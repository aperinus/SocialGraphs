It stars [[Sigourney Weaver]], reprising her role as [[Ellen Ripley]]. It is the third installment of the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] and led to a sequel, ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997).\n\nSet right after the events of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), Ripley and an [[Xenomorph (Alien franchise)|Alien organism]] are the only survivors of the Colonial Marine spaceship [[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|''Sulaco'']] following an escape pod's crash on a planet housing a penal colony populated by violent male inmates. Additional roles are played by [[Charles Dance]], [[Brian Glover]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], [[Ralph Brown]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Holt McCallany]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], and Danielle Edmond.\n\nThe film faced problems during production, including shooting without a script and the attachment of various screenwriters and directors. Fincher, in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature directorial debut]], was brought in to direct after a proposed version with Vincent Ward as director was canceled during pre-production.\n\n''Alien 3'' was released on May 22, 1992. While it underperformed at the American box office, it earned over $100&nbsp;million outside North America. The film received mixed reviews and was regarded as inferior to previous installments. Fincher has since disowned the film, citing studio interference and deadlines. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], seven [[Saturn Award]]s ([[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Dutton, [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Direction]] for Fincher, and [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Giler, Hill, and Ferguson), a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]], and an [[MTV Movie Award for Best Action Sequence]]. In 2003, a revised version of the film known as the [[#Assembly Cut|Assembly Cut]] was released without Fincher's involvement, which received a warmer reception.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nFollowing the events of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', an egg hatches aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship ''[[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|Sulaco]]'', releasing a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|facehugger]]. A fire starts and the ship's computer launches an escape pod containing [[Ellen Ripley]], the young girl Newt, [[Dwayne Hicks|Hicks]], and the damaged [[Android (robot)|android]] [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]]; all four are in [[Cryonics|cryonic]] [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, a [[foundry]] and maximum-security correctional facility inhabited by male inmates with a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior. The inmates recover the crashed pod and its passengers. The same facehugger is seen approaching inmate Thomas Murphy's dog, Spike.\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: Do not change the plot summary to say that the alien comes from an \"ox\", \"bull\" or \"cow\" rather than a dog. In the theatrical version of the film, the alien comes from a dog. There are two different versions of the film. These differences are discussed in the section of this article titled \"Special Edition DVD\". -->\n\nRipley is awakened by Clemens, the prison doctor, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. She is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an [[autopsy]] on Newt and that her and Hicks's bodies be subsequently burned, secretly fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The funeral proceeds in the foundry with spiritual leader Dillon delivering a speech as the deceased are dropped into the furnace. Elsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike.\n\nRipley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison's garbage dump before she is cornered by four inmates and almost gang-raped. After being saved by Dillon, Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who, before asking to be permanently shut down, confirms through scanning ship records that a Facehugger was onboard and came with them to Fiorina. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains, and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state. Ripley informs Andrews of her previous Xenomorph encounters{{efn|The Alien species is defined as \"Xenomorph\" within the previous film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and is later referred to as \"Xenomorph\" by Ripley when she is sending an email to Weyland-Yutani.}} and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story, and explains that even if she were telling the truth, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the [[Weyland-Yutani Corporation]].\n\nThe Alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison [[First aid room|infirmary]], killing him, and corners Ripley, but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley then rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the monster. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and sees the embryo of an [[Alien Queen]] growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the aliens into [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].\n\nDeducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the Alien first. They form a plan to lure the Alien into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten [[lead]]. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of all the remaining prisoners except Dillon and Morse. Dillon sacrifices himself to position the Alien towards the mold as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the Alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold. Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, blowing it apart from [[thermal shock]].\n\nThe Weyland\u2013Yutani team arrives, including commandos and a man who looks identical to Bishop,{{efn|Identified as '''Michael Bishop Weyland''' in tie-in materials.}} who explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Alien Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland\u2013Yutani team shoots Morse in the leg to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-alike with a wrench and is shot dead by the commandos. Ignoring pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace, holding captive the infant queen as it erupts from her. The facilities are closed down. Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's final [[logbook]] recording from the ''Nostromo'' plays.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sigourney Weaver 1989 Academy Awards (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Sigourney Weaver]] reprised her role as [[Ellen Ripley]]]]\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters}}\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]], reprising her role from the previous two ''Alien'' films.

Gibson, who told the producers his writing was influenced by ''Alien'', accepted the task. Fearful of [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|an impending strike]] by the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]], Brandywine asked Gibson to deliver a screenplay by December.<ref name=\"bald\"/> Gibson drew heavily from Giler and Hill's treatment, having a strong interest in the \"Marxist space empire\" element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_09_01_archive.asp#106243398206019606|title=William Gibson talks about the script|publisher=WilliamGibsonBooks.com|access-date=December 18, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230140902/http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2003_09_01_archive.asp#106243398206019606|archive-date=December 30, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The following year, Finnish director [[Renny Harlin]] was approached by Fox based on his work in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Luke Savage |url=https://denofgeek.com/movies/alien/14416/renny-harlin-interview-12-rounds-die-hard-and-the-alien-3-that-never-was |title=Renny Harlin interview: 12 Rounds, Die Hard, and the Alien 3 that never was |date=May 27, 2009 |publisher=Denofgeek.com |access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Harlin wanted to go in different directions from the first two movies, having interest in both visiting the Alien homeworld or having the Aliens invading Earth.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\nGibson's script was mockingly summed up by him as \"Space commies hijack alien eggs\u2014big problem in Mallworld\".<ref name=\"bald\"/> The story picked up after ''Aliens'', with the ''Sulaco'' drifting into an area of space claimed by the \"Union of Progressive Peoples\". The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The ''Sulaco'' then arrives at a space station\u2013shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint. With Ripley put in a coma, Hicks explores the station and discovers Weyland-Yutani are developing an Alien army. In the meantime, the U.P.P. are doing their own research, which led them to repair Bishop. Eventually Anchorpoint and the U.P.P. stations are overrun with the Aliens, and Hicks must team up with the survivors to destroy the parasites. The film ends with a teaser for a fourth movie, where Bishop suggests to Hicks that humans are united against a common enemy, and they must track the Aliens to their source and destroy them.<ref name=\"bald\" />\n\nThe screenplay was very action-oriented, featuring an extended cast, and is considered in some circles as superior to the final film and has a considerable following on the Internet.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://horror.about.com/od/horrorthemelists/ss/Greatest-Horror-Movies-Never-Made_5.htm|title=10 of the Greatest Horror Movies Never Made|author=Mark H.

They still liked certain parts, such as the subtext making the Alien a metaphor for [[HIV]], but felt it lacking the human element present in ''Aliens'' and Gibson's trademark cyberpunk aesthetic.

Ward, who was in London developing ''[[Map of the Human Heart]]'',<ref name=\"bald\"/> accepted the project only on the third call, as he at first was uninterested in doing a sequel. Ward thought little of the Twohy script, and instead worked up another idea, involving Ripley's escape pod crash landing on a monastery-like satellite. Having developed this pitch on his flight to Los Angeles, once Ward got with the studio executives he saw his idea approved by the studio. Ward was hired to direct ''Alien 3'', and writer John Fasano was hired to expand his story into a screenplay.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/> Once Twohy discovered through a journalist friend that another script was being written concurrently with his, he went after Fox and eventually left the project.<ref>{{cite web | last=Stovall | first=Ada | date=September 24, 2013 | title=Riddick's David Twohy | publisher=Creative Screenwriting | url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/david-twohy-is-a-hard-working-man/ | access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWard envisioned a planet whose interior was both wooden and archaic in design, where [[Luddite]]-like monks would take refuge. The story begins with a monk who sees a \"star in the East\" (Ripley's escape pod) and at first believes this to be a good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it to be some sort of religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the Monks of the \"wooden satellite\" lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast.<ref>vincentwardfilms.com, Alien 3 Unrequited Vision, retrieved on 2009:10:30 http://www.vincentwardfilms.com/concepts/alien-3/unrequited-vision/{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternative ending in which Ripley survived, but Weaver would agree to the film only if Ripley died.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine described Ward's 'Wooden Planet' concept as 'undeniably attractive\u2014it would have been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.' In the same article, Norman Reynolds\u2014Production Designer originally hired by Ward\u2014remembers an early design idea for \"a wooden library shaft.

The producers at Brandywine discussed the logical problems of creating and maintaining a wooden planet in space, while Fox executive [[Jon Landau (film producer)|Jon Landau]] considered Ward's vision to be \"more bent on the artsy-fartsy side than the big commercial one\" that Ridley Scott and James Cameron employed. Ward managed to dissuade the producers of their idea of turning the planet into an ore refinery and the monks into prisoners, but eventually Fox asked a meeting with the director imposing a list of changes to be made. Refusing to do so, Ward was fired. The main plot of the finished film still follows Ward's basic structure.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n===Walter Hill and David Giler's script===\nHill and Giler did a first draft trying to enhance the story structure on the Fasano script, and feeling creatively drained hired [[Larry Ferguson (screenwriter)|Larry Ferguson]] as a [[script doctor]]. Ferguson's work was not well received in the production, particularly by Sigourney Weaver, who felt Ferguson made Ripley sound like \"a pissed-off gym teacher\". Short on time before filming was due to commence, Hill and Giler took control of the screenplay themselves, melding aspects of the Ward/Fasano script with Twohy's earlier prison planet screenplay to create the basis of the final film.<ref name=bald/> Sigourney Weaver had also had a clause written into her contract stating the final draft should be written by Hill and Giler, believing that they were the only writers (besides James Cameron) to write the character of Ripley effectively.<ref name=wreckage/> Fox approached music video director [[David Fincher]] to replace Ward.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Pearce | first=Garth | date=1991 | title=Alien3: Set Visit To A Troubled Sequel | magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | url=https://empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703222946/https://empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-date=July 3, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Fincher did further work on the screenplay with author [[Rex Pickett]], and despite Pickett being fired and Hill and Giler writing the final draft of the screenplay, he revised most of the work done by the previous authors.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Knapp | editor1-first=Laurence F. | last=Richardson | first=John H. | date=2014 | title=David Fincher: Interviews | series=Conversations with Filmmakers Series | chapter=Mother from Another Planet | page=23 | location=Jackson, Miss. | publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] | isbn=978-1-628460-36-0}}</ref> Fincher wanted [[Gary Oldman]] to star in the film, but the pair \"couldn't work it out\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/playboy-interview-david-fincher|title=Interview: David Fincher|last=Rebello|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Rebello|date=16 September 2014|website=[[Playboy]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917030311/http://www.playboy.com/articles/playboy-interview-david-fincher|access-date=16 December 2019|archive-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Blast Beach (37391466).jpeg|thumb|Blast Beach near [[Dawdon]] in England was used for exterior shots of the planet ''Fiorina \"Fury\" 161''.]]\nFilming began on January 14, 1991, at [[Pinewood Studios]] without a finished script and with $7&nbsp;million already having been spent.<ref name=\"last\" /> While a majority of the film was shot at Pinewood, some scenes were shot at [[Blyth Power Station]] and the beach near [[Dawdon]] (known locally as \"the Blast\" or \"Blast Beach\") in the UK.<ref name=\"sine_project\">{{cite web|title=Structure details |work=SINE Project (Structural Images of the North East) |publisher=[[Newcastle University]] |url=http://www.sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=301 |access-date=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312201030/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=301 |archive-date=March 12, 2008 }}</ref> The purpose of these shots was to show the exterior of the planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtfdvds.com/all-dvds-1/alien-3-workprint-1992-dvd-43.html|title=Alien 3 Workprint (1992) DVD|access-date=January 20, 2009|publisher=WTFDVDs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123184215/http://wtfdvds.com/all-dvds-1/alien-3-workprint-1992-dvd-43.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=January 23, 2009}}</ref> [[Cinematographer]] [[Jordan Cronenweth]] worked only for two weeks before he started developing [[Parkinson's disease]], and was forced out of the film by a line producer who had lost his father to the disease several years previously, and knew that if anything, the demanding schedule would likely take a fatal toll on Cronenweth's health.

Winston instead recommended Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two former workers of his studio who had just started their own company, [[Amalgamated Dynamics]].<ref name=\"fright\"/> Even before principal photography had begun, the practical effects crew was developing models of the Alien and the corpses of the ''Sulaco'' victims. [[Richard Edlund]]'s [[Boss Film Studios]] was hired for [[compositing]] and other post-production effects.<ref name=wreckage/> A small number of shots contain [[computer-generated imagery]], most notably the cracking alien head once the sprinklers cause thermal shock. Other CGI elements include shadows cast by the rod puppet alien, and airborne debris in outdoor scenes.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\"/>\n\nDavid Fincher wanted the alien to be, \"more of a puma, or a beast\" as opposed to the upright, humanoid posture of the previous films, so the designer of the original alien, [[H. R. Giger]], was contacted to generate new sketch ideas. His revisions included longer, thinner legs, the removal of \"pipes\" around the spine, and an idea for a sharp alien \"tongue\" in place of the secondary jaws. Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of [[plasticine]].<ref name=\"xeno\">{{cite video  | title=Xeno-Erotic: The H.R. Giger Redesign\" | medium=DVD | location=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc  | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The only one of Giger's designs that wound up in the final project was a \"Bambi Burster\" Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale [[Bunraku]]-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the background plate, but can be seen in the \"Assembly Cut\" of the film.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe Alien is portrayed by both Woodruff Jr. in a suit and a [[Rod puppets|rod puppet]] filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] and optically [[Compositing|composited]] into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by [[rotoscoping]]. A mechanical alien head was also used for [[close-up]]s.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\">{{cite video | people=Fredrick Garvin (Director) | title=The Making of Alien 3 | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The suit adapted the design used in ''Aliens'' so Woodruff could walk on all fours.<ref name=\"fright\"/> Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with [[animatronics]] to move the mouth of the Alien.<ref name=\"shock\" /> Fincher suggested that a [[Whippet]] be dressed in an alien costume for on-set [[Camera coverage|coverage]] of the [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\"/>\n\nThe rod-puppet approach was chosen for the production rather than [[stop motion|stop-motion animation]], which did not provide the required smoothness to appear realistic. As a result, the rod-puppet allowed for a fast alien that could move across surfaces of any orientation and be shot from any angle.<ref name=\"optical\">{{cite video | people=David Fincher (Director) | title=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc \"Optical Fury\" | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> This was particularly effective as it was able to accomplish movements not feasible by an actor in a suit. The {{frac|1|3}}-scale puppet was 40 inches long and cast in foam rubber over a bicycle chain armature for flexibility.<ref name=\"imagi\">{{cite journal |year=1994 |title=H.R. Giger |journal=Imagi-Movies Magazine |volume=1 |issue=3 }}</ref> For moving camera shots, the on-set cameras were equipped with digital recorders to track, pan, tilt, and dolly values. The data output was then taken back to the studio and fed into the motion control cameras with the linear dimensions scaled down to match the puppet.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nTo make syncing the puppet's actions with the live-action shots easier, the effects team developed an instant compositing system using [[LaserDisc]]. This allowed takes to be quickly overlaid on the background plate so the crew could observe whether any spatial adjustments were required.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nLaine Liska was hired to lead a team of puppeteers in a new process dubbed \"Mo-Motion\" where the rod puppet would be simultaneously manipulated and filmed with a moving [[motion control photography|motion control camera]].<ref name=\"optical\" /> Depending on the complexity of the shot, the puppet was operated by 4\u20136 people.<ref name=\"imagi\" /> Sparse sets were created to provide freedom of motion for the puppeteers as well as large, solid surfaces for the puppet to act within a three dimensional space.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe crew was pushed to make the movements of the Alien as quick as possible to the point where they were barely in control, and this led to, according to Edlund, \"the occasional serendipitous action that made the alien have a character.\" The ease of this setup allowed the crew to film 60\u201370 takes of a single scene.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nHoping to give the destroyed Bishop a more complex look that could not be accomplished by simple make-up, the final product was done entirely through animatronics, while a playback of Lance Henriksen's voice played to guide Sigourney Weaver.<ref name=\"wreckage\" />\n\nScenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle were shot with a 3.5-foot [[scale model|miniature]] against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional [[matte painting]]s of the planet's surface. To make the clouds glow from within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting's values were digitally reversed and animated frame by frame. The scene in which the EEV is moved by a crane-arm (also a miniature) was created by projecting a video of actors onto pieces of cardboard and then compositing them into the scene as silhouettes against the matte-painted background.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Alien 3 (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's composer, [[Elliot Goldenthal]], spent a year composing the score by working closely with Fincher to create music based primarily on the surroundings and atmosphere of the film itself. The score was recorded during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], which Goldenthal later claimed contributed to the score's disturbing nature.<ref>\"Music, Editing and Sound\"; ''Alien<sup>3</sup>'' bonus disc, Alien ''[[Quadrilogy]]''</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n''Alien 3'' has been released in various [[home video]] formats and packages over the years. The first of these were on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]], and several subsequent VHS releases were sold both singly and as [[box set|boxed sets]] throughout the 1990s. A VHS boxed set titled ''The Alien Trilogy'' containing ''Alien 3'' along with ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' was released in [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|facehugger]]-shaped carrying cases, and included some of the deleted scenes from the LaserDisc editions. When ''Alien Resurrection'' premiered in theaters in 1997, another boxed set of the first three films was released titled ''The Alien Saga'', which included a ''Making of Alien Resurrection'' tape. A few months later, this set was re-released with the ''Alien Resurrection'' film taking the place of the making-of video. In 1999, ''Alien 3'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], both singly and packaged with the other three ''Alien'' films as ''The Alien Legacy'' boxed set. This set was also released in a VHS version and would be the last VHS release of the film. In 2003, ''Alien 3'' would be included in the 9-disc ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set which contained two versions of the film (see below). The first three films were also later packaged as the ''Alien Triple Pack'' DVD set (this release was identical to the 1999 ''Alien Legacy'' set but excluding ''Alien Resurrection'').\n''Alien 3'' was first released on [[Blu-ray]] in 2010, as part of the 6-disc ''Alien Anthology'' boxed set which included all of the features from the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set and more. The film was also released as a single Blu-ray Disc in 2011. Fincher was the only director from the franchise who declined to participate in the box-set releases.<ref name=\"Vox\" />\n\nThe bonus disc for ''Alien 3'' in the 2003 ''Quadrilogy'' set includes a documentary of the film's production, that lacks Fincher's participation as clips where the director openly expresses anger and frustration with the studio were cut.<ref name=\"Vox\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/reviews3/alienquad06.html | title=Criticism of Bonus Disc| publisher=The Digital Bits | access-date=January 15, 2013}}</ref> The documentary was originally named ''Wreckage and Rape'' after one of the tracks of Goldenthal's soundtrack, but Fox renamed it simply ''The Making of Alien 3''.

Officially titled the \"Assembly Cut\", it was released on the 9-disc ''Alien Quadrilogy'' box set in 2003, and later in the ''Alien Anthology'' Blu-ray set in 2010. It includes over 30 minutes of extended and previously deleted scenes, alternative key plot elements, and new digital effects.

Upon learning of Hicks' demise, Biehn demanded and received almost as much money for the use of his likeness in one scene as he had been paid for his role in ''Aliens''.<ref>''Wreckage and Rape: The Making of Alien 3 \u2013 Development Hell: Concluding The Story'' (''Alien 3 Collector's Edition'' DVD)</ref><ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/sdmVIp9xeK4 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190611061857/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmVIp9xeK4 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmVIp9xeK4| title = James Cameron on memorable scenes in 'The Terminator,' 'Titanic,' 'Aliens,' 'Avatar' and more | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=reject>{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Jeremy|title=36 Things We Learned From the 'Aliens' Commentary|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/36-things-we-learned-from-the-aliens-commentary-45fc526346e0/|website=filmschoolrejects.com|access-date=August 4, 2017|date=June 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"RemarEmpire\"/><ref name=\"THRBiehn\"/>\n\nDavid Fincher eventually disowned the film, stating in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 that \"No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me\".<ref name=\"disown\">{{cite web|last1=Salisbury|first1=Mark|last2=Fincher|first2=David|title=Transcript of the Guardian interview with David Fincher at BFI Southbank|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 27, 2016|date=January 18, 2009}}</ref> He also blamed the producers for not putting the necessary trust in him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century |isbn = 082641902X|last1 = Littger|first1 = Stephan|date = October 15, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Vox\">{{cite web |author=Suderman |first=Peter |date=May 22, 2017 |title=Alien 3 is far from the worst Alien movie.

Foster's adaptation includes many scenes that were cut from the final film, some of which later reappeared in the \"Assembly Cut\". Foster wanted his adaptation to differ from the film's script, which he disliked, but Walter Hill declared he should not alter the storyline. Foster later commented: \"So out went my carefully constructed motivations for all the principal prisoners, my preserving the life of Newt (her killing in the film is an obscenity), and much else.
