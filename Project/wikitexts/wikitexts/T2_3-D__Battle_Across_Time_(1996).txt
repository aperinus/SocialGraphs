The queue media sets the scene in the lobby of Cyberdyne and the company propaganda is playing all around the audience. The segments are about the latest innovations and products of [[Cyberdyne Systems]]. The video also includes several special musical segments, including two songs from the film; \"[[Bad to the Bone]]\" and \"[[Guitars, Cadillacs]]\", as well as a \"live\" video feed from [[Costa Rica]] of a performance of the song [[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]. Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience (in the manner of a [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] security system) and two brief comical sketches of \"guests\" running afoul of Cyberdyne security \u2013 either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff. \nQueue video also contains a brief appearance of [[Dr. Peter Silberman]] played by [[Earl Boen]]. \nJust before entering the pre-show auditorium, guests pass an unmanned kiosk where they pick up a pair of \"safety visors\" ([[polarized 3D glasses|3D glasses]])<ref name=\"'3-d' Is A True Continuation, Not A Rehash\"/> for use during the main show.\n\n===Pre-show===\n[[File:T2 3-D Battle Across Time preshow 1.jpg|thumb|left|The pre-show room]]\nThe pre-show is hosted in the \"[[Miles Bennett Dyson]] Memorial Auditorium\" by Kimberley Duncan, Cyberdyne's Director of Community Relations and Media Control. Here, the audience stands and views a promotional video about Cyberdyne's numerous technological contributions before the video feed is temporarily hijacked by John ([[Edward Furlong]]) and Sarah Connor ([[Linda Hamilton]]), warning the audience about Skynet and the future war against the machines and telling them to get out of the building before they are cut off. As the video continues, Duncan can be seen talking on a phone, telling someone on the other line to find the Connors. Once the video ends, Duncan tells the audience to ignore the Connors' warnings and proceed forward. The video was produced and directed by Landmark Entertainment's [[Gary Goddard]] and Adam Bezark. A segment on future technology in sports featured a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]].\n\nThe promotional video in the pre-show was updated in 2015 as some of the original pre-show featured \"future\" technologies that were now in existence; new CGI and narration now accompanied the remastered original footage alongside some newly-shot scenes.<ref name=\"InsideTheMagic\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dougherty|first1=Andrew|title=New T-2 3D Pre-Show|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/discussion/thread.cfm?page=868|website=Theme Park Insider|access-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Main show===\nGuests are ushered from the pre-show auditorium into a large theater that seats 700 where they are to see a demonstration of Cyberdyne's newest creation, the \"Cyberdyne Series 70 Autonomous Infantry Unit\" (T-70 Terminators). Once guests are seated, they are told to put on their \"safety visors\" to watch a demonstration of the T-70 Terminators in action, presented by Duncan. After this brief demonstration, John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings. After disabling the security alarms, they force Duncan to shut down the T-70s. However, they are confronted by a T-1000 Terminator ([[Robert Patrick]]) from the future whom they engage with automatic-weapons. Duncan is killed by the T-1000 while attempting to stop him, mistaking him for a police officer. A T-800 Terminator ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) bursts through the movie screen through a \"time portal\" on his signature [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle \u2013 via actual actor/stunt double riding into auditorium \u2013 to rescue John. He takes John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines while Sarah stays behind in the present, with the T-1000 in pursuit. After defeating him, John and the T-800 make their way across the war-ravaged landscape as they head towards [[Skynet (fictional)|Skynet]]. Along the way, they are chased by a flying Hunter-Killer, four Mini-Hunters, and a Terminator endoskeleton.<ref name=\"The Terminator Hits Town\"/><ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\"/>\n\nThe duo successfully penetrate the Skynet facility and descend with the audience into Skynet's Central Core, where they battle the \"T-1000000\", a giant liquid-metal spider-like construct similar to a very large T-1000. The T-800 sends John to a nearby time machine that will take him back to the present while he stays behind to blow up Skynet and the T-1000000. The show ends with the ground-shaking destruction of Skynet, leaving Sarah and John alone in the present time once again. During the destruction of the T-1000000, water is sprayed from the ceiling onto the riders and then during the explosion, smoke is blown into the audience; the seats of the auditorium also lurch with a sudden drop, giving guests a final scare and ending the attraction with Sarah narrating that she feels that she owes her life to the Terminator for saving John's life. During this narration, the face of a Terminator endoskeleton fills the screen, morphing into Schwarzenegger's face before the film fades to black, during which John and Sarah mysteriously disappear.<ref name=\"The Terminator Hits Town\"/><ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\" />\n\nThe ground breaking sound design for the theater set new standards and created new technologies in the design and delivery of fully immersive 3D sound. The main show sound system is a 24 channel matrix surround system driven by a Peavey Media Matrix, an Akai DD1000 digital 24 Track, 156 speakers, 24 custom engineered subwoofers that shook the building. [[James Cameron]] was quoted as saying, \"Sound is 50% of the experience. T23D is the greatest sounding show in the world\".\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| footer    = Two new Terminator characters were created for the attraction: T-1000000 (top) and T-70 (bottom).\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = T-1000000.png\n| alt1      = T-1000000\n| image2    = T-70.jpg\n| alt2      = T-70\n| direction = vertical\n}}\nThe initial planning for ''T2 3-D: Battle Across Time'' began in the early 1990s. [[Jay Stein]], [[Universal Parks & Resorts]]' Chairman and CEO at the time, asked [[Gary Goddard]] and his team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a [[stunt show]] based around the Terminator franchise. Goodard sought permission from MCA Planning and Development (later [[Universal Creative]]) to morph this concept into a theater-based presentation featuring a [[3-D film]], live action and pyrotechnics. After a year-and-a-half of development, MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached [[James Cameron]]'s [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] for ultimate approval. Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking his Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride, he found the storyboards and the whole concept to be \"great\", so the project was green-lit.<ref name=\"Gary Goddard Q&A\">{{Cite interview|last=Goddard|first=Gary|title=Gary Goddard Q&A|publisher=JamesCameronOnline|url=http://www.jamescamerononline.com/GaryGoddardQA.htm|access-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA full-scale mock-up duplicating the dimensions of the planned Florida venue was created in an airplane hangar at the [[Van Nuys Airport]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\"/> The set consists of a stage surrounded by a [[triptych]] of adjoined [[silver screen]]s.<ref name=\"Making Of\"/> Each of these three screens measured {{Convert|23|by|50|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\">{{cite journal|last=Heuring|first=David|title=T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida|journal=On Production|year=1996|series=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> A total of six [[Iwerks]] projectors<ref name=\"In My Office: Bob Chambers\">{{cite journal|last=Zoltak|first=James|title=In My Office: Bob Chambers|journal=Amusement Business|date=March 1, 2004|volume=116|issue=9|page=2}}</ref> were used to run the 3-D, [[70mm film]] simultaneously at 30 [[frames per second]].<ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\" /> Several elements of ''T2 3-D: Battle Across Time'' have been patented by Universal, including the seat drop effect, the blending of live action and film, the trio of projection screens, and the simulated assault weapons.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=5829201|status=patent|title=Theater with seat and wheelchair platform movement|pubdate=November 3, 1998|fdate=April 15, 1997|invent1=Schelter, James|invent2=Masi, Frank|assign1=Universal Studios}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=5833544|status=patent|title=Film and live action theater|pubdate=November 10, 1998|fdate=April 25, 1997|inventor=Corbin et al.|assign1=Universal Studios}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=5964064|status=patent|title=Theater with multiple screen three dimensional film projection system|pubdate=October 12, 1999|fdate=April 25, 1997|invent1=Goddard, Gary|invent2=Bezark, Adam|assign1=Universal Studios}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=6099316|status=patent|title=Simulated assault weapon|pubdate=August 8, 2000|fdate=April 29, 1998|inventor=Levy et al.|assign1=Universal Studios}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot at the abandoned [[Eagle Mountain, California|Eagle Mountain]] [[iron ore]] mine, just north of [[Desert Center, California|Desert Center]] in California.<ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\"/><ref name=\"Terminator Will Be Back - Ride To Debut In Spring\">{{cite news|last=Shenot|first=Christine|title=Terminator Will Be Back \u2013 Ride To Debut In Spring|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-03-18/news/9603170567_1_t2-3-d-3-d-effect-terminator-2-3-d|access-date=September 11, 2017|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=March 18, 1996}}</ref> The cast and crew from the first two Terminator films returned for the shoot, including [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]], [[Linda Hamilton]] as [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], [[Robert Patrick]] as [[T-1000]], and [[Edward Furlong]] as [[John Connor]].<ref name=\"TotalFilmJan10\"/><ref name=\"'3-d' Is A True Continuation, Not A Rehash\"/> To achieve the 3-D effect on a 70mm projected film, a two-camera rig weighing {{convert|450|lb|kg}} was used.<ref name=\"T2:3D Will Debut at Universal Studios Florida\"/>\n\nAs a sequel to [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|the 1991 film]], ''T2 3-D: Battle Across Time'' introduced two new Terminator characters.
