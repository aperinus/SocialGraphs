The cast includes [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Eric Roberts]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Jena Malone]], [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Jeannie Berlin]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Michael K. Williams]] and [[Martin Short]]. The film follows Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, a well-intentioned but inept [[drug culture|stoner]], [[hippie]], and [[private investigator]] in 1970, who is embroiled in the Los Angeles criminal underworld while investigating three cases interrelated by the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend and her new wealthy boyfriend.\n\nAnderson's adaptation of ''Inherent Vice'' had been in development since 2010; it is the first Pynchon novel to be adapted for the screen. It is Anderson's second collaboration with Phoenix, following ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]],'' and involves a number of his other recurring collaborators, including producers [[Daniel Lupi]] and [[JoAnne Sellar]], cinematographer [[Robert Elswit]], editor [[Leslie Jones (film editor)|Leslie Jones]], and composer [[Jonny Greenwood]].\n\n''Inherent Vice'' premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on October 4, 2014, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 12, 2014. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, costumes and screenplay, but some criticizing the complicated plot. It was nominated for several awards, including two at the [[87th Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for Phoenix at the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]]. The [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|ten best films of the year]]. Some critics said that ''Inherent Vice'' has the makings of a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-nyff-inherent-vice-paul-thomas-anderson-movie-pynchon-20141005-story.html|title=NYFF 2014: 'Inherent Vice' and the contemporary cult hit|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 5, 2014|access-date=October 7, 2014|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006154324/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-nyff-inherent-vice-paul-thomas-anderson-movie-pynchon-20141005-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2016, it was voted the 75th best film since 2000 in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|an international critics' poll]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films|publisher=[[BBC]]|work=[[BBC News]]|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=June 22, 2018|archive-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1970, Shasta Fay Hepworth visits the beach house of her ex-boyfriend, Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, a [[private investigator]] and [[hippie]] in Gordita Beach, [[Los Angeles County]]. She tells him about her new lover, Michael Z. \"Mickey\" Wolfmann, a wealthy [[real estate developer]], and asks him to help prevent Mickey's wife from abducting Mickey and committing him to an [[insane asylum]].\n\nDoc meets with Tariq Khalil, a member of the [[Black Guerrilla Family]], who hires him to find Glen Charlock, a member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] he met in jail, who owes him money and is one of Wolfmann's bodyguards. He visits Mickey's Channel View Estates project, entering the only business in the developing strip mall, a [[massage parlor]], where he meets an employee, Jade. He searches the premises for Charlock, but is hit with a baseball bat and collapses. Doc wakes outside, lying next to Charlock's dead body and surrounded by policemen. Interrogated by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Christian F. \"Bigfoot\" Bjornsen, he learns that Wolfmann has disappeared. His attorney, Sauncho Smilax, arranges for his release by the LAPD.\n\nDoc is hired by former heroin addict Hope Harlingen, who is looking for her missing husband, Coy. Although told that Coy is dead, she believes he is alive due to a large deposit to her bank account. Jade leaves Doc a message apologizing for setting him up with the police and telling him to \"beware the Golden Fang.\" He meets her in an alley, where she explains the Golden Fang is an international [[drug smuggling]] operation. Jade introduces Doc to Coy, who tells him he is hiding at a house in [[Topanga Canyon]]. In a later meeting, he explains he is a [[police informant]] and fears for his life, wanting only to return to his wife and daughter. Doc talks to Sauncho, who tells him about the suspicious boat, the ''Golden Fang'', which the last time it sailed, Shasta was on board. Thanks to a postcard from her, Doc finds a large building shaped like a golden fang and meets dentist Rudy Blatnoyd.\n\nBigfoot calls Doc and tells him that Blatnoyd has just been found dead with fang bites in his neck. Bigfoot decides to help Doc find Coy and tells him to search for Puck Beaverton in Chryskylodon, an asylum run by a cult connected to the Golden Fang. There, Doc finds Mickey, who is being watched by the [[FBI]]. Mickey tells him he felt guilty for the negativity his real-estate business caused and wants to give his money away, appearing to be a happy member of the cult. Doc also glimpses Puck and Coy. When Doc returns home to his beach house, he is greeted by Shasta, who has returned and is indifferent to the trouble her disappearance has caused. She tells him Mickey is back with his wife. Shasta confesses to having been on the ''Golden Fang'' with Mickey on a \"three-hour tour\" and says she was brought along to be used sexually by all of Mickey's friends. She brags about what she did on the boat to provoke Doc into rough sex, then tells him they still aren't back together.\n\nPenny, an assistant district attorney with whom Doc is having a fling, gives him confidential files from which he learns that the LAPD pays the [[loan shark]] Adrian Prussia to kill people and that one of his victims was Bigfoot's former partner. Prussia is tied to the Golden Fang, and Doc learns that Charlock was involved with a deal, which is why he was killed. Doc visits Adrian, noticing his obsession with baseball bats, but is abducted and drugged by his partner, Puck. He manages to escape, killing both Puck and Adrian. Bigfoot appears and rescues him, driving him home, but Doc discovers he has been set up: Bigfoot has planted heroin in his car. Doc arranges for the drugs to be returned to the Golden Fang in exchange for Coy's freedom. Doc and Shasta drive off together, and he tells her this doesn't mean they are back together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Larry \"Doc\" Sportello \n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Lieutenant Christian F. \"Bigfoot\" Bjornsen\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Coy Harlingen\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Shasta Fay Hepworth\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Deputy District Attorney Penny Kimball\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Sauncho Smilax, Esq.\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Hope Harlingen\n* [[Joanna Newsom]] as Sortil\u00e8ge, who is also the narrator\n* Jordan Christian Hearn as Denis\n* [[Hong Chau]] as Jade\n* [[Jeannie Berlin]] as Aunt Reet\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Petunia Leeway\n* [[Michael K.
