It was produced and directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] and stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]] and [[Kevin Kline]]. It also features Charlie Chaplin's own daughter, [[Geraldine Chaplin]], in the role of his mother, [[Hannah Chaplin]].\n\nThe film was adapted by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], [[Bryan Forbes]] and [[William Goldman]] from Chaplin's 1964 book ''[[My Autobiography (Chaplin)|My Autobiography]]'' and the 1985 book ''[[Chaplin: His Life and Art]]'' by film critic [[David Robinson (film critic and author)|David Robinson]]. Associate producer Diana Hawkins got a story credit. The original music score was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-20-ca-4268-story.html|title=Channeling Chaplin : It is the role of Robert Downey Jr.'s career--and he believes the Little Tramp is with him|date=1992-12-20|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/movies/film-robert-downey-jr-is-chaplin-on-screen-and-a-child-off.html|title=FILM; Robert Downey Jr. Is Chaplin (on Screen) and a Child (Off)|last=Diamond|first=Jamie|date=1992-12-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews; Downey's titular performance, however, garnered critical acclaim and won him the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] along with nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn elderly [[Charlie Chaplin]] reminisces during a conversation with George Hayden, the fictionalized editor of his autobiography.\n\nChaplin escapes his poverty-stricken childhood by immersing himself in the world of London's variety circuit. After his mother [[Hannah Chaplin|Hannah]] loses her voice onstage, five-year-old Charlie takes her place. Hannah is eventually committed to an asylum after developing [[psychosis]]. Over the years, Chaplin and his brother [[Sydney Chaplin|Sydney]] gain work with variety producer [[Fred Karno]], who later sends him to the United States. He begins a relationship with dancer [[Hetty Kelly]] and soon proposes to her, but she declines, reasoning she is too young. He vows to return when he is a success.\n\nIn America, Chaplin is employed by famous comedy producer [[Mack Sennett]]. He creates the Tramp persona, and due to the terrible directorial abilities of Sennett's girlfriend Mabel Normand, he becomes his own director. After Sydney becomes his manager, Chaplin breaks from Sennett to gain complete creative control over his films, with the goal of one day owning his own studio. In 1917, he completes work on his politically sensitive ''[[The Immigrant (1917 film)|The Immigrant]]'' and starts a brief relationship with actress [[Edna Purviance]].\n\nYears later, at a party thrown by [[Douglas Fairbanks]], Chaplin dates child actress [[Mildred Harris]]. He sets up his own studio and becomes \"the most famous man in the world\" before his 30th birthday. Chaplin tells Fairbanks that he must marry Harris because she is pregnant, but later learns it is a hoax. Chaplin has a confrontation with [[J. Edgar Hoover]] about actor/directors and propaganda. This sparks a 40-year-long vendetta by Hoover.\n\nHarris's divorce lawyers claim Chaplin's film [[The Kid (1921 film)|''The Kid'']] as an asset. Chaplin and Sydney flee with the footage, finish editing it in a [[Salt Lake City]] hotel, then smuggle it back to [[Los Angeles]].\n\nThe brothers arrange for their mother to join them, but Chaplin cannot cope with her worsened condition. In 1921, Chaplin attends the UK premiere of ''The Kid''. He hopes to locate Hetty, but Karno informs him that she died in the [[Spanish flu|influenza epidemic]]. Chaplin also discovers although most are happy to see him, the British working class resent him for not fighting in [[World War I]] as they did.\n\nBack in America, Hoover digs into Chaplin's private life, suspecting him of communist sympathies. Chaplin is forced to consider the effect of \"talkies\" on his career. Despite the popularity of sound films, he vows never to make a talkie featuring the Tramp.\n\nIn 1925, Chaplin makes ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' and marries bit-part actress [[Lita Grey]]. However, he later confides to George that he always thought of her as a \"total bitch\" and barely mentions her in his autobiography. Chaplin marries [[Paulette Goddard]] and feels a sense of guilt and sympathy for the millions unemployed due to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash]] (Chaplin sold most of his shares the year before the crash). Chaplin decides to address the issue in his next movie, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'', but his dedication to the film results in the breakup of his marriage.\n\nAt an industry party, Chaplin refuses to shake hands with a visiting Nazi. Fairbanks comments that Chaplin resembles [[Adolf Hitler]], providing him with the inspiration for his next film. ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' satirizes the Nazis and is a huge hit worldwide, but Hoover tries to portray it as anti-American propaganda.\n\nChaplin finally settles down and marries [[Oona O'Neill]], an actress who strikingly resembles Hetty. However, it is alleged that he is the father of the child of former lover [[Joan Barry (American actress)|Joan Barry]]. Despite a blood test proving that the child is not his, Chaplin is ordered to provide financial support. With his reputation severely damaged, he stays out of the public eye for over seven years until producing ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''. During the height of [[McCarthyism]], Chaplin leaves America with Oona on a visit to Britain, but the [[United States Attorney General]] revokes his [[re-entry permit|permit to re-enter the United States]].\n\nIn 1972, Chaplin is invited back to America to receive a special [[Academy Honorary Award]]. Though he is initially resentful at his exile and fearful that no one will remember him, he is moved to tears when the audience is seen laughing at his films and give him the [[Academy Awards]]' longest [[standing ovation]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Charlie Chaplin]]\n** Hugh Downer as Charlie Chaplin (age 5)\n** Thomas Bradford as Charlie Chaplin (age 14)\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as [[Mabel Normand]]\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as [[Hannah Chaplin]], Chaplin's mother\n* [[Paul Rhys]] as [[Sydney Chaplin]], Chaplin's half-brother\n** Nicholas Gatt as Sydney Chaplin (age 9)\n* [[John Thaw]] as [[Fred Karno]], a British music-hall impresario\n* [[Moira Kelly]] as [[Hetty Kelly]], Chaplin's first love / [[Oona O'Neill]], Chaplin's last wife\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as George Hayden, Chaplin's biography editor\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Mack Sennett]]\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as [[Edna Purviance]]\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Douglas Fairbanks]]\n* [[Matthew Cottle]] as [[Stan Laurel]]\n* [[Maria Pitillo]] as [[Mary Pickford]]\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Mildred Harris]], a young Hollywood actress and Chaplin's first wife\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as FBI Director [[J.

Attenborough was sufficiently confident in Downey's performance to include historical footage of Chaplin himself at the end of the film.\n\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 60% of critics have given ''Chaplin'' a positive review based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"''Chaplin'' boasts a terrific performance from Robert Downey, Jr. in the title role, but it isn't enough to overcome a formulaic biopic that pales in comparison to its subject's classic films.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chaplin |title=Chaplin (1992) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=June 4, 2021}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/chaplin |title=Chaplin Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=May 23, 2019}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded Downey's performance, and deemed the film \"extremely appreciative\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/25/movies/review-film-robert-downey-jr-in-charlie-chaplin-life-story.html|title=Review/Film; Robert Downey Jr. in Charlie Chaplin Life Story|first=Vincent|last=Canby|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 25, 1992}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' remarked that Chaplin's life was too grand to properly capture in a film, criticizing the screenplay, but praised the casting and the film's first hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/chaplin-2-1200431060/|title=Chaplin|first1=Todd|last1=McCarthy|date=December 7, 1992}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars, dubbing the film, \"a disappointing, misguided movie that has all of the parts in place to be a much better one\", but praised Downey and the production values.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/chaplin-1993|title=Chaplin movie review & film summary (1993)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt Attenborough's filmmaking and Chaplin's life were ill-suited to each other, but said of Downey, \"Lithe and lively and looking remarkably like the younger Chaplin, Downey does more than master the man\u2019s celebrated duck walk and easy grace.
