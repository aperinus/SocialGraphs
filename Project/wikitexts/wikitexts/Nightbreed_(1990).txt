It stars [[Craig Sheffer]], [[Anne Bobby]], [[David Cronenberg]], [[Charles Haid]], [[Hugh Quarshie]], and [[Doug Bradley]]. The film follows an unstable mental patient named Aaron Boone who is falsely led to believe by his doctor that he is a serial killer. Tracked down by the police, his doctor, and his girlfriend Lori, Boone eventually finds refuge in an abandoned cemetery called Midian among a tribe of [[monster]]s and outcasts known as the \"Nightbreed\" who hide from humanity.\n\nAt the time of its release, the film was a commercial and critical failure. In several interviews, Barker protested that the film company tried to sell it as a standard [[slasher film]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Timpone|first=Anthony|title=Barker Bites Back|journal=Fangoria Horror Spectacular|year=1990|issue=n\u00b01|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/nightbreedb.html|access-date=22 March 2012}}</ref> and that the powers-that-be had no real working knowledge of ''Nightbreed''{{'}}s story.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salisbury|first=Mark|title=Flesh And Fury|journal=Fear|date=October 1990|issue=22|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/nightbreed.html}}</ref> Since its initial theatrical release, ''Nightbreed'' has become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/morenightbreed.html|publisher=The Official Clive Barker Resource: Revelations|access-date=22 March 2012|first1=Amber|last1=Black|first2=Tim|last2=Trautmann|year=1996|quote=The movie has, and this is wonderful, you know, a lot of fans.

At the request of girlfriend Lori Winston, Boone is seeing [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] Dr. Phillip Decker, a serial killer who convinces Boone that he committed Decker's murders. Decker drugs Boone with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] disguised as [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] and orders Boone to turn himself in. Before he can do so, Boone is struck by a truck and taken to a hospital. There, Boone overhears the rants of Narcisse, a seemingly insane man who seeks to enter Midian. Convinced that Boone is there to test him, Narcisse gives Boone directions to the hidden city before tearing the skin off his face in order to show his \"true\" face. He is quickly subdued by hospital staff, and Boone leaves.\n\nBoone makes his way to Midian, a city beneath a massive graveyard in the middle of nowhere. Upon encountering supernatural creatures Kinski and Peloquin, Kinski says they should bring him below, but Peloquin refuses to allow in a normal human. Boone claims to be a murderer, but Peloquin smells his innocence and attacks him. Boone escapes, only to encounter a squad of police officers led by Decker. Boone is gunned down after Decker tricks the police into believing Boone is armed. Due to Peloquin's bite, Boone returns to life in the morgue. When he returns to Midian, he finds Narcisse there and is inducted into their society by the Nightbreed's leader, Dirk Lylesburg. In an initiation ceremony, Boone is touched by the blood of their deity, [[Baphomet]].\n\nSeeking to understand why Boone left her, Lori investigates Midian. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne and drives to the cemetery with her. Leaving Sheryl Anne at the car, Lori explores the cemetery, where she finds a dying wolf-like creature. A woman named Rachel (a nightbreed with the power to transform into smoke) pleads from the shadows for Lori to take it out of the sunlight. Once in the shadows, it transforms into a little girl, Rachel's daughter Babette. Lori asks about Boone but is rebuffed by Lylesburg and scared off by Peloquin. While leaving the cemetery, Lori discovers Sheryl Anne's corpse and her killer, Decker. Decker attempts to use Lori to draw Boone out of hiding. Boone rescues Lori, and Decker learns Boone cannot be killed due to his transformation. Decker escapes, and Boone takes Lori into Midian. Rachel explains to Lori that the monsters of [[folklore]] were peaceful beings who were hunted to near-extinction by humans. Lylesburg banishes Boone and Lori from Midian. Decker learns how to kill the Nightbreed and murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. When Boone discovers the crime scene, he uncontrollably drinks the blood. The police find Boone and take him into custody. At Decker's urging, the police form a militia led by Police Captain Eigerman. A drunken priest named Ashberry joins them as God's servant in their upcoming battle against Midian. Lori, Rachel and Narcisse rescue Boone, and the four return to Midian, where Boone convinces the Nightbreed to fight.\n\nDuring the battle, Ashberry learns there are women and children amongst the Nightbreed. When he tries halting the attack, he is beaten by Eigerman. Ashberry finds the idol of Baphomet and swears allegiance to it. When he is splashed by its blood, he is burned and transformed. Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet plans to destroy Midian. Boone argues to release the Berserkers, a monstrous feral breed that were imprisoned due to their insanity. When Lylesburg is killed before he can open the cages, Boone releases them and the Berserkers turn the tide of battle. Decker confronts Boone and is killed. When Boone faces Baphomet, Baphomet says that Boone has caused the end of Midian, which had been foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him Cabal.\n\nBoone leaves Midian with Lori and meets with the remaining Nightbreed in a barn, where he says his goodbyes to Narcisse and promises to find a place where they will be safe. In the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker's corpse and states that he wants vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. When he presses Baphomet's blood to Decker's wound, Decker springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry repeatedly hollers \"Hallelujah!\".\n\n=== Alternative endings ===\n==== The Cabal Cut ====\nIn ''The Cabal Cut'', the resurrection of Decker plays as a [[post-credits scene]].\n\n==== Director's Cut ====\nIn the alternative ending used in ''The Cabal Cut'' and ''Director's Cut'' of the film, Narcisse is killed earlier in the battle by Decker, so he is not present during the subsequent events. The Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori, as he must find a new home for the Nightbreed. Boone promises to return to her, but knowing that Boone will retain his youth and immortality as she grows old, Lori suddenly stabs herself, forcing Boone to resurrect her as a Nightbreed. They profess their love for one another and begin their journey.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains of the cemetery, where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry, who longs for revenge after his burning by Baphomet. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects Eigerman's offer, kills him, and starts his hunt for the Nightbreed.\n\nThe surviving Nightbreed watch Boone and Lori in the distance. Rachel tells Babette that Boone will return soon, perhaps the next day, to lead them to a new haven. Boone and Lori now appear together as part of a prophecy in a Nightbreed painting.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Craig Sheffer]] as Aaron Boone / Cabal, a man who is turned into a Nightbreed.\n* [[Anne Bobby]] as Lori Winston, Aaron's girlfriend.\n* [[David Cronenberg]] as Dr. Philip K.
