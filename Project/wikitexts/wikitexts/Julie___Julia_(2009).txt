The film contrasts the life of chef [[Julia Child]] in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker [[Julie Powell]], who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook in 365 days, a challenge she described on [[Julie Powell#Julie .26 Julia: 365 Days.2C 524 Recipes.2C 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen|her popular blog]], which made her a published author.<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/161490-bless-this-mess-sweeping-the-kitchen-with-julia-child-2495828420.html|title=Bless This Mess: Sweeping the Kitchen with Julia Child|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2021-09-04|author=J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III}}</ref>\n\nEphron's screenplay is based on two books: ''[[My Life in France]]'', Child's autobiography written with [[Alex Prud'homme]], and a [[Julie Powell#Julie .26 Julia: 365 Days.2C 524 Recipes.2C 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen|memoir]] by Powell, ''Julie & Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen'' (later retitled ''Julie & Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously''). Both of these books were written and published  between 2004 and 2006. Powell's book was based on her blog ''The Julie/Julia Project'',<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110819073749/http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html The Julie/Julia Project]</ref> where she documented online her daily experiences cooking each of the 524 recipes in Child's 1961 cookbook ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]''. The film is the first major motion picture based on a blog.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120529185137/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/Six-Films-Inspired-By-Items-on-the-Internets.html ''Philadelphia Weekly'']</ref>\n\nIn March 2008, Ephron began filming with Streep as Child and Adams as Powell. On July 30, 2009, the film officially premiered at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York; and, on August 7, 2009, it opened throughout North America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tweetin' Streep |url=http://www.zagat.com/Blog/Detail.aspx?SNP=NB&SCID=34&BLGID=22599  |work=Zagat.com |date=July 30, 2009 }}</ref> It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Streep's performance. Streep and Adams previously starred together in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' (2008). Streep and Tucci previously starred together in ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' (2006).\n\n''Julie & Julia'' was Ephron's last film before her death in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is presented in a series of flashbacks between present-day and past, jumping between various moments in both Julie and Julia's lives. The following plot summary separates the plot based on character.\n\n=== Julia Child \u2013 1950s ===\nIn the 1950s, Julia Child, an enthusiastic and unabashed woman, moves to Paris with her diplomat husband, Paul Child. She attends [[Le Cordon Bleu]] to learn French cooking and is initially met with skepticism as she is the only woman in the class. [[Madame Brassart|Madame Elizabeth Brassart]], the proprietress of the school, clashes with Julia. However, Julia is undaunted and begins collaborating on a book about [[French cooking]] for American housewives with [[Simone Beck]] and [[Louisette Bertholle]].\n\nJulia continues to work diligently on the book, despite such obstacles as Paul being repeatedly reassigned, Louisette's less-than-diligent efforts on the project (she's eventually told she will get a smaller share of the royalties than Julia and Simone), and Paul's being investigated for allegedly \"[[McCarthyism|un-American activities]].\"\n\nAlthough Julia's book is rejected by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] as too long and complicated, it is ultimately accepted and published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]].\n\n=== Julie Powell \u2013 2002 ===\nIn 2002, Julie Powell has an unpleasant job at the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]]'s call center, where she answers telephone calls from victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] and members of the general public complaining about the LMDC's controversial plans for rebuilding the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]].\n\nTo do something she enjoys, she decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's 1961 book ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' in one year while blogging about it. Her husband Eric initially supports her in this and she gains a following, but tension develops when Julie starts to get conceited and prioritize her blog and readers over their marriage. He temporarily leaves after an argument, after which Julie expresses remorse in her blog. Finally, Julie is visited by a food writer from ''[[The New York Times]]'', who features her blog in a story, after which her project begins to receive the attention of journalists, literary agents, and publishers.\n\nJulie is hurt when a journalist tells her that Child was critical of Julie's blog project, but she retains her love and gratitude for Child and the inspiration she provided. The last scenes show Powell and her husband visiting a reconstruction of Child's kitchen at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and Child in the same kitchen at her home receiving a first print edition of her cookbook and celebrating the event with her husband.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Julia Child]]\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Julie Powell]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Paul Cushing Child|Paul Child]], Julia's husband\n* [[Chris Messina]] as Eric Powell, Julie's husband<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=40198 |title=Chris Messina Joins Julie & Julia |date=2007-12-13 |access-date=2008-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Linda Emond]] as [[Simone Beck]] (\"Simca\"), with whom Julia wrote ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking''\n* Helen Carey as [[Louisette Bertholle]], co-author of ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking''\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Dorothy Dean Cousins, Julia's sister<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981898.html?categoryid=28&cs=1 |author=Bryon Perry |title=Jane Lynch |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2008-03-05 |access-date=2008-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Sarah, Julie's friend<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Movie-News/24s-Mary-Lynn/800036860 |title=24's Rajskub Cooks Up Role in Julie and Julia |access-date=2008-06-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705141156/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Movie-News/24s-Mary-Lynn/800036860 |archive-date=2008-07-05 }}</ref>\n* [[Joan Juliet Buck]] as [[Madame Brassart|Madame Elisabeth Brassart]] of Le Cordon Bleu, where Julia studied French cooking\n*[[Amanda Hesser]] as herself\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as [[Avis DeVoto]], Julia's long-time pen pal\n* [[Vanessa Ferlito]] as Cassie, Julie's acquaintance\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as Regina, Julie's acquaintance\n* [[Jillian Bach]] as Annabelle, Julie's acquaintance\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as [[Irma S.
