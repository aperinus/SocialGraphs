The screenplay by Sheridan Gibney draws elements of its plot from eight of the nine books in [[Hervey Allen]]'s historical novel, ''Anthony Adverse.'' Abandoned at a convent as an infant, Anthony comes of age in the tumultuous turn of the 18th to the 19th century, the age of Napoleon. The audience is privy to many truths in Anthony's life, including the tragic story of his origins and the fact that the wealthy merchant who adopts him is his grandfather. Most important of all, Anthony believes that his beloved Angela abandoned him without a word, when in fact she left a note telling him that the theatrical troupe was going to Rome. The gust of wind that blows the note away is one of many fateful and fatal events in Anthony's story.\n\nThe film received four [[Academy Awards]], including the inaugural [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]], given to [[Gale Sondergaard]] for her performance as the villainous Faith Paleologus.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\nIn 1773, young Scottish beauty Maria Bonnyfeather is the new bride of the cruel and devious middle-aged Spanish nobleman Marquis Don Luis. Don Luis suffers horribly from gout, so the consummation of their marriage must be postponed until his cure at a famous spa is complete. Meanwhile, Maria's true love, Denis Moore, the man she loved before being forced to marry Don Luis, follows them and stays near the ch\u00e2teau where they are living. While the marquis is away taking the cure, they contrive to meet in the woods, and after 3 months Maria tells him she is carrying his child. The marquis returns home, cured, and Maria is horrified at what awaits her. The lovers plan to flee that night, but the marquis discovers Maria waiting for Denis. Don Luis takes her across Europe, but Denis at last tracks them down at an inn, where Don Luis treacherously kills him in a sword duel.\n\nMonths later, Maria dies giving birth to her son at a [[chalet]] in the [[Alps]] in northern Italy. Don Luis leaves the infant in the [[foundling wheel]] of a [[convent]] near the port city of [[Livorno|Leghorn]] (Livorno), Italy, where the nuns christen him Anthony because he was found on January 17, the feast day of St. [[Anthony the Great]]. Don Luis lies to Maria's father, wealthy Leghorn-based merchant John Bonnyfeather, telling him that the infant is also dead. Ten years later, completely by coincidence, Anthony is apprenticed to Bonnyfeather, his real grandfather, who discovers his relationship to the boy but keeps it a secret from him. The only explanation for Don Luis\u2019 behavior is that Maria's child was illegitimate, and Bonnyfeather cannot bear to have his daughter\u2014or his grandson\u2014bear that stigma. He gives the boy the surname Adverse in acknowledgement of the difficult life he has led.\n\nFrom his arrival at Bonnyfeather's Anthony and the cook's daughter, Angela Guisseppi<ref>\"Guessippi\" in the novel, probably from Italian \"Giuseppe\", a first name.</ref> are attracted to each other, and as they grow they fall in love. Angela has ambitions to  become a great singer. Anthony wants to serve Bonnyfeather and marry Angela, but fate intervenes. Angela's father wins the lottery and the family leaves Leghorn. Years later, Anthony finds her, singing professionally, in the opera chorus. Eventually, the couple wed. Soon after the ceremony, Anthony is asked by Bonnyfeather to depart for [[Havana]] to save Bonnyfeather's fortune from a laggard debtor, the merchant trading firm Gallego & Sons. On the day his ship is supposed to set sail, he and Angela are supposed to meet at the convent before departing together, but she arrives first, and  he is late. Unable to wait any longer, she leaves a note outside the convent to inform him that she is leaving for Rome with her opera company. But the note Angela leaves for Anthony is blown away, and he is unaware that she has gone to Rome. Confused and upset, he sails without her. Meanwhile, assuming he has abandoned her, she departs and continues her career as an opera singer.\n\nLearning that Gallego has quit Havana, Anthony leaves to take control of Gallego & Sons' only remaining asset&mdash;a [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trading]] post on the [[Pongo River (Guinea)|Pongo River]] in Africa. Three years in the slave trade (so he can recover Bonnyfeather's debt) corrupts him, and he takes slave girl Neleta into his bed. Anthony eventually is redeemed by his friendship with Brother Fran\u00e7ois. After the monk is crucified and killed by the natives, Anthony returns to Italy to find Bonnyfeather has died. His housekeeper, Faith Paleologus (Don Luis' longtime co-conspirator and now wife), has inherited Bonnyfeather's fortune. Anthony goes to Paris to rectify the situation and claim his inheritance.\n\nIn Paris, Anthony is reunited with his friend, prominent banker Vincent Nolte, whom he saves from bankruptcy by loaning him his entire fortune, having learned from Brother Fran\u00e7ois that \"there's something besides money and power\".\n\nAll Paris is buzzing with gossip about [[Marguerite Georges|Mademoiselle Georges]], the famous opera star and mistress of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]],<ref>The historical character [[Marguerite Georges]] (nicknamed \"Mademoiselle Georges\") was indeed a famous actress and Napoleon's mistress in the years in which the plot of ''Anthony Adverse'' is set. She was, however, French and not Italian; and the documented facts about her life are very different from those of Angela in the novel and in this film adaptation.</ref> and the magnificent diamond necklace he has given to her, although [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine|Josephine]] wanted it.\n\nThrough the intercession of [[impresario]] Debrulle, Anthony is reunited with Angela and discovers that she bore him a son. They spend a blissful day or two together. Angela tells him that she is singing at the opera and he goes with Nolte to hear her. He searches the program in vain for her name, but then he hears her voice coming from the stage. He exclaims, \u201cthat\u2019s Angela\u201d and Nolte replies, \u201cThat\u2019s Mademoiselle Georges!\u201d Angela continues the aria and emerges from the shadows, descending a long staircase. Her voice is superb, she is magnificently costumed\u2014and she is wearing Napoleon's gift. She whispers \u201cGoodbye, Anthony,\u201d as he stands and leaves the box.\n\nShaken, he returns home to find that she has sent him their son, with a letter stating that he is better suited to raise the boy, and apologizing for not seeing him again. Anthony departs for America with his son in search of a better life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Fredric March]] as Anthony Adverse\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Angela Guisseppi\n* [[Donald Woods (actor)|Donald Woods]] as Vincent Nolte\n* [[Anita Louise]] as Maria\n* [[Edmund Gwenn]] as John Bonnyfeather\n* [[Claude Rains]] as Marquis Don Luis\n* [[Rollo Lloyd]] as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Louis Hayward]] as Denis Moore\n* [[Gale Sondergaard]] as Faith Paleologus\n* [[Steffi Duna]] as Neleta\n* [[Billy and Bobby Mauch|Billy Mauch]] as Anthony Adverse (age 10)\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as Carlo Cibo\n* [[Ralph Morgan]] as Debrulle\n* [[Henry O'Neill]] as Father Xavier\n* [[Pedro de Cordoba]] as Brother Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Alma Lloyd]] as Florence Udney (as an adult)\n* [[Marilyn Knowlden]] as Florence Udney (as a child)\n* [[Anne Howard (actress)|Anne Howard]] as Angela as a child (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n[[File:Filming on set of Anthony Adverse, 1936.jpeg|thumb|260px|right|Mervyn LeRoy (seated right) directing March and De Havilland; behind LeRoy is cinematographer Tony Gaudio]]\n\nBefore casting Frederic March to costar with Olivia de Havilland, Warner Bros. considered [[Robert Donat]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], and [[George Brent]] for the title role.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walter Connolly Selected to Play Title Role in \"Father Brown, Detective\": Long Search for Correct Type Ends \"Vampire of Prague\" Lead Scheduled for Fay Webb|author=Scheuer, Philip K|work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 4, 1934|page=13}}</ref> The studio during preproduction also intended to cast [[Errol Flynn]] in support of March, but Flynn became so popular with moviegoers after his performance in ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' in 1935 that Warner Bros. assigned him to star instead in the 1936 film ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]''.<ref>\"Chaplin's Big Business: Goldwyn's Leading Lady: A New Romantic Hero\" Bain, Greville.

Most of its picaresque quality has been lost in the screen version; its philosophy is vague, its characterization blurred and its story so loosely knit and episodic that its telling seems interminable. A few years back we devoted the better part of a British week-end to the reading of Mr. Allen's little pamphlet and we enjoyed it. Yesterday we spent only a fraction more than two hours watching its progress on the screen and we squirmed like a small boy in Sunday school.<ref>Nugent, Frank (1936).

Befitting with his name, he goes through great adversity to emerge a better man - renouncing material possessions in general and the owning of slaves in particular, and aspiring with increasing success to emulate the saintly, martyred Brother Fran\u00e7ois. In the film, all this was chopped off and amputated by cutting off the book's plotline in the middle. The film's Anthony Adverse is in effect denied the spiritual redemption which his literary creator intended for him. Possibly this was simply due to the fact that a normal length film could not accommodate so many adventures and changes of fortune over three continents. But I have a sneaking suspicion that some of the film-makers considered 'too much Christianity' as endangering a film's box office success. Anyway, I strongly recommend to anyone seeing the film to also read the book and find for themselves what they missed.<ref>Rev.
