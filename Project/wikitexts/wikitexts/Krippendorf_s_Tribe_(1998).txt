The film stars [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Jenna Elfman]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], and [[Lily Tomlin]]. Its plot follows Professor James Krippendorf (Dreyfuss), an [[anthropologist]] who, with the help of his wife and three children, creates a fictitious lost [[New Guinea]] tribe to cover up his misuse of grant money.\n\n''Krippendorf's Tribe'' was produced by [[Touchstone Pictures]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], the former a label of and the latter a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The film received generally negative reviews, with criticism for its racial stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 50 Most Racist Movies |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/05/the-50-most-racist-movies/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Complex}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRespected [[anthropologist]] James Krippendorf and his wife, Jennifer, bring their three children along during their much-enjoyed search in [[New Guinea]] for a lost tribe. The search fails, despite the family's best efforts. After Jennifer's death back in the U.S., James falls into academic stagnation, having spent all his foundation grant money raising the children as a single parent. Scheduled to lecture at a college and fearful of being charged with misuse of grant funds, James concocts an imaginary tribe, the Shelmikedmu, using the names of his children as a basis. He later fakes a 16&nbsp;mm \"documentary\" film, casting his children as tribe members and superimposing footage of a legitimate New Guinean tribe so as to enhance the illusion.\n\nAnthropologist Veronica Micelli contacts cable-TV producer Henry Spivey, forcing James to continue creating fraudulent footage as James' rival Ruth Allen becomes suspicious. Because he has described a culture unlike any other, Krippendorf's fraud becomes increasingly famous. James himself masquerades as a tribal elder, while his two sons, Mickey and Edmund, create and enact increasingly imaginative rituals. Only the eldest child, James' daughter Shelly, refuses to participate due to her disgust at the dishonesty perpetrated by her father.\n\nTaking advantage of her curiosity, James tricks Veronica into participating in his false documentary. When she discovers the truth, she is initially angry, but later helps James continue his fraud. Ruth Allen travels to New Guinea, discovering no tribe in the location specified by James. She transmits the news via fax to a colleague, who exposes James at a gala. James' imaginative son, Mickey, improvises a lie, that the Shelmikedmu hide by means of a magical ritual known only to them.\n\nUnknown to the majority of the characters, Shelly has contacted the New Guineans befriended by her family during the futile search for the lost tribe, urging them to masquerade as the Shelmikedmu in order to disappoint Ruth Allen. The ruse succeeds, and the accusation of fraud is abandoned. James, relieved of his worries, ends his fraud. Because Veronica has become sexually involved with him during her participation in his deceit, she assumes the role of a mother toward the children, though she is not explicitly said to marry James.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Professor James Krippendorf\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Professor Veronica Micelli\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Shelly Krippendorf\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Professor Ruth Allen\n* [[Barbara Williams (actress)|Barbara Williams]] as Professor Jennifer Harding Krippendorf\n* [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] as Michael \"Mickey\" Krippendorf\n* Carl Michael Lindner as Edmund Krippendorf\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Gerald Adams\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Sulukim\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Abbey Tournquist\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Henry Spivey\n* [[Doris Belack]] as President Porter\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Edith Proxmire \n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Nurse\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Krippendorf's Tribe'' opened at #7 in its opening weekend with $3,316,377.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&wknd=09&p=.htm Weekend Box Office Results for February 27-March 1, 1998 - Box Office Mojo]</ref> By the end of its domestic run, the film grossed $7,571,115.<ref>{{mojo title|krippendorfstribe|Krippendorf's Tribe}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally negative reviews.
