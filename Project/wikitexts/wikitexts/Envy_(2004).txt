It stars [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Jack Black]]. The film was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nTim Dingman and Nick Vanderpark are best friends, neighbors and co-workers at [[3M]]. Nick is constantly coming up with crazy ideas to get rich quick, and when he invents Vapoorize, a spray that instantly disintegrates dog feces, he actually succeeds. As Nick's wealth continues to grow, so does Tim's envy, as he had initially scoffed at the idea and squandered an opportunity to invest and become mega-rich himself. Nick is blissfully unaware of Tim's envy, and his generosity only serves to make Tim more envious of him. Meanwhile, Nick's wife Natalie decides to run for state senate but is continually plagued by questions about her husband's product.\n\nAfter Tim's wife Debbie and children temporarily leave and he is fired from 3M, Tim's envy reaches new levels. In a bar, he meets J-Man, a bizarre drifter, who lends a sympathetic ear and offers advice. After a drunken night out, Tim accidentally shoots Nick's beloved horse, Corky, with a bow and arrow, apparently killing him, and buries the horse in his abandoned swimming pool.\n\nNick offers a $50,000 reward for the return of his horse. J-Man and Tim concoct a plan whereby J-Man would discover the horse and claim the reward, splitting the proceeds. However a series of unfortunate events, including Tim's family getting holed up in J-Man's mountain cabin, leads to the horse's carcass being lost in a rain storm.\n\nNick reveals to Tim that he is going to [[Rome]] for the debut of Vapoorize there, and gives Tim the opportunity to join him in a 50-50 partnership, which he accepts. J-Man finds out that Tim is now rich, and, feeling betrayed, tries to [[blackmail]] him. After confessing to his wife, now enjoying her rich lifestyle, Tim agrees to pay J-Man; however, J-Man ups his demands and asks to be Tim's partner. Tim accidentally shoots him in the back with an arrow and J-Man, believing that Tim has tried to kill him, backs down in fear.\n\nTim eventually confesses all to Nick who forgives him for his jealousy and agrees to continue with the partnership; however, at a press conference for Natalie's electoral campaign (where she promises to withdraw her candidacy if it is proven Vapoorize is harmful to the environment in any way), Corky's body is seen floating down the nearby river. The animal's [[post-mortem]] reveals that the horse was not killed by the arrow as previously thought but actually [[poison]]ed by a by-product of Vapoorize, used by Tim to treat his garden after Corky came to eat the apples from his tree. The [[veterinarian]] informs the pair that she is obliged to notify the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], and Vapoorize is immediately pulled from the market. Nick and Tim almost lose all their wealth and glory, until Tim comes up with an invention of his own: Pocket Flan, inspired by Nick's family's love for [[cr\u00e8me caramel|the dessert]]. J-Man is shown in the audience of Tim and Nick's infomercial for Pocket Flan, apparently reconciled.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as Tim Dingman\n*[[Jack Black (actor)|Jack Black]] as Nick Vanderpark\n*[[Rachel Weisz]] as Debbie Dingman\n*[[Amy Poehler]] as Natalie Vanderpark\n*[[Christopher Walken]] as J-Man Goddard\n\n==Reception==\n''Envy'' received generally negative reviews from critics.
