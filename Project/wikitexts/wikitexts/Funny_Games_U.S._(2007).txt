Their next-door neighbor, Fred, is seen with two young men, Peter and Paul. They find Fred reacting somewhat awkwardly. Fred and Paul come over to help put the boat into the lake. After they leave, George and Georgie stay outside by the lake, tending to their boat. Georgie asks his father why Fred was behaving so strangely.\n\nWhile Ann is in the kitchen cooking, Peter visits and asks to borrow some eggs. Ann gives him the eggs but Peter clumsily drops them. Feeling a little annoyed after Peter accidentally knocks her phone into the sink filled with water, Ann gives him another four eggs and he leaves. Soon afterwards she hears Lucky barking and finds Peter and Paul inside together. Lucky had jumped on Peter, causing him to break the second batch of eggs. Paul asks her to try out one of the golf clubs outside, and she begrudgingly agrees. In the boat, George and Georgie hear Lucky barking hysterically when suddenly the barking stops. Peter and Paul request more eggs, and Ann becomes frustrated, but George arrives and tries to force the men to leave, slapping Paul. In retaliation, Peter breaks one of George's legs with the golf club. The two young men then take the family hostage.\n\nPaul guides Ann on a hunt to find the family's dog, which he had killed with George's golf club. When their neighbors, the Thompsons, visit, Ann passes Paul off as friends, just like what Fred had done before. After returning to the house, the Farbers are forced to participate in a number of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] games in order to stay alive, in hope that Fred would visit them as scheduled so they might be rescued. The two young men try to \"apologize\" to George, but when neglected by George and Ann, they beat them.\n\nPaul asks if George or Ann wants to bet that they will be alive by 9:00 in the morning, and says that he and Peter are betting they will not be. Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence, and describes a number of contradicting stories of Peter's past, although no definitive explanation is ever presented as to the men's origins or motives.\n\nDuring the \"games\", Peter and Paul put Georgie's head in a bag and ask Ann to strip naked. Georgie is nearly suffocated until George asks Ann to follow the men's instructions. When released from the bag, Georgie escapes the house with the help of his parents. He goes to the house of Fred, where he discovers bloody corpses. Meanwhile, Paul pushes Ann, whose hands have been tied by tape behind her back, onto a sofa that is some space away from George, and ties her ankles by tape as well before going out to search for Georgie, leaving Peter to watch over the Farbers. Ann asks why they do not directly kill them, and Peter answers that they should not forget the fun of the games. When Peter goes to the kitchen to get eggs, Ann jumps to George but George fails to untape her before Peter comes back, and Peter beats her and breaks the eggs again. Ann begs Peter to let them go, but he refuses. Georgie finds a shotgun in the house of Fred and Paul tells him to go ahead and shoot him with it, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, and gives the shotgun to Peter.\n\nThe men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. While Paul is in the kitchen getting something to eat, Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to briefly leave. George and Ann are grief-stricken over their loss, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house.\n\nAfter stabbing George, they tell Ann to say a prayer before making a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the \"little\" knife, or a quick and brutal death with the \"big\" shotgun. While Paul is talking, Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, breaking the [[fourth wall]]. On the \"do over\", Paul snatches the shotgun away before she can grab it and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules.\n\nPeter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself but is caught by Paul and Peter. Around eight o'clock in the morning, Paul nonchalantly pushes her into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. Paul glances at the camera with a smirk.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as Ann Farber\n*[[Tim Roth]] as George Farber\n*[[Devon Gearhart]] as Georgie Farber\n*[[Michael Pitt]] as Paul\n*[[Brady Corbet]] as Peter\n*[[Boyd Gaines]] as Fred, the Farbers' neighbor\n*[[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Betsy Thompson\n*[[Robert LuPone]] as Robert Thompson\n*Susanne Haneke as Betsy's sister-in-law\n*Linda Moran as Eve\n\nFor 2007's American remake, the character of Gerda was renamed \"Betsy\", the second family to fall victim to Paul and Peter were given the surname \"Farber\" and the third family were given the surname \"Thompson\".\n\n==Development==\n[[Michael Haneke]] wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set the [[Funny Games (1997 film)|original 1997 film]] in Austria.<ref name=CineasteFG>Koehler, Robert. \"[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Funny Games].\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131002065215/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Archive]) ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''.

He says he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie. He had written a short essay revealing how he felt on the issue, called \"Violence + Media.\" The essay is included as a chapter in the book ''A Companion to Michael Haneke.''<ref>Haneke, Michael (2010). \"Violence and the Media\".
