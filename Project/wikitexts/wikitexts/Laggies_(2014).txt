At her friend Allison's ([[Ellie Kemper]]) wedding, her boyfriend unexpectedly proposes. She also sees her father cheating on her mother.\n\nShocked and confused, she flees and runs into teenager Annika ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]) and her friends outside a grocery store. After buying them alcohol, Megan plays with their skateboard. When they ask her to join them on their night out, she does.\n\nReturning home, Megan's boyfriend suggests that rather than having a big wedding, they elope. She agrees, but delays the wedding by pretending she has a week-long career advice seminar to attend.\n\nMegan receives a call from Annika asking her to pretend to be her absentee mother at a guidance counsellor's meeting. She goes to the meeting, then asks Annika if, in return, she can stay at her house.\n\nAnnika is unsuccessful at sneaking Megan into her house, where her single-parent lawyer father Craig ([[Sam Rockwell]]) questions Megan about her relationship with his daughter. She lies that there is a one-week gap between her lease expiring and her move into a new apartment. Craig reluctantly allows her to stay and gradually begins to trust her. Annika asks Megan to drive her to her estranged mother's house to see her for the first time in years.\n\nCraig asks Megan out for a drink. When they return\u2014having had more drinks than they planned\u2014they end up having sex. The next morning, he offers to let her stay longer than the week she asked for, but she declines.\n\nAnnika, seeing them kiss, tentatively tells Megan that she approves of the relationship. She then finds the engagement ring in her purse. Megan tells her she's engaged, and that Craig has no idea. On the way home from shopping for Annika's prom dress, they begin arguing, Patrick is distracted and crashes the car. He tells Megan he has been drinking the wine she bought for them because he is upset that his parents are sending him to boarding school.\n\nFeeling guilty, Megan tells the police she was the one driving the car. She still has alcohol on her breath from that morning, and is arrested. When Craig arrives to free her, Megan reveals her engagement and that she bought alcohol for his daughter.\n\nMegan's father picks her up at the police station. He says he has confessed his cheating to her mother and they are trying to work things out.\n\nMisty shows up at Megan's door with her white dress she bought and a few other things she'd left in Patrick's car, and tries to convince Megan to go to the prom. When Anthony comes to the door, they tell him Misty is a girl she was mentoring at the seminar. Once he goes back upstairs, Misty gives Megan a prom ticket, urging her to go for Annika's benefit.\n\nMegan continues to lie to her fianc\u00e9 about where she was for the past week. At the airport, he takes a selfie of them, sending it to their high school friends. Megan, realizing their relationship is stifling her, breaks up with him, unfriends her high school friends, and goes to Annika's prom, where she tells Annika to be honest and pursue Junior, a friend with whom she is in love.\n\nMegan goes to Craig's house and leaves him a box of wine with a note that says, 'Can we try again? Check [Yes] or [No]\". She knocks, then hides at the bottom of the steps. Craig answers the door, reads the note, sees Megan at the bottom of the steps, and closes the door. Not to be deterred, she knocks again, then picks up the house key hidden outside\u2014but before she can unlock the door, Craig opens it again and lets her in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Megan Burch\n** Larissa Schmitz as young Megan Burch\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Annika Hunter\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Craig Hunter\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Allison\n** Sarah Lynn Wright as young Allison\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Anthony\n** Phillip Abraham as young Anthony\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Misty\n* [[Tiya Sircar]] as Zareena\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Bethany\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Mr. Birch\n* Sara Coates as Savannah\n** Rocki DuCharme as young Savannah\n* [[Louis Hobson]] as Theo\n* Kirsten deLohr Helland as Danielle\n** Maura Lindsay as young Danielle\n* [[Daniel Zovatto]] as Junior\n* [[Dylan Arnold]] as Patrick \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Title==\nThe writer and director have explained that choosing the title \"Laggies\" was a complex decision.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why the name 'Laggies' was chosen.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW-vlXpwEwU|website=youtube|access-date=November 8, 2014}}</ref> Shelton said she had never heard the term before making the film, but that screenwriter [[Andrea Seigel]] insisted it was a common term for adult slackers.
