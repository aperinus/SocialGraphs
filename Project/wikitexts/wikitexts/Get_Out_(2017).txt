It stars [[Daniel Kaluuya]], [[Allison Williams (actress)|Allison Williams]], [[Bradley Whitford]], [[Caleb Landry Jones]], [[Stephen Root]], and [[Catherine Keener]]. The plot follows a young black man (Kaluuya), who uncovers shocking secrets when he meets the family of his white girlfriend (Williams).\n\nPrincipal photography began in February 2016 in [[Fairhope, Alabama]], then moved to [[Barton Academy]] and the [[Ashland Place Historic District (Mobile, Alabama)|Ashland Place Historic District]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. The entire film was shot in 23 days.\n\n''Get Out'' premiered at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 24, 2017, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received critical acclaim for its screenplay, direction, acting, and social critiques. It was a major commercial success, grossing $255 million worldwide on a $4.5 million budget, with a net profit of $124.3 million, making it the tenth-most profitable film of 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://deadline.com/2018/03/most-profitable-movies-2017-star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-disney-fox-merger-1202356161/ | title='Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Leads Franchise-Filled Blockbuster Tournament: The Data Behind the Dollars | date=March 30, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIt was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]], the [[American Film Institute]], and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the top ten films of the year. Peele won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]], with additional nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Kaluuya). It also earned five nominations at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], two at the [[75th Golden Globe Awards]], and two at the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n''Get Out'' has maintained a strong reputation since its release, and it is commonly cited by critics as one of the best films of the 21st century, featuring in multiple listings of the best films of the 2010s. In 2021, the [[Writers Guild of America]] ranked the screenplay the greatest of the 21st century.\n\n== Plot ==\nChris Washington is a Black photographer from [[Brooklyn, New York]], preparing for a weekend visit to [[Upstate New York]], to meet the family of his\nwhite girlfriend, Rose Armitage. Hesitant, he asks Rose if her family knows about their interracial relationship, but she assures him that they are not racist. While there, Rose's brother Jeremy and their parents, neurosurgeon Dean and hypnotherapist Missy, make disconcerting comments about Black people, and Chris witnesses strange behavior from the estate's Black housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter.\n\nOne night, Missy pressures Chris into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, he confesses that his mother was killed in a [[Hit and run|hit-and-run]] when he was a child and that he feels responsible for her death as he waited too long to call for help. He then enters a void Missy calls the \"Sunken Place\". The next morning, he assumes that the encounter was a dream until Walter acknowledges their brief session the night before. However, he is pleased to discover that the hypnosis was a success, as he no longer feels a desire to smoke.\n\nDozens of wealthy white people arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, and express admiration for Chris' physique and for Black figures such as [[Tiger Woods]]. Jim Hudson, an art dealer who has gone blind in his old age, takes a particular interest in Chris' photography skills. Chris meets another Black man, Logan King, who behaves strangely and is married to a much older white woman. Chris relays the information to his friend, [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] officer Rod Williams. Chris tries to photograph Logan inconspicuously, but when his flash goes off, Logan becomes hysterical, shouting at Chris to \"get out\". The others restrain him, and Dean later claims that Logan had an [[epileptic seizure]].\n\nAway from the party, Chris tells Rose that they should leave. Meanwhile, the party guests hold a silent auction with Chris as the \"prize\", with Jim making the winning bid. Rod recognizes \"Logan\" as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Suspecting a conspiracy, Rod tries to tell the police, but his claims are dismissed. While Chris packs to leave, he finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with several Black partners, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her earlier claim that Chris is the first Black person she has dated. He tries to leave the house, but Rose and her family lock him in. Chris attacks Jeremy, but Missy uses a \"trigger\" that she implanted during his hypnosis, knocking him out.\n\nChris awakens strapped to a chair in the basement. In a video presentation, Rose's grandfather Roman explains that the family transplants people's brains into others' bodies, granting them preferred physical characteristics and a twisted form of immortality. The host's consciousness remains in the Sunken Place, alive but powerless. The video then connects to a feed of Jim, speaking with Chris through an intercom. Jim says that although the Armitages target mainly black people, he doesn't care about Chris' race: he only wants his eyesight. Missy performs hypnosis, seemingly knocking Chris out.\n\nWhen Jeremy comes to fetch Chris for the surgery, it is revealed that Chris blocked the hypnosis trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the chair. Chris bludgeons Jeremy unconscious with a bocce ball and heads to the operating room where Dean is about to perform the surgery replacing Jim's body with Chris'. Chris impales Dean with the antlers of a deer mount, knocking over a candle which sets fire to the operating room with an anesthetized Jim inside. Missy attacks Chris in the kitchen but he stabs and kills her, and is then attacked again by Jeremy as he heads towards the door; he overpowers and kills Jeremy before leaving in the latter's car. On the way out, he hits Georgina \u2013 who is revealed to be possessed by Rose's grandmother, Marianne \u2013 and knocks her unconscious. Compelled by guilt from his mother's death, he decides to carry her into the car, but she awakens and attacks him. In the ensuing struggle, the car crashes and Georgina is killed.\n\nAn armed Rose apprehends Chris with Walter, who is possessed by Roman. Chris uses the flash on his phone to neutralize Roman, allowing Walter to regain control of his body. Walter takes Rose's rifle and shoots her in the stomach before shooting himself. Chris begins to strangle Rose, but he finds himself unable to kill her. Police sirens approach, and Rose cries out for help. However, the driver is revealed to be Rod, who drives away with Chris as Rose is left bleeding out on the road.<!--- DO NOT CHANGE based on whether you believe she dies or not.

During a February 2017 interview with Bethonie Butler in the ''Washington Post'', Peele said \"he deliberately avoided setting the movie in red state territory. 'It was really important for me to not have the villains in this film reflect the typical red state type who is usually categorized as being racist. It felt like that was too easy,' he said.

And if you didn't catch yourself, where would you end up?

It was a very emotional discovery.

Instead of rescuing Chris, Rod meets him in jail and asks him for information about the Armitage family to investigate, but Chris insists that he stopped them and everything is fine.

By the time production had begun, however, several high-profile police shootings of black people had made discussion, in Peele's words, \"more [[woke]]\". After gauging reception at [[test screening]]s, he decided the film needed a happy ending, but felt a moment when the audience believes Chris is about to be arrested would preserve the intended reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/get-out-alternate-ending/|title=Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' Almost Had a Much More Bleak Ending|last=Anderton|first=Ethan|work=Slash Film|date=March 5, 2017|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/get-out-alternate-ending-explained/|title=Get Out Filmmakers Explain Why They Changed The Ending|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|work=Collider|date=February 22, 2018|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nPeele considered several other endings, some of which are included on the DVD and Blu-ray release.
