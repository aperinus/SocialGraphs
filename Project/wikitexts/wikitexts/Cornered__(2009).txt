At Steve's [[liquor store]] (the main door to which has been boarded up due to an incident with a homeless man) the employees, customers, and a deliveryman named Morty discuss the killer, the $500,000 being offered as a reward for his capture, and how they would kill him, the mentioned methods being eye gouging, [[exsanguination]] in plastic wrap, sawing, and decapitation. After the store closes, Steve has a clerk named Donny, and two regulars (a prostitute named Jess, and a [[phone sex]] worker named Mona) stay to play cards in the upstairs apartment as a means of keeping Steve's nephew Jimmy (an addict going through [[drug withdrawal]]) occupied. Unbeknownst to the [[quintet]], the Convenience Store Killer has chosen them as his next victims, cutting the homeless man (who resides in a nearby [[alley]]) in half before sneaking into the building.\n\nWhen Mona goes downstairs to look for the source of strange noises, the Convenience Store Killer stabs her in the eyes with [[Cornetto (ice cream)|cornetto]]s, and hides her body in a freezer. Later, Jimmy and Steve are also killed, the former by being stabbed while wrapped in plastic, and the latter by being bisected with the [[Delicatessen|deli's]] [[Meat slicer|meat saw]]. Donny and Jess witness Steve's death on a security monitor, and after finding the bodies of Mona and Jimmy, realize the killer is murdering them in the ways they said they would kill him, and that they are trapped in the store without any way to contact help. Forced to try and survive until Morty drops a delivery off at dawn, Jess and Donny find the hidden room where Steve keeps his surveillance equipment, and seal themselves in it.\n\nMorty eventually arrives, and has Jess help him try and seal the killer in the basement, so they can claim the reward money. Donny accidentally rewinds Steve's surveillance gear to the earlier discussion about the killer, which causes him to realize that Morty is the murderer, as he is the only one who could have known about the ways the group had said they would bring down the Convenience Store Killer. Jess is beheaded (the way she said she would dispose of the killer) while trying to escape, and Donny is knocked unconscious. Donny awakens with Morty about to kill him, but realizing that Morty needs the surveillance tapes, Donny taunts him by saying that only he knows where Steve's surveillance equipment is hidden. After Morty has Donny show him where the tapes are, the two get into a fight, which ends with them knocking each other out. Hours later, the authorities arrive, and it shown that Morty had killed Donny by [[force-feeding]] him donuts (his favorite food).\n\nAt another store, the customers and employees discuss the recent massacre, with the owner saying that it is nothing compared to what he would do to the Convenience Store Killer. Morty appears, and asks, \"Oh yeah? What do you have in mind?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Morty\n* [[James Duval]] as Jimmy\n* Elizabeth Nicole as Jess\n* Peter Story as Donny\n* Eduardo Antonio Garcia as Steve\n* [[Ellia English]] as Mona Moore\n* David Jean Thomas as Jacko\n* David Basila as Teddy\n* Rolando Boyce as T.J.\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\nJimmy O of [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]] awarded ''Cornered!'' a score of 3 out of 4, commending the visual style and it spending most of its running time focused on atypical characters, though O did admit that the twist was predictable, and that the actions of the characters could induce frustration.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/cornered|title = ''Cornered!''|last = O|first = Jimmy|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref> An overall grade of 2.5 out of 5 was given by Justin Felix of DVD Talk, who found the plot contrived and the mystery weak, though the murders and quirky characters largely succeeded at making it \"a run-around that does entertain\" and \"a dark yet slightly comic take on the [[slasher film]]s of yesteryear\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42598/cornered/|title = ''Cornered''|last = Felix|first = Justin|publisher = DVD Talk|date = 2 June 2010|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Dread Central]] gave the film 1.5 out of 5, and wrote that it felt like a [[Filler (media)|padded]] [[Short film|short]], and that it \"fancies itself a slasher comedy except as a comedy it's not all that amusing in spite of the best efforts of a game cast, and as a slasher movie there are only two deaths in the first hour and little to get excited, scared, or grossed out by\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/cornered-2010#axzz2r4I5fVtG|title = ''Cornered'' (2010)|last = Foywonder|first = The|publisher = Dread Central|date = 16 June 2010|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref> Steve Porter of [[DVD Verdict]] also lambasted ''Cornered!'', stating that it was an \"agonizingly slow\" film that was full of \"moronic horror-film [[clich\u00e9]]s\" and no surprises, and ultimately concluding that it was \"a complete waste for all but the hardest of hard core slasher fans, who'll probably be disappointed by the relative lack of sickness on display\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/cornered.php|title = ''Cornered!''|last = Power|first = Steve|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = 11 June 2010|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n''Cornered!'' was runner-up for Best Picture at the [[Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival]], and [[Ellia English]] won Best Actress at the [[New York City Horror Film Festival]].\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1151911|Cornered!}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|cornered}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2008]]\n[[Category:2009 horror films]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in the United States]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films about security and surveillance]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2009 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
