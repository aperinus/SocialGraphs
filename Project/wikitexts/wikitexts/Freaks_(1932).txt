However, her plot proves to have dangerous consequences. The film is based on elements from the short story \"[[Spurs (short story)|Spurs]]\" by [[Tod Robbins]], first published in ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' in February 1923, with the rights being purchased by the studio, responsible by MGM art department chief [[Cedric Gibbons]].<ref name=\"publication\"/>{{Clarify|reason=Does not make sense|date=May 2022}}\n\nFilmed in [[Los Angeles]] in the fall of 1931, some employees at MGM were discomfited by the presence of the actors portraying the \"freaks\" on set, and, other than the so-called more normal looking \"freaks\", the [[Siamese twins]] and the Earles, the performers were not allowed to be on the studio lot, relegated instead to a specially-built tent.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/549845-facts-about-freaks-tod-browning|title=11 Astonishing Facts About Tod Browning's Freaks |date=July 6, 2018 }}</ref> The film had test screenings in January 1932, with many members of the audience reacting negatively, finding the film too grotesque. In response to this, MGM executive [[Irving Thalberg]], without consent of director Browning, edited the original 90-minute feature, which was significantly cut, with additional alternate footage incorporated to help increase the running time. The final abridged cut of the film, released in February 1932, was 64 minutes; the original version [[lost film|no longer exists]].\n \nDespite the cuts made to the film, ''Freaks'' still garnered notice for the portrayal of its eponymous characters by people who worked as sideshow performers and had real disabilities. These cast members included dwarf siblings [[The Doll Family|Harry and Daisy Earles]]; [[Johnny Eck]], who had [[Caudal regression syndrome|sacral agenesis]]; the [[conjoined twin]] sisters [[Daisy and Violet Hilton]]; and [[Schlitzie]], a man with [[microcephaly]]. Because of its controversial content, the film was banned in the United Kingdom for over 30 years, and was labelled as \"brutal and grotesque\" in Canada.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1471733/Tiny-Doll.html|title=Obituaries: Tiny Doll|date=September 15, 2004|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160724044456/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1471733/Tiny-Doll.html|archive-date=July 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough it received critical backlash and was a [[box-office failure]] upon initial release, ''Freaks'' was subject to public and critical reappraisal in the 1960s, as a long forgotten Hollywood classic, particularly in Europe, and was screened at the 1962 [[Venice Film Festival]]. In retrospect, numerous film critics have suggested that the film presents a starkly sympathetic portrait of its sideshow characters rather than an [[Exploitation film|exploitative]] one, with [[Andrew Sarris]] declaring ''Freaks'' one of the \"most compassionate\" films ever made.{{sfn|Skal|1995|p=224}} Nonetheless, critics have continued to take note of the film's horror elements; in 2009, [[Joe Morgenstern]] proclaimed that ''Freaks'' contains some of the most terrifying scenes in film history. [[film studies|Film scholars]] have interpreted the film as a metaphor for [[class conflict]], reflecting the [[Great Depression]], and it has been studied for its portrayal of [[disability|people with disabilities]], with theorists arguing that it presents an anti-[[eugenics]] message. The film has been highly influential, has become a [[cult classic]], and, in 1994, was selected for preservation by the United States [[National Film Registry]], which seeks to preserve films that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite news|date=November 15, 1994|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|access-date=October 2, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=October 2, 2020|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA beautiful and conniving [[trapeze]] artist named Cleopatra seduces a [[traveling carnival|carnival]] [[sideshow]] little person named Hans after learning of his large inheritance, much to the chagrin of Frieda, his fianc\u00e9e, also a little person. Cleopatra also conspires with circus strongman Hercules to kill Hans and inherit his wealth. Meanwhile, other romances flourish among the sideshow performers: the [[bearded lady|Bearded Lady]], who is in love with the Human Skeleton, gives birth to their daughter. The news is spread among the friends by [[Elizabeth Green the Stork Woman|the Stork Woman]]. Additionally, Violet, a [[Conjoined twins|conjoined twin]] whose sister Daisy is married to Roscoe, the stuttering circus clown, becomes engaged to the circus's owner.\n\nHans, enamored of Cleopatra, ultimately marries her. At their wedding, Cleopatra begins poisoning Hans's wine but drunkenly kisses Hercules in front of Hans, revealing her affair. Oblivious, the other \"freaks\" announce that they accept Cleopatra in spite of her being a \"normal\" outsider; they hold an initiation ceremony in which they pass a [[loving cup]] around the table while chanting, \"We accept her, one of us. We accept her, one of us. Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble.\"{{sfn|Peterson|2014|p=239}} However, Cleopatra's mean-spirited amusement at this ceremony soon turns into fear and anger after Hercules jokes that the rest of the entertainers plan to turn her into one of them. She mocks them, tosses the wine in their faces and drives them away before berating Hans and drunkenly parading him around on her shoulders like a child. The humiliated Hans realizes that he has been played for a fool and rejects Cleopatra's attempts to apologize, but then he falls ill from the poison. While bedridden, Hans pretends to apologize to Cleopatra and also pretends to take the poisoned medicine that she is giving him, but he secretly plots with the other entertainers to strike back at Cleopatra and Hercules.\n\nIn the film's climax, Hans confronts Cleopatra with three of the entertainers as backup thugs. However, Hans's circus wagon is overturned in a storm, giving Cleopatra the chance to escape into the forest, closely pursued by them. At the same time Hercules goes to kill seal-trainer Venus for knowing about the plot. Venus's boyfriend, Phroso the clown, attempts to stop Hercules but is nearly killed before the rest of them intervene and injure Hercules, saving Phroso. They all pursue an injured Hercules.\n\nThe freaks then capture Cleopatra and sometime later, she is shown to be a grotesque, squawking \"human duck\" on display for carnival patrons; her tongue has been removed, one eye has been gouged out, the flesh of her hands has been melted and deformed to look like duck feet, her legs have been cut off, and what is left of her torso has been permanently [[Tarring and feathering|tarred and feathered]]. In the original version of the film, it is revealed that after the freaks caught Hercules, they made him into a [[castrato]] singer.\n\nWhile some versions end on Cleopatra as the human duck, another ending shows Hans, now living in a mansion from his inheritance and still humiliated, visited by Phroso, Venus and Frieda. Frieda tells Hans she knows he just wanted to demand the bottle of poison from Cleopatra, not to mutilate her, and not to blame himself for what happened; and that she still loves him. The two then share a heartwarming hug.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Wallace Ford]] as Phroso\n* [[Leila Hyams]] as Venus\n* [[Olga Baclanova]] as Cleopatra\n* [[Roscoe Ates|Rosco Ates]] as Roscoe \n* [[Henry Victor]] as Hercules\n* [[The Doll Family|Harry Earles]] as Hans\n* [[Daisy Earles]] as Frieda\n* [[Rose Dione]] as Madame Tetrallini\n* [[Daisy and Violet Hilton]] as the [[Siamese twins]]\n* [[Schlitzie]] as himself and [[Samuel Whiskers]]\n* [[Josephine Joseph]] as [[Intersex|Half Woman-Half Man]]\n* [[Johnny Eck]] as Half-Boy\n* [[Frances O'Connor (performer)|Frances O'Connor]] as [[Armless wonder|Armless girl]]\n* [[Peter Robinson (sideshow artist)|Peter Robinson]] as Human skeleton\n* [[Jane Barnell|Olga Roderick]] as [[Bearded lady]]\n* [[Koo-Koo the Bird Girl|Koo Koo]] as herself\n* [[Prince Randian]] as The Living Torso\n* Martha Morris as Angeleno's armless wife\n* Elvira Snow as Pinhead Pip\n* Jenny Lee Snow as Pinhead Zip\n* [[Elizabeth Green the Stork Woman|Elizabeth Green]] as Bird Girl\n* [[Angelo Rossitto]] as Angeleno\n* [[Edward Brophy]] and [[Matt McHugh]] as the Rollo Brothers\n}}\n\n==Analysis and themes==\n===Class conflict===\nFilm critic Melvin Matthews has interpreted ''Freaks'' within the context of the [[Great Depression]], writing that it \"is essentially a story of the little people (average Americans) versus the big people (the rich and businessmen). The film makes it clear that the big people, personified by Cleopatra and Hercules, scorn the Freaks. Such a disdainful attitude was reflected in the real-life social outlook of some business tycoons during the Depression.\"{{sfn|Matthews|2009|p=58}} Film studies academic Jennifer Peterson similarly identifies ''Freaks'' as an example of an \"outsider film\".{{sfn|Peterson|2009|p=37}} Historian Jane Nicholas suggests that the film's conclusion, in which the circus performers mutilate Cleopatra whilst chanting \"one of us,\" is reinforcing the freaks' social currency: \"It is interesting that a statement that reads as one of inclusion is often cited as one that embodies horror in the film. What does it mean to be 'one of us'? The chilling horror of the chant 'one of us' reveals why the freak show persists.\"{{sfn|Nicholas|2018|p=204}}\n\nIn the book ''Midnight Movies'' (1991), critics J. Hoberman and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] compare ''Freaks'' to ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', writing that the former is \"almost literally dealing with the same thing [class disparity]...&nbsp;but more directly\u2014because the end product isn't just putting on a show, but slaves breaking their chains and triumphing over their masters. ''Freaks'' is asking a Depression audience to identify not with the Beautiful People, but with sideshow mutations, a total underclass.\"{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=306}}\n\nJohn Stanley, longtime publisher of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', describes the film as \"A Classic of the Grotesque\" in ''Creature Features''.<ref>=Stanley, John \"Creature Features: The Science Fiction, Fantasy And Horror Movie Guide\" {{ISBN|9780425175170}} published by BERKLEY (updated edition 1 August 2000)</ref>\n\n===Disability and eugenics===\n[[File:Wallace Ford, Johnny Eck, and Leila Hyams in Freaks.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Critic Jon Towlson notes that the everyday interaction between the able-bodied and disabled circus performers serves to uphold an anti-[[eugenics]] sentiment.]]\nThe film's depiction of [[disability|people with disabilities]] has been a significant point of analysis amongst film critics and scholars.{{sfn|Towlson|2014|pages=22\u201325}}{{sfn|Smith|2012|pages=88\u201392}} In his book ''Subversive Horror Cinema: Countercultural Messages of Films from Frankenstein to the Present'' (2014), critic Jon Towlson proposes that ''Freaks'' exemplifies an anti-[[eugenics]] sentiment.{{sfn|Towlson|2014|pages=22\u201325}} In presenting this idea, Towlson cites vignette sequences that make up the beginning of the film, largely consisting of the freaks in the context of their sideshow, before Browning \"begins to undercut the voyeuristic aspects of the traditional freakshow by showing the freaks engaged in the activities of everyday life, dispelling the initial shock and revulsion, and encouraging the viewer to see the freaks as individuals who have overcome their disabilities.\"{{sfn|Towlson|2014|p=25}}\n\nTowlson also notes that the freaks' everyday interactions with the able-bodied sideshow performers, such as Phroso, Roscoe, and Venus, further blurs the distinction between the able-bodied and disabled members of the circus, and that the physically beautiful characters\u2014such as trapeze artist Cleopatra\u2014are the ones who are vindictive and immoral.{{sfn|Towlson|2014|pages=25\u201326}} He further argues that the implied sexuality in the film\u2014such as the implication that the conjoined twin sisters (played by [[Daisy and Violet Hilton]]) carry on their own separate sex lives{{sfn|Hartzman|2006|p=169}}\u2014is an affront to the eugenic stance against reproduction and sexual activity among the \"physically unfit.\"{{sfn|Towlson|2014|p=29}} Towlson ultimately concludes that this subversion of character exemplifies a stark opposition to the core belief of eugenics, which is that physical appearance is equated with internal worth.{{sfn|Towlson|2014|p=25}}\n\nAngela Smith, a scholar of film and disability, similarly notes that ''Freaks'' presents numerous scenes in which the freaks engage in routine and ordinary domestic behavior.{{sfn|Smith|2012|p=89}} Among them, Smith cites the freaks' celebration of the birth of the Bearded Lady's baby, and the film's key dinner party sequence in which Cleopatra grows enraged when the freaks sing \"We accept her, we accept her, one of us, one of us\" as a welcoming song.{{sfn|Smith|2012|pages=89\u201390}} Film scholars Martin Norden and Madeleine Cahill, however, question Browning's intention of the film's final revenge sequence, in which the freaks mutilate the able-bodied, morally cruel Cleopatra.{{sfn|Norden|Cahill|2000|pages=163\u2013165}} \"The implications of the violence against [Cleopatra] are far from clear,\" they write. \"Members of a traditionally disempowered minority use their collective force to disempower a majority member\u2014turn her into one of them, in effect\u2014leading us to wonder if she is truly disempowered or empowered in a new way. Browning's ambiguity on this point only enhances the film's unsettling properties.\"{{sfn|Norden|Cahill|2000|p=164}}\n\n===Status as a horror film===\nThough widely considered a horror film, some critics, such as John Thomas and [[Raymond Durgnat]], have noted that ''Freaks'' does not fully embody the genre.{{sfn|Hawkins|2000|p=150}} Thomas wrote in ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' that ''Freaks'' would \"disappoint no one but the mindless children who consume most horror films...&nbsp;Certainly it is macabre...&nbsp;But the point is that ''Freaks'' is not really a horror film at all, though it contains some horrifying sequences.\"{{sfn|Thomas|1964|p=59}} Durgnat made a similar observation, writing that, like the films of [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], its shock value \"mingles with moments which seem shallow, but by the end of the film one begins to catch their mood, a calm, cold combination of [[Grand Guignol|guignol]] and eerily matter-of-fact {{sic}}.\"{{sfn|Hawkins|2000|p=150}}\n\nFilm-studies scholar Joan Hawkins describes the evolution of how the film's genre was perceived, noting that it \"started as a mainstream horror film that migrated into the [[exploitation film|exploitation]] arena before finally being recuperated as an [[avant-garde]] or art project.\"{{sfn|Hawkins|2000|p=167}} Hawkins notes that Browning inverts the audience's expectations, demonstrating that it is \"the ordinary, the apparently normal, the beautiful which horrify\u2014the monstrous and distorted which compel our respect, our sympathy, ultimately our affection.\"{{sfn|Hawkins|1996|p=267}} Smith writes that the inclusion of ''Freaks'' within the horror genre \"forces our reconsideration of the genre's status [and] challenges readings in which all horror movies are seen to use monstrous bodies to the same effects.\"{{sfn|Smith|2012|p=117}} Film theorist Eugenie Brinkema suggests that ''Freaks'' functions as a horror film \"not because Cleo is mutilated and Hercules killed, all lightning and dark shadows\u2014no, ''Freaks'' is a horror film because the gaze itself is horrific, because locating the gaze is a work in terror.\"{{sfn|Brinkema|2008|p=166}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) had purchased the rights to [[Tod Robbins]]'s short story \"[[Spurs (short story)|Spurs]]\" in the mid-1920s at [[Tod Browning]]'s urging for a reported $8,000.{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=124}} [[The Doll Family|Harry Earles]], a dwarf who had appeared in Browning's ''[[The Unholy Three (1925 film)|The Unholy Three]]'' (1925)\u2014and who would ultimately star as Hans in ''Freaks''\u2014had originally proposed the idea of making a film version of \"Spurs\" to Browning.{{sfn|Hartzman|2006|p=139}} The studio agreed to hire Browning to direct the project based on his past success at [[Universal Pictures]] with ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) and for his collaborations with [[Lon Chaney]].{{sfn|Mank|2005|p=123}}\n\nIn June 1931, MGM production supervisor [[Irving Thalberg]] offered Browning the opportunity to direct ''[[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (1932 film)|Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]]'' with [[John Barrymore]].
