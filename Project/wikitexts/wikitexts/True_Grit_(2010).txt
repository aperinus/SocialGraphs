It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Charles Portis]]' 1968 [[True Grit (novel)|novel of the same name]], starring [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn]] and [[Hailee Steinfeld]] as Mattie Ross. The film also stars [[Matt Damon]], [[Josh Brolin]], and [[Barry Pepper]].\nA [[True Grit (1969 film)|previous film adaptation]] in 1969 starred [[John Wayne]], [[Kim Darby]] and [[Glen Campbell]].\n\nFourteen-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross hires Cogburn, a boozy, trigger-happy lawman to go after an outlaw named Tom Chaney who has murdered her father. The bickering duo are accompanied on their quest by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf who has been tracking Chaney for killing a State Senator. As the three embark on a dangerous adventure, they each have their \"grit\" tested in various ways.\n\nFilming began in March 2010, and the film was officially released in the United States on December 22, 2010 after advance screenings earlier that month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcfilmsociety.org/screen.htm|title=DC Film Society: Screenings|website=www.dcfilmsociety.org}}</ref> The film opened the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 10, 2011.<ref name=\"Berlinale True Grit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_7060.html |title=Coen Brothers' True Grit to Open the 61st Berlinale |access-date=2010-12-15 |website=berlinale.de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229025237/http://www.berlinale.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/alle/Alle-Detail_7060.html |archive-date=2010-12-29 }}</ref> It was well received by critics with particular praise to its acting, directing, story, musical score and production values, with some deeming it superior to the original. It was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]], but won none: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Bridges), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Steinfeld), [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on June 7, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nThe father of fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross is murdered by hired hand Tom Chaney while on a trip to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] to purchase horses. While collecting her father's body, Mattie asks the local [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has likely fled with \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper and his gang into [[Indian Territory]], where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]]. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses the \"meanest\" of the three, [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]]. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, doubting both her grit and her wealth, but she raises the money by aggressive horse-trading.\n\n[[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a [[Texas Senate|Texas State Senator]]. LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in [[Texas]] for killing the senator. Mattie insists on traveling with Cogburn but he departs without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.\n\nAfter pursuing and catching up to the lawmen, Mattie is spanked for her perceived insolence by LaBoeuf. This, combined with a further disagreement, prompts Cogburn to end his arrangement with LaBoeuf; the latter leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. At a rural dugout, Cogburn and Mattie find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, who surrender after Cogburn shoots and injures Moon. Initially, the outlaws deny any knowledge of Ned Pepper or Chaney, but Cogburn, using Moon's worsening injury as leverage, convinces Moon to cooperate. Quincy, enraged, stabs Moon and is himself shot and killed by Cogburn. A dying Moon informs Cogburn that Pepper and his gang will arrive at the dugout later that night for supplies.\n\nCogburn and Mattie plan an ambush for the Pepper gang, but LaBoeuf arrives first and is confronted by the gang. Cogburn shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. The next morning the three set off again in pursuit of Chaney and the Pepper gang, who Cogburn believes may be hiding out in the Winding Stair Mountains. Cogburn begins to drink heavily, and after several days of searching, the three find no trace of Chaney or the Pepper gang. Cogburn declares that the trail has gone cold and quits the pursuit; LaBoeuf leaves the posse, declaring he will return to Texas.\n\nWhile retrieving water from a stream, Mattie happens upon Chaney. She shoots and wounds him, but her revolver then misfires, allowing Chaney to take her hostage. Ned Pepper convinces Cogburn to leave the area by threatening to kill Mattie. Pepper leaves Mattie alone with Chaney, ordering him not to harm her. Pepper then departs with the rest of the gang, stating he will return with a fresh horse for Chaney. Chaney, musing that Pepper has abandoned him to be captured by the law, attempts to kill Mattie. LaBoeuf, having rendezvoused with Cogburn, arrives and knocks Chaney unconscious, while Cogburn intercepts the fleeing gang in a four-to-one standoff.\n\nCogburn and the outlaws charge at each other headlong, with Cogburn killing two of the gang before his own horse is shot and falls, trapping him. As Pepper, mortally wounded, prepares to execute Cogburn, LaBoeuf shoots Pepper from 400 yards with his [[Sharps rifle]]. Chaney regains consciousness and knocks out LaBoeuf, but Mattie seizes LaBoeuf's rifle and shoots Chaney in the chest, killing him. The recoil knocks her into a pit, where she is bitten by a rattlesnake. Cogburn arrives and rescues Mattie, promising to send help for LaBoeuf before departing with Mattie to reach a doctor. After their horse collapses from exhaustion, Cogburn carries a delirious Mattie on foot to reach help. Mattie's arm is ultimately amputated, and although Cogburn stays with her until she is out of danger, he is gone by the time she regains consciousness.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Mattie receives a letter from Cogburn inviting her to attend a traveling [[Wild West shows|Wild West show]] in which he is performing. When she arrives at the show site, she learns that Cogburn died three days earlier. She has his body moved to her family cemetery and stands over the grave, reflecting on this decision, her choice not to marry, and her hope of hearing from LaBoeuf again if he is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:HaileeSteinfeldJan11 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Hailee Steinfeld]] was cast as Mattie Ross from among 15,000 applicants.]]\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]]\n* [[Hailee Steinfeld]] as Mattie Ross\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] LaBoeuf\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Tom Chaney\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Moon (the Kid)\n* Bruce Green as Harold Parmalee\n* [[Ed Corbin|Ed Lee Corbin]] as Bear Man (Dr. Forrester)\n* Roy Lee Jones as Yarnell Poindexter\n* [[Paul Rae]] as Emmett Quincy\n* [[Nicholas Sadler]] as Sullivan\n* [[Dakin Matthews]] as Colonel Stonehill\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] and Ruth Morris as 40-year-old Mattie\n* [[Leon Russom]] as Sheriff\n* Jake Walker as Judge [[Isaac Charles Parker]]\n* Don Pirl as [[Cole Younger]]\n* [[Jarlath Conroy]] as the Undertaker\n* [[J.

The book is entirely in the voice of the 14-year-old girl. That sort of tips the feeling of it over a certain way. I think [the book is] much funnier than the movie was so I think, unfortunately, they lost a lot of humor in both the situations and in her voice. It also ends differently than the movie did. You see the main character \u2013 the little girl \u2013 25 years later when she's an adult. Another way in which it's a little bit different from the movie \u2013 and maybe this is just because of the time the movie was made \u2013 is that it's a lot tougher and more violent than the movie reflects. Which is part of what's interesting about it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039283p1.html|title=True Grit Exclusive&nbsp;\u2013 Movies News at IGN|publisher=IGN|access-date=February 16, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016184724/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039283p1.html|archive-date=October 16, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMattie Ross \"is a pill\", said Ethan Coen in a December 2010 interview, \"but there is something deeply admirable about her in the book that we were drawn to\", including the [[Presbyterian]]-[[Protestant ethic]] so strongly imbued in a 14-year-old girl. Joel Coen said that the brothers did not want to \"mess around with what we thought was a very compelling story and character\". The film's producer, [[Scott Rudin]], said that the Coens had taken a \"formal, reverent approach\" to the Western genre, with its emphasis on adventure and quest. \"The patois of the characters, the love of language that permeates the whole film, makes it very much of a piece with their other films, but it is the least ironic in many regards\".<ref name=\"NYT 10-10-10\" />\n\nNevertheless, there are subtle ways in which the film adaptation differs from the original novel. This is particularly evident in the negotiation scene between Mattie and her father's undertaker. In the film, Mattie bargains over her father's casket and proceeds to spend the night among the corpses to avoid paying for the boardinghouse. This scene is, in fact, nonexistent in the novel, where Mattie is depicted as refusing to bargain over her father's body, and never entertains the thought of sleeping among the corpses.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/jpcu.12262|title = \"Why do You Think I am Paying You if Not to Have My Way?\" Genre Complications in the Free-Market Critiques of Fictional and Filmed Versions of ''True'' Grit|journal = The Journal of Popular Culture|volume = 48|issue = 2|pages = 355\u2013370|year = 2015|last1 = Turner|first1 = Ralph Lamar}}</ref>\n\nOpen casting sessions were held in [[Texas]] in November 2009 for the role of Mattie Ross.
