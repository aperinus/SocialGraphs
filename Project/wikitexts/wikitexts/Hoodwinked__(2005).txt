It retells the folktale ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' as a [[police procedural]], using backstories to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with [[Kanbar Entertainment]], directed and written by [[Cory Edwards]] along with [[Todd Edwards (film writer)|Todd Edwards]], and [[Tony Leech]], and produced by [[Katie Hooten]], [[Maurice Kanbar]], [[David K. Lovegren]], [[Sue Bea Montgomery]], and [[Preston Stutzman]]. The film features the voices of <!-- PER Starring role. Billing on main part of poster.

Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's low budget, its animation was produced in the [[Philippines]], with a less realistic design inspired by [[stop motion]] films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful ''[[Shrek franchise|Shrek]]'' series, which accentuated the [[fairy tale parody]] genre of which ''Hoodwinked!'' is a part. ''Hoodwinked!'', however, intentionally deviated from the ''Shrek'' series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre.\n\nThe film was released by [[The Weinstein Company]] in Los Angeles, California, on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. Because of this, it is regarded as the most profitable animated film ever made. A sequel, ''[[Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil]]'', directed by [[Mike Disa]]. It was created by an entirely different team, even though the original draft of the screenplay was written by the Edwards brothers and Leech. It was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nLittle Red Riding Hood arrives at her grandmother's house, where the Big Bad Wolf has disguised himself as Red's Granny. The Wolf attacks Red. Granny, who has been tied up, jumps out of a closet just as ax-wielding woodsman Kirk bursts through the window. The police arrive, and Detective Nicky Flippers questions everyone about the incident.\n\nLittle Red, actually named Red Puckett, explains she was delivering goodies for her grandmother's business when she discovered a threat from the Goody Bandit, who has been stealing recipes. Red had set out to take the Puckett family recipes to Granny's mountaintop home. She fell out of bunny Boingo's cable car and encountered the Wolf, who asked her suspicious questions. Red then met the old singing goat Japeth, who accompanied her to Granny's house where she found the Wolf waiting in ambush.\n\nThe Wolf reveals that he is an investigative reporter on the trail of the Goody Bandit, and had reason to believe Red and Granny were the culprits. The Wolf and his hyperactive squirrel assistant Twitchy confronted Red in hope of solving the Goody Bandit mystery. When they failed to detain Red, they made haste for Granny's house, arriving ahead of Red using a shortcut known to Boingo. They found Granny already tied up in the closet. The Wolf disguised himself as Granny, planning to trick Red into revealing the truth about the Goody Bandit.\n\nKirk explains his appearance at Granny's house was pure happenstance; he is an aspiring actor trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he was consoled by Boingo and then received a callback for the commercial. He spent the rest of the day getting into character by chopping trees, until at sunset a tree collapsed and pushed him through the window of Granny's home.\n\nThe investigation turns to Granny, who is secretly an extreme sports enthusiast. Earlier that day she had competed in a ski race, with Boingo watching as a fan. Granny had been attacked by the opposing team before winning the race. She learned that the Goody Bandit hired the team to eliminate her. She says that while parachuting back home, she got tangled in the parachute strings, which snagged on her ceiling fan and threw her into the closet.\n\nFeeling betrayed by Granny's secrecy, Red wanders off alone. Flippers deduces that Boingo had been present in all four stories and must be the Goody Bandit. Red notices Boingo sneaking in and stealing the Puckett family recipes. She follows him to his cable car station hideout where she confronts him but is overpowered and captured. The police pursue Boingo in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red: he plans to add addictive \"Boingonium\" to the recipes then bulldoze the forest for a Boingo-themed corporate empire.\n\nThe Wolf and Kirk distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into Boingo's lair, but they are all found out. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives. Granny goes after Red, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red frees herself and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been redirected by Twitchy, wait at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen.\n\nKirk finds success in a yodeling troupe, while Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Flippers to join the Happily Ever After Agency crime-solving organization.\n\n==Voice Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Red Puckett\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Abigail \"Granny\" Puckett\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as Kirk the Woodsman\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Wolf W.

The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time.<ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 4\"/> Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist [[Prana Studios]] in Mumbai, India to perform [[lighting]] and [[compositing]].<ref name=\"creativeplanetnetwork\"/>\n\nThe filmmakers found that the most difficult aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation.<ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 2\"/><ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 3\"/> Todd Edwards explained that \"it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 things that I would like to change in this shot. I have the time and the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do\".<ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 3\"/> Another obstacle during the film's production, according to Cory Edwards, was putting fur on the animal characters. It took the filmmakers three and a half years to crack the code to do so perfectly, forcing themselves to redesign and reanimate several aspects.<ref name=\"comingsoon\" />\n\nKnowing that they could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead designed to imitate the look of [[stop motion]]. Cory Edwards cited [[Rankin-Bass]] as an inspiration and explained, \"If we approach our look like that\u2014photographed miniatures in stop motion\u2014and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures.\"<ref name=\"Anatomy p. 3\"/> Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' with the simple, but beloved puppet character [[Kermit the Frog]] to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.<ref name=\"chattaway\"/>\n\nDistancing the film from what producer Preston Stutzman called the \"candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world[s]\" of other CG animated films, an attempt was made to bring an organic look to the film, and \u201cdirt\u201d was rubbed into the colors.<ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 5\"/> ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that \"CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but ''Hoodwinked'' takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon.\"<ref name=\"Dr. Toon p. 4\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's score was composed by [[John Mark Painter]], who along with his wife Fleming McWilliams, constituted the [[Rock music|rock]] duo [[Fleming and John]] in the 1990s. The Edwards brothers were fans of the group and first met Painter while Cory was performing in an animated film on which Painter served as the composer.<ref name=\"chattaway\"/> The score was inspired by music from the 1960s and the soundtracks to ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', and ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' have been cited as influences, as well as the works of [[Henry Mancini]].<ref name=\"DVD commentary Score\">{{cite video\n| people =Edwards, Cory; Edwards, Todd; Leech, Tony\n| date =May 2, 2006\n| title = Hoodwinked!

Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as [[Albert Brooks]], but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed a large part of the film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting, however, saying, \"At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it.
