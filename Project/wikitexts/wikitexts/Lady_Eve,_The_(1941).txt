Along with her equally larcenous father, \"Colonel\" Harrington, and his partner Gerald, she is out to fleece rich, naive Charles Pike, the heir to the Pike Ale (\"The Ale That Won for Yale\") fortune, on an ocean liner. Charles is a woman-shy [[Ophiology|snake expert]] just returning from a year-long expedition up the Amazon. The young women aboard the ship compete for his attention, but Charles is more concerned with reading about snakes.\n\nJean contrives a way to meet Charles, who is smitten with her. After Jean runs off, terrified by a real snake that Charles has brought on board, the two share a steamy scene in her cabin.\n\nCharles's minder Muggsy suspects that Jean is a trickster looking to steal from Charles, but Charles refuses to believe him. However, despite the con, Jean falls in love with Charles and shields him from her [[card sharp]] father. Muggsy discovers the truth and presents proof to Charlie, who dumps Jean.\n\nFurious at being scorned, Jean soon re-enters Charles's life masquerading as the posh Lady Eve Sidwich, niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith, another con man who has been swindling the rich of Connecticut. Jean takes on an English accent, determined to torment Charles mercilessly, as she explains, \"I've got some unfinished business with him\u2014I need him like the axe needs the turkey.\"\n\nWhen Charles meets Jean as Lady Eve, he is so bewildered at her resemblance to the Jean that he knew that he constantly trips and falls over himself. Although Muggsy tries to convince him that \"she's the same dame,\" Charles reasons that Jean would not come close to his home without at least disguising herself. Then, after Sir Keith feeds him a story that the Lady Eve is Jean's sister, Charles accepts the resemblance. After a brief courtship they marry, right on Jean's schedule. And just as she had planned, on the train to their honeymoon Eve begins to confess her past, continuously dropping names of many old boyfriends and lovers. A disgusted Charles jumps off the train.\n\nJean's con team urges her to close the deal by pursuing a huge divorce settlement, but she tells Charles' father on the phone that she wants no money, but only wants Charles to tell her that their marriage is over in person. Charles refuses. Jean is then told by Charles' father that Charles is departing on another ocean voyage. She arranges passage for herself and her father, and then schemes to happen upon Charles, just as they had met before. Charles is overjoyed to see the real Jean again, and they dash to her cabin, where they mutually affirm their love for each other. Charles confesses that he is married, and Jean replies, \"So am I, darling.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Jean Harrington, aka Lady Eve Sidwich\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Charles Poncefort Pike (Hopsie)\n* [[Charles Coburn]] as \"Colonel\" Harrington\n* [[Eugene Pallette]] as Horace Pike\n* [[William Demarest]] as Muggsy, aka Ambrose Murgatroyd\n* [[Eric Blore]] as Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith\n* [[Melville Cooper]] as Gerald\n* [[Janet Beecher]] as Janet Pike\n* [[Martha O'Driscoll]] as Martha, Pike's maid\n* [[Robert Greig]] as Burrows, Pike's butler\n* Dora Clement as Gertrude\n* [[Luis Alberni]] as Emile, Pike's chef\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve trailer.png|right|thumb|Henry Fonda from a trailer for ''The Lady Eve'']]\n''The Lady Eve'' was loosely based on a 19-page story by Monckton Hoffe called \"Two Bad Hats,\" which was also the working title for the film.

Sturges and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Albert Lewin]] had some written disagreement in 1939 about the development of the script. Lewin wrote to Sturges, \"[T]he first two-thirds of the script, in spite of the high quality of your jokes, will require an almost one hundred percent rewrite.\" Sturges objected, and eventually Lewin acceded, writing, \"Follow your witty nose, my boy; it will lead you and me and Paramount to the Elysian pastures of popular entertainment.\"<ref name=\"tcmarticles\">Miller, Frank and Jeff Stafford.

Most of the characters have two names (Charles is Hopsie, Jean is Eve Sidwich); this lack of recognition sets the stage for the storyline.
