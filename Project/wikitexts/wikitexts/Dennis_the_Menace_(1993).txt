It was directed by [[Nick Castle]] and written and coproduced by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]] label. It concerns the misadventures of a mischievous child ([[Mason Gamble]]) who wreaks havoc on his next door neighbor, George Wilson ([[Walter Matthau]]), usually hangs out with his friends, Joey McDonald (Kellen Hathaway) and Margaret Wade (Amy Sakasitz), and is followed everywhere by his dog, Ruff. It also features a cameo appearance by [[Jeannie Russell]] who was a cast member on the original television show.\n\nReleased on June 25, 1993, the film was a commercial success, grossing $117.2 million on a $35 million budget despite receiving negative reviews from critics. A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] called ''[[Dennis the Menace Strikes Again]]'' was later released in 1998 without the cast from this film. A second direct-to-video sequel called ''A Dennis the Menace Christmas'' was released in 2007 with a different cast from both this film and the second one.\n\n==Plot==\nFive-year-old Dennis Mitchell is a constant source of mischief, especially to his retired next door neighbor George Wilson. George pretends to be asleep to avoid Dennis, who mistakes this for illness and shoots an aspirin into George\u2019s mouth with a slingshot. Dennis' parents, Henry and Alice, try to discipline him as they get ready for work, and leave him with his friend, Joey McDonald, at the home of their classmate Margaret Wade, whom they dislike. As the three children fix up an abandoned treehouse in the woods, itinerant criminal Switchblade Sam arrives in town.\n\nVacuuming up spilt paint in the garage, Dennis inadvertently shoots a glob of it onto George\u2019s barbecue grill; tasting it, he suspects Dennis. The Mitchells leave Dennis with a teenage babysitter named Polly, who invites her boyfriend, Mickey, over. Sneaking outside, Dennis pranks them by [[Knock, Knock, Ginger|ringing the doorbell and hiding]] until Mickey tapes a thumbtack to it. George investigates the vacuum in the Mitchells' garage and accidentally shoots himself in the gonads with a golf ball. Hoping to confront the Mitchells, he pricks his thumb on the tack; mistaking him for the prankster, Polly and Mickey douse him with water and flour. Switchblade Sam commits a string of robberies throughout town, and is noticed by Chief Bennett.\n\nBringing the sleeping George an apology card, Dennis plays with his dentures, loses the two front teeth, and replaces them with [[Chiclets]] just before he has his picture taken for the local newspaper. Henry and Alice both leave on business trips, but are unable to find anyone willing to babysit Dennis. George's wife, Martha, agrees to let him stay with them, happy to treat him as the child they never had. George is infuriated by slipping in Dennis' spilt bath water, and discovering Dennis has replaced his nasal spray with mouthwash and the latter with toilet cleanser. Dennis lets his dog, Ruff, inside the Wilsons\u2019 house, leading George to mistake him for Martha in the dark living room. In the attic, Dennis' carelessness causes George to slip on mothballs and nearly crushes him with a canoe which contains the garden lanterns he's looking for.\n\nGeorge has been chosen to host his garden club's \"Summer Floraganza\", having spent almost forty years growing a rare orchid that will finally bloom that night. During the party, Dennis presses the garage door button, and it opens and upends the entire dessert table, and is angrily sent inside. While the Wilsons and their guests await the flower\u2019s nocturnal display, Switchblade Sam robs the house, stealing George\u2019s antique coin collection. Dennis alerts George, distracting everyone from the flower's brief blooming, and it dies afterward. Furious and unaware that he has been robbed, George chastises Dennis, who flees to the woods in sadness and is caught by Switchblade Sam. Henry and Alice arrive home to learn he has disappeared, prompting a town-wide search, and even a guilt-ridden George sets out to find him after realizing that he was telling the truth about the robbery.\n\nSwitchblade Sam prepares to leave town with Dennis as an unsuspecting hostage. Showing him the proper way to tie him up, Dennis handcuffs him, loses the key, unintentionally bludgeons him, and sets him on fire. Just as Dennis discovers George\u2019s stolen coins and realizes Switchblade Sam is a thief, Switchblade Sam attempts to stab him but is snared in a rope caught by a passing train. The next morning, Dennis returns home with the captured Switchblade Sam and George's recovered coins, to the relief of George and the entire neighborhood. Switchblade Sam is arrested, and Dennis na\u00efvely returns his knife and he attempts to stab him with it, but Chief Bennett closes the police car door on his hand, causing him to drop the knife down a storm drain and wince in pain before being driven away.\n\nDennis and George make amends, and Alice mentions that she can bring Dennis to work with her as her office now has a day care center. George insists he would be happy to watch Dennis himself, just as Dennis accidentally flings a flaming marshmallow onto his forehead. During the closing credits, Dennis gets his mother's condescending coworker, Andrea, caught in the office copy machine.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mason Gamble]] as [[Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics)#Characters and setting|Dennis Mitchell]]\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as George Wilson\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Martha Wilson\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Switchblade Sam\n* [[Lea Thompson]] as Alice Mitchell\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Henry Mitchell\n* Amy Sakasitz as Margaret Wade\n* Kellen Hathaway as Joey McDonald\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Chief Bennett\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Polly\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Mickey\n* Hank Johnston as Gunther Beckman\n* [[Melinda Mullins]] as Andrea\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Edith Butterwell\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Edward Little\n* [[Arnold Stang]] as Photographer\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Boss (only cameo shot at meeting)\n* [[Jeannie Russell]] as Neighbor\n\n==Production==\nMason Gamble won the role of Dennis Mitchell after beating out a reported 20,000 other children who had auditioned for it.<ref>{{cite book|title=''TV Guide'' September 17\u201323, 1994. pg. 23}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered on June 25, 1993. It was known simply as ''Dennis'' in the United Kingdom in order to avoid confusion with an unrelated British comic strip, also called \"[[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]]\", which also debuted in 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/dennis-1993 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709192111/https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/dennis-1993 |archive-date=2019-07-09 |title=DENNIS {{!}} British Board of Film Classification}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's music was composed by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who was [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' first and only choice to write the score for it. The short-lived Big Screen Records label released an album of Goldsmith's score alongside the film in July 1993; La-La Land Records issued the complete score in April 2014 as part of their Expanded Archival Collection on [[Warner Bros.]] titles.\n\nAdditionally, three old-time pop hits were featured in the film: \"[[Don't Hang Up (song)|Don't Hang Up]]\" by [[The Orlons]], \"Whatcha Know Joe\" by [[Jo Stafford]] (from the 1963 album, ''[[Getting Sentimental over Tommy Dorsey]]'') and \"[[A String of Pearls (song)|A String of Pearls]]\" by [[Glenn Miller]].\n\n===Home media===\n\nOn November 16, 1993, Warner Home Video released the film on VHS and LaserDisc. It was released on DVD January 28, 2003, and was re-released on a double feature DVD with ''[[Dennis the Menace Strikes Again]]'' on August 30, 2005.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a success at the box office. Against a $35 million budget, it grossed $51.3 million domestically and a further $66 million overseas to a total of $117.3 million worldwide,<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Park' Paces Summer Moviegoing|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-29/entertainment/ca-8224_1_jurassic-park|access-date=June 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= July Fourth Weekend Sets Off Box-Office Boom : Movies: 'The Firm,' with $31.5 million for the weekend, leads the way.

The movie, directed by Nick Castle from Hughes\u2019 script, is still caught up in that warp (with a few concessions, like the fact that both Henry and Alice now work). This means that Dennis doesn\u2019t get into any high-tech shenanigans. No [[computers]], no [[video games]], no [[laser guns]]. The film pretty much sticks to the old-fashioned basics [and] since this Dennis is only 5 years old, perhaps the decision was made to keep things slapstick-simple. Or could it be that the filmmakers regard Dennis as a \u201cclassic\"\u2014like, say, [[Huck Finn]] or [[Penrod]]?\n\nThis sort of misplaced reverence probably won\u2019t do much for young audiences accustomed to a little more zap and bounce in their heroes. Parents might be grateful, though. The shenanigans in \"Dennis the Menace\" are mostly so mildly conceived and executed that kids aren\u2019t likely to try them out on their families when they get home from the theater. Mom and Dad won\u2019t have to lock up the frying pans.\n\nIf Hughes was expecting this film to create another pipsqueak franchise for him, he may have miscalculated. \"Dennis the Menace\" seems more like a rest period in between Culkin-ized tantrums. It\u2019s not much\u2014just one goofy little foul-up after another\u2014but its lack of crassness is rather sweet.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : No Menace, but No Macaulay Either : In the Era of 'Home Alone,' 'Dennis' Is Agreeably Low-Key|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-25/entertainment/ca-7057_1_dennis-mitchell|access-date=June 1, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"There's a lot to like in ''Dennis the Menace''.

It included stages based on Mr. Wilsons' house, the great outdoors, and a [[mechanical room|boiler room]] among others.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1990s}}\n* {{IMDb title|0106701|Dennis the Menace}}\n* {{amg movie|13227}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=18369}}\n* {{Mojo title|dennisthemenace|Dennis the Menace}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|dennis_the_menace|Dennis the Menace}}\n\n{{Dennis the Menace}}\n{{Nick Castle}}\n{{John Hughes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dennis The Menace (Film)}}\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1993 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about pranks]]\n[[Category:Films based on American comics]]\n[[Category:Films based on comic strips]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nick Castle]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Hughes (filmmaker)]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Hughes (filmmaker)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on comics]]\n[[Category:Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics) films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
