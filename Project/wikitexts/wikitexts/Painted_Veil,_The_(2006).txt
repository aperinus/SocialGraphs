The screenplay by [[Ron Nyswaner]] is based on the 1925 [[The Painted Veil (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. [[Edward Norton]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Toby Jones]], [[Anthony Wong Chau Sang]] and [[Liev Schreiber]] appear in the leading roles.\n\nThis is the third [[film adaptation]] of the Maugham book, following [[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|a 1934 film]] starring [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Herbert Marshall]] and a 1957 version called ''[[The Seventh Sin]]'' with [[Bill Travers]] and [[Eleanor Parker]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn a brief trip to [[London]] in the early 1920s, earnest and bookish [[Microbiology|bacteriologist]] Walter Fane is dazzled by Kitty Garstin, a London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple [[honeymoon]] in [[Venice]]. They travel to Walter's medical post in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], where he is stationed in a government lab studying [[infectious diseases]]. They are ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriate community.\n\nShe meets Charles Townsend, a married British vice consul, and they have an affair. When Walter finds out, he threatens divorce for adultery unless she accompanies him to a village in a remote area of [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]] where he has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked [[cholera]] [[epidemic]]. Kitty begs for a quiet divorce, which he initially refuses, but later says only if Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy to marry her. Charles declines to accept, despite earlier claiming his love for Kitty.\n\nThe couple embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey to the mountainous inland region, which is considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she discovers they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from the town. Their cheerful neighbor Waddington is a British deputy commissioner living in relative opulence with Wan Xi,, a young Chinese woman.\n\nWalter and Kitty barely speak. Except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her during unrest due to the Chinese [[Warlord Era|civil war]], she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. She begins to see him differently, that he can be unselfish and caring. When he sees her with the children, he also realizes she is not as shallow and selfish as he had thought. Their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter \u2013 in love with Kitty again \u2013 assures her it doesn't matter.\n\nThe cholera epidemic takes many victims. Just as Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control \u2013 due to his creating a system of aqueducts to transport clean water \u2013 cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere arrive in the area, and Walter sets up a camp for them outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.\n\nFive years later, Kitty is seen in London, well-dressed and apparently happy, shopping with her young son, Walter. They are picking flowers for their visit to Walter's grandfather. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father.\n\nKitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies: \"No one important, darling\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Walter Fane\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Kitty Garstin Fane\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Waddington\n* [[Diana Rigg]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as Colonel Yu\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Charles Townsend\n* Juliet Howland as Dorothy Townsend\n* [[Alan David (actor)|Alan David]] as Mr. Garstin\n* [[Maggie Steed]] as Mrs. Garstin\n* [[Cheng Sihan]] as Warlord Kwei\n* Lucy Voller as Doris Garstin\n* Marie-Laure Descoureaux as Sister St. Joseph\n* [[Zoe Telford]] as Leona\n* [[L\u00fc Yan (model)|L\u00fc Yan]] as Wan Xi\n* [[Xia Yu (actor)|Xia Yu]] as Wu Lien\n* Feng Li as Song Qing\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nPrior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for ''The Painted Veil''. The script was frequently redrafted, as it was intended both to be close to the source material, and to take liberties with the source material, specifically to create a [[feminism|feminist]] version. Actor [[Edward Norton]] became involved with the project in 1999.<ref name=\"encore\">{{cite news |author=McGrath |first=Charles |date=2006-12-10 |title=Another Encore for the Most Adaptable of Authors |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/movies/another-encore-for-the-most-adaptable-of-authors.html |access-date=2022-09-24}}</ref>  Norton discussed why he liked the project,\n<blockquote>\"It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings.\"<ref name=\"passion\">{{cite news |author=Armour |first=Terry |date=2006-12-30 |title=Edward Norton concentrates his passion on performing |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe suggested casting [[Naomi Watts]] for the role of Kitty, but this did not take place until after she proved herself a bankable star with her performances in ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003). When Watts joined the project, she recommended director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]], with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film ''[[We Don't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The director's expertise with that work convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in ''The Painted Veil''.<ref name=encore/>\n\nThe project began development at producers [[Bob Yari]] and [[Mark Gordon (film)|Mark Gordon]]'s Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start [[Warner Independent Pictures]], he took the project with him.  Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by [[Warner Bros.]] production president Jeff Robinov. This was said to contribute to the film's [[#Marketing|marketing difficulties]].<ref name=\"trying\">{{cite news |author=Horn |first=John |date=2006-12-18 |title='Veil' in need of a lift |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-dec-18-et-painted18-story.html |access-date=2022-09-24}}</ref>\n\nYari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for ''The Painted Veil''. When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, its representatives were unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to 38 seconds.<ref name=trying/>\n\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[Ron Nyswaner]] and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film.  They considered the 1925 novel by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] to be one-dimensional. Norton expanded the character of Walter Fane, giving him an enhanced role.  He also had Walter make peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other.  Norton explained, \"I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it.  We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel.\"  Norton described the novel as \"almost unremittingly bleak\" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change.  The actor said of his changes, \"I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful.\"<ref name=encore/>  Norton considered ''The Painted Veil'' to be in the spirit of such films as ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985) and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996), seeing it as \"rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other\".<ref name=passion/>\n\nDirector [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at [[Yale University]], agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian [[Jonathan Spence]]'s 1969 book ''To Change China'', which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton said that the character Walter Fane served as \"the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism.\" He said that Fane was confused when the Chinese were not grateful for his help, saying, \"Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed.\"<ref name=encore/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place on location in [[Shanghai, China]] and in a southern Chinese rural village. The director did not want to build a set for the village beset by cholera, and instead sought a rural area in China. He came across the old quarter of [[Huangyao]] (\u9ec4\u59da\u53e4\u9547, ''hu\u00e1ngy\u00e1o g\u01d4zh\u00e8n'') in [[Guangxi]] Zhuang Autonomous Region, which then served as the location for the village scenes. The director described the location, \"Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time.\" According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script.<ref name=encore/>\n\nMost of the film was shot in [[Guangxi]]. Director John Curran said, \"We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn\u2019t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]] or [[Italy]].\" Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate. They altered the story to set the plot in Shanghai; the crew shot \"Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\n===Music===\nThe official [[The Painted Veil (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]], and features [[Lang Lang]] on the piano.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Painted Veil (2006) |url=http://www.soundtrackinfo.com/title/tracks.asp?paintedveil |access-date=2011-01-06 |publisher=the SoundtrackINFO Project}}</ref>\n\n# \"The Painted Veil\"\n# \"Gnossienne No 1\" (composed by [[Erik Satie]])\n# \"Colony Club\"\n# \"River Waltz\"\n# \"Kitty's Theme\"\n# \"Death Convoy\"\n# \"The Water Wheel\"\n# \"The Lovers\"\n# \"Promenade\"\n# \"Kitty's Journey\"\n# \"The Deal\"\n# \"Walter's Mission\"\n# \"The Convent\"\n# \"River Waltz\"\n# \"Morning Tears\"\n# \"Cholera\"\n# \"The End of Love\"\n# \"The Funeral\"\n# \"From Shanghai to London\"\n\nThere are also three songs not listed on the official soundtrack.

This is heard after the funeral of Dr. Fane.\n# \"Reste Avec Moi\" (French translation of \"Abide with Me\", with words by Henry Lyte, Music by William Monk, Arranged by Evan Chen)\n\n==Marketing==\nThe film's post-production schedule was slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November. According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of [[Warner Independent Pictures]], the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so ''The Painted Veil'' was unable to get first priority in processing. When ''The Painted Veil'' had a limited release in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006 in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. Half a dozen people associated with the film complained that [[Warner Independent Pictures]] conduct of the marketing campaign was failing to gain the film enough attention. Film critic [[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote, \"Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops.\"<ref name=trying/>\n\nThe firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of ''The Painted Veil'' and who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]] said to Warner Independent, \"Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed.\"<ref name=trying/> Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. ''The Painted Veil'' eventually expanded to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent hosted 80 screenings of ''The Painted Veil'' in Los Angeles, New York, [[San Francisco]], and [[London]], as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.<ref name=trying/>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Painted Veil'' initially had a [[limited release]] in four theaters in the [[United States]] on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend.  The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and [[Canada]], peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=paintedveil.htm | title=The Painted Veil (2006) - Weekend Box Office Results | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=2007-12-05 }}</ref> ''The Painted Veil'' ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $18,850,360 in other territories for a worldwide total of $26,910,847.<ref name=\"Mojo\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has received an approval rating of 74% based on 143 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/painted_veil/ | title=The Painted Veil | website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher= Fandango Media | access-date=2007-12-05 }}</ref>  On [[Metacritic]], the film has received a score of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-painted-veil | title=Painted Veil, The (2006): Reviews | website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher= CBS Interactive | access-date=2022-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the story seems\n<blockquote>\"so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn\u2019t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn\u2019t know Maugham from [[Edna Ferber]]. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham\u2019s distaff [[bildungsroman]] into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character\u2019s emotional thaw and Kitty\u2019s predicament all the more poignant.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |date=2006-12-20 |title=A Plague Infects the Land, as Passion Vexes Hearts |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/movies/20veil.html |access-date=2010-10-08 |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCarina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film \"has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary [[E.M.

It's impeccable, but leaves you cold.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Chocano |first=Carina |date=2006-12-20 |title='The Painted Veil' |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-painted20dec20,0,7424259.story |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617041913/http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-painted20dec20,0,7424259.story |archive-date=June 17, 2007 |access-date=2010-10-08 |website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and commented,\n<blockquote>\"If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a [[period piece]] propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . ''The Painted Veil'' has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story.

All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . .
