It is the second installment in the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]] and set two years after the first film; the plot follows [[Chucky (character)|Charles Lee Ray]] (better known as Chucky) continuing his pursuit for [[Andy Barclay]], who was placed in foster care, and transferring his soul into him after being [[Resurrection|resurrected]]. [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] and [[Brad Dourif]] reprised their roles while [[Christine Elise]], [[Jenny Agutter]], [[Gerrit Graham]] and [[Grace Zabriskie]] joined the cast.\n\n''Child's Play 2'' was released on November 9, 1990, exactly two years after the first film was released, and grossed over $35 million on a budget of $13 million. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Child's Play 3]]'', 9 months later.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years after [[Child's Play (1988 film)|the first film]], the Play Pals Corporation, which produces the Good Guy dolls, recovers from the negative publicity and reassembles [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] to reassure its [[Shareholder|stockholders]] that there was nothing actually wrong with the doll. During the process, a power surge electrocutes one of the [[assembly line]] workers. Mr. Sullivan, the executive of the company, orders his assistant Mattson to cover up the accident and dispose of Chucky, unaware that he has been revived.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Andy Barclay]], now eight years old, has been in [[foster care]] ever since the murders, his mother having been institutionalized for backing up Andy's story about the killer doll. Andy goes to live with foster parents Phil and Joanne Simpson, who are also fostering [[Kyle (Child's Play)|Kyle]], a cynical, street smart teenage girl. Chucky discovers Andy's whereabouts by using Mattson's car phone to call Grace Poole, the manager of Andy's foster center, before [[Asphyxia|suffocating]] Mattson with a plastic bag.\n\nChucky invades the home by destroying and burying another Good Guy doll called \"Tommy\" and replacing it with himself. Andy begins to bond with Kyle after the two are punished for an [[heirloom]] Chucky destroyed. That night, Chucky ties Andy to his bed and reveals himself, but Kyle enters the room before he can complete the voodoo chant to possess him. Kyle doesn't believe Andy's assertions about Chucky while Phil and Joanne blame Kyle and throw Chucky in the [[basement]]. Chucky realizes that he is becoming human after suffering a [[nosebleed]]. The next day, Chucky secretly follows Andy to school and [[Vandalism|defaces]] his homework, resulting in Andy being assigned detention. Chucky kills Andy's teacher Miss Kettlewell by stabbing her with a pump and then beating her to death with a [[Meterstick|yardstick]], but Andy manages to escape. Andy tries to warn his foster parents about Chucky, but Phil refuses to believe him and considers returning him to the foster center.\n\nThat night, Andy sneaks into the basement to destroy Chucky with an [[electric knife]], but the doll overpowers him. When Phil arrives to investigate the commotion, Chucky trips him, causing Phil to fall and break his neck. Joanne immediately blames Andy and sends him back to the foster center. Kyle discovers \"Tommy\" buried outside and realizes Andy was telling the truth all along. She rushes to warn Joanne, only to discover that Chucky has already killed her. Chucky ambushes Kyle and forces her to drive him to the foster center. There, Chucky clears the building by pulling the [[Fire alarm system|fire alarm]]. He stabs Grace to death and forces Andy to take him to the Play Pals factory to perform the voodoo chant. Kyle pursues them to the factory but is unable to find them before Chucky knocks Andy unconscious and completes the ritual.\n\nHowever, the spell fails as Chucky has spent too much time in his doll body and is now permanently trapped. Infuriated, Chucky chases Andy and Kyle through the factory, intent on killing them both. Kyle slams a gate shut on Chucky's hand, which Chucky tears off and replaces with a makeshift blade. After Chucky murders a factory technician, Kyle and Andy manage to trap him in a giant assembly line machine that mutilates his body, appearing to kill him. However, Chucky manages to escape the machine by cutting off his own legs and attacks again, knocking out Kyle. Andy is able to defeat him a second time by opening a valve, showering Chucky with a lethal amount of [[Plastic|hot molten plastic]]. After saving the unconscious Kyle from a conveyor belt, the two approach the half-melted Chucky, who suddenly attacks them again.\n\nDuring the struggle, Kyle shoves a [[High-pressure area|high-pressure air hose]] into his mouth, inflating his head until it [[Explosion|explodes]], appearing to kill and [[Decapitation|decapitate]] him. Andy and Kyle exit the factory, unsure of where to go.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] as [[Andy Barclay]]\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]\n** [[Ed Gale]] (in-suit performer)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihorror.com/know-chucky-played-real-person-exclusive-interview-ed-gale/|title=Chucky Was Played by a Real Person Exclusive Interview with Ed Gale|date=January 29, 2015|website=iHorror &#124; Horror News and Movie Reviews}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3554839/came-80s-hidey-ho-chucky-childs-play/|title=[It Came From the \u201880s] How Actors and Effects Made a Killer Doll a Horror Icon in \u2018Child\u2019s Play\u2019|first=Meagan|last=Navarro|date=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Christine Elise McCarthy|Christine Elise]] as [[Kyle (Child's Play)|Kyle]]\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Joanne Simpson\n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Phil Simpson\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Grace Poole\n* [[Peter Haskell]] as Haskell Sullivan\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Elizabeth Kettlewell\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Mattson\n* [[Edan Gross]] as Tommy Doll\n* [[Charles Meshack]] as Van Driver\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[United Artists]] purchased the script to the original ''Child's Play'' partially because UA President Tony Thomopoulis and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA Communications]] Chairman [[Lee Rich]] believed that it had the potential for multiple sequels.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/58582-CHILDS-PLAY?sid=bf89618f-b794-4364-a94b-994bed6f942a&sr=10.089998&cp=1&pos=0|access-date=2021-05-29|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> The sequel was in pre-production and was set to begin filming on October 15, 1989, when UA President Richard Berger told producer [[David Kirschner]] that the film was put on hold as the studio was about to be acquired by the Australian group [[Qintex]], whose director [[Christopher Skase]] intended to ban the studio from producing horror films.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], The Price Company, [[Carolco]], [[New Line Cinema]], [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], and [[Universal Pictures]] expressed interest in picking up the [[film rights]] to the series and sequel, with Universal winning the rights bid, after [[Steven Spielberg]] assisted Universal's [[Sidney Sheinberg|Sid Sheinberg]] in convincing Kirschner to accept it.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-21/entertainment/ca-725_1_child-s-play-ii | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=New UA Team Won't Touch 'Child's Play II' | date=1989-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/02/18/chucky-childs-play/|title=You only Chucky twice: The strange story behind the two Child's Play franchises|last=Collis|first=Clark|date=February 18, 2019|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOriginally the film was intended to open with a courtroom scene of a [[jury]] sentencing Karen Barclay to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] for insisting that Chucky was alive, and both [[Catherine Hicks]] and [[Chris Sarandon]] were intended to reprise their roles as Karen and Detective Mike Norris from the first film. However, their scenes were cut from the scripts because of budgetary constraints, and as a result of their omission the film is much shorter than the other installments in the series. The courtroom scene would be recycled as the ending of ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' in 2013. It also would have contained a scene where Chucky's remains were held in a police evidence locker alongside [[Jason Voorhees]] and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]'s masks, an idea which came to be reused in ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' in 1998.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|date=2020-05-29|title=10 Behind-The-Scenes-Facts About The Making Of Child's Play 2|url=https://screenrant.com/childs-play-2-behind-the-scenes-trivia-horror-chucky-don-mancini-john-lafia/|access-date=2021-05-29|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 6, 1989 with a $12 million budget.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58442|access-date=2021-05-29|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Unlike the first film which was mostly shot on-location in Chicago, most of the second film was shot in [[Universal Studios Lot]] in [[Universal City, California]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Brad Dourif recorded all of his dialogue as Chucky in advance, which allowed his words to match up with his facial movements better than in the first film.

Costello. The author added in some of his own plot scenes exclusive to the novel, such as going deeper into Andy Barclay and Chucky's past. Chucky is characterized to have an absent father and his abusive mother being a dwarf. Chucky got teased a lot because of this and later strangled his mother to death. Also, Chucky was put in special classes when he was younger. During the scene at the factory, Chucky sees a bunch of Good Guy dolls and wishes that he could bring them to life to do his bidding.
