As the first discussions are completed, Prokosch invites the crew to join him at his villa, offering Camille a ride in his two-seat sportscar. Camille looks to Paul to decline the offer, but he submissively withdraws to follow by taxi, leaving Camille and Prokosch alone. Paul does not catch up with them until 30 minutes later, explaining that he was delayed by a traffic accident. Camille grows uneasy, secretly doubting his honesty and suspecting that he is using her to cement his ties with Prokosch. Her misgivings are heightened when she sees Paul grope Prokosch's secretary, Francesca. Back at their apartment, Paul and Camille discuss the subtle uneasiness that has come between them in the first few hours of the project, and Camille suddenly announces to her bewildered husband that she no longer loves him.\n\nHoping to rekindle Camille's love, Paul convinces her to accept Prokosch's invitation to join them for filming in [[Capri]]. Prokosch and Lang are locked in a conflict over the correct interpretation of Homer's work, an impasse exacerbated by the difficulty of communication between the German director, French script writer, and American producer. Francesca acts as interpreter, mediating all conversations. When Paul sides with Prokosch against Lang by suggesting that Odysseus actually left home because of his wife's infidelity, Camille's suspicions of her husband's servility are confirmed. She deliberately allows him to find her in Prokosch's embrace, and in the ensuing confrontation she implies that her respect for him has turned to contempt because he has bartered her to Prokosch. He denies this suggestion, offering to sever his connection with the film and leave Capri; but she will not recant and leaves for Rome with the producer. After a car crash in which Camille and Prokosch are killed, Paul prepares to leave Capri and return to the theater. Lang continues to work on the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brigitte Bardot]] as Camille Javal\n* [[Michel Piccoli]] as Paul Javal\n* [[Jack Palance]] as Jeremy Prokosch\n* [[Giorgia Moll]] as Francesca Vanini\n* [[Fritz Lang]] as himself\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] as the cameraman\n* [[Jean-Luc Godard]] as Lang's assistant director\n* [[Linda Veras]] as a [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]\n\n==Production==\nItalian film producer [[Carlo Ponti]] approached Godard to discuss a possible collaboration; Godard suggested an adaptation of Moravia's novel ''[[Il disprezzo]]'' (originally translated into English with the title ''A Ghost at Noon'') in which he saw [[Kim Novak]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] as the leads; they refused. Ponti suggested [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]], whom Godard refused. [[Anna Karina]] (by then Godard's former wife) later revealed that the director had traveled to Rome to ask [[Monica Vitti]] if she would portray the female lead. However the Italian actress reportedly turned up an hour late, \"staring out the window like she wasn't interested at all\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/anna-karina-2-3-things-we-now-know-about-her|title=Anna Karina: 2 or 3 things we now know about her|website=British Film Institute|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref> Finally, Bardot was chosen because of the producer's insistence that the profits might be increased by displaying her famously sensual body. This provided the film's opening scene, filmed by Godard as a typical mockery of the cinema business with tame nudity. The scene was shot after Godard considered the film finished, at the insistence of the American co-producers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drnorth.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/things-you-need-to-know-about-le-mepris/|title=Things You Need to Know About ''Le M\u00e9pris''|website=Spectacular Attractions|date=7 February 2013 |access-date=2017-12-28}}</ref> In the film, Godard cast himself as Lang's assistant director, and characteristically has Lang expound many of Godard's [[French New Wave|New Wave]] theories and opinions. Godard also employed the two \"forgotten\" New Wave filmmakers, [[Luc Moullet]] and [[Jacques Rozier]], on the film. Bardot visibly reads a book about Fritz Lang that was written by Moullet, and Rozier made the documentary short about the making of the film ''[[Le Parti des Choses]]''.\n\nGodard admitted to changing the original novel, \"but with full permission\" of Moravia, the original writer. Among his changes were focusing the action to only a few days and changing the writer character from being \"silly and soft. I've made him more American\u2014something like a [[Humphrey Bogart]] type.\"<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news|title=Godard's Ghost, Roman-Style: Analytic Break Complex Pattern One Man's Method |first=Robert F.|last=Hawkins|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 June 1963|page=97}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Contempt'' was filmed in Italy where it is set, with location shooting at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios in Rome and the [[Casa Malaparte]] on [[Capri]] island. In a sequence, the characters played by Piccoli and Bardot wander through their apartment alternately arguing and reconciling. Godard filmed the scene as an extended series of [[tracking shot]]s, in natural light and in near real-time. The cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] also shot some of the other ''nouvelle vague'' films, including Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (1960). According to [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], Godard was also directly influenced by [[Jean-Daniel Pollet]] and [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s ''[[M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (1963 film)|M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]]'', released earlier the same year.<ref name=\"Schneider2012\">{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Steven Jay|title=1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKeKMwEACAAJ|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84403-733-9|page=419}}</ref>\n\nGodard admitted his tendency to get actors to improvise dialogue \"during the peak moment of creation\" often baffled them. \"They often feel useless,\" he said. \"Yet they bring me a lot... I need them, just as I need the pulse and colours of real settings for atmosphere and creation.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 58 reviews, with an average score of 8.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"This powerful work of essential cinema joins '[[meta]]' with '[[Physical attractiveness|physique]],' casting Brigitte Bardot and director Godard's inspiration Fritz Lang.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/contempt/|title=''Le M\u00e9pris'' (''Contempt'')|access-date=19 August 2021|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critic [[Colin MacCabe]] referred to ''Contempt'' as \"the greatest work of art produced in postwar Europe.\"<ref>[[Phillip Lopate]] [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/22/movies/brilliance-and-bardot-all-in-one.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Brilliance And Bardot, All in One\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (22 June 1997)</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"luxuriant\" but wrote that Godard \"could put his talents to more intelligent and illuminating use\"; according to Crowther, who is unclear about the motivations of the main characters, \"Mr. Godard has attempted to make this film communicate a sense of the alienation of individuals in this complex modern world.
