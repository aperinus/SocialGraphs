The play was adapted by [[John Lee Mahin]] for the screenplay of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nKenneth and Christine Penmark dote on their eight-year-old daughter Rhoda. Kenneth leaves on military duty. Monica, the Penmarks' neighbor and landlady,  visits. Rhoda, pristine and proper in her [[pinafore dress]] and blonde [[pigtail]]s, tells her about a [[penmanship]] competition that she lost to her schoolmate, Claude Daigle. Rhoda then leaves for her school picnic at the lake.\n\nChristine is having lunch with friends when they hear a radio report that a child has drowned in the lake. The victim is the same Claude who had won the penmanship medal. Christine worries that her daughter might be traumatized, but Rhoda is unfazed by the incident and goes about her life. Rhoda's teacher, Miss Fern, visits Christine, revealing that Rhoda was the last person to see Claude alive and that she was seen grabbing at Claude's medal. She hints that Rhoda might have some connection to the boy's death and adds the girl will not be welcome at the school after the current term ends. Claude's parents barge in.  Mrs. Daigle is distraught and drunk and accuses Rhoda's teacher of knowing something she is not telling.\n\nWhen Christine finds the medal in Rhoda's room, she demands an explanation. Rhoda lies that Claude let her have it. Christine's father visits. Haunted by confusing memories about her own childhood, Christine talks with him and he reveals that he is not her biological parent; she was adopted. Upset by this revelation, Christine is then horrified to learn that she is actually the daughter of a notorious [[serial killer]]. She worries that her origin is the cause of Rhoda's [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]] and that her behavior is genetic.\n\nChristine catches Rhoda trying to dispose of her [[tap shoe]]s in the household incinerator and realizes that Rhoda must have hit Claude with the shoes, which left odd crescent marks on his face that could not be identified. Alternately feigning tears and angrily blaming Claude, Rhoda admits that she killed the boy for his medal and confirms Christine's suspicion that, to acquire a keepsake, she had previously murdered an elderly neighbor when they lived in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Christine orders Rhoda to burn the shoes in the incinerator.<ref>''Cruel Children in Popular Texts and Cultures''; {{ISBN|978-3-030-10179-4}} p. 294</ref>\n\nThe next day, the caretaker, Leroy, teasingly tells Rhoda that he believes she killed Claude. After Rhoda angrily tells him she burned her shoes, Leroy opens the incinerator and finds the remains. A drunk Mrs. Daigle returns and tells Christine that she believes Rhoda knows what happened to her son. Mr. Daigle calls and comes to pick up his wife. Realizing that Leroy knows she really did kill Claude, Rhoda sets his [[Wood wool|excelsior]] bedding ablaze. After some men break open the basement hatch, Leroy runs into the yard aflame, ultimately burning to death. From the window, Christine and Monica see him die, which makes Christine hysterical. That night, a strangely calm Christine tells Rhoda that she dropped the medal into the lake, then gives her daughter a lethal dose of [[sleeping pills]]. She attempts to kill herself with a gunshot to the head. However, the gunshot alerts the neighbors and Rhoda and Christine are taken to the hospital. They both survive, although Christine is in a coma. Kenneth arrives and takes Rhoda home.\n\nAt bedtime, Rhoda excitedly tells Kenneth that she will inherit Monica's pet [[Lovebird|love bird]]. She also mentions that she and Monica plan to sunbathe on the roof soon. Christine regains consciousness and is expected to make a full recovery. She calls Kenneth and tells him that she must pay for her \"dreadful sin\" but Kenneth assures her that they will work on their problems together. Meanwhile Rhoda sneaks out during a rainstorm, determined to retrieve the medal from the bay. She uses a metal pole to probe the water. Suddenly a bolt of lightning strikes her, sending her into the water and to her death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nancy Kelly]] as Christine Penmark\n* [[Patty McCormack]] as [[Rhoda Penmark]]\n* [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]] as Leroy Jessup\n* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Hortense Daigle\n* [[Evelyn Varden]] as Monica Breedlove\n* [[William Hopper]] as Col.

Harvey]] as Guard in Hospital Corridor (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nAfter the success of the book, Geoffrey Shurlock from [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA) sent a letter to [[Jack Warner (film production executive)|Jack Warner]] stating that \u201cthe property violated the spirit and letter of the Code.\u201d Shurlock\u2019s office wrote to [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Universal Pictures]] to caution them against the property although none had inquired about it.\n\nAfter a bidding war, Jack Warner bought the film rights for $300,000 (equivalent to $2.9 million in 2021).<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |title=The Bad Seed |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/51748 |website=AFI |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Inflation Calculator |url=https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=300000&year=1955 |website=Dollar Times |publisher=H Brothers, Inc. |access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref> [[United States Pictures]] owned by [[Milton Sperling]] stated that they would only produce the film for [[Warner Brothers Pictures]] upon approval by PCA. Adler contacted Shurlock demanding to know why approval was given. Shurlock responded that director [[Mervyn LeRoy]] was able to come up a treatment \"that seemed to do what the office thought was impossible\".<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nAlthough the novel and play conclude with Christine dying and Rhoda surviving, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] did not allow for \"crime to pay\".<ref>''Writing the Horror Movie'' {{ISBN|978-1-441-19618-7}} p. 28</ref> The ending of the film thus reverses the deaths of the mother and daughter, with Christine's life being saved and Rhoda's ultimately being struck down by lightning. In another move to appease the censors, Warner Bros. added an \"adults only\" tag to the film's advertising.<ref name=\"TCM\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67988/The-Bad-Seed/articles.html \"The Bad Seed\"], [[Turner Classic Movies]]; retrieved February 11, 2014.</ref> Finally, the film diffuses shock of the ending with a coda in which an announcer introduces the members of the cast. It concludes with Kelly lightheartedly [[spanking]] McCormack for her character's misdeeds.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Bad Seed'' was one of the bigger hits of 1956 for Warner Bros., earning the company $4.1 million in theatrical rentals in the U.S. against a $1 million budget.
