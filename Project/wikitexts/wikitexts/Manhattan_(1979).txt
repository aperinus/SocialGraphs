Joffe]] from a screenplay written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]]. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) but falls in love with his best friend's ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]) mistress ([[Diane Keaton]]). [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] also star.\n\n''Manhattan'' was Allen's first movie filmed in [[black-and-white]], and was shot in [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|2.35:1 widescreen]]. It features music by [[George Gershwin]], including ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''.<ref name=\"combo\" />\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for Hemingway and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (adjusted for inflation). It ranks 46th on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list and number 63 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080412071717/http://movies.nytimes.com/person/79388/Woody-Allen/biography Woody Allen \u2013 Biography] by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>[http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ Article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226133915/http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ |date=2014-02-26 }} in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' by [[Bilge Ebiri]] on AFI Top 100</ref> In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] and other parts of [[New York City]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', with Isaac Davis narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his boring job. He is dating Tracy, a 17-year-old girl attending the [[Dalton School]]. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack, married to Emily, is having an affair with Mary Wilkie. Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah, also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill, who before their marriage told Isaac that she was [[bisexual]], has since [[Coming out|come out]] and lives with her [[lesbian]] partner, Connie.\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery offends him. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] and escorts her home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in a shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to [[London]] to study acting.\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her distress, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book, ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a [[Threesome|m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Publicly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds nonchalantly and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A furious Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the [[d\u00e9nouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people\". He gives her a slight smile, with a final look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again. An instrumental version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\" plays over the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Isaac Davis\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Mary Wilkie\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Yale Pollack\n* [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Tracy\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Jill Davis\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126117/bio|title=Anne Byrne Hoffman|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-07-01|archive-date=2015-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609115842/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126117/bio|url-status=live}}</ref> as Emily Pollack\n* [[Michael O'Donoghue]] as Dennis\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Jeremiah (in his film debut)\n* Karen Ludwig<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525023/|title=Karen Ludwig|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-07-01|archive-date=2017-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226065713/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525023/|url-status=live}}</ref> as Connie\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]], [[Karen Allen]], and [[David Rasche]] as Television actors\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Frances Conroy]] as Shakespearean actors\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of Gershwin's music.
