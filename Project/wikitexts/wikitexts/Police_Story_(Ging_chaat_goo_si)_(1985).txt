In the film, Ka-Kui helps arrest a drug lord, but must clear his own name after being accused of murder.\n\nChan began work on the film after a disappointing experience working with [[James Glickenhaus]] on ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' (1985), which was intended to be his entry into the [[Cinema of the United States|American film]] market. ''Police Story'' contains many large-scale action sequences with elaborate, dangerous [[stunts]] performed by Chan and his [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team|stunt team]], including [[car chase]]s, Chan hanging off a speeding bus, parkour-like acrobatics, and a [[shopping mall]] fight with shattering glass panes, leading up to Chan sliding down a pole with exploding electric lights as he falls to the ground. Much of the film was created surrounding the action sequences, which Chan and the filmmakers developed via linear progression.\n\n''Police Story'' was a blockbuster success in Asia and Europe, grossing an estimated {{US$|18,724,000|1985|round=-5}} at the box office. It won the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] award at the [[5th Hong Kong Film Awards|1986 Hong Kong Film Awards]]. According to Chan's autobiography, he considers ''Police Story'' his best [[action film]]. In 2016, ''Police Story'' was voted the fourth [[List of films considered the best|best action film of all time]] in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''{{'}}s poll of film critics, directors, actors and [[stunt performer]]s.<ref name=\"Time\"/> Chan's final action sequence in the mall is considered one of the greatest stunts in the history of action cinema.<ref name=\"rogerebert\"/> A [[4K resolution|4K]] restoration of the film had a limited theatrical release in North America on February 1, 2019, along with its sequel ''[[Police Story 2]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Han |first1=Karen |title=Jackie Chan's Police Story movies remain among the best action films of all time |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/27/18157761/jackie-chan-police-story-4k-restoration-trailer-best-action-movie |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Hong Kong Police Force|Royal Hong Kong Police Force]] is planning a major undercover sting to arrest crime lord Chu Tao. Inspector [[Chan Ka-Kui]] (or Kevin Chan in some versions) is part of the operation, along with undercover officers stationed in a shantytown. However, the criminals spot the officers and the shootout ensues between the two groups in which civilians either flee the town or caught in the crossfire as a result of the gunfight. Chu Tao and his men successfully flee in their car by driving through the town but crashes it immediately after going downhill and escapes on foot. Ka-Kui persists in his chase on foot as Chu Tao and his men attempt to escape in a [[double-decker bus]]. Ka-Kui manages to get in front of the bus and bring it to a halt by threatening to shoot the driver with his service [[pistol|revolver]].\n\nLater, Ka-Kui is reprimanded by Superintendent Li for letting the operation get out of hand but subsequently presented to the media as a model police officer. His next assignment is to protect Chu Tao's secretary, Salina Fong, who plans to testify in court about Chu Tao's illegal activities. At first, Salina insists that she does not require protection, but Ka-Kui has a fellow policeman break into her apartment and pose as a knife-wielding assassin. Ka-Kui and Salina fight him off and she agrees to be more cooperative. The two drive away in her car, but are ambushed by Chu Tao's actual hitmen, who are scared away when Salina threatens them with Ka-Kui's revolver.\n\nWhen Ka-Kui arrives at his apartment with Salina, he is surprised to find his girlfriend, May and her friends throwing a birthday party for him, but May becomes angry with Ka-Kui after seeing Salina only wearing [[lingerie]] and Ka-Kui's jacket. Ka-Kui eventually explains to May that Salina is a witness, but only after much bumbling and embarrassment. While he tries to apologize to May, Salina discovers that the attack at her apartment was a sham, and decides to record over her taped confession about working for Chu Tao that took place in the car ride there. She sneaks away while Ka-Kui is sleeping and is not present at the trial the next day, which ends with failure for the prosecution because of Salina's absence and tampering with the recording.\n\nThough Chu Tao is released on bail, he wants revenge against Ka-Kui. He captures Salina and threatens to kill her to ensure her silence. Ka-Kui finds and frees her, but is attacked by several of Chu Tao's men. When fellow Police Inspector Man arrives (Kam Hing Ying), he reveals that he had been working with Chu Tao and thus Salina's capture was merely a ruse to trap Ka-Kui. To Man's grim surprise, the plan is also to include Tao's men killing him with Kui's gun to frame him for murder. Now a fugitive cop killer, Ka-Kui must try to catch Chu Tao and clear his name, taking his superintendent as a hostage in order to escape custody, though he soon lets his co-operative superior go free.\n\nSalina goes to Chu Tao's office at a shopping mall to download incriminating data from Chu Tao's computer system. Chu Tao notices this and he and his men rush to the shopping mall to intervene. Ka-Kui and May, who are monitoring Chu Tao's activities, follow. In the ensuing carnage, Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao's henchmen (and destroys a good portion of the mall). The briefcase containing the computer data falls to the bottom floor of the mall, but Chu Tao retrieves it after attacking May. Ka-Kui, at the top floor, slides down a pole wrapped in lightbulbs to the bottom floor and catches Chu, but the rest of the police force quickly arrives and prevent him from further taking matters into his own hands. Salina attests to them that Danny Chu killed Inspector Man and evidence of his crimes is in the briefcase. Chu's defence attorney shows up and accuses the police of misconduct, prompting a beating from an at-wit's-end Ka-Kui, who goes on to extend the beating to Chu Tao before being stopped by his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as Sergeant \"Kevin\" [[Chan Ka-Kui]] (\"Jackie\" in second, third, and fourth English dubs)\n*[[Brigitte Lin]] as Salina Fong, Chu Tao's secretary aka Selina Fong (all English dubs) (as Brigette Lin)\n*[[Maggie Cheung]] as May, Ka-Kui's Girlfriend\n*[[Chor Yuen]] as Chu Tao, Crime Lord aka Tom Koo (first and second English dubs) / Joe Chu (third and fourth English dubs)\n*[[Charlie Cho]] as John Ko, gangster aka John Chow (second English dub)\n*[[Fung Hark-On]] as Danny Chu Ko / Danny Koo (first and second English dubs)\n*[[Lam Kwok-Hung]] as Superintendent Raymond Li\n*[[Bill Tung]] as Inspector \"Uncle\" Bill Chou / Inspector Wong (first and second English dubs) / Inspector George (third and fourth English dubs)\n*Kam Hing Yin as Inspector Man / Sergeant Mao (first and second English dubs) / Sergeant Ming (third and fourth English dubs)\n*[[Mars (actor)|Mars]] as Kim\n*Lau Chi-wing as Counsellor Cheung \n*[[Tai Po]] as Lee / Snake Eyes (first and second English dubs) / Sharkey (third and fourth English dubs)\n*[[Kent Tong]] as Tak / Tom / Francis Tong (Japanese release version)\n*Wan Fat as Mad Wing / Jacknife (1st and 2nd English dubs) / Crazy Wing (third English dub) / Psycho Wing (fourth English dub)\n*[[Bowie Wu]] as Sha Tau Kok police officer\n*[[Clarence Fok]] as Photographer\n*[[Money Lo]] as TV reporter\n\n===Jackie Chan stunt team===\n*Chan Tat-kwong\n*Johnny Cheung\n*Danny Chow\n*Fung Hak On\n*Benny Lai\n*Rocky Lai\n*Sam Wong\n*Ben Lam\n*Chris Li\n*[[Mars (actor)|Mars]]\n*Pang Hiu-sang\n*Paul Wong\n\n==Production==\nThe film contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a [[car chase]] through a [[shanty town]], Chan dangling from a speeding [[double-decker bus]] before stopping it with his service [[pistol|revolver]], and a climactic fight scene in a [[shopping mall]]. This final scene earned the film the nickname \"Glass Story\" by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of [[sugar glass]] that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering [[Burn#Classification by degree|second-degree burns]], particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html|title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing|author=Jackie Chan|author-link=Jackie Chan|publisher=[[Random House]]|access-date=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nEdward Tang, the screenwriter for this film and many others, said that he did not write this film the way normal Hollywood screenwriters work. Chan instructed Tang to structure the film around a list of props and locations, e.g. a shopping mall, a village, a bus, etc. In contrast to this production, most Hollywood films rely on the creativity of the screenwriters to create the plot elements of a film, which are then forwarded to the director for actual filming.\n\nIn an interview with Chan, he discusses the stunt of sliding down the pole covered with lights. As with the clock tower stunt from ''[[Project A (film)|Project A]]'' (1983), Chan described his fear at the thought of performing the stunt. During the filming of ''Police Story'', there was the added pressure of strict time constraints, as the shopping mall had to be cleaned up and ready for business the following morning. One of Chan's stuntmen gave him a hug and a [[Buddhist prayer]] paper, which he put in his trousers before finally performing the stunt.<ref name=\"PoliceStory\">{{cite video|title=''Police Story'', Jackie Chan interview, Bey Logan Audio Commentary (DVD featurette)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Hong Kong Legends]], UK|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nStuntman [[Blackie Ko]] doubled for Chan during a motorcycle stunt in which his character drives through glass towards a hitman.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In the double decker bus scene, Jackie used a metal umbrella because a wooden one kept slipping when he tried to hang onto the bus.\n\n==Box office==\nThe film grossed {{HK$|26,626,760|link=yes}} at the Hong Kong box office,<ref name=\"hkmdb\">{{cite web |title=Police Story (1985) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6753 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie DataBase]] |access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref> becoming the third highest-grossing film of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c8\u56de\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=(Jackie Chan Box Office Results) 8th: Box Office in Hong Kong |url=http://kungfutube.info/3129 |website=KungFu Tube |access-date=22 June 2020 |language=ja}}</ref> In Taiwan, it grossed {{NTD|{{#expr:5861430+14688240}}|link=yes}} between 1985 and 1986,<ref name=\"taiwan85\">{{cite web |title=1985 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a85.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219163210/cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a85.htm |website=[[National Chengchi University]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2001 |language=zh |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"taiwan86\">{{cite web |title=1986 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a86.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219163210/cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a86.htm |website=[[National Chengchi University]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2001 |language=zh |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> becoming one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1986.<ref name=\"taiwan86\"/> In Japan, it was the eighth highest-grossing foreign film of 1986,<ref>{{cite web |title=1986\u5e74\uff081\u6708\uff5e12\u6708\uff09 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/1986.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> grossing {{JPY|1.9 billion|link=yes}} at the Japanese box office.<ref name=\"japan\">{{cite web |title=\u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc \u9999\u6e2f\u56fd\u969b\u8b66\u5bdf\uff0f\u8b66\u5bdf\u6545\u4e8b\uff081985\uff09 |url=http://kungfutube.info/5831 |website=KungFu Tube |access-date=6 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> In South Korea, it was the third highest-grossing film of 1988,<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> with {{formatnum:{{#expr:191739+(692-104)}}|}} ticket sales in [[Seoul City]].<ref name=\"korea\">{{cite web|title=KOFIC \uc601\ud654\uad00 \uc785\uc7a5\uad8c \ud1b5\ud569\uc804\uc0b0\ub9dd|url=http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do|website=[[Korean Film Council]]|date=September 2018|access-date=8 November 2018|language=ko}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, the film sold 245,452 tickets in France (released 1987),<ref name=\"France\">{{cite web |last1=Soyer |first1=Renaud |date=4 February 2014 |title=Jackie Chan Box Office |url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-jackie-chan-c24779784 |website=Box Office Story |language=fr |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref> 846,700 tickets in [[Hungary]] (released 1988) and 65,700 tickets in Romania.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=\u00ab\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f\u00bb (Ging chaat goo si, 1985)|url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/22791/|access-date=9 November 2021|website=[[KinoPoisk]]|language=ru}}</ref> In the United States, the film was screened in 1993 at the [[Hogg Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Austin, Texas]], along with ''[[Police Story 3: Supercop]]'', with both films well-received among Austin audiences at the time.<ref name=\"Texan\" /> The film later had a limited US release in 2019, grossing US$113,164.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |title=Police Story (Domestic) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2080998913/ |access-date=26 December 2020 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

[[Kim Newman]] wrote, in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', that ''Police Story'' starts well with its car chase described as an \"astonishing set-piece\", but that \"once the mix of realistic settings and fantasy action seems to have been established, the film falls back on Chan's clowning and turns into a slapstick comedy heavily dependent on cake-in-the-face jokes\". The review concluded that the film \"still lacks much of the aesthetic appeal and occasional comic grace of the more traditional period kung fu films such as ''[[Project A (film)|Project A]]'', ''[[Drunken Master]]'', ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Dragon Lord]]''\".<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Jingcha Gushi/Police Story|last=Newman|first=Kim|author-link=Kim Newman|volume=54|issue=637|pages=50\u201351|date=1987|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|issn=0027-0407}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that at a screening of the film at the [[New York Film Festival]] Chan was promoted as a hybrid of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Clint Eastwood]], with Canby noting that Chan was \"more like a scaled-down, oriental [[Sylvester Stallone]], with energy and a willingness to smile fondly at himself\". Canby also noted the excessive pie-in-the-face gags, and that Chan \"participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases\" which were \"mildly amusing\" but not as amusing as the dubbed dialogue.
