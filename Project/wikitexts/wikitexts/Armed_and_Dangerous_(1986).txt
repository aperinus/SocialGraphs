Lester]] and starring [[John Candy]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Robert Loggia]] and [[Meg Ryan]].<ref name=\"Armed and Dangerous\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67627/Armed-And-Dangerous/|title=Armed and Dangerous|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=February 28, 2016}}</ref> It was filmed on location in and around [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[LAPD]] Officer Frank Dooley is framed for stealing a television set by two corrupt detectives. He is dismissed from the force, but escapes criminal punishment. The court's next case features hapless defense attorney Norman Kane attempting to defend a white supremacist leader, who threatens him with death should Kane fail to keep him out of prison. Kane reveals his ineptitude and the death threat to the judge, who agrees to render a long sentence if Kane promises to leave law behind.\n\nDooley and Kane meet when they both apply for work at Guard Dog Security, run by Captain Clarence O'Connell and part of a union represented by Klepper and Lazarus. Becoming licensed security guards after a single afternoon of training, Dooley and Kane are made partners by supervisor Maggie Cavanaugh and assigned to night duty at a pharmaceutical warehouse. Ordered to take a lunch break by senior guard Bruno, Kane happens upon an armed robbery of the warehouse and calls Frank for help, but they prove no match for the thieves.\n\nThe next day, the pair are berated by O'Connell for their failure. While they are venting their anger toward O'Connell, Maggie reveals that she is his daughter. Dooley and Kane then attend a meeting of the union, where Kane's attempt to file a grievance against Guard Dog is quashed by union president Michael Carlino. Kane pointedly questions Carlino about how the union dues, adding to about $4 million per year, are spent. After Kane rejects an evasive answer from treasurer Lou Brackman, Carlino threatens Kane should he ever attend another union meeting.\n\nOver the next few days, Dooley and Kane find themselves assigned to work at a landfill and a toxic waste dump. Convinced something illegal is afoot after hearing a story from two fellow security guards about a similar robbery, the pair track down Bruno at his gym and interrogate him. Bruno admits that O'Connell had him order them to lunch the night of the robbery. They visit an informant friend of Dooley's for information on Carlino and bring their suspicions to Maggie, but she rejects them for having no evidence.\n\nDooley and Kane next attend a party thrown by Carlino, hoping to gather some evidence. Eavesdropping on a meeting between Carlino and Brackman, they learn that Carlino is using the pension fund to finance dealings with a drug cartel and plans to have the money robbed from an armored car, with insurance covering the loss. Fearing the insurance company will investigate, Brackman urges Carlino not to execute the robbery. Carlino instructs Klepper and Lazarus to kill Brackman. Dooley and Kane attempt to save Brackman, but are too late to prevent his murder. After a night spent evading police, the two make plans with Maggie to prevent the armored car robbery. Kane and Maggie take over driving the truck, while Dooley plans to meet them ahead of the would-be robbers.\n\nDooley has problems with his motorcycle while weaving through a traffic jam on L.A.'s [[Sixth Street Viaduct]] and is forced to hitch a ride with a trucker who bulls through the traffic, destroying several cars in the process. Meanwhile, Kane and Maggie avoid assaults from multiple cars attempting to hold them up. Dooley is able to arrive in time to save the armored car from a final attack from Klepper and Lazarus. O'Connell arrives, having captured Carlino and his associates, the two detectives who originally framed Dooley.\n\nThe criminals are arrested and Dooley is invited back to the police force, along with a reluctant Kane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[John Candy]] as Frank Dooley \n*[[Eugene Levy]] as Norman Kane \n*[[Robert Loggia]] as Michael Carlino \n*[[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Captain Clarence O'Connell \n*[[Meg Ryan]] as Maggie Cavanaugh \n*[[Brion James]] as Anthony Lazarus \n*[[Jonathan Banks]] as Clyde Klepper\n*[[Don Stroud]] as Sergeant Rizzo \n*[[Larry Hankin]] as Kokolovitch \n*[[Steve Railsback]] as \"The Cowboy\" \n*[[Tony Burton]] as \"Cappy\" \n*[[Larry \"Flash\" Jenkins]] as Raisin \n*[[Stacy Keach, Sr.]] as Judge\n*[[Saveliy Kramarov]] as Olaf\n*[[Tom Lister, Jr.|Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister]] as Bruno \n*[[James Tolkan]] as Lou Brackman\n*[[Glenn Withrow]] as Larry Lupik\n*[[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Prosecutor\n*[[Teagan Clive]] as Staff Member\n*[[Tito Puente]] as Band Leader\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe project was initially developed by [[Harold Ramis]] as a vehicle for [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]].<ref name=latimes/> According to [[John Candy]], [[John Carpenter]] was initially attached to direct.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-08-28-ca-13992-story.html|title=JOHN CANDY'S READY TO TAKE CONTROL : My agent is always telling me--'it's not called show art, it's show business.'
