The film stars [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Tim Avery, an aspiring animator from Fringe City who has just had his first child born with the powers of the Mask. A stand-alone sequel to ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'' (1994), it is the second installment in [[The Mask (franchise)|''The Mask'' franchise]], an adaptation of [[Dark Horse Comics]] which starred [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Cameron Diaz]].\n\nIt also stars [[Alan Cumming]] as Loki, whom Odin has ordered to find the Mask. It co-stars [[Traylor Howard]], [[Kal Penn]], [[Steven Wright]], [[Bob Hoskins]] as Odin, and Ryan and Liam Falconer as Tim's baby Alvey. [[Ben Stein]] makes a brief reappearance at the beginning of the film as Doctor Arthur Neuman from the original film to re-establish the relationship between the mask and Loki. The film was a critical and financial failure upon release, being panned by both critics and fans of both the original film and comic books for its story, lack of the original cast, and moments too inappropriate for a PG film. It grossed $59.9 million against its $84\u2013100 million budget. Kennedy would later talk in-depth about his experiences working on the movie in the years since its release on his YouTube channel.\n\n== Plot ==\nDoctor Arthur Neuman is giving a tour of the hall of [[Norse mythology]] in Edge City's local museum. Neuman mentions that [[Loki]], the God of Mischief, created the mask and unleashed it on Earth to spread chaos among mankind, and that those who wear it are granted his powers. When Neuman mentions Loki's imprisonment at his father Odin's hands, a stranger becomes furious and transforms, revealing himself to be Loki. The tourists panic and flee, but Neuman stays to argue with Loki, who takes the mask in the display case, only to realize it is a replica. In anger, he removes Neuman's face and puts it in the case, disposes of the arriving authorities, and storms out of the museum.\n\nIn Fringe City, the real mask is found in a river by a dog named Otis, who belongs to Tim Avery. An aspiring animator, Tim is reluctant to accept parenthood with his wife, Tonya. On a tropical island, Loki is relaxing until Odin orders him to resume the search for the mask, believing it has caused too much chaos for mankind. Loki asks his father for help, but Odin says that he has to take responsibility for his actions. Tim puts on the mask for his studio's Halloween party, and becomes a green-faced party animal who can magically alter his surroundings. When the party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his newfound powers to perform a remix of \"[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]\", invigorating the event and giving Tim's boss, Daniel Moss, the inspiration for a new cartoon.\n\nThat night, Tim returns to his house and has sex with Tonya, while still wearing the mask. A baby is conceived, and is born with the same powers as the mask, which alerts Odin. Possessing a store clerk, Odin informs Loki and tells him that if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Months later, Tonya goes on a business trip, leaving Tim with their son Alvey. Tim, now promoted, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is continuously disrupted by Alvey. To get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch various cartoons on television, which inspire Alvey to torment his father using his powers. Otis, who has been feeling neglected by Tim, accidentally dons the mask, gains its power, and tries to get rid of Alvey, but his attempts are foiled by the craftier infant.\n\nLeaving a trail of mayhem in his wake, Loki finds Alvey and confronts Tim for the mask, but Alvey uses his powers to protect his father. Odin, possessing Tim's body, scolds Loki's destructive approach and strips him of his powers. Tim is later fired after failing to impress Moss during a pitch but reconciles and bonds with Alvey. Loki, determined to please his father, sneaks into the Avery household and completes a summoning ritual and appeals to Odin to restore his powers. Odin agrees, but only for a limited time, stating this is his last chance.\n\nLoki kidnaps Alvey in exchange for the mask. Tonya returns home and goes with Tim and Otis, to whom Tim had apologized for his negligence, to make the exchange. Loki decides to keep Alvey despite the exchange, forcing the group to chase after them as Tim becomes the Mask once more. The subsequent confrontation is relatively evenly matched, prompting Loki to halt the fight, suggesting they let Alvey decide who to be with. Although Loki tries to lure Alvey to him with promises of fun, Tim takes the mask off and convinces his son to choose him. Enraged, Loki tries to kill Tim, but his time runs out and Odin appears in person, again scolding Loki for his failure. Tim, however, feels sympathy for Loki and reminds Odin that regardless of their problems, they are still family. Odin reconciles with Loki, and the duo returns home.\n\nSome time later, Tim is rehired when his cartoon, based on Alvey and Otis competing for his attention, becomes a success. After the Avery family watches the cartoon's premiere, Tonya reveals that she is pregnant again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as [[The Mask (comics)|Tim Avery / The Mask]]\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as [[Loki]]\n* [[Traylor Howard]] as Tonya Avery\n* [[Kal Penn]] as Jorge\n* [[Steven Wright]] as Daniel Moss\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Odin]]\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Doctor Arthur Neuman\n* [[Magda Szubanski]] as Betty\n* [[Sandy Winton]] as Chris\n* [[Rebecca Massey]] as Clare\n* [[Ryan Johnson (actor)|Ryan Johnson]] as Chad\n* [[Victoria Thaine]] as Sylvia\n* Peter Flett as Mr. Kemperbee\n* Amanda Smyth as Mrs. Babcock\n* Ryan and Liam Falconer as Alvey Avery\n* Bear the Dog as Otis\n}}\n[[Jack Black]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] were offered for the role of Tim Avery, but both turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superherohype.com/news/83145-jack-black-passed-up-son-of-the-mask/|title=Jack Black Passed up Son of the Mask|date=5 September 2003}}</ref><ref name=\"Untold\" />\n\n=== Voices ===\n* [[Bill Farmer]] and [[Richard Steven Horvitz]] as the vocal effects of the masked Otis\n* [[Joyce Kurtz]], [[Mona Marshall]] and [[Mary Mouser|Mary Matilyn Mouser]] as Alvey\n** [[Neil Ross]] provided Alvey's deep voice\n\n== Production ==\nNot long after the release of ''The Mask'', it was announced in ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' that [[Jim Carrey]] would be returning in a sequel called ''The Mask II''.

He was hoping Carrey would come back as the title character, along with [[Amy Yasbeck]], who played reporter Peggy Brandt in the original. Russell decided to cut scenes when Peggy dies and leave the character open for the sequel, which became this film. In a 1995 [[Barbara Walters Special]], Carrey revealed that he was offered $10 million to star in ''The Mask II'', but turned it down, because his experiences on ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' convinced him that reprising a character he'd previously played offered him no challenges as an actor. Due to Carrey declining to reprise his role, the project never came to fruition, and the concept for the sequel was completely changed. The winner of the failed contest was given $5000 and other prizes and was issued an apology in the final issue of ''Nintendo Power'' in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/meet-the-winner-of-nintendo-power-s-the-mask-ii-contest-287112.phtml|title=Meet the winner of Nintendo Power's The Mask II contest|last=Ponce|first=Tony|date=February 4, 2015|website=[[Destructoid]] |access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that Lance Khazei was asked by New Line Cinema to do the script for a sequel to ''The Mask''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010731/re/film_mask_dc_1.html|title='Mask' Sequel in the Works but Will Carrey Be Back?|date=July 31, 2001|website=[[Yahoo!

He is the only actor to appear in both films as well as in [[The Mask: Animated Series|''The Mask'' cartoon series]]. The dog's name, Otis, connects with the dog from the original film and comic book, Milo, as a reference to ''[[The Adventures of Milo and Otis]]''. The naming of the Avery family pays homage to [[Tex Avery]] as its patriarch and the film's protagonist, Tim Avery, wants to be a cartoonist throughout the film. The film was shot at [[Fox Studios Australia|Fox Studios]] in [[Sydney]]. Principal photography began on August 18, 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 2021, Jamie Kennedy revealed in a series of in-depth videos on his [[YouTube]] channel about his experience making the film. He was offered the lead role after a couple of other projects he was to make with Warner Bros. did not go into production. He had initially turned down the offer to star due to scheduling conflicts with his television series ''[[The Jamie Kennedy Experiment]]''. Both the studio and network managed to work his schedule and he was signed. However, Kennedy was once again hesitant due to Tim only having minuscule time as the Mask and considered instead playing the role of Loki due to the versatile nature of the character.<ref name=\"Untold\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4ctYxLoXdo |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/X4ctYxLoXdo |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Son of the Mask: The Untold Story|website=YouTube|publisher=Jamie Kennedy|date=March 25, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> A chance encounter with [[Jim Carrey]] convinced him to take the role as well as talks with the director and producers who pitched the film as a romantic-comedy of a simple man going through relatable circumstances as a newly married man and sudden father. Kennedy admitted that he was also impressed with the special effects and hoped that the film would at least succeed in that aspect.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCwHq2LbyI |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/jQCwHq2LbyI |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Son of the Mask: The Untold Story PART 2|website=YouTube|publisher=Jamie Kennedy|date=May 12, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nKennedy stated that filming was exhausting primarily due to the Falconer twins and Bear the dog's constant maintenance. This combined with the heavy deadline and constant onset rewrites made it difficult to determine how the film would turn out. The original cut was roughly two hours long and only went through minor changes before getting screened for executives. Kennedy claimed that this version was much more accessible and had \"scope and tones\"; praising Guterman's attention to detail. However, the film was deemed \"not funny\" and was demanded to have thirty-eight minutes cut from the film. This resulted in what Kennedy described as an \"ADHD clusterfuck\" with numerous VFX-based scenes added that focused on Alvey and Otis.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi72bJfAAOc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/pi72bJfAAOc |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Filming Son of The Mask: The Untold Story|website=YouTube|publisher=Jamie Kennedy|date=November 23, 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe film had a budget of $84 million, [[New Line Cinema]] paid $20 million of that for the North America distribution rights while international partners paid the rest, as it was expected to do well in its home media release.<ref name=\"Snyder\">{{cite web |date=21 February 2005  |last1=Snyder |first1=Gabriel |title='Hitch' richer as Keanu raises hell |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/box-office/hitch-richer-as-keanu-raises-hell-1117918256/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |quote= \"Mask\" carried an extraordinarily hefty $84 million pricetag.}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned back $59.9 million of its $84\u2013100 million budget, making it a [[box office bomb|financial failure]].<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews and an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
