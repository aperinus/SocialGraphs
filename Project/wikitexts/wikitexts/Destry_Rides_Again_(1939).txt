The supporting cast includes [[Mischa Auer]], [[Charles Winninger]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Irene Hervey]], [[Billy Gilbert]], [[Bill Cody Jr.]], [[Lillian Yarbo]], and [[Una Merkel]].\n\nThe opening credits list the story as \"Suggested by [[Max Brand]]'s novel ''[[Destry Rides Again (novel)|Destry Rides Again]]''\", but the movie is almost completely different. It also bears no resemblance to the [[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|1932 adaptation of the novel]] starring [[Tom Mix]], which is often retitled as ''Justice Rides Again''.\n \nIn 1996, ''Destry Rides Again'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Christopher|date=1996-12-03|title=National Film Registry taps 25 more pix|url=https://variety.com/1996/scene/vpage/national-film-registry-taps-25-more-pix-1117466310/|access-date=2020-09-29|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-29|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''Destry Rides Again'']]\nSaloon owner Kent, the unscrupulous boss of the fictional [[Wild West|Western]] town of Bottleneck, has the town's sheriff, Mr. Keogh, killed when Keogh asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and Frenchy, a cheap saloon tramp who is his girlfriend, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The town's crooked mayor, Hiram J. Slade, who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale, as the new sheriff, assuming that he will be easy to control and manipulate. However, Dimsdale, a deputy under the famous lawman Tom Destry, promptly swears off drinking, and is able to call upon the latter's equally formidable son, Tom Destry Jr., to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town.\n\nDestry arrives in Bottleneck with Jack Tyndall, a cattleman, and his sister, Janice. Destry initially confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun and maintaining civility in dealing with everyone, including Kent and Frenchy. This quickly makes him a disappointment to Dimsdale and a laughingstock to the townspeople; he is mockingly asked to \"clean up\" Bottleneck by being given a mop and bucket. However, after a number of rowdy horsemen ride into town shooting their pistols in the air, he demonstrates uncanny expertise in marksmanship and threatens to jail them if they do it again, earning the respect of Bottleneck's citizens.\n\nThrough the townsmen's evasive answers regarding the whereabouts of Keogh, Destry gradually begins to suspect that Keogh was murdered. He confirms this by provoking Frenchy into admitting it, but without a location for the body, he lacks any proof. Destry therefore deputizes Boris, a Russian immigrant whom Frenchy had earlier humiliated, and implies to Kent that he had found the body outside of town \"in remarkably good condition\". When Kent sends a member of his gang to check on Keogh's burial site, Boris and Dimsdale follow, capture, and jail him.\n\nAlthough the gang member is charged with Keogh's murder (in the hope that he would implicate Kent in exchange for clemency), Mayor Slade appoints himself judge of the trial, making an innocent verdict a foregone conclusion. To prevent this, Destry calls in a judge from a larger city in secret, but the plan is ruined after Boris accidentally gives away the other judge's name in the saloon. Kent orders Frenchy to invite the deputy to her house while other gang members storm the sheriff's office and cause a breakout; now in love with Destry, she accepts. When shots are fired, he rushes back, to find the cell empty and Dimsdale mortally wounded. Destry returns to his room and puts on his gun belt, abandoning his previous commitment to nonviolence.\n\nUnder Destry's command, the honest townsmen form a posse and prepare to attack the saloon, where Kent's gang is fortified, while Destry enters through the roof and looks for Kent. At Frenchy's urging, the townswomen march in between the groups, preventing further violence, before breaking into the saloon and subduing the gang. Kent narrowly escapes, and attempts to shoot Destry from the second floor; Frenchy takes the bullet for him, killing her, and Destry kills Kent.\n\nSome time later, Destry is shown to be the sheriff of a now lawful Bottleneck, repeating to children the stories that Dimsdale told him of the town's violent history. He jokingly tells a story about marriage to Janice, implying a marriage between them will soon follow.\n\n==Cast==\nAs appearing in screen credits:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Marlene Dietrich]] as Frenchy, the saloon singer\n* [[James Stewart]] as Thomas Jefferson \"Tom\" Destry Jr., the new deputy\n* [[Mischa Auer]] as Boris Callahan, the henpecked Russian\n* [[Charles Winninger]] as Washington \"Wash\" Dimsdale, the new sheriff\n* [[Brian Donlevy]] as Kent, the saloon owner\n* [[Allen Jenkins]] as \"Gyp\" Watson\n* [[Warren Hymer]] as \"Bugs\" Watson\n* [[Irene Hervey]] as Janice Tyndall\n* [[Una Merkel]] as Lily Belle, \"Mrs. Callahan\"\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Bartender \"Loupgerou\"\n* [[Samuel S.

In the original work, Harrison (or \"Harry\") Destry was not a pacifist. As [[Destry Rides Again (1932 film)|filmed in 1932]], with [[Tom Mix]] in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns.\n\nThe film was James Stewart's first Western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with ''[[Winchester '73]]'', followed by ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]''). The story featured a ferocious cat-fight between Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel, which apparently caused a mild censorship problem at the time of release.<ref>Quirk 2000, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref>\nThe film also represented Dietrich's return to Hollywood after a string of flops at Paramount (\"Angel\", \"The Scarlet Empress\", \"The Devil is a Woman\") caused her, and a number of other stars, to be labelled \"box office poison\". While vacationing at Cap d'Antibes with her family, her mentor [[Josef von Sternberg]] and her lover [[Erich Maria Remarque]], she received an offer from [[Joe Pasternak]] to come to Universal at half the salary she had been receiving for most of the 1930s. Pasternak had previously tried to sign Dietrich to Universal while she was still in Berlin. Unsure of what to do she was advised by von Sternberg \"I made you into a Goddess. Now show them you have feet of clay\".\n\nAccording to writer/director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she and James Stewart had an affair during shooting and that she became pregnant but had a surreptitious abortion without telling Stewart.<ref>Riva 1994, pp. 456, 500.</ref>\n\nInternationally, the film was released under the alternative titles ''[[:fr:Femme ou D\u00e9mon|Femme ou D\u00e9mon]]'' in French and ''Arizona'' in Spanish.\n\n==Reception==\n''Destry Rides Again'' was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by [[Frank S. Nugent]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', who observed that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized: \"It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'.\" Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, \"turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.\"<ref>Nugent, Frank S.
