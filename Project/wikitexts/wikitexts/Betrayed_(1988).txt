The plot is roughly based upon the terrorist activities of American [[neo-Nazi]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Robert Jay Mathews|Robert Mathews]] and his group [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the American Midwest, the film begins with the murder of a Jewish radio host in [[Chicago]]. [[FBI]] [[undercover]] agent Catherine Weaver, alias Katie Phillips, sets out to infiltrate a farming community, suspected of harboring those responsible.\n\nAfter receiving a warm welcome from land-owner and farmer Gary Simmons, his two children and [[extended family]], she begins to believe that the FBI lead is erroneous. Throwing caution to the wind, she falls in love with Simmons, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who appears to command the respect of the local community. A short while later, her suspicions are aroused by talk of family secrets and as more chilling events unfold, Katie is exposed to the fact that Gary is the leader of a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan-like]] [[white supremacy]] group involved in heinous, often gut-wrenching, acts of racial violence.\n\nIn too deep, Katie pleads with boss and mentor Michael Carnes to release her from the assignment, but he refuses, instead turning the screws on her mixed loyalties. Ultimately, she must betray either the man she loves or the country she has sworn to protect.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Debra Winger]] as FBI Agent Cathy Weaver / Katie Philips\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Gary Simmons\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as FBI Agent Mike Carnes\n* [[Betsy Blair]] as Gladys Simmons\n* [[John Mahoney]] as \"Shorty\"\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Wesley \"Wes\" John Bond\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Bobby Flynn\n* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as FBI Agent Al Sanders\n* [[David Clennon]] as Jack Carpenter\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Sam Kraus\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] (''cameo'') as Juggler At The Fair\n* [[Ralph Foody]] as Lyle\n* Robert Swan as Dean\n* Stephen E.

It lurches \"from the outrageous to the outright ludicrous\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Sheila|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-26-ca-869-story.html|title=Costa-Gavras' 'Betrayed' Deceived by Unlikely Story|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1988|access-date=May 8, 2022}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] wrote: \"a film that left me in turmoil, torn between the strong sympathies I felt for the characters and the fundamental doubts I had about the plot. Here were people I believed in, involved in a story that no one could believe in.\" Ebert thought there was a conflict between the thriller envisaged in the screenplay by Eszterhas and the presumed wish of Costa-Gavras to make a political film, but there still remains \"two performances of such power that the characters become real, and sympathetic, despite everything\", in reference to the central roles of Berenger and Winger.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/betrayed-1988|title=Betrayed|work=Roger Ebert|date=August 26, 1988|access-date=May 8, 2022}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' itemized what she saw as the film's \"story problems\". She doubted there was a feasible way \"to stage the sequence that has the amorous Gary dragging his new sweetheart along on a racist hunting expedition, insisting 'You'll like this' when she protests? Is it possible, after this, that she can still find him attractive? Is the F.B.I. really apt to send a brand-new female agent on such a dangerous mission, to deny her adequate backup and to bully her when she complains? John Heard, who is good as an F.B.I. colleague who's in love with Cathy, is meant to provide the element of sexual jealousy that explains this. But like too much of ''Betrayed,'' it just doesn't make sense.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/26/movies/review-film-costa-gavras-s-betrayed-the-world-of-bigotry.html|title=Costa-Gavras's 'Betrayed,' the World of Bigotry|work=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1988|access-date=May 8, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Berenger named ''Betrayed'' as his favorite film, shrugging off any media criticism with the retort \"It was exactly what it was meant to be\".<ref>[http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html Tom Berenger Biography at www.tv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928121632/http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html |date=September 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAt [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Betrayed'' has a 38% \"Rotten\" rating based on 13 reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002205-betrayed/ RottenTomatoes.com rating information]</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at #2 at the box office,<ref>{{cite news|title= WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : National Box Office Goes Soft|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-30/entertainment/ca-1481_1_box-office|access-date=2011-03-21}}</ref> earning $5,534,787 and coming in behind the second weekend of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1988&wknd=35&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 26-28, 1988 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=August 29, 1988 | access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> The film would go on to gross $25,816,139 in the United States.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=betrayed.htm | title=''Betrayed'' (1988) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | access-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Talk Radio (film)]]''\n* ''[[American History X]]''\n* ''[[Green Room (film)|Green Room]]''\n* ''[[Imperium (2016 film)|Imperium]]''\n* ''[[BlacKkKlansman]]''\n* [[White supremacist terrorism in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0094731|Betrayed}}\n* {{Mojo title|betrayed|Betrayed}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1002205-betrayed|Betrayed}}\n\n{{Costa-Gavras}}\n{{Joe Eszterhas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Betrayed (1988 Film)}}\n[[Category:Films about the Ku Klux Klan]]\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1988 thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Costa Gavras]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Joe Eszterhas]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Works about white nationalism]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bill Conti]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about racism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n[[Category:Films about neo-Nazis]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
