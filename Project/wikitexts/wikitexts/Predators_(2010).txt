It was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the third installment of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]]. The film follows an [[ensemble cast]] of characters including Royce (Adrien Brody), a mercenary who appears in an unidentified jungle among other proficient killers. They find that they have been abducted and placed on a planet that acts as a game reserve for two warring tribes of [[Predator (alien)|extraterrestrial killers]], and actively look for a way to return to Earth.\n\nProducer [[Robert Rodriguez]] had developed a script for a third installment as early as 1994, although it was not until 2009 that 20th Century Fox greenlit the project. According to Rodriguez, the title ''Predators'' is an [[allusion]] to the second film in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]], ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986).<ref name=\"AICNE\" /> The title also has a double meaning, referring both to the extraterrestrial [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] creatures and to the group of human characters who are pitted against them.<ref name=\"MTV\" /> [[Principal photography]] for ''Predators'' began on September 28, 2009, and concluded after 53 days; filming took place in [[Hawaii]] and then in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\n''Predators'' was released in the United States on July 9, 2010. It grossed $127 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the action but criticism aimed at the thinly written characters. A fourth film, titled ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]'', was released in 2018, and a prequel, ''[[Prey (2022 film)|Prey]]'', in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please keep in mind WP:FILMPLOT guidelines regarding word count (i.e. under 700 words). -->\nRoyce awakens to find himself free falling into an unfamiliar jungle, and meets several others who arrive in the same manner: [[Los Zetas]] cartel enforcer Cuchillo, [[Spetsnaz]] soldier Nikolai, [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] [[sniper]] Isabelle, [[Revolutionary United Front|RUF]] officer Mombasa, [[San Quentin]] [[death row]] inmate Stans, [[Yakuza]] member Hanzo, and [[physician]] Edwin. The group follows Royce, whom Isabelle suspects is a former [[black operations]] soldier turned [[mercenary]]. In the jungle, they find a strange monument, empty cages, and [[deadfall trap]]s set by a deceased [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]]. Reaching the higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize they are not on Earth.\n\nThe party survives an attack from a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a [[Game preservation|game preserve]], where humans and other species are hunted. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is used to lure the survivors into a trap, which they avoid. The group follows the beasts' tracks to a camp and finds a captive [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. Their hunters, three larger Predators known as the ''Tracker'', ''Berserker'' and ''Falconer'', attack the group. Mombasa is killed, and the rest of the group escapes. Isabelle recognizes the Predator as matching the description of a similar creature that [[Predator (film)|killed a special operations team in 1987 in Guatemala]], but was defeated by a single survivor.<!--Schaeffer's name is never mentioned in the film, so it should not be mentioned in this summary.-->\n\nThe group encounters Ronald Noland, a solitary [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|U.S. Air Cavalry]] soldier, who has survived on the planet for \"ten seasons\" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims. He takes the group to his hideout and explains that the Predators hunt in threes, sharpening their killing skills by abducting worthy prey from other worlds and bringing them to the planet. Noland also reveals that there is a [[blood feud]] between the Predators. Royce devises a plan to free the Predator being held prisoner, hoping it will take them home.\n\nNoland traps the others and attempts to use smoke to suffocate them. Having gone mad, he plans to kill them for their equipment. Royce uses an explosive to attract the Predators to the hideout. Noland is killed by the ''Tracker'', who releases the group. In the ensuing chase, Nikolai uses two [[claymore mine]]s to kill the ''Tracker'', sacrificing himself. The remaining group is intercepted by the ''Berserke''r. Stans distracts it by attacking it with his [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]], allowing the others to escape before being killed. Hanzo stays behind to duel the ''Falconer'' with a [[katana]], killing it before dying from his wounds.\n\nRoyce, Isabelle, and Edwin continue to head for the Predators' camp, hoping to enact Royce's plan, until Edwin is injured by a trap. When Isabelle refuses to abandon him, Royce leaves them both behind. They are caught by the ''Berserker,'' who traps them in a pit and continues to the camp. Royce frees the captive Predator in exchange for transport to Earth. The Predator dons his armor and activates the ship using his wrist computer, setting a course for Earth. Royce runs to the ship as the ''Berserker'' arrives, and the two Predators fight each other. The ''Berserker'' overpowers and decapitates the other Predator before using his wrist computer to self-destruct the ship, ostensibly killing Royce. Edwin paralyzes Isabelle using the [[neurotoxic]] poison from a plant he found earlier; he reveals he is a [[serial killer]] and intends to stay on the planet. Royce appears and stabs Edwin with his scalpel, paralyzing him.\n\nRoyce [[booby trap]]s Edwin with grenades, using him as bait to injure the remaining Predator. While Isabelle crawls for her sniper rifle, Royce fights the ''Berserker'' with an axe. Isabelle shoots the Predator and Royce decapitates it. As Royce and Isabelle rest, they observe parachutes opening in the distant sky. Surmising that more Predators will arrive to hunt the new prey, Royce and Isabelle head into the jungle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Predator (film series) characters}}\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Royce, a former [[U.S. Special Operations Forces]] veteran turned mercenary who reluctantly assumes leadership of the group of humans.<ref name=\"Tyler 3/25/2010\">{{cite web |last=Tyler |first=Josh |title=New Predators Featurette Proves Adrien Brody Is a Badass |publisher=[[CinemaBlend]] |date=2010-03-25 |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/New-Predators-Featurette-Proves-Adrien-Brody-Is-A-Badass-17737.html |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref><ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Allan |title=''Predators'' Featurettes: Royce & Edwin |publisher=filmofilia.com |date=2010-04-14 |url=https://www.filmofilia.com/2010/04/14/predators-featurettes-royce-edwin/ |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref> Brody claimed he had been \"blown away\" by ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and viewed his role as a challenge, wanting to bring a complexity to the character that would contrast with Schwarzenegger's role in the original film.<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite web |last=McCabe |first=Joseph |title=Adrien Brody on His ''Predator''-Filled Future |publisher=fearnet.com |date=2010-05-25 |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b19186_adrien_brody_on_his_predator-filled.html |access-date=2010-05-29}}</ref> He put on {{convert|25|lb|kg|spell=in}} of muscle for the role, stating that \"I want it to be entertaining and part of the ride that people see when they see a movie like that.
