This film was loosely inspired by writer/director Brad Silberling's own experience. He was dating actress [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] at the time she was killed by an obsessed fan in 1989.\n\nThe film takes its name from the [[Rolling Stones]] [[Moonlight Mile (Rolling Stones song)|song of the same name]]. The film's original title was ''Baby's in Black'', and then later changed to ''Goodbye Hello'', and then the current title. The film is set in 1973 and music from that era is heavily featured, including that of the Rolling Stones, [[Van Morrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Elton John]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the murder of Diana Floss in a restaurant in [[Cape Ann]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1972, her fianc\u00e9 Joe Nast elects to stay with her parents. Her father, Ben, is a realtor whose business partner has recently left. Ben and Joe go into business as Floss & Son, as this was their plan before Diana's death. Joe goes to the post office to retrieve all the invitations that had been sent out for his and Diana's wedding, and with the help of Bertie Knox he retrieves seventy-four of seventy-five. She finds the last invitation and takes it to his house later that night. He drops her off at a local bar, and returns home, despite her inviting him in for a drink. Joe and Ben attend a local property fair, and Ben pitches the idea of redeveloping a block in the town to developer Mike Mulcahey. Mulcahey agrees, but they need to get all the tenants to agree.\n\nDiana's friends come around to look through her possessions, much to the consternation of her mother, Jojo. They then take Joe out for a drink at the same bar Bertie went to the previous night. Joe puts \"Moonlight Mile\" on the jukebox and Bertie dances with him. Joe convinces Ben to let him talk to the bar's owner to convince them to sell. Feeling trapped at the Floss home, he meets Bertie and tells her about Diana. He confesses to her that he had split up with Diana three days before she was killed. Bertie tells Joe about her boyfriend, the owner of the bar, who is lost in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].\n\nOne night Joe sneaks out the window to go see Bertie again. They sleep together, and he leaves the next morning, slipping back into Diana's house through the window. Jojo is sitting in the room, drinking, knowing that he was out seeing another woman, and saddened by the idea that she had always known he would have never ended up with her daughter. She does not want Joe to leave, as they have formed a bond.\n\nJoe goes to dinner at the Mulcahey's, where Mike's wife presumes aloud that Joe was not still tied up with thoughts of his fiancee's murder. Joe states that this is not the case, upsetting the mood at the dinner table. Mike calls Ben and ends their deal.\n\nBertie confronts Joe about what happened between them, and they have an argument in which he tells her no one believes her boyfriend is coming home and that she deserved better anyway. She leaves, upset.\n\nThe family attends the trial of Diana's murderer. However, the murderer's wife elicits sympathy from the jury, and the prosecutor, Mona Camp, asks Joe to testify and help the jury gain sympathy for Diana. While on the witness stand, Joe confesses that he and Diana had broken up prior to her death, and had not told her parents. Ben and Jojo are happy with the confession and gain closure. Joe symbolically writes 75 letters expressing his newfound clarity about what course his life ought to take and his love for Bertie, and places them in mailboxes around town, hoping that one will get to her.\n\nBen closes the shop, Jojo resumes her writing career, Bertie sells the bar, and she and Joe leave town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Joe Nast\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Ben Floss\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Jojo Floss\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as Bertie Knox\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Mona Camp\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Mike Mulcahey\n* [[Careena Melia]] as Diana Floss\n* [[Roxanne Hart]] as June Mulcahey\n* [[Richard T.
