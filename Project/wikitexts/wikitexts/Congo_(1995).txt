Karen Ross, Charles' ex-fianc\u00e9e and a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative, and R. B. Travis, Charles' father and the CEO of TraviCom, lose contact with the team while tracking their progress at the company headquarters. Activating a remote camera, they find the camp destroyed and strewn with corpses, as well as a savage ape-like creature that destroys the camera. Travis asks Karen to lead another expedition to the site.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Elliott, a [[Primatology|primatologist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his assistant Richard teach [[human communication]] to [[primate]]s using a [[mountain gorilla]] named Amy. With a specialized backpack and glove, her [[sign language]] is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned by Amy's drawings of jungles and the [[Eye of Providence]], and seeks funding to return her to Africa, but the university is reluctant. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka offers to fund the expedition, and Karen asks permission to join it since her [[travel visa|visas]] will be invalid unless connected to such a venture. Peter is hesitant at first, seeing Amy's jealousy of Karen, but allows her to join and pay part of the expenses after Homolka is unable to provide funding.\n \nThe group flies to Africa and lands in [[Uganda]], where they meet wilderness guide Monroe Kelly. They are detained and questioned by Captain Wanta, a local military leader, who warns them not to trust Homolka and lets them proceed only after Karen pays him a large bribe. As the group crosses to [[Tanzania]] to board another plane that will take them to [[Zaire]], Monroe reveals that Homolka has led previous [[safari]]s in search of the \"Lost City of Zinj\", with disastrous results. The group parachutes into the jungle just before their plane is shot down by Zairean soldiers.\n\nOn the ground, they encounter a native tribe that leads them to Bob Driscoll, a wounded member of Charles' expedition. On seeing Amy approaching, Bob begins screaming in fear and soon dies. The group continues by boat, and learn that Homolka, in search of Zinj and its fabled [[King Solomon's Mines|diamond mine]], believes that Amy's drawings suggest she has seen the mine and can lead them to it. After an attack by massive [[Hippopotamus|hippos]], they find the ruined camp and the nearby City of Zinj. Richard and a couple of porters are killed by a vicious grey gorilla. The group take shelter at the ruined camp, keeping other gorillas at bay with automated sentry guns and detectors.\n\nWhen day breaks, they find Homolka, several porters and Amy missing. They return to the city, where they find Homolka exploring, and surmise from [[hieroglyphs]] that the city's inhabitants specially bred the grey gorillas, encouraging their violent tendencies to guard the mine and kill anyone looking to steal the diamonds. The group suspects the gorillas turned on their masters yet still continue to protect the mine. They find the mine and are faced with a troop of grey gorillas. Homolka begins to collect diamonds, but is soon cornered and killed by some of the apes. Monroe, Karen and Peter flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Jeffrey and Charles' bodies with the latter still holding a giant blue diamond in hand. As Amy protects Peter, Monroe fends off the other gorillas until Karen can fit the diamond into a portable laser, allowing her to power it up and kill several gorillas. The volcano begins to [[Types of volcanic eruptions|erupt]], and the four escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the gorillas.\n\nOnce safe, Karen reports to Travis on finding the diamond and confirming Charles' death. Realizing Travis was only interested in the diamond, she uses her laser to destroy the TraviCom satellite. In the nearby wreckage of another one of Travis' expedition [[Cargo aircraft|cargo planes]] they had found earlier, they find a [[Hot air balloon|hot-air balloon]], and prepare to leave. Peter sees Amy with a troop of [[mountain gorilla|gorilla]]s and bids her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Peter throws the diamond back into the jungle below. Amy watches the departing balloon with a smile, then joins her new gorilla family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Karen Ross, an electronics expert for TraviCom, and a former CIA operative, who hopes to find her ex-fianc\u00e9 lost in a previous expedition to the Congo.\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as Peter Elliott, a [[primatologist]] of [[Berkeley, California]], who wants to return his mountain gorilla, Amy, to her birthplace in the [[DR Congo|Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park|Virunga Region]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Captain Monroe Kelly, the \"Great White Hunter\" who \"also happens to be black\" - a mercenary who leads the group into the jungle.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Herkermer Homolka, a [[Romania]]n man who offers to finance the expedition.
