The United Kingdom, one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government, is deluged by refugees fleeing from chaos in their own countries. In response to this mass influx, the country has become a [[police state]], and the British government arrests, imprisons, or executes [[illegal immigrants]].\n\nTheo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrant-rights group led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor. The pair separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee woman named Kee. Theo obtains the papers from his cousin, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes member, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards [[Canterbury]]. An armed gang ambushes them and kills Julian. Two police officers later stop their car; Luke kills them and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a Fishes safehouse.\n\nWhile there, Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only known pregnant woman in the world. Julian had intended to hand her to the Human Project, a secretive scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's infertility. Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is voted the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so that Luke could become their leader. Theo also hears that they intend to kill him and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they escape to the secluded hideaway of Theo's aging friend Jasper Palmer. Palmer was once a political cartoonist, but has since turned into a cannabis dealer.\n\nThe group make plans to board the Human Project ship, the ''Tomorrow'', which will arrive offshore at [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] disguised as a fishing vessel. Jasper suggests they get Syd, an immigration cop to whom Jasper frequently sells drugs, to smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees. The next day, the Fishes discover Jasper's house and the group is forced to flee. Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes; Luke shoots and kills him while a hidden Theo watches. Theo, Kee and Miriam meet with Syd, who helps them board a bus headed to Bexhill, now converted into a refugee camp. When Kee begins experiencing [[uterine contraction|contractions]], Miriam distracts a guard by feigning religious mania, and is taken away.\n\nInside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romani woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd tells Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British military and the refugees. The refugees are being led by the Fishes. Syd learns that Theo and Kee have a bounty on their heads and attempts to capture them. Theo subdues Syd with Marichka's help, and they all escape. The group head to a hidden rowboat under cover of the fighting, but the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building that is under heavy fire. Theo confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and Theo escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting, and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the boat, but chooses to stay behind as they depart.\n\nBritish fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, and Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point. Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier. He teaches Kee how to burp her baby which prompts Kee to name her daughter Dylan, after Theo's and Julian's lost son. Theo loses consciousness as the ''Tomorrow'' approaches. As the screen cuts to black, children's laughter is heard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Thelonius \"Theo\" Faron, a former activist who was devastated when his child died during a flu pandemic.<ref name=\"ChristianCentury\">{{cite magazine |last=Vineberg |first=Steve |title= Rumors of a birth |magazine=[[The Christian Century]] |volume=124 |issue=3 |date=6 February 2007}}</ref> Theo is the \"archetypal [[everyman]]\" who reluctantly becomes a saviour.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carla |last=Meyer |title=''Children of Men'' |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=3 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Kevin |last=Williamson |title=Man of action |work=[[Calgary Sun]] |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=167431&x=articles&s=showbiz&cid=0&ei=gVScRYeAN5igogLti5CFCg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004613/http://www.calgarysun.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=167431&x=articles&s=showbiz&cid=0&ei=gVScRYeAN5igogLti5CFCg |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2007 |date=3 January 2007 |access-date=2 December 2011}}</ref> Cast in April 2005,<ref>{{cite news|first=Gabriel |last=Snyder |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117921775.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&p=0 |title=Owen having U's children |work=Variety |date=27 April 2005 |access-date=2 February 2007}}</ref> Owen spent several weeks collaborating with Cuar\u00f3n and Sexton on his role.

It took fourteen days to prepare for the single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, \"Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, when we come to shoot, we have to make feel completely random.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Claire |last=Sutherland |url=http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20603665-5006023,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907065329/http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20603665-5006023,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2012 |title=Clive's happy with career |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=19 October 2006 |access-date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nCuar\u00f3n's initial idea for maintaining [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] during the roadside ambush scene was dismissed by production experts as an \"impossible shot to do\".

Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to \"combine several takes to create impossibly long shots\", where their job was to \"create the illusion of a continuous camera move\". Once the team was able to create a \"seamless blend\", they would move on to the next shot. These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. The coffee shop scene was composed of \"two different takes shot over two consecutive days\"; the car ambush was shot in \"six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions\"; and the battlefield scene \"was captured in five separate takes over two locations\".
