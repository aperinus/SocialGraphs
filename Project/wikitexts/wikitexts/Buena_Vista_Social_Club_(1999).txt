It is named for a [[danz\u00f3n]] that became the title piece of the album ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]''. The film is an [[international co-production]] of [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Cinema of France|France]], and [[Cinema of Cuba|Cuba]].\n\nIn 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=December 14, 2020|title='Dark Knight,' 'Shrek,' 'Grease,' 'Blues Brothers' Added to National Film Registry|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dark-knight-shrek-grease-blues-brothers-national-film-registry-1234852610/amp/|website=Variety}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\nThe film documents how [[Ry Cooder]], long-time friend of Wenders, brought together the ensemble of legendary [[Cuba]]n musicians to record an album (also called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'') and to perform two times with a full line-up: in April 1998 in [[Amsterdam]] (two nights) and the 1st of July 1998 in the [[United States]] (at the [[Carnegie Hall]], [[New York City]]). Although they are geographically close, travel between [[Cuba]] and the United States is restricted due to the political tension between the two countries, so many of the artists were travelling there for the first time. The film shows their reactions to this experience, as well as including footage of the resultant sell-out concert. It also includes interviews with each of the main performers.\n\n==Musicians==\n* Francisco Repilado, aka [[Compay Segundo]] ([[Singing|vocals]] and [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]])\n* [[Eliades Ochoa]] ([[Singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]])\n* [[Ry Cooder]] ([[slide guitar]])\n* [[Joachim Cooder]], Ry's son ([[Percussion instrument|percussion]])\n* [[Ibrahim Ferrer]] ([[Singing|vocals]], [[conga]]s, [[claves]], [[Bongo drum|bongos]])\n* [[Omara Portuondo]] ([[Singing|vocals]])\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez (pianist)|Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[piano]])\n* [[Orlando \"Cachaito\" L\u00f3pez]] ([[Double bass]])\n* [[Amadito Vald\u00e9s]]\n* [[Manuel \"Guajiro\" Mirabal]] ([[trumpet]])\n* [[Barbarito Torres]]  ([[la\u00fad]])\n* [[P\u00edo Leyva]]\n* [[Manuel \"Puntillita\" Licea]] ([[Singing|vocals]])\n* [[Juan de Marcos Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[g\u00fciro]])\n\n==Songs==\n# \"[[Chan Chan (song)|Chan Chan]]\" ([[Compay Segundo|Francisco Repilado]])\n# \"[[Silencio (Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez song)|Silencio]]\" (Rafael Hernandez)\n# \"[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]\" ([[Harry Warren]] and [[Mack Gordon]])\n# \"Dos Gardenias\" (Isolina Carillo)\n# \"Veinte A\u00f1os\" ([[Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera]])\n# \"Y Tu Que Has Hecho?\" (Eusebio Delfin)\n# \"Black Bottom\" ([[Ray Henderson]], [[Lew Brown]] and B.

These included [[Ibrahim Ferrer]], [[Compay Segundo]], [[Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez (pianist)|Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Eliades Ochoa|El\u00edades Ochoa]]. The latter went on to support younger musicians making the same style of music beyond 2010 under the name \"Buena Vista Social Club\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Cuban films]]\n* ''[[Buena Vista Social Club: Adios]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0186508}}\n* {{Mojo title|buenavistasocialclub}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1087935-buena_vista_social_club}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4506-buena-vista-social-club-a-city-in-time ''Buena Vista Social Club: A City in Time''] an essay by [[Joshua Jelly-Schapiro]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Wim Wenders}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Buena Vista Social Club''\n|list1 =\n{{Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{European Film Award for Best Documentary}}\n{{Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Non-Fiction Film}}\n{{Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{Satellite Award Best Documentary Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buena Vista Social Club (Film)}}\n[[Category:Buena Vista Social Club]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:1999 documentary films]]\n[[Category:German documentary films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:British documentary films]]\n[[Category:French documentary films]]\n[[Category:Cuban documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Cuba]]\n[[Category:European Film Awards winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wim Wenders]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Amsterdam]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
