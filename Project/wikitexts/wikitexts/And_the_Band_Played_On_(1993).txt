The [[screenplay|teleplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the best-selling 1987 non-fiction book ''[[And the Band Played On|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic]]'' by [[Randy Shilts]], and is noteworthy for featuring both a vast historical scope, as well as an exceptionally sprawling cast.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] on September 2, 1993, before being broadcast on [[HBO]] on September 11, 1993. It later was released in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. The HBO movie was later aired on [[NBC]] in 1994. NBC (as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) were some of the networks considered to make a miniseries based on the book in the late 1980s, but the networks turned it down because they could not find a way to structure it as a two-night, four-hour miniseries. In 1994, NBC finally aired the movie with a parental discretion warning due to its sensitive subject matter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn  prologue set in 1976, American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Don Francis]] arrives in a village on the banks of the [[Ebola River]] in [[Zaire]] and discovers many of the residents and the doctor working with them have died from a mysterious illness later identified as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola hemorrhagic fever]]. It is his first exposure to such an [[epidemic]], and the images of the dead he helps [[cremation|cremate]] will haunt him when he later becomes involved with [[HIV/AIDS]] research at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].\n\nIn 1981, Francis becomes aware of a growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among [[gay]] men in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and is prompted to begin an in-depth investigation of the possible causes. Working with no money, limited space, and outdated equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, numerous members of the medical community (many of whom resent his involvement because of their personal agendas), and gay activists. Of the latter, some such as [[Bill Kraus]] support him, while others express resentment at what they see as unwanted interference in their lives, especially in his attempts to close the local [[Gay bathhouse|Gay bathhouse]]. One day, when exercising at a local gym, Kraus notices a spot at the base of his leg, worrying that it might be [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. After a series of blood tests, Kraus is horrified that his worst fears have been confirmed when he learns that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. While Francis pursues his theory that AIDS is caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted virus]] on the model of [[feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], he finds his efforts are stonewalled by the CDC, which is unwilling to prove the disease is transmitted through blood, and competing [[France|French]] and [[United States|American]] scientists, particularly [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]]. These medical researchers squabble about who should receive credit for discovering the virus. Meanwhile, the death toll climbs rapidly.  In November 1985, Kraus and his lover, Kico Govantes, are attending the candlelight parade in San Francisco when Kraus suddenly starts coughing and becomes too weak to stand.  He is taken to a local hospital where he appears to be suffering from dementia as he doesn't recognize anyone in front of him and speaks gibberish.  Don Francis arrives, and within a few minutes, the condition passes.  Francis and Kraus talk for a bit and Kraus encourages Francis to continue his research and fight for the truth.  The film ends with a playing of Elton John's \"The Last Song\" showing a photo and video montage of many celebrities and activists who had contracted AIDS.\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[Don Francis|Dr. Don Francis]], an epidemiologist, [[HIV/AIDS]] researcher, and one of the first scientists to suggest that AIDS was caused by an [[Pathogen|infectious agent]]\n* [[Alan Alda]] as [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]], a biomedical researcher and one of the discoverers of HIV as the infectious agent responsible for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Bill Kraus]], a [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] and AIDS activist and congressional aide\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as [[Mary Guinan|Dr. Mary Guinan]], an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]\n* [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]], a sociologist and investigator for the CDC, one of the discoverers of HIV as the virus that causes AIDS\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Dr. [[James W.

The stars lend warmth to a movie necessarily preoccupied with cold research and politics, and they lend prestige: The movie must be important, since actors of this stature agreed to appear. The result of the stars' generosity, however, works against the movie by halting the flow of the drama every time a familiar face pops up on screen. The emotions and agony involved in this subject give ''Band'' an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich\u00e9d. The best compliment one can pay this TV movie is to say that unlike so many fact-based films, it does not exploit or diminish the tragedy of its subject.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Ken Tucker|author-link=Ken Tucker|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307958,00.html |title=And the Band Played On |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 10, 1993 |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a review from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'', the writing team thought \"so keen were the makers of this adaptation of Randy Shilts's best-seller to bombard us with the facts and figures of the history of AIDS that they forgot to offer a properly dramatic human framework to make us care fully about the characters.\" The review also says that the multiple issues the film attempts to cover \"make for a disjointed, clich\u00e9d narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/77950/And_the_Band_Played_On.html |title=And the Band Played On |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]] |date=January 5, 2011 |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRichard Zoglin of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote \"Shilts's prodigiously researched 600-page book has been boiled down to a fact-filled, dramatically coherent, occasionally moving 2 hours and 20 minutes.
