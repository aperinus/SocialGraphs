It premiered at the ''[[Berlinale]]'' on 14 February 2006, and was first shown in the UK on [[Channel 4]] on 9 March 2006. The following day it was the first film to be released simultaneously in cinemas, on DVD, and on the Internet.\n\nThe film was generally well received: Michael Winterbottom won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[56th Berlin International Film Festival]], and the film won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. ''The Times'' criticised Winterbottom for accepting the men's stated reasons for going to Afghanistan at a time of danger after the 9/11 attacks in the United States, as it was known as [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] territory.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film portrays the accounts of [[Ruhal Ahmed]], [[Asif Iqbal (terror suspect)|Asif Iqbal]] and [[Shafiq Rasul]] (the '[[Tipton Three]]');<ref name=\"NYT20060428review\" /><ref name=\"Times2006\" /><ref>[[Channel 4]]: ''[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/feature.jsp?V=3&SV=5&id=154599 Michael Winterbottom on The Road To Guant\u00e1namo]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802203350/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/feature.jsp?V=3&SV=5&id=154599 |date=2 August 2009 }}</ref> three young British men from [[Tipton]] in the [[West Midlands conurbation|West Midlands]], who are of Pakistani and [[Bangladesh]]i ancestry. It features both actors and portrayals of actions, historical footage, and interviews with the three men.\n\nThey travelled to [[Pakistan]] in September 2001, just days after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] in the U.S., to attend a wedding of a friend of theirs. While staying at a mosque in [[Karachi]], the three decided to take a trip to [[Afghanistan]] to see first-hand what was happening in the region.\n\nMixed with interviews with the three men, and archive news footage from the period, the film portrays a dramatic account with actors of the three men's experiences: from their travels into Afghanistan to their capture and imprisonment.\n\nTravelling by van, Ruhal, Asif, and Shafiq, with two other friends, crossed the border in October 2001 just as US warplanes began attacking [[Taliban]] positions all over the country. They made it to [[Kandahar]] without incident, and later to the capital city of [[Kabul]] a few days later. After nearly a month of \"lingering\" aimlessly around Kabul, the Tipton Three decided to return to Pakistan. But through a combination of bad luck and the increasing chaos, the friends took the wrong bus, which travelled further into Afghanistan towards the north and the front-line fighting between the Taliban and the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] rebels. The convoy of vehicles they were riding in was hit by an airstrike, and they were left wandering around the unfamiliar country. In mid-November, near the town of [[Baghlan]], the three came across a group of Taliban fighters and asked to be taken to Pakistan. Shortly afterward, all of the men were captured by Northern Alliance soldiers.\n\nImprisoned at a base at [[Mazar-e Sharif]], the three were interrogated and discovered to be British citizens. As they had no luggage, money, passports or any kind of identification to support their stories, Ruhal, Asif, and Shafiq were transferred to the [[United States military]]. They were imprisoned in a [[US army]] stockade for a month with other prisoners, being regularly interrogated and occasionally beaten by US soldiers.\n\nIn January 2002, the 'Tipton Three' were declared \"[[enemy combatant]]s\" by the US military, and flown with dozens of other alleged Taliban and [[al-Qaeda]] fighters to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], where they were held for the next two years. They were held in mostly [[solitary confinement]] without charge or [[legal aid|legal representation]].\n\nThe film portrays several scenes depicting beatings during interrogation, the use of [[torture]] techniques such as [[stress position]]s, and attempts by the US Army to extract [[forced confession]]s of involvement with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The isolation continued in Camp X-Ray and another camp. During two years they were subjected to more questioning by US Army and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] interrogators.\n\nIn one incident, one US army guard at [[Camp X-Ray]] desecrated one prisoner's [[Qur'an]] by throwing it to the ground to incite a reaction from the rest of the prisoners. Ruhal witnessed a group of US soldiers severely beat up an unruly and mentally ill [[Arab]] prisoner for not obeying their orders. When Ruhal shouts out that the beatings violate the [[Geneva Conventions]], the guards laugh and say those laws do not apply to enemy combatants.\n\nIn 2004, the Tipton Three were released without charge. They were flown back to England where, one year later, they returned to Pakistan for the wedding they had planned to attend in the first place. (It had been postponed.)\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Riz Ahmed]] \u2013 Shafiq\n* Farhad Harun \u2013 Ruhel\n* Afran Usman \u2013 Asif Iqbal\n* [[Mark Holden (actor)|Mark Holden]] \u2013 Kandahar Interrogator #2\n\n==Production==\nThe torture depicted in the film had to be reduced from that claimed by the detainees for the benefit of the actors; according to the actor [[Riz Ahmed]], they were unable to bear the pain and had the shackles on their legs cushioned. They were also unable to remain in the stress positions depicted for more than an hour. The Tipton Three claim to have been left in such positions for up to eight hours.<ref name=\"UsingTerror\">[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1717953,00.html \"Using terror to fight terror\"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 26 February 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521164556/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1717953,00.html |date=21 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFilming took place in [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Iran]], which doubled as Cuba.

Michael Winterbottom won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[56th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\nCommentators have criticised Winterbottom for not questioning the decision of the Tipton Three to enter Afghanistan in the first place; a review in ''[[The Times]]'' (which gave the film 3 out of 5 stars) refers to this perceived lapse as\n\n<blockquote>an insane lack of cool perspective...The sheer stupidity of these Brits mocks the sincerity of the film.
