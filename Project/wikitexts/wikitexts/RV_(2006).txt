It stars [[Robin Williams]] in the lead role, [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Cheryl Hines]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]], [[JoJo (singer)|Joanna Levesque]], and [[Josh Hutcherson]]. Bob Munro (Williams) and his [[dysfunctional family]] rent an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] for a road trip from [[Los Angeles]] to the [[Colorado Rockies (mountains)|Colorado Rockies]], where they ultimately have to contend with a bizarre community of campers. It premiered at the Village Theater, Los Angeles on April 23, 2006. The North American theatrical release followed on April 28, 2006, and was released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on August 15, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nBob Munro, a successful [[California]] beverage company executive, is struggling to reconnect with his [[dysfunctional family]], which includes his materialistic wife, Jamie, his irritable and brash sixteen-year-old daughter, Cassie, and his mischievous twelve-year-old son, Carl, who is an aspiring [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] and likes [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. At a company picnic, Bob is embarrassed in front of his self-absorbed boss, Todd Mallory, by Cassie's militant friend, Gretchen, who hurls a bottle of schmaltz all over Todd's face for putting unhealthy drinks in schools. This causes Jamie to faint. Looking forward to a big family vacation in [[Hawaii]], the Munros are forced to cancel it when Todd, out of spite, tells Bob that he has to attend a [[merger]] meeting with the Alpine Soda company in [[Boulder, Colorado]] instead, or else he will be fired. Concealing the real reason for not going to Hawaii, he rents a [[wiktionary:garish|garish]] [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] from the dodgy dealer Irv and tells his family they are traveling to the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], much to their dismay.\n\nDuring their trip, the Munros have many mishaps, which include Bob damaging the parking brake, crashing into and running over various objects, flushing out a trio of [[raccoon]]s with a [[stink bomb]], and fixing a clogged sewage system. Along the way, the Munros meet another traveling family, the Gornickes, consisting of Travis, his wife Mary Jo, and their children, Earl, Moon, and Billy. Earl develops a romantic interest in Cassie, and Carl starts to like Moon, but thinking that the Gornickes are too strange for them, Bob and Jamie decide to ditch them. When they reappear at another stop, the Munros believe they are stalking them. Meanwhile, Bob tries to e-mail a [[Proposal (business)|proposal]] outline from his [[laptop]], working in restrooms. Eventually, a [[hitchhiker]] steals it, leaving him with only a [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], which he does manage to use to compose and wirelessly send his proposal to his company. The Gornickes then recover the stolen laptop after picking up the same hitchhiker and persuading him to return it.\n\nEventually, the Munros begin to enjoy their trip. In order to attend the meeting, Bob distracts his family by faking illness and sends them on a [[Hiking|hike]]. The meeting is a success, and Bob is invited to talk to the whole company again the next day. Rushing back to his family in the RV, he takes a treacherous [[4 wheel drive]] trail, and gets the huge RV stuck atop a [[mountain]] in the middle of the trail. He eventually manages to dislodge the RV from the mountain by getting on the front and rocking it until it eventually wobbles and tips forward enough to slide down from atop the mountain. Now riding on the front while it is traveling at a frenzied pace, Bob barely manages to return to his family in time. While Bob is attempting a similar ruse the next day, the parking brake fails again and the RV rolls into a lake. Bob comes clean about the true purpose of the trip, and his family becomes upset that he would treat them like that. Still needing to get to the meeting, he asks them for help, but they refuse. He retrieves one of their bicycles from the lake the RV rolled into and pedals off by himself. His family hitchhikes and is then picked up by the Gornickes, and soon realize how well they get along with each other.\n \nBob appears again, climbing atop the moving RV. He apologizes to his family, and they, in turn, apologize to him for their selfishness and reveal that they love him more than the lifestyle his job gives them. As support, the two families accompany Bob to the next meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, Bob starts his speech and it goes well, but then he has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and recommends against the merger, realizing that Todd's selfishness would destroy a great independent company. Todd gets upset and tries to dismiss Bob's claims, but Cassie backs her father up by saying Todd was outsourcing the company. In retaliation, Todd fires Bob on the spot. Carl gets angry at Todd and flips him over his shoulder, onto the ground. Bob then tells Todd that he quits anyhow. \n\nBob soon retrieves the sodden-but-still-operable RV from the lake. At the end, he is offered a job by the owners of Alpine Soda, who want to go national independently with Bob. In addition, at the same time, the parking brake fails once again, causing the RV to roll backwards, flattening both a police car and the Alpine Soda company owner's car.\n\nUltimately, the Munros and the Gornickes dance and sing \"[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Bob Munro\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Travis Gornicke\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] as Jamie Munro, Bob's wife\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Mary Jo Gornicke, Travis's wife\n* [[Joanna Levesque]] as Cassie Munro, Bob & Jamie's daughter\n** Erika-Shaye Gair as 5-year-old Cassie Munro\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Carl Munro, Bob & Jamie's son\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Todd Mallory, Bob's self-absorbed boss\n* [[Hunter Parrish]] as Earl Gornicke, Travis & Mary Jo's son\n* Chloe Sonnenfeld as Moon Gornicke, Travis & Mary Jo's daughter\n* [[Alex Ferris]] as Billy Gornicke, Travis & Mary Jo's son\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Howie\n* Rob LaBelle a Larry Moiphine\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Garry Moiphine\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Joseph \"Joe Joe\"\n* [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] as Irv\n* [[Richard Ian Cox]] as Laird (as Richard Cox)\n* [[Ty Olsson]] as Diablo Pass Officer\n\n==Production==\nThe film began principal photography in the [[Vancouver]] area and [[southern Alberta]] on May 25, 2005 and finished filming the following August.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe score was written by [[James Newton Howard]] and featured several members of the [[Lyle Lovett]] Band: [[Matt Rollings]] (keyboards), [[Russ Kunkel]] (drums), Ray Herndon (guitar), [[Viktor Krauss]] (bass), and Buck Reid (pedal steel).
