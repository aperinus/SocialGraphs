Wayne saves the life of mob boss Frank Milo during a hold-up in a convenience store. Milo offers Wayne a gift in return: for one week, he will have the \"personal services\" of Glory, a young woman who works as a bartender at Milo's club.\n\nWayne learns that Glory is trying to pay off a personal debt and wants nothing to do with Milo after the debt is paid off. After an awkward start, they fall in love. Wayne wants her to move into his apartment, but Milo has no intention of letting Glory go, saying that he owns her. When Wayne doesn't comply, Milo sends one of his thugs, Harold, to take Glory away by force, but Wayne's partner Mike is waiting and beats Harold in a fight. Milo tells Wayne that he has to pay $40,000 to give Glory her freedom.\n\nGlory rejects Wayne's attempts to buy her freedom, as she feels it represents her accepting being owned. As she walks down the street, Milo shows up. Wayne did his best to get the money, but falls short by $12,500. With Harold and an arriving Mike looking on, Wayne stands up to Milo himself, and after impulsively drawing his gun, ends up brawling with Milo in the street. Glory intervenes, suspecting that Milo might kill Wayne. Seeing that the two are in love with each other, Milo concedes and makes peace with Wayne and lets Glory go with no strings attached.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Wayne 'Mad Dog' Dobie\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Glory\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Frank Milo\n* [[David Caruso]] as Mike\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Harold\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Andrew the Beater\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Lee\n* Derek Anunciation as Shooter\nOther small appearances include [[J. J. Johnston]] as Shanlon, [[Jack Wallace (actor)|Jack Wallace]] as Tommy, comedian [[Richard Belzer]] as M.C. / Comic, and the film's screenwriter [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] as the Detective in Restaurant.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to a profile of producer Steven A. Jones written by [[Luke Ford (blogger)|Luke Ford]], the film was delayed by a year because of studio-required changes. Jones and director McNaughton were contractually required to deliver the film with no changes to the script written by Price. Universal [[Test screening|test-screened]] the film, then insisted on reshooting the film's final scene. As written, when Milo and Wayne fight, Milo dominates Wayne. Wayne's one connecting punch did no damage, but did serve to prompt Milo to realize that Glory was not worth fighting over.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite web |date= March 5, 2002 |last= Ford |first= Luke |author-link= Luke Ford |title= Profile of Producer Steven A.

Those who saw the test screenings could not accept the fact that De Niro's Wayne had done so poorly against Murray's Milo.<ref name=\"jones\" />\n\nOther reshoots for the film were done to make Glory seem less manipulative and Milo more of a puppet-master behind Glory's actions.<ref name=\"jones\" />\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported 77% of 31 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.3/10.
