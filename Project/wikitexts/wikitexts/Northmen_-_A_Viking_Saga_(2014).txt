There, they are attacked by soldiers who guard princess Inghean, who is on her way to her wedding. The Vikings defeat the soldiers and take Inghean with them as a hostage with the intent of using the ransom money to buy entry into friendly land. Along the way, they meet a Christian [[monk]] who grants them aid and shelter. Meanwhile, Inghean's father, King Dunchaid, tasks a mercenary force to pursue the Vikings; knowing of Inghean's distaste for their group, the mercenary leaders plan to kill both her and the Vikings, an order not out of character for the tyrant king. The group, including the princess, learn of their plan from a captured soldier.\n\nAs the mercenaries attack the tower where the monk and the Vikings are sheltered, the group manages to escape and stay ahead of their pursuers. The monk offers to show the Vikings the way to the Viking settlement [[Danelaw]], where they would be safe. Along the way, they are repeatedly attacked by the mercenaries, but the Vikings eventually defeat them, suffering some casualties. After reaching a cliffside with transport to Danelaw, the survivors find themselves trapped by King Dunchaid and his troops. Asbj\u00f6rn jumps into the water, seemingly to his death, but manages to retrieve a boat from an underwater cave. The surviving Vikings jump after him, joined by the monk and Inghean, who elects to stay with the group. Together, the group rows towards Danelaw.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hopper]] as Asbj\u00f6rn\n* [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Conall\n* [[Ken Duken]] as Thorald\n* [[Charlie Murphy (actress)|Charlie Murphy]] as Inghean\n* [[Ed Skrein]] as Hjorr\n* [[Anatole Taubman]] as Bovarr\n* [[Leo Gregory]] as Jorund\n* [[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]] as Bjorn\n* [[Darrell D'Silva]] as Gunnar\n* [[Johan Hegg]] as Valli\n* [[Danny Keogh]] as King Dunchaid\n\n==Production==\nThe film is directed by Hollywood-based [[Switzerland|Swiss]] director [[Claudio F\u00e4h]] from a script by Austrians Mattias Bauer and Bastian Zach, the writers of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] horror film ''[[One Way Trip 3D]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754314/|title=One Way Trip (2011)|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] score of 50 out of 100, based on five critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/northmen-a-viking-saga|title=Northmen: A Viking SagaReviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=May 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2290553}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|northmen_a_viking_saga}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKhXt8hNu78 Teaser trailer (English)]\n\n{{Claudio F\u00e4h}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Claudio F\u00e4h]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Viking Age]]\n[[Category:Historical action films]]\n[[Category:2010s historical action films]]\n[[Category:Swiss historical films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
