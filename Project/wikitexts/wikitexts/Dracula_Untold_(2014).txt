In this adaptation, [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] is the monster alter ego of historical figure [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III \"the Impaler\" Dr\u0103culea]]. [[Luke Evans]] portrays the title character, with [[Sarah Gadon]], [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Art Parkinson]], and [[Charles Dance]] cast in supporting roles. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Northern Ireland]] on August 5, 2013.\n\n[[Universal Pictures]] released the film in regular and [[IMAX]] cinemas on October 10, 2014. ''Dracula Untold'' grossed $217 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summary for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. At the time of this notice this summary is exactly 700 words -->\nIn the 15th century, [[Count Dracula|Vlad Dr\u0103culea]] is the Prince of [[Wallachia]] and [[Transylvania]]. As a child, he was a royal [[Ward (law)|ward]] in the palace of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite [[Janissary]] corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called \"[[Vlad the Impaler]], [[Vlad II Dracul|Son of the Dragon]]\", after slaughtering thousands by [[Impalement|impaling]] them on spears, but became sickened by his own acts and abandoned his past.\n\nNow ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's [[retinue]]. Vlad barely escapes and returns to his castle, where he learns from a local [[monk]] that the creature is a [[vampire]], a Roman from the days of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] named Caligula, who was tricked by a demon for personal success and great powers, but was trapped in the cave as the price for this. Vlad celebrates an [[Easter]] feast with his wife Mirena and son \u00cengera\u0219, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the [[Ambassador|emissary]] wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition.\n\nKnowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken by having given the darkness a worthy offering to plague the world like himself. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad single-handedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to [[Cozia Monastery]] for safety.\n\nMirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attacking them for blood. Vlad's sudden increased strength also arouses suspicion among his subjects.\n\nThat night, the [[Ottoman army]] marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap \u00cengera\u0219. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Despite his superhuman speed, Vlad cannot reach her in time. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises and lifts his curse, so that he will have the strength to save their son. Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers, and in doing so he frees the ancient vampire from his cave by breaking the magical seal imprisoning him. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to block out the sun. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.\n\nAt the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding \u00cengera\u0219 captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human \u2014 and impairing his vision \u2014 as Mehmed fights him with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name \"Dracula, Son of the Devil\", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood. Vlad then sends \u00cengera\u0219 away before his vampire army preys on him, and dispels the storm clouds so that the vampires, including himself, will burn away and die in the light. However, a man who had previously observed Vlad's nature and wished to serve him drags his dying body out of the sunlight and offers him his blood, which restores Vlad to life. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, \u00cengera\u0219 is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia.\n\nIn the present day, Vlad now known as Dracula meets a woman named [[Mina Harker|Mina]] who strikingly resembles Mirena, in the streets of modern [[London]]. The vampire who cursed Vlad watches them from afar. As they walk away, he follows, saying \"Let the games begin\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Evans]] as [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III \"the Impaler\" Dr\u0103culea]] / [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]: Known as the [[Vlad II Dracul|Son of the Dragon]], Vlad is a prince and war hero, who becomes a [[monster]] known as a [[vampire]] to protect and defend his family and kingdom.<ref name=\"Luke\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]]<ref name=\"Dominic\" /> as Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as Mirena, Vlad's wife<ref name=\"Sarah\" />\n** Gadon also portrays [[Mina Murray]] as a part of the present-day ending\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as \u00cengera\u0219, son of Vlad and Mirena<ref name=\"got\" />\n* [[Charles Dance]]<ref name=\"got\" /> as the Master Vampire, the one who turns Vlad into a vampire.\n* [[Will Houston|William Houston]] as Cazan, Vlad's advisor\n* [[Diarmaid Murtagh]] as Dumitru, one of Vlad's men\n* [[Noah Huntley]] as Captain Petru, one of Vlad's men\n* [[Paul Kaye]] as Brother Lucian, a monk\n* [[Zach McGowan]] as Shkelgim, a mysterious Romani<ref name=\"Zach\" />\n* [[Ferdinand Kingsley]] as [[Hamza Bey]], one of Mehmed's generals\n* [[Joseph Long (actor)|Joseph Long]] as [[Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey]], one of Mehmed's generals\n* [[Thor Kristjansson]] as Bright Eyes, an assassin in the Ottoman Army<ref name=\"got\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 45%\n| quote = Anybody who\u2019s going to the film expecting a horror film, is going to be sorely disappointed.
