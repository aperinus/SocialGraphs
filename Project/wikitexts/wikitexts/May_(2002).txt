Starring [[Angela Bettis]], [[Jeremy Sisto]], [[Anna Faris]], and [[James Duval]], the film follows a lonely young woman (Bettis) traumatized by a difficult childhood, and her increasingly desperate attempts to connect with the people around her.\n\nAlthough ''May'' was [[Box office bomb|unsuccessful at the box office]], it received favorable reviews from critics, and is now considered a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott|title=May |url=https://avclub.com/articles/may,58566/ |work=AV Club |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nMay Canady is a woman in her mid-twenties, who suffered from a troubled childhood due to her [[Strabismus|lazy eye]]. She has very few social interactions, her only \"true friend\" being a glass-encased doll named Suzie made by her mother and given to May for her birthday with the adage \"If you can't find a friend, make one.\" May works as a vet assistant. Her optometrist fixes May's lazy eye, first with glasses, then with contact lens. May becomes friends with Adam, a local mechanic. She has a fixation on his hands, which she considers to be the most attractive part of him, and they start dating. May's lesbian colleague, Polly, begins to flirt with May. One day, May remarks that Polly has a beautiful neck. During their flirtation, Polly gives May a pet cat, Lupe.\n\nMay invites Adam to her apartment and he shows her a film that he made for his university titled ''Jack and Jill''. The film reveals a story of two young lovers, who go on a picnic, and end up [[Cannibalism|eating each other]]. May becomes aroused by the cannibalism in the film. During an intense make-out session, she bites Adam on the lip, and it bleeds. Disturbed, Adam abruptly leaves. May shouts at Suzie and shoves her in the cupboard. She begins volunteering at a school for blind children, where she takes a liking to a sullen young girl named Petey, who makes her a clay ashtray with the name \"MAY\" pressed into it. She gives in to Polly's advances and starts a short affair. Adam stops calling her and May overhears him say that he is glad he could get rid of her. Devastated, she visits Polly, but finds her with another girl named Ambrosia, furthering May's grief. When even Lupe refuses to come near her, May becomes enraged and throws Petey's ashtray at her, killing the cat and shattering the ashtray. She becomes delusional, and believes that Suzie is talking to her.\n\nMay takes Suzie to school and tells the blind children that Suzie is her best friend. The children struggle to take the doll out of the glass case, and the case shatters. May and the children are cut by the broken glass. Scooping up the ruined doll, May returns home devastated. The following day, she meets a young [[Punk subculture|punk]]. He asks her if she wants to get some candy with him, and she accepts. May does not admire him very much, but likes the tattoo on his arm. At her house, he finds the cat's corpse, and calls May a freak. May breaks down and stabs him in the head, killing him. After putting much thought into her future actions, May claims she needs \"more parts\".\n\nOn Halloween night, May dresses in a homemade costume resembling Suzie, adopts a normal personality, and goes to Polly's house, where she slits her throat with a pair of surgical scalpels. When Ambrosia arrives, May stabs her in the temples. Next, she visits Adam and his new girlfriend at his house. May murders both of them with the scalpels. At home, she designs her \"new friend\", a life-sized patchwork doll made from the punk's arms, Polly's neck, Ambrosia's legs, Adam's hands, his girlfriend's ears, and Lupe's fur for the hair. Using the broken remnants of the \"MAY\" ashtray to form an anagram, she names the doll \"Amy\". She realizes that Amy has no eyes and cannot \"see\" her, so she gouges out her lazy eye. Crying in pain and bleeding, she puts the eye on Amy's head and begs the doll to look at her. She collapses on the bed beside the doll, and caresses it. Her creation comes to life, and brushes her face affectionately with Adam's hands.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angela Bettis]] as May Dove Canady \n** [[Chandler Riley Hecht]] as young May Dove Canady\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Adam Stubbs \n* [[Anna Faris]] as Polly \n* [[Nichole Hiltz]] as Ambrosia\n* [[James Duval]] as the punk boy (\"Blank\")\n* [[Ken Davitian]] as Foreign Doctor\n* [[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]] as Papa Canady\n* [[Merle Kennedy]] as Mama Canady\n* Rachel David as Petey David\n* [[Nora Zehetner]] as Adam Stubbs's new girlfriend (\"Hoop\")\n* [[Will Estes]] as Chris, Adam Stubbs's roommate\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n''May'' also features a [[Film score|score]] and original songs by [[Jammes Luckett]] of the rock group [[Poperratic]] (then known as Alien Tempo Experiment 13).\n\nAdditional artists on the soundtrack include [[The Breeders]], [[The Kelley Deal 6000]], H Is Orange, Strangels, Thrill My Wife, The Wedding's Off, Angelo Metz, and [[Tommy James and the Shondells]].\n\nSome of Luckett's music from the film was released on the 2007 CD ''May and Other Selected Works of Jaye Barnes Luckett'' by La-La Land Records.\n\n==Release==\n''May'' was given a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] to nine theaters in North America.

[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 69% of 67 critics have given the film a positive review, with a [[average|rating average]] of 6.08 out of 10.

Bettis' performance was also praised. [[Roger Ebert]] granted the film four stars out of four, and called it \"a horror film and something more and deeper, something disturbing and oddly moving\" and characterized the denouement as \"a final shot that would get laughs in another kind of film, but ''May'' earns the right to it, and it works, and we understand it\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030606/REVIEWS/306060303/1023|title=May ::rogerebert.com :: Reviews|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 6, 2003|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine critic David Rooney turned in a review that was more middle of the road, stating that the film was \"More successful when the title character finally embarks on her bloody mission than in the dawdling buildup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117916759|title=May Review|last=Rooney|first=David|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 15, 2002|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Stephen Holden]] opined that \"the performances are a cut or two above what you would find in the average [[slasher film]].
