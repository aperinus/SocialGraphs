[[Jean Rochefort]] stars as the title character.  [[Anna Galiena]] co-stars.\n\nThe film received the [[Prix Louis Delluc]].  In 1991 it was nominated for \"Best Foreign-Language Film\" in the [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins with a flashback from the titular character, Antoine.  We are introduced to his fixation with female [[hairdresser]]s which began at a young age.  The film uses flashbacks throughout and there are frequent parallels drawn with the past.  Though Antoine tells Mathilde that 'the past is dead', his life is evidence that on some level the past repeats itself.  As a young boy he fantasised about a hairdresser who died by suicide and as a man in his 50s he begins an affair with a hairdresser which ends after ten years in her suicide.  However, there are differences: Mathilde dies by suicide because she is so happy she is afraid of the happiness she has found with Antoine ending.\n\nWe are unsure what Antoine has done with his life; we know, however, that he has fulfilled his childhood ambition: to marry a hairdresser.  The reality proves to be every bit as wonderful as the fantasy and the two enjoy an enigmatic, enclosed and enchanting relationship.  The final sequence shows Antoine, in the salon, dancing to Eastern music just as he has done throughout his life.  His last line is the enigmatic comment that the hairdresser will return.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jean Rochefort]] as Antoine\n*[[Anna Galiena]] as Mathilde\n*[[Roland Bertin]] as Antoine's father\n*[[Maurice Chevit]] as Ambroise Dupr\u00e9 dit Isidore Agopian\n*[[Jacques Mathou]] as Mr. Chardon\n*[[Philippe Cl\u00e9venot]] as Morvoisieux\n*[[Anne-Marie Pisani]] as Madame Shaeffer\n*[[Albert Delpy]] as Donecker\n*[[Mich\u00e8le Laroque]] as Adopted Child's Mother\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received the 1990 [[Prix Louis Delluc]] which it shared with ''[[The Little Gangster|Le Petit Criminel]]'' by [[Jacques Doillon]].
