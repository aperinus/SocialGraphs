Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]].\n\n==Performance and participation==\n[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]\n\nTheatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed and performed in a theatre setting but it is not a requirement. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] such as [[Bharatanatyam]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas such as [[dragon dance]]. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].\n\nParticipatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], or building flexibility of participants rather than to serve any benefit to onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women, and children may or must participate.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of dance}}\n[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]\n[[archeology|Archaeological]] evidence for early dance includes 10,000-year-old paintings in [[Madhya Pradesh, India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]],<ref name=\"YM\">{{cite book |last1=Mathpal |first1=Yashodhar |title=Prehistoric Painting Of Bhimbetka |date=1984 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=9788170171935 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GG7-CpvlU30C&pg=PA220 |language=en}}</ref> and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

[[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''\"the text of dramaturgy\"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types--secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive--and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other [[contemporary dance]] forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.\n\n==Music ==\n{{main|Dance music}}\n[[File:Dancing girls in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Two women dance at a [[pop music]] concert in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]].]]\nDance is generally, however not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]]. The choreography and music go hand in hand, as they complement each other to express a story told by the choreographer and or dancers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Relationship Between Dance And Music {{!}}{{!}} Dotted Music|url=https://dottedmusic.com/2014/lifestyle/relationship-between-dance-and-music/|access-date=2021-10-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Rhythm ==\n[[Rhythm]] and dance are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; \"The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\">Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50</ref> A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the \"beat\" or \"tactus\") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.\n[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a \"slow\", lasts for one beat, so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted \u2013 \"slow-slow\" \u2013 while many additional figures are counted \"slow \u2013 quick-quick.<ref>Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38</ref>\n\nJust as musical rhythms (e.g., [[drum beats]]) are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depend on alternating \"strong\" and \"weak\" muscular movements.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\">Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4</ref> Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. Since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other \u2013 such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike \u2013 some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49</ref> Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\n\n[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund \u2013 The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; \"Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity.\"]]\nThe very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an \"initial skeleton of rhythmic beats\" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3</ref> just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/>\n\nMusical accompaniment, therefore, arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the \"measures and perfect concords of harmony\" that fall upon the human ear,<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/> while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying \"I have piped and ye have not danced\",<ref>Matthew 11:17</ref> writes;\n\n{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest.

Shawn concurs, stating that dance \"was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew\" and that even the \"[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting was performed simultaneously\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\"/> \u2013 an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term \"foot\" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\n\n[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the \"incalculable\" influence of dance upon music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |author-link1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |chapter=Dance }}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him \"to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism\", to develop \"a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves\" and ultimately to seek the connections between \"the art of music and the art of dance\", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii</ref> He concluded that \"musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion\".<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181</ref>\n\nHence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, \"it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance\", nevertheless the \"two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music\",<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54</ref> the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named \"[[waltz]]\" or \"[[minuet]]\", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of \"measure\" or \"metre\" from poetry.\n\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents \"according to physiological law\", that of \"plastic rhythm\" (i.e. dance) \"is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations\".\n\nShawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a \"man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all\", being \"the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units\", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that \"it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.\"<ref>Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\n[[File:Dinastia tang, due danzatrici, cina del nord, 650 ca..JPG|thumb|[[Tang dynasty]] female dancers]]\n\n===Theatrical===\nConcert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2</ref> Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely \"plotless\" ballets in the 20th century<ref>Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92</ref> and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n\nThe [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,<ref>Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967</ref> all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].\n\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the \"rhythm and shape\" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''</ref> while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of \"primitive rhythmic movements\",<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86</ref> a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.<ref>Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin</ref>\n\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and \"pure\" dance. In this case, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.\n\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).<ref name=\"Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares\">{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki \u00ab MIT Global Shakespeares | access-date=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Fury\u016b Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.<ref name=\"Ortolani\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&q=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no&pg=PA132 |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0-691-04333-3}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory and social===\n[[File:Dela Says Yippee at YDW 2019.webm|thumb|A [[contra dance]], a form of participatory social folk dance with mixed European roots]]\n[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.<ref>Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P.

Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.\n\nThere are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''\"Odra Magadhi\"'', which after decades-long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P.C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.</ref>\n\nThe [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.\n\nThe [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient \"[[Ayurvedic]]\" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], \"The yakun natima&nbsp;\u2014 devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|An [[Indonesia]]n [[Balinese dance]]r]]\n[[Dances in Indonesia|Indonesian dances]] reflect the richness and diversity of Indonesian ethnic groups and [[Culture of Indonesia|cultures]]. There are more than 1,300 [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]], it can be seen from the cultural roots of the [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] and [[Melanesian peoples]], and various cultural influences from [[Asia]] and the west. Dances in [[Indonesia]] originate from ritual movements and religious ceremonies, this kind of dance usually begins with rituals, such as war dances, shaman dances to cure or ward off disease, dances to call rain and other types of dances. With the acceptance of dharma religion in the 1st century in Indonesia, [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhist]] rituals were celebrated in various artistic performances. Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]] and also the [[Panji tales|Panji]] became the inspiration to be shown in a dance-drama called \"Sendratari\" resembling \"[[Ramayana Ballet|ballet]]\" in the western tradition. An elaborate and highly stylized dance method was invented and has survived to this day, especially on the islands of [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. The Javanese [[Wayang wong]] dance takes footage from the Ramayana or Mahabharata episodes, but this dance is very different from the Indian version, indonesian dances do not pay as much attention to the \"[[mudra]]s\" as Indian dances: even more to show local forms. The sacred [[Javanese people|Javanese]] ritual dance [[Bedhaya]] is believed to date back to the [[Majapahit]] period in the 14th century or even earlier, this dance originated from ritual dances performed by virgin girls to worship Hindu Gods such as [[Shiva]], [[Brahma]], and [[Vishnu]]. In Bali, dance has become an integral part of the sacred Hindu Dharma rituals. Some experts believe that [[Balinese dance]] comes from an older dance tradition from Java. Reliefs from temples in [[East Java]] from the 14th century feature crowns and headdresses similar to the headdresses used in Balinese dance today. [[Islam]] began to spread to the [[Indonesian archipelago]] when indigenous dances and dharma dances were still popular. Artists and dancers still use styles from the previous era, replacing stories with more Islamic interpretations and clothing that is more closed according to Islamic teachings.<ref name=\"Folk Dances Indonesia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia-tourism.com/general/theatre.html |work=Indonesia Tourism |title=The Indonesian Folk Dances |access-date=30 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124083455/http://indonesia-tourism.com/general/theatre.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Middle Eastern dance|dances of the Middle East]] are usually the traditional forms of [[circle dance|circle dancing]] which are modernized to an extent.

Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name=\"lecomte\"/>\n\n[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].\n\n[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence.

The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&vid=11&hid=4104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre & Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}</ref> \n\n===Teachers===\nDance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both.
