In the film, a boy named Victor Frankenstein uses the power of electricity to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] his dead [[Bull Terrier]], Sparky, but his peers discover what he has done and reanimate their own deceased pets and other creatures, resulting in mayhem.\n\n''Frankenweenie'' came development in December 2007, when Burton was asked to direct two 3D films for Disney, including a [[Live-action|live-action adaptation]] of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. However, the development of a full-length stop motion dates as far back as November 2005, when scripts had been written by [[Josann McGibbon]] and Sara Parriott. The [[tongue-in-cheek]] film contains numerous references to and [[parodies]] of elements of ''Frankenstein'' and past film versions of it, other literary classics, various horror and science-fiction films, and other films which Burton has directed or produced.\n\n''Frankenweenie'', which was both the first [[black-and-white]] feature-length film and the first stop-motion film to be released in [[IMAX 3D]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|title=Disney to Release Tim Burton's Frankenweenie in IMAX 3D|url=https://collider.com/frankenweenie-imax-3d/150366/|access-date=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Collider|date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 20, 2012 and was released in the United States on October 5, to generally positive reviews for its visuals and story and moderate box office returns.

His intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, who include his somber next-door neighbor Elsa Van Helsing who is the niece of Mayor Burgermeister, the mischievous Edgar \"E\" Gore, the obese and gullible Bob, the overconfident Toshiaki, the creepy Nassor, and an eccentric girl nicknamed \"Weird Girl\", but he does not interact much with them due to his relationship with his dog. Concerned with his son's isolation, Victor's father encourages the boy to take up [[baseball]]. When Victor hits a [[home run]] at his first game, Sparky chases the ball and is struck and killed by a car, leaving Victor despondent.\n\nInspired by his new science teacher Mr. Rzykruski's demonstration of [[Galvanism|the effect of electricity on dead frogs]], Victor digs up Sparky, brings the dog to a makeshift laboratory in his attic, and successfully reanimates his old friend with a bolt of lightning. While Victor is at school the next day, Sparky escapes from the attic to chase Weird Girl's cat, Mr. Whiskers, and subsequently explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to raise the dead. Together, the two resurrect a dead [[goldfish]], which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the fish to his classmates, but when he tries to show it to a skeptical Nassor, it is gone, leading him to speculate that the revived creatures only last for a short time.\n\nFearful of losing the upcoming science fair, Toshiaki and Bob make a rocket out of soda bottles, and Bob breaks his arm when they test it. Mr. Rzykruski is blamed for the accident and fired by Mayor Burgermeister and the adults, who are confused by and jealous of his intelligence. The gym teacher replaces him. Before Mr. Rzykruski leaves the school, he is able to talk with Victor and advise the boy to use science wisely. Edgar accidentally reveals to Toshiaki, Nassor, and Bob that he and Victor had brought the invisible fish back from the dead, and that Victor had done the same with Sparky, which inspires them to try reanimation themselves.\n\nVictor's parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. His father starts to talk to him about the seriousness of what he has done, but Victor tearfully tells them that he just wanted his dog back, so his parents decide to help him find Sparky and continue the conversation later.\n\nWhen the family leaves, Victor's classmates invade the lab and discover the reanimation instructions. They perform their experiments separately, but each of their dead animals is turned into a monster: Mr. Whiskers holds a dead [[bat]] while he is electrocuted, resulting in both animals being fused into a grotesque vampiric feline; the dead [[rat]] Edgar found in the garbage turns into a wererat; Nassor's [[Mummy (monster)|mummified]] [[hamster]] Colossus comes back to life; Toshiaki's [[turtle]] Shelley is covered in [[Miracle Gro]] and becomes a huge [[Gamera]]-like monster; and Bob's [[Sea-Monkeys]] grow into [[Gremlins|Gremlin]]-like amphibious humanoids. The monsters converge on the town fair, where they wreak havoc.\n\nAfter Victor finds Sparky at the town's pet cemetery, Bob and Toshiaki find him and ask for his help dealing with the monsters. They go to the fair, where the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salted [[popcorn]], Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, and the wererat and Shelley both return to their original, deceased forms after getting electrocuted. During the chaos, Persephone, Elsa's pet poodle, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town [[windmill]], with Elsa and Victor giving pursuit. The townsfolk blame Sparky for Elsa's disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which Elsa's uncle accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa and Persephone, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers, who is fatally impaled by a flaming piece of wood just before the windmill collapses, killing Sparky again.\n\nTo reward him for his bravery, the townsfolk gather and revive Sparky with their car batteries. Persephone runs to Sparky and they touch noses, producing a spark.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Frankenweenie premiere at the Fantastic Fest, Tim Burton, Winona Ryder, Martin Landau, Charlie Tahan 2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Tim Burton]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Charlie Tahan]], and [[Allison Abbate]] at the film's premiere at the [[Fantastic Fest]] in Austin, Texas.]]\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as:\n** Susan Frankenstein, Victor's mother.\n** Weird Girl, Victor's unnamed eccentric classmate who is obsessed with the psychic predictions of her cat Mr. Whiskers.\n** The Gym Teacher who replaces Mr. Rzykruski as science teacher when he gets fired and has no knowledge of science.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[Martin Short]] as:\n** Edward Frankenstein, Victor's father.\n** Mr. Burgermeister, the grumpy Mayor of New Holland who is the Frankenstein family's next-door neighbor and Elsa's uncle.

Compared to other stop-motion animation sets, ''Frankenweenie''{{'}}s set was much larger.\n\nAs IGN noted, the main character Sparky had to be \"'dog-size' compared to the other human characters, but also large enough to house all the elements of the mechanical skeleton secreted within his various foam and silicon-based incarnation\". The mechanics were small and delicate, and in some instances the filmmakers had to have Swiss watchmakers create the tiny nuts and bolts. Around 200 separate puppets were used in the film, with roughly 18 different versions of Victor.
