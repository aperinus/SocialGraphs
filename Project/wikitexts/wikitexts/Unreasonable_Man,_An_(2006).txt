The film was created to defend Nader and restore his reputation after his controversial role in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]].\n\nThe film presents interviews with current and former members of Nader's Raiders, including [[Joan Claybrook]] and [[Robert Fellmeth]], as well as political commentators such as [[Phil Donahue]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Eric Alterman]]. The film takes its name from the [[George Bernard Shaw]] quotation, \"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\"\n\n==Summary== \nThe first half of the film examines Nader's advocacy for [[auto safety]] features, such as federally mandated [[seat belts]] and [[air bags]], as well as his rise to national prominence following an [[invasion of privacy]] lawsuit against [[General Motors]]. It also examines the formation of independent advocacy groups (termed \"[[Nader's Raiders]]\") during the 1970s; organizations which carried out independent research on various federal agencies, such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Over the next thirty years, the film argues, Nader \"built a legislative record that would be the envy of any modern president.\"\n\nThe second half of the film traces Nader's shift to a [[grassroots organizing|grassroots form of organizing]] focused on citizen power, including his disillusionment with the [[two-party system]] following the rise of [[Reaganism]]. The film examines Nader's effect as a [[Third party (politics)|third party candidate]] on the results of the controversial [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]].\n\n==Response==\nThe documentary has an aggregate of 92 percent based on 63 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a score of 75 percent based on 24 review on [[Metacritic]].<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unreasonable_man/ Rotten Tomatoes page on An Unreasonable Man]</ref><ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/unreasonableman?q=an%20unreasonable%20man Metacritic page on An Unreasonable Man]</ref>\n\n==Festival screenings==\n*Meaford International Film Festival 2007<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-02-07|title=MIFF 2007 Archives|url=https://meafordfilmfest.ca/category/miff-2007/|website=Meaford International Film Festival}}</ref>\n*Sundance Film Festival\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official Website}}\n*[https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/unreasonableman/ ''An Unreasonable Man''] site for [[Independent Lens]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]\n*{{IMDb title|0492499}}\n* {{Amg movie|339975|An Unreasonable Man}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=unreasonable_man|title=An Unreasonable Man}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ycR36N68R8 ''An Unreasonable Man'' trailer (YouTube)]\n\n{{Ralph Nader}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unreasonable Man}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:Biographical documentary films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Ralph Nader]]\n[[Category:Works about consumer protection]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about American politicians]]\n[[Category:Films about activists]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
