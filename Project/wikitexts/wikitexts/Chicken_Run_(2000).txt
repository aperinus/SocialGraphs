The farm is run by the middle-aged childless couple; the cruel Mrs. Tweedy and her oafish husband Mr. Tweedy, who kill and eat any chicken that is no longer able to lay eggs. The chickens try to escape frequently, but are always caught. Frustrated at the minuscule and declining profits that the farm generates, Mrs. Tweedy spots a magazine advertisement and gets an idea of converting the farm to automated production and having a machine turn the chickens into [[pot pie|meat pies]], despite Mr. Tweedy's reluctance. Mr. Tweedy suspects the chickens' sapience and wonders if they are plotting, but Mrs. Tweedy dismisses his theories.\n\nOne day, the chickens' leader, Ginger, witnesses an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes crash-land in the farm's coop; the chickens put his damaged wing in a [[Orthopedic cast|cast]] and hide him from the Tweedys, who were promised a handsome reward by Rocky's owner for his return. Interested in Rocky's apparent flying abilities, Ginger begs him to help teach her and the chickens to fly. Rocky gives them training lessons while Mr. Tweedy builds the pie machine. Ginger suspects that Tweedys plan to kill the chickens after they increase their food whilst apparently not being concerned that they have not laid any eggs. After Ginger and Rocky get into an argument over alerting the others to the impending prospect of death, Rocky holds a morale-boosting dance party during which it is revealed that his wing is healed; Ginger insists he demonstrates flying the next day, but Mr. Tweedy finishes the pie machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves her and inadvertently sabotages the machine, buying them time to warn the chickens and plan an escape from the farm.\n\nThe next day, Ginger finds Rocky has left, leaving behind part of a poster revealing him as a former cannon stunt actor who is unable to fly, depressing her and the others. After a fight breaks out, Ginger is inspired by elderly rooster Fowler's stories of his time in the [[Royal Air Force]] to create a plane to flee the farm.\n\nThe chickens\u2014with help from Nick and Fetcher (two rats who smuggle contraband in exchange for eggs)\u2014assemble parts for the plane as Mr. Tweedy fixes the machine. Mrs. Tweedy orders Mr. Tweedy to gather all the chickens for the machine, but the chickens attack him, leaving him bound and [[gag]]ged as they finish the plane. Meanwhile, Rocky encounters a billboard advertising Mrs. Tweedy's chicken pies and returns to the farm out of guilt for abandoning the chickens. An alerted Mrs. Tweedy attacks Ginger as she helps the plane take off but is subdued by Rocky, who leaves with Ginger by holding onto a line of [[Christmas lights]] snagged by the departing plane. Mrs. Tweedy follows by climbing up the lights with an axe; Ginger dodges an axe swipe which cuts through the line, sending Mrs. Tweedy falling into the safety valve of the pie machine and causing it to explode. Having freed himself, Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy of his warning that the chickens were sapient, causing her to scream in anger. The still-standing barn door then collapses which lands on Mrs. Tweedy, crushing her.\n\nThe chickens celebrate their victory while Ginger and Rocky kiss, and they fly to an island that they make their home. During the credits, Nick and Fetcher discuss starting their own chicken farm so they can have all the eggs they could eat, but then end up arguing over whether the [[chicken or the egg]] came first on top of a chicken sanctuary \"Keep Off\" sign.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n\n* [[Julia Sawalha]] as Ginger, the de-facto British leader of the chickens who is determined to protect her friends from facing certain death.\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Rocky Rhodes, an American circus rooster who crash-lands on the coop and must teach the chickens to fly.\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Melisha Tweedy, Mr. Tweedy's evil, greedy, abusive, and power-hungry wife and owner of the farm who wants to make the chickens into pies.\n* [[Tony Haygarth]] as Mr. Willard Tweedy, Mrs. Tweedy's oafish and hen-pecked husband and owner.
