It is directed by [[Danny Cannon]] and stars [[Sylvester Stallone]] in the title role, a law enforcement officer in the crime-ridden futuristic metropolis of [[Mega-City One]]. The film co-stars [[Armand Assante]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Rob Schneider]], [[Joan Chen]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], and [[Max von Sydow]]. It was filmed entirely at [[Shepperton Studios]] in the United Kingdom, and released by [[Buena Vista Pictures]] on June 30, 1995.\n\nThe film takes place in the year 2080 and depicts a dystopian world. Following an unspecified disaster that turned Earth into a \"cursed\" wasteland, the survivors established a corps of Judges whose role combines that of police, judge, jury and executioner. In ''Judge Dredd'', Dredd, one of the most dedicated [[Judge (2000 AD)|Street Judges]], has been framed for murder by his own half-brother \u2014 the psychotic Rico, who plots to take over Mega-City One with an army of superhuman clones. The film was produced by Charles Lippincott and Beau E. L. Marks, with a screenplay by [[William Wisher Jr.]] and [[Steven E. de Souza]].\n\nReviewers criticized the film for its script and perceived lack of originality and faith to its source material, along with Stallone's acting. The film is often considered to be one of Stallone's worst films,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flickchart.com/Charts.aspx?genre=Sci-Fi+Action&perpage=100&order=desc|title=The Top 100 Worst Sci-Fi Action Movies of All Time|website=Flickchart|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=August 9, 2010  |author=Mike Thompson |url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/sylvester-stallone-best-and-worst-movies|title=Sylvester Stallone: All Films Considered |work=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2017-03-31 }}</ref> but its visual style, effects, music score, stunts and action sequences were praised, and the film was nominated for four [[Saturn Award]]s. A reboot film, entitled ''[[Dredd]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n== Plot ==\nBy the 2080s, much of Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland. While some humans manage to survive in the barren \"Cursed Earth\", the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of tens of millions. To combat crime, the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]]s whose role combines those of [[police officer]], [[judge]], [[jury]], and [[executioner]].\n\nIn [[Mega-City One]], 2139, [[Judge Dredd (character)|Joseph Dredd]], one of the most dedicated \"Street Judges\", assists first-year [[Judge Hershey|Judge Barbara Hershey]] in ending a block war. [[Fergee|Herman \"Fergee\" Ferguson]], a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] just released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot. Dredd arrests Herman for destruction of property, and sentences him to five years' imprisonment. [[Rico Dredd|Rico]], a former Judge, escapes from prison and returns to Mega-City One to reclaim his uniform and \"[[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]]\" gun. He also finds and reactivates a decommissioned [[ABC Warriors|ABC Warrior]] combat robot.\n\nVartis Hammond, a news reporter critical of Dredd, is murdered, and Dredd becomes the chief suspect. Dredd is taken to a trial before a [[tribunal]] of Council Judges including Griffin and [[Chief Judge Fargo|Chief Justice Fargo]], his mentor. Dredd is found guilty as his [[DNA]] is found on the bullets used to kill Hammond (a feature of the Lawgiver is imprinting the user's DNA on each bullet, a fact apparently unknown by most Judges). To save Dredd, Fargo steps down as Chief Justice and, for his last request, asks the Council to spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on the \"long walk\", in which a retiring Judge ventures into the wasteland \"to bring law to the lawless\". [[Judge Griffin]], who freed Rico to [[frameup|frame]] Dredd for the murder, becomes Chief Justice and instructs Rico to cause chaos in the city.\n\nDredd is taken to the [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] penal colony by airship, where he is seated next to Herman. However, the Angel Gang, a family of [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] scavengers and bandits, shoots down the airship and brings Dredd and Herman back to their cave. A squad of Judges investigate the crashed ship and get to the cave, intent on killing any survivors, not rescuing them. Fargo arrives in time to save Dredd's life, but [[Mean Machine Angel]] mortally wounds him. A dying Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico are the result of the Janus project, an experiment in [[genetic engineering]] intended to create the perfect Judge. Dredd deduces Rico framed him for the reporter's murder, using their identical DNA. Believing Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, Fargo urges Dredd to stop him.\n\nIn Mega-City One, Rico terrorises the city and assassinates Judges in various ways. Griffin, intent on creating an army of Judges from his own DNA, uses the situation to convince the Council Judges to unlock the Janus files. After the Council Judges unlock the file, Griffin has them killed. Dredd and Herman sneak back into the city and meet with Hershey, who had also discovered the Janus project by herself. They go to the [[Statue of Liberty]] where the Janus laboratories are hidden. They encounter the ABC Warrior, who wounds Herman and captures Dredd and Hershey. Rico uses his own DNA as template for the Janus clones, then commands the ABC Warrior to kill Griffin. Herman, despite his wounds, disables the ABC Warrior as Dredd fights Rico, while Hershey fights his assistant, Dr. Ilsa Hayden. Rico activates his clones prematurely, but they fail to stop Dredd, and the swift clone activation ends up destroying the Janus laboratory. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the Statue of Liberty, and a final struggle sends Rico falling to his death.\n\nHaving recorded the entire event, Central, the city's controlling supercomputer, broadcasts the information, clearing Dredd's name. The remaining Judges ask Dredd to become the new Chief Justice, but he refuses, preferring to remain a Street Judge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Judge Dredd (character)|Judge Joseph Dredd]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] as [[Rico Dredd|Rico]]\n* [[Diane Lane]] as [[Judge Hershey]]\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as [[Fergee|Fergie]]\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as [[Judge Griffin]]\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Chief Judge Fargo|Chief Justice Fargo]]\n* [[Joanna Miles]] as [[Judge McGruder]]\n* [[Joan Chen]] as Dr. Ilsa Hayden\n* [[Balthazar Getty]] as Cadet Nathan Olmeyer\n* [[Ian Dury]] as Geiger\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Vartis Hammond\n* [[Bradley Lavelle]] as Chief Judge Hunter\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Pa Angel\n* [[Christopher Adamson]] as [[Mean Machine Angel]]\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Junior Angel\n* [[Phil Smeeton]] as Link Angel\n}}\n\nOther actors include [[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] as [[Prison warden|Warden]] Miller, [[James Remar]] as the Block Warlord, Pat Starr as Lily Hammond, Lex Daniel as rookie Judge Brisco, [[Angus MacInnes]] as [[Judge Silver]], Peter Marinker as Judge Esposito, [[Mark Moraghan]] as Judge Monroe, [[Louise Delamere]] as Judge Meeker, and [[Al Sapienza]] as Judge Gellar.

He hired [[Peter Young (set decorator)|Peter Young]], whom he'd previously worked with on [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'']], as set decorator. [[Leslie Tomkins]] was the supervising art director.\n\nStallone personally selected [[Gianni Versace]] to design futuristic yet functional attire for the film.

Additional effects were provided by Digital FilmWorks, The Magic Camera Company, Amalgamated Pixels, and Atomic Pictures.\n\nThe prosthetic make-up designs for [[Mean Machine Angel]] were created by artist [[Chris Cunningham]] (credited as 'Chris Hill'), supervised by [[Nick Dudman]].\n\nThe production initially intended to use an actor in a suit to depict the Hammerstein, but Danny Cannon insisted they build it for real using [[animatronics]]. The hydraulics-powered effect was created by [[Joss Williams]] and controlled by five remote operators.\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[England]],<ref name=\"Archerd\" /> with some location filming in [[Iceland]]. The producers initially wanted to shoot the film in the United States, but Cannon insisted on keeping production in the United Kingdom, the natural home of the character.\n\n==Music==\nAlthough film composer [[David Arnold]] was originally set to score the film, having collaborated with director [[Danny Cannon]] on his previous film ''[[The Young Americans (film)|The Young Americans]]'', Arnold was replaced by film composing veteran [[Jerry Goldsmith]], but as post-production dates fell further and further behind, Goldsmith was forced to drop out of the project as well, due to prior commitments to score other films (''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]]''). Prior to leaving the project, Goldsmith composed and recorded a short piece of music that would eventually be used for the film's trailers and advertising campaigns. In the end, [[Alan Silvestri]] was selected as the new composer and would go on to score the final film. He initially recorded the soundtrack with the [[Sinfonia of London]]. But following changes made to the film in post-production, Silvestri had to make extensive adjustments to his score by re-recording [[segue]]s and cues in Hollywood, though some of the music from the London sessions remains in the finished film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrada.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6667|title=Intrada Announces Alan Silvestri's Judge Dredd|author=Roger Feigelson|website=Intrada.net|access-date=May 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe end credits song for the film, \"Dredd Song\", was written and performed by the English [[alternative rock]] band [[The Cure]]. The song appears on disc three of their 2004 rarities [[box set]] ''[[Join the Dots: B-Sides & Rarities 1978\u20132001 (The Fiction Years)]]'' as well as on the film's soundtrack album. The song \"Judge Yr'self\" by the [[Manic Street Preachers]] was originally going to be on the soundtrack. Their guitarist [[Richey Edwards]] disappeared in early 1995, and since the song was the last written with him in the band, it never made it to the final soundtrack listing. The song was not released until 2003, when the band released ''[[Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)]]''.\n\nIn 1995 [[Epic Records]] released a soundtrack album featuring seven tracks from Silvestri's score (all performed by the Sinfonia of London but most were not versions used in the film) and songs by [[The Cure]], [[The The]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Cocteau Twins]], [[Leftfield]]. The UK edition also had [[Aska (singer)|Ryo Aska]] and Worldbeaters with [[Youssou N'Dour]] (only the first two songs are heard in the film over the end credits).\n\nIn 2015, [[Intrada Records]] issued a greatly-expanded two-disc, limited-edition album featuring all the music Silvestri recorded for the film. The album also includes the trailer music conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. This had only previously released as a re-recording \u2013 conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] \u2013 on the [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] compilation entitled ''Hollywood '95''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.9616/.f |title=Judge Dredd (2CD) |website=Store.intrada.com |access-date=2016-02-26}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n=== Re-editing and censorship ===\nPrior to the film's world premiere on 30 June 1995, ''Judge Dredd'' had to be re-cut and submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] five times in order to get it down from a NC-17 to a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#R|R rating]].<ref name=\"souza\">{{cite web|author=Mike Cecchini|date=December 20, 2013|title=Steven E. de Souza Talks Commando 2, Sgt.

Director [[Danny Cannon]] was so disheartened over the constant creative disputes with Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another big-name actor. He also stated that the final version was completely different from the script due to the creative changes demanded by Stallone. In later interviews, Stallone said he thought the film was supposed to be an action comedy film so demanded rewrites to make it more comedic. The director and screenwriter had a darker, more satirical vision.<ref name=\"souza\" />\n\nSeveral entire sequences were deleted from the theatrical release to reduce the violence and darker tone of the film. For example, a scene where Rico kills news reporter Hammond and his wife was originally longer and bloodier because it showed them getting hit by bullets in slow-motion. Likewise the ABC Warrior robot was to kill Judge Griffin by ripping his arms and legs off but this was also changed. Cannon wanted more violence (because it was in keeping with the comic's source material) but the studio and Stallone wanted a PG-13 movie with more focus on humour.<ref name=\"souza\" /> Even the film's climax was deleted, scenes showing Dredd fighting and killing clone Judges was removed prior to the theatrical release.

It had political overtones. It showed how if we don't curb the way we run our judicial system, the police may end up running our lives. It dealt with archaic governments; it dealt with cloning and all kinds of things that could happen in the future. It was also bigger than any film I've done in its physical stature and the way it was designed. All the people were dwarfed by the system and the architecture; it shows how insignificant human beings could be in the future. There's a lot of action in the movie and some great acting, too. It just wasn't balls to the wall. But I do look back on ''Judge Dredd'' as a real missed opportunity. It seemed that lots of fans had a problem with Dredd removing his helmet, because he never does in the comic books. But for me it is more about wasting such great potential there was in that idea; just think of all the opportunities there were to do interesting stuff with the Cursed Earth scenes. It didn't live up to what it could have been. It probably should have been much more comic, really humorous, and fun. What I learned out of that experience was that we shouldn't have tried to make it ''Hamlet''; it's more ''Hamlet and Eggs''.<ref>Sylvester Stallone interviewed in ''Uncut'' #131 (April 2008), p.118</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborated:\n\n<blockquote>From what I recall, the whole project was troubled from the beginning. The philosophy of the film was not set in stone \u2013 by that I mean \"Is this going to be a serious drama or with comic overtones\" like other science fiction films that were successful? So a lotta pieces just didn't fit smoothly. It was sort of like a feathered fish. Some of the design work on it was fantastic and the sets were incredibly real, even standing two feet away, but there was just no communication. I knew we were in for a long shoot when, for no explainable reason Danny Cannon, who's rather diminutive, jumped down from his director's chair and yelled to everyone within earshot, \"FEAR me! Everyone should FEAR me!\" then jumped back up to his chair as if nothing happened. The British crew was taking bets on his life expectancy.<ref>{{cite web |date=Dec 16, 2006 |author= Harry Knowles (headgeek) |author-link= Harry Knowles |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 |title=Stallone answers December 9th & 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen Rocky Balboa |website=Aintitcool.com |access-date=2020-02-26 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{Anchor|Wagner's view of the film}}\n[[John Wagner]], the creator of the comic character on which the film was based, said when interviewed by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' in 2012: \"the story had nothing to do with Judge Dredd, and Judge Dredd wasn't really Judge Dredd.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=18 October 2012 |author=Owen Williams |title=Exclusive: John Wagner And Alex Garland Talk Dredd |url=https://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1530 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018165841/https://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1530 |archive-date=2012-10-18 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)]] |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!-- Again in 2012 -->Wagner said it was a pity the way the film turned out, since the production values were great, and they had the budget for it.<ref>{{cite AV media |author=Talk Comix|title=Interview With John Wagner at Glasgow Con 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-poxzZW1rQ |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=10 December 2015 }}</ref> In an interview with ''Total Film'' magazine, he said the film had \"told the wrong story\" because it \"tried to do too much\".<ref>{{cite web |date=2012-01-20 |author= George Wales |title=Judge Dredd creator talks new film &#124; GamesRadar |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/judge-dredd-creator-talks-new-film |website=Totalfilm.com |access-date=2020-02-26 |quote=Perhaps that was one of the failings of the first film.
