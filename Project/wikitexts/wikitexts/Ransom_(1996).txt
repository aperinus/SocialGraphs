The film stars [[Mel Gibson]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Delroy Lindo]], [[Lili Taylor]], Brawley Nolte, [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Donnie Wahlberg]] and [[Evan Handler]]. Gibson was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]]. The film was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States. The original story came from a 1954 episode of ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' titled \"Fearful Decision\". In 1956, it was adapted by [[Cyril Hume]] and [[Richard Maibaum]] into the feature film, ''[[Ransom!]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[Donna Reed]], and [[Leslie Nielsen]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile multi-billionaire Tom Mullen and his wife Kate attend a science fair, their son Sean is kidnapped. Sean is taken to an apartment by Maris Conner, a caterer working for the Mullens, along with brothers Clark and Cubby Barnes, as well as tech expert Miles Roberts. NYPD Detective Jimmy Shaker is Maris' boyfriend and the mastermind behind the kidnapping. The kidnappers send Tom and Kate an e-mail demanding $2 million. Tom calls the FBI, who begin operating from his New York City penthouse under Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins. In private, Tom voices his belief that a union machinist, Jackie Brown, who is in prison following one of Mullen's business scandals, may be behind it. They visit Brown in prison, but he denies any involvement.\n\nTom agrees to the FBI's plan for delivering the [[ransom]]. Receiving a phone call from Shaker, who electronically disguises his voice, Tom follows his instructions. He meets Cubby in a New Jersey quarry but refuses to hand over the money when Cubby fails to give him Shaker's promised directions. A fight ensues and the FBI intervene and shoot Cubby, who dies before revealing Sean's location; Tom begins to realize there is no guarantee Sean will be returned alive. Shaker later arranges another drop off, but although Tom initially agrees to take the money alone at first, he instead appears on television and offers the ransom as a bounty on the kidnappers, promising to withdraw the bounty and drop all charges if the kidnappers return Sean alive and unharmed.\n\nDespite Kate and Agent Hawkins' pleadings, Tom sticks to his plan, believing it is the best chance for Sean's return. Shaker lures Kate to a meeting where he assaults her and presents Sean's blood-stained t-shirt as a warning to pay the ransom or Sean will die, but Tom responds by doubling the bounty to $4 million. Shaker calls Tom and gives him one final warning to pay the ransom, but Tom still refuses, and Shaker fires a gunshot after Tom hears Sean scream for help, leading Tom and Kate to believe Sean is dead. Clark and Miles attempt to abandon the plan and flee, but Shaker calls in the NYPD to request backup and kills both Clark and Miles while making it look like Miles shot first and kills Maris after she shoots him in the arm from behind. The NYPD arrive and find Shaker with a badly beaten Sean, believing Shaker found and rescued Sean. Hawkins informs Tom and Kate, and they are reunited with Sean while Shaker is hospitalized.\n\nShaker arrives at Tom's penthouse to claim the reward. He intends to immediately leave the country before his connection to Maris is discovered. Sean, however, recognizes Shaker's voice as the kidnapper, causing Tom to notice his son's frightened reaction. Realizing his cover is blown, Shaker plans to kill everyone in the apartment, but Tom persuades him to accompany him to the bank to gain the money and leave peacefully. Shaker attempts to force Tom to wire the money from the house via phone, but Tom stands his ground and warns him that whether he receives his money or not, Shaker will be exposed and hunted citywide. Shaker reluctantly agrees to go to bank, threatening to rekidnap and execute Sean should Tom attempt any double-crossing. On the way, however, Tom discreetly alerts Hawkins, and the police and FBI converge on Tom and Shaker outside the bank. As soon as Tom and Shaker exit the bank, two police officers attempt to detain Shaker, but Shaker shoots them. Tom knocks Shaker to the ground and the two struggle. Tom picks up Shaker's dropped gun and points at him. Hawkins and other police officers demand that Tom drop the gun and walk away. In desperation, Shaker draws another gun, but is shot dead by Tom and Hawkins. Tom finally drops the gun and police rush in to arrest Tom, but Hawkins orders them to stand down, and Tom leaves the scene with Kate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Tom Mullen\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Kate Mullen\n* Brawley Nolte as Sean Mullen\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Detective Jimmy Shaker\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as [[FBI]] Special Agent Lonnie Hawkins\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Maris Conner\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Clark Barnes\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as 'Cubby' Barnes\n* [[Evan Handler]] as Miles Roberts\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as [[FBI]] Director Stan Wallace\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as David Torres\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Jackie Brown\n* [[John Ortiz]] as Roberto\n* [[David Vadim]] as an [[NYPD]] Officer\n\n==Reception==\n''Ransom'' has a 74% rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 74 reviews, with its consensus stating: \"Directed with propulsive intensity by Ron Howard, ''Ransom'' is a fiery thriller packed with hot-blooded performances and jolting twists.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1074298-ransom/ Ransom] Rotten Tomatoes, Retrieved 8/02/10</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 60 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ransom|title= Ransom reviews|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"Gibson gives an interesting performance, showing a man trying to think his way out of a crisis, and Sinise makes a good foil: Here are two smart men playing a game with deadly stakes.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961108/REVIEWS/611080303 Ransom] Roger Ebert, Retrieved 2010-08-02</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n'''1997 [[ASCAP]] Film and Television Music Awards'''\n* Won - Top Box Office Film\n'''1997 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films ([[Saturn Award]]s)'''\n* Nominated - [[Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film|Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film]]\n'''1997 [[Golden Globe Award]]s'''\n* Nominated - [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama]] \u2014 [[Mel Gibson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/scene/vpage/golden-globe-nominations-2-1117436552/|title=GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1996-12-19|access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n'''1997 [[NAACP Image Award|Image Awards]]'''\n* Nominated - [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture]] \u2014 [[Delroy Lindo]]\n'''1997 [[Young Artist Awards]]'''\n* Nominated - Best Performance in a Feature Film - Supporting Young Actor \u2014 [[Brawley Nolte]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|117438}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=300927}}\n* {{amg movie|136703}}\n* {{AFI film|60558}}\n* {{mojo title|ransom}}\n\n{{Ron Howard}}\n{{Richard Price}}\n{{Brian Grazer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ransom 1996}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about extortion]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Howard]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Scott Rudin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films about hostage takings]]\n[[Category:Imagine Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Richard Price (writer)]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Richard Maibaum]]\n[[Category:Films about father\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
