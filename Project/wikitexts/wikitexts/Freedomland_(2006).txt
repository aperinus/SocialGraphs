Jackson]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Edie Falco]], [[Ron Eldard]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], [[Aunjanue Ellis]], and [[Anthony Mackie]]. It is based on [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]]'s [[Freedomland (novel)|1998 novel of the same name]], which touches on themes of [[covert racism]]. The film grossed $14.7 million against a $30 million budget (approximately \u00a322,671,000).  The [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus calls it \"poorly directed and overacted\".<ref name=rt/>\n\n==Plot==\nBrenda walks through a predominantly [[African American]] housing project and enters an emergency room, apparently in shock and with cut and bleeding hands. Police detective Lorenzo Council is sent to take a statement from Brenda, who says that her car has been stolen. When Lorenzo gets there, she reveals that her young son, Cody, was in the back seat of the car. The police frantically begin searching for Cody.\n\nBrenda's brother, Danny, a police officer in a neighboring town, calls a massive police presence in to search the housing project for clues. This angers the residents who protest their innocence. Lorenzo begins to suspect that Brenda is holding back details from him and pressures her to tell the truth. She insists that she has told the truth and would never harm her son. With a sketch artist she produces a picture of the man she says stole her car. Danny's white coworkers arrest a man from the housing project who they think matches the picture. Danny flies into a rage and beats him.\n\nDesperate to find Cody, Lorenzo enlists the aid of a volunteer group which helps search for missing children. He suggests that they search Freedomland, an abandoned foundling hospital nearby. As they search, the group's leader Karen Collucci talks with Brenda.  Collucci had lost her own son years before and convinces Brenda to admit that Cody is dead. She leads them to a nearby park where they find Cody's body in a shallow grave, covered with heavy rocks.\n\nLorenzo realizes that Brenda could not have moved the rocks herself. Under interrogation Brenda admits to having been engaged in an affair with a man named Billy who lived in the projects. She would give Cody cough syrup so that he would fall asleep and she could visit Billy. On the night in question she had returned to find Cody dead, having drunk a whole bottle of cough syrup. Billy helped her bury his body. When the police go to arrest Billy, they are confronted by residents angry over previous unfounded police harassment and a riot erupts. Brenda is charged with criminal neglect, and Lorenzo promises to visit her in jail.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Samuel L.

It begins with a compelling story about a woman whose car is hijacked with her 4-year-old son inside. It adds racial tension, and the bulldog detective work of a veteran police detective. Then, it flies to pieces with unmotivated scenes, inexplicable dialogue, and sudden conclusions which may be correct but arrive from nowhere. The film seems edited none too wisely from a longer version that made more sense.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/freedomland-2006 | title=Freedomland movie review & film summary (2006) &#124; Roger Ebert }}</ref>\n\nSheri Linden of [[The Hollywood Reporter]] wrote: \"The film is, above all, a moving portrait of hurting souls, brought to life in compelling performances.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/topic/movie-reviews?vnu_content_id=1001994910|title = Movie Reviews &#124; Hollywood Reporter|website = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\nBrian Lowry of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] wrote: \"Despite a few raw moments, pic feels like a Lifetime movie with a marquee cast.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 9 February 2006 |last1= Lowry |first1= Brian |title= Freedomland |url= https://variety.com/review/VE1117929541 |website= Variety }}</ref>\n\nIn a more positive review, [[James Berardinelli]] awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing: \"The thing that makes Freedomland riveting is the way in which its tale of human tragedy unfolds. Although it begins by looking like a big screen episode of CSI, it develops into something more sublime and disturbing. This isn't a mystery in the conventional sense, but it's about secrets hidden and revealed, and the corrosive power of guilt. Even as Council probes into the dark recesses of Brenda's psyche, he seeks to exorcise his own demons. The two form an unlikely connection, the nature of which cannot be revealed without spoiling the ending. But don't expect any last-minute twists or turns. The movie doesn't employ sensationalist tactics to enhance its potency.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/freedomland|title = Freedomland}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0349467|Freedomland}}\n* {{amg movie|299011}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=620687}}\n* {{AFI film|id=63828|title=Freedomland}}\n* {{Mojo title|freedomland|Freedomland}}\n\n{{Joe Roth}}\n{{Richard Price}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freedomland}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2006 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about grieving]]\n[[Category:Films about missing people]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Revolution Studios films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Richard Price (writer)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joe Roth]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Scott Rudin]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
