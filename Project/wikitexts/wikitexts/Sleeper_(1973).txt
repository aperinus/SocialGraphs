The plot involves the misadventures of the owner of a [[health food store]] who is [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically frozen]] in 1973 and defrosted 200 years later in an ineptly led police state. Contemporary politics and pop culture are satirized throughout the film,<ref name=afi>http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54878 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122065734/http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54878 |date=2021-01-22 }} ''Sleeper'', AFI (American Film Institute), AFI Catalog of Feature Films, The First 100 Years - 1893\u20131993</ref> which includes tributes to the classic comedy of [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=afi/>  Many elements of notable works of science fiction are also paid tribute to, or parodied.\n\n==Plot==\nMiles Monroe (Woody Allen) is a jazz musician and owner of the \"Happy Carrot\" health-food store in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]].  He walks into the hospital in 1973 for a routine operation, which goes wrong, leaving him relegated to 200 years of anonymous [[cryopreservation]].<ref name=\"ebert\"/> Two scientists in 2173 (played by Bartlett Robinson and Mary Gregory) illegally revive him. They are members of an underground rebellion at odds with the [[police state]] the United States had become after the massive destruction caused when \"a man named [[Albert Shanker]] got hold of a nuclear warhead.\". \nIt is ostensibly ruled by a [[dictator]] known only as \"The Leader\", and about to implement a secret plan known as the \"Aries Project\". The rebels hope to use Miles as a spy to infiltrate and derail it, as he is the only member of the [[dystopian]] society without a known [[Biometrics|biometric]] identity.\n\nThe authorities grow suspicious and arrive in force to question the scientists, who are arrested and taken to have their brains \"simplified\". Miles escapes by disguising himself as a [[robot]], which is then randomly delivered to work in the home of idle socialite Luna Schlosser ([[Diane Keaton]]). When Luna decides to have her new butler's rather unattractive head replaced with something more \"aesthetically pleasing\", Miles reveals his true identity.  Spooked at his disclosure and unsympathetic to the rebels, she threatens to turn him in to the authorities. In response, Miles kidnaps her and goes on the run, searching for the Aries Project.\n\nAfter much bickering, Miles and Luna fall in love. Miles is captured and brainwashed into becoming a complacent member of society, while Luna escapes and joins the rebellion. The rebels kidnap Miles and perform successful reverse-brainwashing. Miles falls into the routine of rebel life, but grows jealous when he catches Luna kissing the handsome, hunky rebel leader, Erno Windt ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]), and she announces that she has come to believe in [[free love]].\n\nMiles tries to win Luna back.  Eventually he and Luna infiltrate the Aries Project, wherein they quickly learn that the national Leader had been killed by a rebel bomb ten months previously. All that survives is his [[human nose|nose]]. Miles and Luna disguise themselves as doctors, resulting in a case of mistaken identity, causing them to be placed in charge of [[cloning]] the Leader from his sole remaining part.  Miles steals the nose and deadends the government's cloning scheme by dropping the nose in the path of a [[road roller]].\n\nThe pair escape, and later debate their future together. Miles tells Luna that Erno will inevitably become as corrupt as the Leader, as that is how all revolutions end up. Miles and Luna confess their love for one another, but she claims that science has proven men and women cannot have meaningful relationships due to chemical incompatibilities. Miles dismisses this, saying that he does not believe in science. Luna then points out that he does not believe in God or political systems either, and asks if there is anything he does believe in.  He responds, \"Sex and death \u2014 two things that come once in a lifetime \u2014 but at least after death you're not nauseous.\"<ref name=\"dirks\"/> The two embrace and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Miles Monroe, the former owner of a health food store from the 1970s\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Luna Schlosser, an artist from the 22nd century\n* [[Don Keefer]] as Doctor Tryon, one of the two scientists who oversee Miles's rehabilitation from cryosleep\n* [[Bartlett Robinson]] and Mary Gregory as Doctor Orva and Doctor Melik, respectively, the scientists who oversee Miles's rehabilitation from cryosleep; both are captured by the government and taken away\n* [[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]] as Erno Windt, the Leader of the rebellion\n* [[Douglas Rain]] as the voice of Bio Central Computer 2100, Series G, the computer aiding in Our Leader's cloning.<ref name=\"dirks\"/>\n\nThe image of [[Timothy Leary]] is used for Our Leader\n\n==Production==\nMuch of the film was shot in and around [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].
