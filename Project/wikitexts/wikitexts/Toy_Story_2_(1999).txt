In the film, [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] is stolen by a toy collector, prompting [[Buzz Lightyear]] and his friends to rescue him, but Woody is then tempted by the idea of immortality in a museum.

The film began production in a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, as most of the main Pixar staff were busy working on ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to a theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for ''Toy Story 2'' was compressed into nine months.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /><ref name=\"iwerks\" />\n\nDespite production struggles, ''Toy Story 2'' opened on November 24, 1999, to wildly successful box office numbers, eventually grossing over $511 million.

The film has seen multiple home media releases and a theatrical 3-D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the first film, 10 years after its initial release. Another sequel, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nWoody and Buzz Lightyear are now the co-leaders of Andy's toys. Andy is preparing to take Woody to cowboy camp but accidentally rips Woody's arm during playtime, choosing to leave him behind on the shelf. After having a nightmare about Andy throwing him away, Woody discovers Wheezy, a toy penguin who has been forgotten by Andy after his squeaker broke. Andy's mother takes Wheezy down to her yard sale. Woody saves Wheezy but is stolen by a greedy toy collector named Al McWhiggin. Buzz fails to rescue Woody, but picks up two vital clues: a feather from a chicken suit and the number plate of the car, both of which help Andy's toys realise who kidnapped Woody.\n\nAt Al's apartment, Woody meets a cowgirl named Jessie, a horse named Bullseye and Stinky Pete the Prospector: all toys based on the main characters from ''Woody's Roundup'', a TV show that was very popular back in the 50s. Woody also learns that he and the Roundup gang are to be sold to a toy museum in Japan; he states he cannot go because he needs to go home to Andy, earning resentment from Jessie. Al accidently rips Woody's arm off. When Woody tries to retrieve it and escape, his attempt fails when Al's television turns on. The next morning, Woody is repaired and still desires to go home to Andy; however, he soon learns that Jessie was once owned by a girl named Emily who eventually outgrew her and fears that Andy will do the same, so decides to stay with the gang to go to Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, Buzz has enlisted the help of Slinky Dog, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and Hamm to rescue Woody. They reach Al's Toy Barn where Buzz is imprisoned by a new Utility Belt Buzz Lightyear toy, who believes himself to be a real space ranger. Andy's toys mistake Utility Belt Buzz for Andy's Buzz and he thinks they are on a mission to defeat his nemesis, the Evil Emperor Zurg. Utility Belt Buzz leads the toys by hiding in Al's bag - Andy's Buzz escapes and follows the gang to Al's apartment, unintentionally releasing a toy Zurg, who also believes he is the real Zurg and follows Andy's Buzz in order to destroy him.\n\nWoody is now excited to go to the museum in Japan. Both Buzzes and the gang arrive; Andy's Buzz tries to persuade Woody to come home, but Woody remains adamant that Andy will outgrow him and decides to go with the Roundup gang, devastating the Buzzes and the gang. When Woody comes to his senses, he asks the Roundup gang to come with him and experience playtime from Andy. However, Stinky Pete prevents them from leaving, revealing he had previously sabotaged Woody's escape. Al takes the roundup gang to the airport. The Buzzes and the gang give chase but are confronted by Zurg, who engages Utility Belt Buzz and reveals he is his father. Andy's toys bid farewell to Utility Belt Buzz & Zurg, and chase Al using a Pizza Planet truck and being accompanied by three Little Green Men. They arrive at the airport and manage to subdue Stinky Pete, placing him in a little girl's backpack.\n\nWoody and Bullseye escape but Jessie is placed in the plane to Japan. Buzz, Woody and Bullseye work together to save Jessie and the whole gang returns to Andy's house. Andy fixes Woody's arm (which had been ripped again earlier by Stinky Pete). The toys are delighted to learn that Al has suffered financially after losing the Roundup gang. Wheezy has also had his squeaker fixed, much to his happiness. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy outgrowing him and that even when it does eventually happen, he and Buzz will be friends \"for infinity and beyond.\"\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction   = horizontal\n| align       = right\n| total_width = 400\n| image1      = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| image2      = Tim Allen cropped.jpg\n| footer      = [[Tom Hanks]] (''Woody'') and [[Tim Allen]] (''Buzz Lightyear'') are amongst the many cast members who reprise their roles from ''[[Toy Story]]'' for ''Toy Story 2''.\n}}\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]] & [[List of Toy Story characters#Al's Toy Barn|Utility Belt Buzz]] (dual role)\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]]\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Stinky Pete the Prospector|Prospector]]\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]]\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog (character)|Slinky Dog]]\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex]]\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as [[Hamm the toy|Hamm]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]]\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]]\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as [[Al McWhiggin]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Davis family|Andy's mom]]\n* [[R.

Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. The memory was a defining factor in the production of ''Toy Story 2'', with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.<ref name=\"dvdint1\">{{cite video |people=Lasseter, John; Unkrich, Lee; Brannon, Ash |title=Toy Story 2.

Roth was pleased and embraced the idea of a sequel.<ref name=\"PixarTouch01\" /> Disney had recently begun making [[direct-to-video]] sequels to its successful features, and Roth wanted to handle the ''Toy Story'' sequel this way, as well. Prior releases, such as 1994's ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' sequel, ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', had returned an estimated $100&nbsp;million in profits.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=175}}</ref>\n\nInitially, everything regarding ''Toy Story 2'' was uncertain at first: whether stars [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]] would be available and affordable, what the story premise would be, and even whether the film would be computer-animated at [[Pixar]] or traditionally [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn]] at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]].<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter regarded the project as a chance to groom new directing talent, as top choices were already immersed in other projects ([[Andrew Stanton]] as co-director in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' and [[Pete Docter]] as director of what would eventually become ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]''). Instead, Lasseter turned to [[Ash Brannon]], a young directing animator on ''Toy Story'' whose work he admired. Brannon, a [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] graduate, joined the ''Toy Story'' team in 1993.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Disney and Pixar officially announced the sequel in a press release on March 12, 1997.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\" />\n\n=== Story ===\n{{quotebox|width=30em|\"The story of ''Toy Story 2'' is based a lot on my own experience. I'm a big toy collector and a lot of them are like antiques, or one-of-a-kind toys, or prototypes the toy makers have given me. Well, I have five sons, and when they were little and they loved to come to daddy's work, and come in into daddy's office and they just want to touch and play with everything. And I was sitting there saying 'Oh no, that's uh, you can't play with that one, oh no, play with this one, oh no....' and I found myself just sitting there looking at myself and laughing. Because toys are manufactured, put on this Earth, to be played with by a child. That is the core essence of ''Toy Story''. And so I started wondering, what was it like from a toy's point of view to be collected?\"|\u2013 John Lasseter, on the story of ''Toy Story 2''<ref name=MakingTS2 />\n}}\nLasseter's intention with a sequel was to respect the original ''Toy Story'' film and create that world again.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The story originated with him wondering what a toy would find upsetting, how a toy would feel if it were not played with by a child or, worse, a child growing out of a toy.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Brannon suggested the idea of a yard sale where the collector recognizes Woody as a rare artifact.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=176}}</ref> The concept of Woody as a collectible set came from the draft story of ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', an original half-hour special pitched by Pixar to Disney in 1990. The obsessive toy collector named [[Al McWhiggin#Al McWhiggin|Al McWhiggin]], who had appeared in a draft of ''Toy Story'' but was later expunged, was inserted into the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\" /> Lasseter claimed that Al was inspired by himself.<ref name=MakingTS2>''The Making of Toy Story 2'', Disc 2, ''Toy Story 2'' 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, 2005</ref>\n\nSecondary characters in Woody's set were inspired by 1940s\u20131950s Western and puppet shows for children, such as ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' and ''[[Howdy Doody]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /><ref name=\"Western\">{{harvnb|Nelson|2015|page=197}}</ref> The development of Jessie was kindled by Lasseter's wife Nancy, who pressed him to include a strong female character in the sequel, one with more substance than Bo Peep.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> The scope for the original ''Toy Story'' was basic and only extended over two residential homes, roadways, and a chain restaurant, whereas ''Toy Story 2'' has been described by Unkrich as something \"all over the map\".<ref name=\"dvdint1\" />\n\nTo make the project ready for theaters, Lasseter would need to add 12 minutes or so of material and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge since it could not be mere padding \u2014 it would have to feel as if it had always been there, an organic part of the film.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, [[Joe Ranft]], and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. There, he hosted what he called a \"story summit\", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.\n\nBack at the office that Monday, Lasseter assembled the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of ''Toy Story 2'' from exposition to resolution.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first ''Toy Story''. The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening scene of ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=181}}</ref> A deleted scene from ''Toy Story'', featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken squeaker also resurfaced from an early version of ''Toy Story''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\nAs the story approached the production stage in early 1997, it was unclear whether Pixar would produce the film, as the entire team of 300 was busy working on ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' for a [[1998 in film|1998]] release. The Interactive Products Group, with a staff of 95, had its own animators, art department, and engineers. Under intense time pressure, they had put out two successful [[CD-ROM]] titles the previous year \u2013 ''[[Disney's Animated Storybook: Toy Story]]'' and ''The Toy Story Activity Center''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\" /> Between the two products, the group had created as much original animation as there was in ''Toy Story'' itself. [[Steve Jobs]] made the decision to shut down the computer games operation and the staff became the initial core of the ''Toy Story 2'' production team.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=177}}</ref>\n\nBefore the switch from direct-to-video to feature film, the ''Toy Story 2'' crew had been on its own, placed in a new building that was well-separated from the rest of the company by railroad tracks. \"We were just the small film and we were off playing in our sandbox,\" co-producer Karen Jackson said.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=180}}</ref> Lasseter looked closely at every shot that had already been animated and called for tweaks throughout. The film reused digital elements from ''Toy Story'' but, true to the company's \"prevailing culture of perfectionism, [...] it reused less of ''Toy Story'' than might be expected\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=182}}</ref> Character models received major upgrades internally and shaders went through revisions to bring about subtle improvements. The team freely borrowed models from other productions, such as Geri from Pixar's 1997 short ''[[Geri's Game]]'', who became the Cleaner in ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\" /> Supervising animator [[Glenn McQueen]] inspired the animators to do spectacular work in the short amount of time given, assigning different shots to suit each animators' strengths.<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nWhile producing ''Toy Story'', the crew was careful in creating new locations, working within available technology at that time. By the time of production on ''Toy Story 2'', technology had advanced farther to allow more complicated camera shots than were possible in the first film.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> In making the sequel, the team at Pixar did not want to stray too far from the first film's look, but the company had developed a lot of new software since the first feature had been completed.<ref name=\"AWN\" /> To achieve the dust visible after Woody is placed on top of a shelf, the crew was faced with the challenge of animating dust, an incredibly difficult task. After much experimentation, a tiny particle of dust was animated and the computer distributed that image throughout the entire shelf. Over two million dust particles are in place on the shelf in the completed film.<ref name=\"Lasseter\">{{cite video |people=Lasseter, John |year=2010 |title=''Toy Story 2'' commentary |medium=Blu-ray Disc |publisher=Buena Vista Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n=== Troubled production ===\n{{quotebox|width=30em|\"When we went from a direct-to-video to a feature film and we had limited time in which to finish that feature film, the pressure really amped up. Forget seeing your family, forget doing anything. Once we made that decision [on the schedule], it was like, 'Okay, you have a release date. You're ''going'' to make that release date. You're ''going'' to make these screenings.'\"|\u2013 Karen Jackson, co-producer of ''Toy Story 2''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/>\n}}\nDisney became unhappy with the pace of the work on the film and demanded in June 1997 that Guggenheim be replaced as producer, and Pixar complied. As a result, Karen Jackson and Helene Plotkin, associate producers, moved up into the roles of co-producers.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=178}}</ref> Lasseter would remain fully preoccupied with ''A Bug's Life'' until it wrapped in the fall. Once available, he took over directing duties and added [[Lee Unkrich]] as co-director. Unkrich, also fresh from supervising editor duties on ''A Bug's Life'', would focus on layout and [[cinematography]], while Brannon would be credited as co-director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" />\n\nIn November 1997, Disney executives Roth and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] viewed the film's story reels, with some finished animation, in a screening room at Pixar. They were impressed with the quality of work and became interested in releasing ''Toy Story 2'' in theaters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> In addition to the unexpected artistic caliber, there were other reasons that made the case for a theatrical release more compelling. The economics of a direct-to-video Pixar release were not working as well as hoped thanks to the higher salaries of the crew. After negotiations, Jobs and Roth agreed that the split of costs and profits for ''Toy Story 2'' would follow the model of a newly created five-film deal \u2014 but ''Toy Story 2'' would not count as one of the five films. Disney had bargained in the contract for five original features, not sequels, thus assuring five sets of new characters for its theme parks and merchandise. Jobs gathered the crew and announced the change in plans for the film on February 5, 1998.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">{{harvnb|Price|2008|page=179}}</ref>\n\nThe work done on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 when one of the animators, while routinely clearing some files, accidentally entered the deletion command code <code>/bin/[[rm (Unix)|rm]] -r -f *</code> on the [[Root directory|root folder]] of the ''Toy Story 2'' assets on Pixar's internal servers.<ref>[https://www.newsweek.com/lightyear-producer-credited-saving-toy-story-2-after-deletion-1680072 ''Lightyear'' Producer Credited With Saving 'Toy Story 2' After Deletion] ''Newsweek'', TAYLOR MCCLOUD, 16 February 2022</ref><ref>[https://www.slashgear.com/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-21229124 How Pixar's Toy Story 2 Was Deleted...

They shut down the file servers but had already lost 90% of the last two years of work, and it was also found that the backups had not been working for about a month. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been [[remote work]]ing to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had a backup copy of the film on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billiondollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html |title=Pixar's billion-dollar delete button nearly lost Toy Story 2 animation |first=Gilliar |last=Orr |work=[[The Independent]] |date=May 17, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119174902/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pixars-billion-dollar-delete-button-nearly-lost-toy-story-2-animation-7758083.html | archive-date=November 19, 2018 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/ |title=How ''Toy Story 2'' Got Deleted Twice, Once on Accident and Again for Its Own Good |date=May 21, 2014 |publisher=The Next Web |access-date=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121130635/https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/05/21/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good/|archive-date=November 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMany of the creative staff at Pixar were not happy with how the sequel was turning out. Upon returning from the European promotion of ''A Bug's Life'', Lasseter watched the development reels and agreed that it was not working. Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.<ref name=\"iwerks\">{{Cite video |people=Iwerks, Leslie |title=[[The Pixar Story]] |medium=Documentary |publisher=Leslie Iwerks Productions |year=2007}}</ref> Unkrich, concerned with the dwindling amount of time remaining, asked Jobs whether the release date could be pushed back.
