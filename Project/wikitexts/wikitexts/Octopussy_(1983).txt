It is the sixth to star [[Roger Moore]] as the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. It was directed by [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]] and the screenplay was written by [[George MacDonald Fraser]], [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]].\n\nThe film's title is taken from a short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1966 short story collection ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'', although the film's plot is mostly original. It does, however, contain a scene adapted from the Fleming short story \"The Property of a Lady\" (included in 1967 and later editions of ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights''). The events of the short story \"Octopussy\" form part of the title character's background and are recounted by her in the film.\n\nIn ''Octopussy'', Bond is assigned the task of following a megalomaniacal Soviet general ([[Steven Berkoff]]) who is stealing jewellery and art objects from the Kremlin art repository. This leads Bond to a wealthy exiled Afghan prince, Kamal Khan ([[Louis Jourdan]]), and his associate, Octopussy ([[Maud Adams]]), and the discovery of a plot to force disarmament in Western Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon.\n\n''Octopussy'' was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]]; it was released four months before the non-[[Eon Productions|Eon]] Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. The film earned $187.5 million against its $27.5 million budget and received mixed reviews. Praise was directed towards the action sequences and locations, with the plot and humour being targeted for criticism; [[Maud Adams]]'s portrayal of the title character also drew polarised responses.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter fleeing knife-throwing twin assassins Mischka and Grishka in [[East Berlin]], mortally wounded British agent 009, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a counterfeit [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], crashes into the British ambassador's residence and dies. [[MI6]] immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after the genuine Faberg\u00e9 egg is to be auctioned in London, sends James Bond to identify the seller. \n\nAt the auction, Bond swaps the fake egg for the real one and subsequently engages in a bidding war with an exiled Afghan prince named Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay \u00a3500,000 for the counterfeit. Bond follows Khan to his palace in [[India]]. Bond defeats Khan in a game of [[backgammon]] using Khan's loaded dice. Bond and his MI6 contact, Vijay, escape Khan's bodyguard Gobinda. Later, Khan's associate Magda seduces Bond. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Faberg\u00e9 egg, which is fitted with Q's listening and tracking device. Gobinda knocks Bond unconscious and takes him to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes, he listens in on the bug and discovers that Khan works with Orlov, a Soviet general seeking to expand Soviet domination to Western Europe.\n\nBond infiltrates a floating palace in [[Udaipur]] and meets its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy businesswoman, smuggler and Khan's associate. She also leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a member. Octopussy has a personal connection with Bond: her father is the late Major Dexter-Smythe, whom Bond arrested for treason. Octopussy thanks Bond for allowing the Major to commit suicide rather than face trial, and invites Bond to be her guest. \n\nEarlier in Khan's palace and later in Octopussy's palace, Bond discovers that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the genuine objects into the West via Octopussy's circus troupe. Orlov is planning to meet Khan at [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx-Stadt]] in [[East Germany]], where the circus is scheduled to perform. Khan's assassins break into the palace to kill Bond, but Bond and Octopussy thwart them. Bond learns from Q that the assassins have killed Vijay.\n\nTravelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates the circus and discovers that Orlov has replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus performance at a [[United States Air Force]] base in [[West Germany]]. The explosion would force Europe into seeking unilateral [[Nuclear disarmament|disarmament]] in the belief that the bomb belonged to the US and was detonated at the airbase accidentally, leaving the unprotected borders open to a Soviet invasion. \n\nBond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the railroad tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed by [[Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic|border guards]] after he tries to rush a checkpoint. Bond kills Mischka and Grischka, and after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He convinces Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her, and realizing that she has been tricked, she assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.\n\nSome time later, with the plan foiled, Khan has returned to his palace and prepares to flee. Bond and Octopussy also return separately to India. Bond arrives at Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops launch an assault on the grounds. \n\nOctopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. As they attempt to escape in their airplane, Bond clings to the fuselage and disables an engine and the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]] panel. Struggling with Bond, Gobinda plummets off the plane's roof to his death, and Bond and Octopussy jump off the plane onto a nearby cliff only seconds before Khan fatally crashes into a mountain. While the Minister of Defence and [[General Gogol]] discuss the transport of the jewelry, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private yacht in India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent '007'.\n* [[Maud Adams]] as [[Bond girl#Octopussy|Octopussy]], a jewel smuggler and wealthy businesswoman.

His original contract had been for three films (''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' in 1973, ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' in 1974 and ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' in 1977) which was fulfilled. Moore's following two films (''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979 and ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' in 1981) were negotiated on a film-by-film basis.

Afterward, she auditioned white actresses, like [[Barbara Parkins]] and [[Kathleen Turner]],<ref name=\":1\" /> who she felt could pass for Indian. Finally, Broccoli announced to her that they would cast Swedish-born Maud Adams, who had been a Bond girl in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', and had been recently used by Eon to screen test the potential Bonds. To acknowledge the nationality, Adams had her hair darkened, and a few lines were added about how she was raised by an Indian family. A different plotline, with Adams's British father exposed as a traitor, was used instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Star is Found: Our Adventures Casting Some of Hollywood's Biggest Movies|first1=Janet|last1=Hirshenson|first2=Jane|last2=Jenkins|pages=35\u20137|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2007|isbn=978-0547545264}}</ref> The role of Magda went to another Swedish actress, [[Kristina Wayborn]], who the producers first noticed playing [[Greta Garbo]] in the miniseries ''The Silent Lovers''.<ref name=inside/>\n\n''Octopussy'' is also the first film to feature Robert Brown as M, following the death of [[Bernard Lee]] in 1981.
