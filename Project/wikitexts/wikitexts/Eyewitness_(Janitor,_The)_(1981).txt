A wealthy Vietnamese man suspected of criminal connections is murdered in Daryll's office building, and Toni suspects Deever knows something about it.\n\nShe keeps after him for information, a pursuit Daryll allows because he is romantically interested in Toni, and a \"cat and mouse\" game ensues.  This convinces the real killers that Daryll does know vital information about the murder, so he and Toni end up with their lives in danger over this false assumption.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[William Hurt]] as Daryll Deever\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Antonia \"Toni\" Sokolow\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Joseph\n* [[James Woods]] as Alan \u201cAldo\u201d Mercer\n* [[Irene Worth]] as Mrs. Sokolow\n* [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Mr. Deever\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Linda Mercer\n* [[Albert Paulsen]] as Mr. Sokolow\n* [[Steven Hill]] as Lt. Jacobs\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Lt. Black\n* [[Alice Drummond]] as Mrs. Eunice Deever\n* [[Chao-Li Chi]] as Mr. Long\n* [[Keone Young]] as Mr. Long's son\n\n== Production ==\nThe news equipment and promotional posters actually belonged to a real television station in New York City, then-[[Metromedia]] owned [[independent station (North America)|independent]] WNEW-TV. Two then-station employees, news anchor [[John Roland]] and sportscaster [[Bill Mazer]], made cameo appearances in the film. Sigourney Weaver, whose father [[Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver]] had been a top network television executive, also worked for the station in order to gain experience. Both WNEW-TV (now Fox-owned-and-operated [[WNYW]]) and the film were under the corporate umbrella of 21st Century Fox until March 20, 2019 when Fox closed on its sale of its entertainment assets, including the film, to The Walt Disney Company.\n\nProducer-director [[Peter Yates]] and screenwriter [[Steve Tesich]] had collaborated two years earlier on the film ''[[Breaking Away]]''.\n\n''[[Hum To Mohabbat Karega]]'', a 2000 [[Bollywood]] thriller-comedy film starring [[Karishma Kapoor]] and [[Bobby Deol]], was inspired by ''Eyewitness''.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0082353|title=Eyewitness}}\n* {{tcmdb title|74401|Eyewitness}}\n* {{amg movie|16466}}\n* {{AFI film|56595}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1006917-eyewitness|Eyewitness}}\n* {{Mojo title|eyewitness|Eyewitness}}\n\n{{Peter Yates}}\n\n[[Category:1980s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Yates]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-thriller-film-stub}}\n{{mystery-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
