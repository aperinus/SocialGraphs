The film presents a [[satire|satirical]] view of the [[McCarthy era|McCarthy communist-hunt era]] and certain other aspects of [[United States]] politics and society. The film, which was produced in Europe after Chaplin's exile from the U.S. in 1952, did not open in the United States until 1972. For this reason, the movie was presented on the island of [[Ischia]], in [[Italy]].\n\n==Plot==\n\"One of the minor annoyances in modern life is a [[revolution]].\" Deposed by revolution in his home country of Estrovia, [[King]] Igor Shahdov ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) comes to [[New York City]] almost broke, his securities having been stolen by his own [[Prime Minister]]. He tries to contact the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] with his ideas for using [[Nuclear power|atomic power]] to create a [[utopia]].\n\nAt a dinner party, some of which is televised live (unbeknown to him), Shahdov reveals he has had some experience in the theatre. He's approached to do TV commercials but does not like the idea. Later, he does make a few commercials in order to get some money.\n\nInvited to speak at a [[progressive school]], Shahdov meets Rupert Macabee ([[Michael Chaplin (actor)|Michael Chaplin]]), a ten-year-old historian and editor of the school paper who doesn't want to disclose his political affinity due to fear of McCarthyism.  Macabee proceeds to give Shahdov a stern [[Marxist]] lecture. Although Rupert himself says he distrusts all forms of government, his parents are Communists who are jailed for not giving up names at a Joseph McCarthy-type hearing. Because young Rupert had spent time with him, Shahdov is suspected of being a Communist himself, and has to face one of the hearings. He is cleared of all charges, but not before a scene in which Shahdov accidentally directs a strong stream of water from a fire hose at the members of the \"[[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]]\" (HUAC), who scatter in panic. He decides to join his estranged queen in Paris for a reconciliation.\n\nIn the meantime, the authorities force the child to reveal the names of his parents' friends in exchange for his parents' freedom. Grieving and guilt-ridden, Rupert is presented to King Shahdov as a \"patriot\". Shahdov reassures him that the anti-Communist scare is a lot of nonsense which will be over soon and invites him to come to Europe with his parents for a visit.\n\nIn addition to its condemnation of HUAC's methods, the film takes witty potshots at American [[commercialism]], popular music, [[celebrity culture]], and film. A dinner party scene includes a number of satirical portrayals of actors and public figures of the period, including [[Sophie Tucker]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as King Shahdov\n* [[Maxine Audley]] as Queen Irene\n* [[Jerry Desmonde]] as Prime Minister Voudel\n* [[Oliver Johnston (actor)|Oliver Johnston]] as Ambassador Jaume\n* [[Dawn Addams]] as Ann Kay - TV Specialist\n* [[Sid James]] as Johnson - TV Advertiser (billed as Sidney James)\n* Joan Ingram as Mona Cromwell - Hostess\n* [[Michael Chaplin (actor)|Michael Chaplin]] as Rupert Macabee\n* John McLaren as Macabee Senior\n* [[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]] as Headmaster\n* Harry Green as Lawyer\n* [[Robert Arden]] as Liftboy\n* [[Alan Gifford]] as School Superintendent\n* [[Robert Cawdron]] as U.S. Marshal\n* [[George Woodbridge (actor)|George Woodbridge]], Clifford Buckton, and Vincent Lawson as Members of Atomic Commission\n* [[Shani Wallis]] as Cabaret Singer\n* [[Joy Nichols]]\n* Lauri Lupino Lane\n* George Truzzi\n* [[Frazer Hines]] (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\nThe film did well in Europe, but its lack of U.S. distribution severely hampered its commercial impact. The film divides opinion over its merits. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it a \"tepid disappointment\" and a \"half-hearted comedy with sour political undertones\" with some \"spasmodically funny scenes\".<ref name=varrev/> The film ranked 1st on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]] in 1957.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=2012-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film has a \"fresh\" rating of 80% on the [[review aggregator]] website  [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 10 reviews.<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/king_in_new_york/|title=A King in New York|date=1 January 1957|work=rottentomatoes.com|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nChaplin biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]], writing in 2003, believes ''A King in New York'' to be an important film within Chaplin's body of work. He concludes his lengthy examination of the film with the statement, \"Although ''A King in New York'' targets the social and political climate of the 1950s, its satiric commentary is timeless. Despite its flaws, the film remains a fascinating study of life in America through the eyes of its most famous exile\".<ref>Vance, Jeffrey. ''Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema'' (2003): Harry N.
