The film stars [[Sam Worthington]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Danny Huston]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], and [[Liam Neeson]], with [[Jonathan Liebesman]] directing a [[screenplay]] by [[Dan Mazeau]] and [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick|David Leslie Johnson]] from a story by them and [[Greg Berlanti]]. ''Wrath of the Titans'' takes place a decade after the events of the preceding film as the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] lose control over the imprisoned [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (thanks to humanity's lack of prayers which also is draining their immortality) and [[Perseus]] is called, this time to rescue his father [[Zeus]], overthrow the Titans, and save mankind.\n\nTalk of a sequel began with the release of ''Clash of the Titans'' in March 2010. Writers Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson were hired in June 2010 and director Jonathan Liebesman was brought on board in August 2010. The majority of the casting took place between January and February 2011. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London]] in March 2011. Like its predecessor, the film was converted to [[3D film|3D]] in [[post-production]]. ''Wrath of the Titans'' was released in 2D and 3D on March 30, 2012, in the United States. The film received widespread negative reception from critics and grossed $302 million worldwide. A sequel entitled ''Revenge of the Titans'' was planned for a 2013 release, but was cancelled due to the two films' critical failures and too few ideas for the script.<ref name=\"ScreenRant\">{{Cite news|last=Scaefer|first=Sandy|url=https://screenrant.com/clash-of-the-titans-3-update-not-happening/|title='Clash of the Titans 3' Not Happening Without 'Fresh' Ideas|date=December 26, 2013|work=Screen Rant|access-date=March 20, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after defeating Hades' [[Kraken]], [[Perseus]], the [[demigod]] son of [[Zeus]], now lives as a fisherman with his young son [[Heleus]], after the death of his wife [[Io (mythology)|Io]]. Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods; as a result, the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal, meaning they can no longer sustain the walls of [[Tartarus]] which are holding back the imprisoned [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus|Kronos]] from freedom. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved.\n\nZeus meets his brothers [[Hades]] and [[Poseidon]] and his son [[Ares]] in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares too, having decided to betray Zeus, attacks his father. Poseidon is fatally injured in the ensuing fight. Hades and Ares imprison Zeus, stealing his thunderbolt. They plan to make a deal with Kronos; in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's [[Ichor|divine power]] to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world.\n\nAfter killing a two-headed [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his demigod son [[Agenor]], who will lead him to [[Hephaestus]], who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his [[trident]] and succumbs to his injuries. Perseus, [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island.\n\nAgenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus's thunderbolt, Hades's [[Bident|pitchfork]], and Poseidon's trident, which can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After an encounter with three 30&nbsp;ft. [[Cyclopes]], the travelers eventually meet the now-mortal Hephaestus and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the [[labyrinth]]. Once inside the labyrinth they encounter the [[Minotaur]] that attacks them, but Perseus manages to kill it.\n\nThe group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to Hades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has forgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in contrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the former's revival. Perseus arrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades' pitchfork, allowing Perseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.\n\nAiming to retrieve Zeus' thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos, Perseus challenges him to a duel. Meanwhile, Andromeda's army is overwhelmed by the [[Machai|Makhai]]. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the creatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromeda's army. Zeus and Hades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares, eventually killing him with the thunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus destroys Kronos by traveling to his heart and throwing the spear into it.\n\nZeus reconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades leaves, telling Perseus that he is now powerless. Perseus kisses Andromeda, and Heleus tells his father that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells him they cannot. Perseus encourages Heleus to be proud of himself, as he is the son of Perseus and the grandson of Zeus. The film ends with Perseus giving his sword to Heleus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as [[Perseus]], the [[demigod]] son of Zeus, who defeated the [[Kraken]] and saved humanity; Zeus enlists Perseus' help in order to defeat the Titan [[Cronus|Kronos]]. None of Perseus\u2019 adventures in the film are based on mythological sources.\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Zeus]], the king of the gods as well as the god of the sky, lightning and thunder. Also Perseus' father.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Hades]], the god of the [[underworld]] and the dead. Hades is a brother of Zeus who resents his brother for having been appointed lord of the underworld.\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], who was saved by Perseus when she was a princess; now crowned Queen of [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], she joins Perseus in his quest to defeat Kronos. Pike replaced [[Alexa Davalos]] in the role, due to a scheduling conflict. In classical mythology, Andromeda was a princess of [[Aethiopia]], who marries Perseus after he saves her from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]].\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as [[Agenor]], the demigod son of Poseidon; he joins Perseus in his quest to defeat Kronos. The character is only very loosely based on the mythological Agenor, son of Poseidon and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], who was King of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Phoenicia]].\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as [[Hephaestus]], god of metalworkers and blacksmiths who forged of the gods' weapons. He was called the \"Fallen One\" for taking Hades' side in a family dispute.\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as [[Ares]], the god of war and violence, who betrays his father Zeus to join Hades.\n* [[Danny Huston]] as [[Poseidon]], the god of the sea, Agenor's father. Huston had also played Poseidon in one scene in the [[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|previous film]].\n\n[[Lily James]] appears as Korrina, a female warrior from Argos, while [[Matt Milne]] plays another Argive soldier. Alejandro Naranjo plays the Argive general Mantius.\n\n[[John Bell (Scottish actor)|John Bell]] plays [[Heleus|Helius]], the young son of Perseus and Io. In classical Greek mythology, Helius was one of the sons of Perseus and Andromeda; not [[Io (mythology)|Io]] who lived hundreds of years before Perseus and was actually one of his ancestors.\n\n[[Sinead Cusack]] plays the local healer and teacher Clea.\n\nThe [[Minotaur]] is performed by [[Spencer Wilding]], with [[Martin Bayfield]] motion-captured the oldest of the three [[Cyclops|cyclopes]], who are based on the mythological cyclopes [[Arges (cyclops)|Arges]], Steropes, and Brontes, who assisted Hephaestes.\n\n==Production==\nTalks of a sequel to ''Clash of the Titans'' began as early as March 2010. [[Tamer Hassan]], who played [[Ares]] in the first film, stated at the film's world premiere that, \"They want this one to do well so they can go ahead with the sequel, ''Return of the Gods''\".<ref>{{cite web| last=Sharp | first=Craig| date=2010-03-29| title=FilmShaft Exclusive!

Liebesman explained, \"I think what you have to remember is the first film was neither shot nor edited with 3D in mind. It was shot as a 2D movie and edited as a 2D film, and they decided to convert it with six or seven weeks to go until release, which is insane; the technology was not there. That's why we're conceiving it from the start, from the ground up, in 3D, editing in 3D for 3D.\" Liebesman also stated the reason behind the conversion was because he wants to shoot on film, which will give the film's imagery better texture than he would get shooting digitally.<ref>{{cite web| last=Gilchrist| first=Todd| date=2011-02-24| title='Clash of the Titans 2' Will Be Converted To 3D, Says Director Jonathan Liebesman| url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2011/02/24/clash-of-the-titans-2-converted-to-3d/| work=[[Moviefone]]| access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2011.
