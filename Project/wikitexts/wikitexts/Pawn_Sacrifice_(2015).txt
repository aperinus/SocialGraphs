It follows Fischer's challenge against top Soviet chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] during the [[Cold War]] and culminating in the [[World Chess Championship 1972]] match versus [[Boris Spassky]] in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]]. It was directed by [[Edward Zwick]] and written by [[Steven Knight]], and stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Fischer, [[Liev Schreiber]] as Spassky, [[Lily Rabe]] as [[Joan Fischer]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as [[William Lombardy]]. It was released in the United States on September 16, 2015.<ref name=\"deadlineill\">{{cite news |last=Pedersen |first=Erik |url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/ill-see-you-in-my-dreams-release-date-pawn-sacrifice-1201366262/ |title='I'll See You In My Dreams' and 'Pawn Sacrifice' Get Release Dates |magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=May 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising Maguire's performance, but grossed only $5 million worldwide against a budget of $19 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, [[Bobby Fischer]] tears apart his hotel room in a [[Paranoid personality disorder|paranoid delusional]] state, believing he is being spied upon by the Soviet [[KGB]].\n\nTwo decades earlier, in 1951 [[Brooklyn]], Fischer's mother, a [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jew]]ish immigrant, explains to 8-year-old Bobby that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has her under surveillance because she supports [[Communist revolution|Marxist revolution]] in the U.S. She coaches Bobby on what to say to the FBI if he is ever approached.\n\nBobby immerses himself in chess and becomes an expert player. Despite her worries that chess is becoming an obsession, his mother takes him to an adult chess club, where he impresses the resident chess master and is accepted as a student. Bobby enters the world of professional chess championships and soon becomes the youngest grandmaster ever.\n\nBobby's hatred of distractions leads to frequent tantrums. He enters a team tournament in Varna, Bulgaria, where he realizes Soviet grandmasters are deliberately [[draw (chess)|drawing]] games with the collusion of the [[World Chess Federation]]. Erupting in a rant that this system makes it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win the championship, Bobby quits the tournament and gives up chess.\n\nWhen Bobby returns to the U.S., lawyer Paul Marshall offers to help him modify the tournament rules, working [[pro bono]] to give Fischer a fair chance to win future tournaments. Fischer re-enters professional chess and selects Father [[William Lombardy]], a former [[World Junior Chess Championship|World Junior Chess Champion]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]], as his second. Lombardy struggles to calm Bobby's rock-star behavior and impossible demands.\n\nAs his demands are accepted, Bobby overcomes most grandmasters across the world and nears the world championship, becoming a hero to the American public. At the height of the [[Cold War]], Soviet domination of the [[World Chess Championship]] is being exploited for propaganda as proof that the Communist system is superior to American democracy. U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] closely monitor and encourage Bobby's progress.\n\nPrivately, Lombardy tells Marshall that excessive focus on chess strategy has destroyed the sanity of the game's greatest players.\n\nDuring a tournament in Santa Monica, California, Bobby loses to Soviet grandmaster [[Boris Spassky]], the world champion. The next morning, an enraged Bobby approaches and berates Spassky on the beach.\n\nAs he pursues the world championship, the pressure drives Bobby into [[paranoia]] and delusional [[psychosis]]. Meeting with Marshall, Bobby's sister Joan quotes from her brother's letters about how the Communists collude with International Jewry to destroy him. Joan explains that Bobby believes this despite being Jewish himself and pleads with Marshall to arrange for Bobby to receive psychiatric help. Marshall is dismissive, but as Bobby's breakdown escalates, he suggests to Lombardy that Bobby needs therapy and medication, which Lombardy rebuffs.\n\nReporters and fans from around the world assemble at [[Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland]], to witness the historic [[World Chess Championship 1972]] match between Bobby and Spassky. Bobby loses the first game and fails to appear for the second, losing it by forfeit. Bobby is easily distracted by small noises from the audience, rolling cameras, and the hard sound of the chessboard, which leads him to make extreme demands for silence and fewer distractions, which could cause another forfeit. Spassky, insulted by the possibility of maintaining his title by forfeit, orders the Soviet entourage to accede to Bobby's demands.\n\nBobby wins the third game by unconventional tactics. Game four is a draw, but Bobby wins game five after Spassky himself begins showing paranoia signs. Experts speculate the next game will determine the outcome of the match. In game six, Bobby uses an opening he has never played before, surprising the audience. His inspired play amazes Spassky, who resigns and leads a [[standing ovation]] of Bobby's victory.\n\nA postscript reveals Bobby went on to win the match and that his sixth game against Spassky is still considered the greatest chess game ever played. However, his delusions worsened, and he went on to forfeit his title and died in 2008 as a fugitive from U.S. prosecution.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Bobby Fischer]]\n** [[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]] as teenage Bobby Fischer\n** Aiden Lovekamp as young Bobby Fischer\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Boris Spassky]]\n* [[Lily Rabe]] as [[Joan Fischer]]\n** [[Sophie N\u00e9lisse]] as young Joan\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as [[William Lombardy]]\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Paul Marshall\n* [[Robin Weigert]] as Regina Fischer\n* [[Conrad Pla]] as [[Carmine Nigro]]\n* [[Evelyne Brochu]] as Donna\n* Katie Nolan as Maria\n* Edward Zinoviev as [[Efim Geller]]\n* Brett Watson as Chief Arbiter [[Lothar Schmid]]\n\n==Title meaning==\nDirector Edward Zwick explained the meaning of the film's title: \"You have [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Richard Nixon]] calling Bobby Fischer; you have [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] and the [[KGB]] agents following Boris Spassky.

There are many inaccuracies. The chess positions are simply idiotic. The film is quite budgetary, so take a chess consultant, pay him a fee, he will correct your position.
