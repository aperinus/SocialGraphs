The stranded passengers are forced to spend the night at a hotel. In the same predicament are [[Charters and Caldicott]], [[cricket]] enthusiasts anxious to see the last days of the [[Test cricket|Test match]] in [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Manchester]], and Miss Froy, a governess and music teacher. Miss Froy listens to a folk singer in the street; he is strangled to death by an unseen murderer.\n\nThat evening, Iris is bothered by a loud noise from the room above hers. It is caused by Gilbert Redman, an [[ethnomusicologist]] who plays the clarinet.\n\nThe next morning at the railway station, Iris is hit on the head by a large planter dropped from above. Miss Froy helps her onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, lawyer Eric Todhunter and his mistress, who is passing herself off as \"Mrs. Todhunter.\" As a result of her injury, Iris faints. She comes to in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep.\n\nWhen Iris wakes up, Miss Froy has vanished, and the other passengers deny having seen her. Todhunter pretends not to remember her to avoid drawing attention to his liaison with his mistress. Iris searches for Miss Froy with Gilbert's assistance. Brain surgeon Dr. Hartz says Iris may be suffering from \"concussion-related hallucinations.\" Fearing that any delay would make them miss the cricket match, Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy. Todhunter's mistress admits to seeing Miss Froy, proving to everyone that she exists.\n\n[[File:The-Lady-Vanishes-1938.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Left to right: Catherine Lacey, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave with the bandaged patient]]\nAt the first stop, Dr. Hartz's patient, covered in bandages from tip to toe, is brought aboard on a stretcher. Madame Kummer, dressed exactly like Miss Froy, appears in her place. Now scared that she'll be revealed, Todhunter's mistress says Madame Kummer was Miss Froy. While continuing their search, Iris and Gilbert are attacked by a knife-wielding magician, Signor Doppo, who was in Iris's compartment. They suspect that Dr. Hartz's patient has been replaced by Miss Froy. Dr. Hartz tells his fellow conspirator, a British woman dressed as a nun, to drug Iris and Gilbert. Convinced they will soon be asleep, Hartz admits to them that he is involved in the conspiracy. The false nun does not follow Hartz's instructions out of loyalty to her fellow countrymen; Gilbert and Iris escape, free Miss Froy and replace her with Madame Kummer.\n\nWhen the train stops near the border, Dr. Hartz discovers the switch. He has part of the train diverted onto a branch line, where soldiers wait. Gilbert and Iris inform their fellow passengers what is happening. A uniformed soldier boards and requests that they all accompany him. They knock him out and take his pistol. Another soldier fires, wounding Charters in the hand.\n\nDuring the ensuing gunfight, Miss Froy tells Gilbert and Iris that she must get away as she is actually a spy. Just in case, she gives them a message (encoded in a tune) to deliver to the Foreign Office in [[Whitehall]]\u2014the same tune that the murdered street musician performed for her. Miss Froy then slips away into the forest. Todhunter attempts to surrender, waving a white handkerchief, and is shot dead. Gilbert and Caldicott then commandeer the locomotive, but the knocked out soldier wakes up and threatens the rest of the guests. The nun escapes through a side door and changes the tracks but is shot in the leg; however, Caldicott and Gilbert manage to pull her up into the train before she is left behind.\n\nIn London, Charters and Caldicott discover the Test Match has been cancelled due to flooding. Seeing her fianc\u00e9 from a distance, Iris jumps into a cab with Gilbert. He kisses her. They arrive at the Foreign Office, but in the waiting room Gilbert realizes he cannot remember the vital tune. As they are led into the office, Gilbert and Iris then hear it. The doors open, revealing Miss Froy is playing the tune on a piano.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Margaret Lockwood]] as Iris Henderson\n* [[Michael Redgrave]] as Gilbert\n* [[Paul Lukas]] as Dr. Hartz\n* [[May Whitty]] as Miss Froy\n* [[Cecil Parker]] as Mr. Todhunter\n* [[Linden Travers]] as \"Mrs.\" Todhunter\n* [[Naunton Wayne]] as Caldicott\n* [[Basil Radford]] as Charters\n* [[Mary Clare]] as Baroness\n* {{ill|Emile Boreo|de}} as Hotel Manager\n* [[Googie Withers]] as Blanche\n* Sally Stewart as Julie\n* Philip Leaver as Signor Doppo\n* [[Selma Vaz Dias]] as Signora Doppo\n* [[Catherine Lacey]] as the Nun\n* [[Josephine Wilson]] as Madame Kummer\n* [[Charles Oliver (actor)|Charles Oliver]] as the Officer\n* Kathleen Tremaine as Anna\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Lady Vanishes'' was originally called ''The Lost Lady'', and Irish director [[Roy William Neill]] was assigned by producer [[Edward Black (producer)|Edward Black]] to make it. A crew was dispatched to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] to do background shots, but when the Yugoslav police accidentally discovered that they were not well-portrayed in the script, they kicked the crew out of the country, and Black scrapped the project. A year later, Hitchcock could not come up with a property to direct to fulfil his contract with Black, so he accepted when Black offered ''The Lost Lady'' to him.\n\n===Writing===\nHitchcock worked with the writers to make some changes to tighten up the opening and ending of the story, but otherwise the script did not change much.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/><ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nThe plot of Hitchcock's film differs considerably from White's novel. In ''The Wheel Spins'', Miss Froy really is an innocent old lady looking forward to seeing her octogenarian parents; she is abducted because she knows something (without realising its significance) that would cause trouble for the local authorities if it came out. Iris' mental confusion is due to sunstroke, not a blow to the head. In White's novel, the wheel keeps spinning: the train never stops, and there is no final shoot-out. Additionally, the supporting cast differs somewhat; for instance, in the novel, the Gilbert character is Max Hare, a young British engineer building a dam in the hills who knows the local language, and there is also a modern-languages professor character who acts as Iris's and Max's interpreter who does not appear in the film. The cricket-obsessed characters [[Charters and Caldicott]] were created especially for the film and do not appear in the novel.\n\nThe plot has clear references to the political situation leading up to the Second World War. The British characters, originally trying their hardest to keep out of the conflict, end up working together to fight off the jack-booted foreigners, while the lawyer who wishes to negotiate with the attackers by waving a white flag is shot and killed.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/><ref>Danny Peary. ''Guide for the Film Fanatic''. Simon & Schuster, 1986. Page 233.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAt first, Hitchcock considered [[Lilli Palmer]] for the female lead, but went instead with Margaret Lockwood, who was at the time relatively unknown.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|title=Why Stars Stop Being Stars: Margaret Lockwood|date=29 January 2020|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/stars-stop-stars-margaret-lockwood/}}</ref> Lockwood was attracted to the heroines of [[Ethel Lina White]]'s stories and accepted the role.\n\nMichael Redgrave was also unknown to the cinema audience, but was a rising stage star at the time. He was reluctant to leave the stage to do the film, but was convinced by [[John Gielgud]] to do so. As it happened, the film, Redgrave's first leading role, made him an international star.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> However, according to [[Robert Osborne]], host of [[Turner Classic Movies]], Redgrave and Hitchcock did not get along; Redgrave wanted more rehearsals, while Hitchcock valued spontaneity more. The two never worked together again.\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock can be seen]] at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], wearing a black coat and smoking a cigarette, near the end of the film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> The film marks the first appearance of the comedy [[double-act]] Charters and Caldicott (played by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford).\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cam\u00e9o - Une femme dispara\u00eet.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hitchcock cameo near the film's end]]\nThe film was shot at [[Islington Studios]],<ref name=tcmover>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=80706&category=Overview Overview]</ref> [[Shepherd's Bush]] and on location in [[Hampshire]] at [[Bordon and Longmoor Military Camps|Longmoor Military Camp]], the site of the [[Longmoor Military Railway#In popular culture|Longmoor Military Railway]]. It was the first film to be made under an agreement between [[Gaumont British|Gaumont-British]] and [[MGM]], in which Gaumont provided MGM with some of their Gainsborough films for release in the UK, for which MGM would pay half the production costs if MGM decided to release the film in the US. In the case of ''The Lady Vanishes'', however, [[20th Century-Fox]] handled the American release.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> Filming was briefly interrupted by an electricians' strike.<ref>\"Strike in Film Studio\", ''The Times of India'', 20 April 1938, page 11.</ref>\n\nElisabeth Weis contends that Hitchcock's use of sound in ''The Lady Vanishes'' uses the \"classical style\" \u2013 that is, that the director eschews [[expressionistic]] sounds in favour of sounds heard in a realistic context.<ref>{{harvnb|Weis|1982|p=77}}</ref> For example, when Iris faints on the train, rather than extraneous noises to denote delirium, only the sound of the train is heard.<ref>{{harvnb|Weis|1982|p=74}}</ref> Another striking use of sound is how evil things are often heard before they are shown. The evil doctor Dr. Hartz often is first heard before he appears on screen, representing an aural intrusion \"not so much an invasion of privacy as of security\".<ref>{{harvnb|Weis|1982|p=127}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nWhen ''The Lady Vanishes'' opened in the UK it was an immediate hit, becoming the most successful British film to that date. It was also very successful when it opened in New York.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> In a contemporary review, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' described the film as an \"out of the ordinary and exciting thriller\", praising Hitchcock's direction and the cast, especially Michael Redgrave, Paul Lukas and [[Dame May Whitty]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Lady Vanishes, The|last=A.
