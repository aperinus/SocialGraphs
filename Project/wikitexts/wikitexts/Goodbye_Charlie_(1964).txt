The film is about a callous womanizer who gets his just reward. It was adapted from [[George Axelrod]]'s 1959 play ''Goodbye, Charlie''. The play provided the basis for the 1991 film ''[[Switch (1991 film)|Switch]]'', with [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Jimmy Smits]].\n\n==Plot==\nPhilandering Hollywood writer Charlie Sorrel (Harry Madden) is shot and killed by Hungarian film producer Sir Leopold Sartori ([[Walter Matthau]]) when he is caught fooling around with Leopold's wife, Rusty ([[Laura Devon]]). Charlie's best and only friend, novelist George Tracy ([[Tony Curtis]]), arrives at Charlie's Malibu beach house for the memorial service, after an exhausting series of flights from Paris that have left him broke. There are only three people there, Charlie's agent and two ex-girlfriends. George does his best to eulogize his friend but there is little to be said in favor of Charlie, whose final bad joke on George is making him executor of his estate \u2014 which is a mess of debts and unpaid taxes.\n\nSoon after the guests leave, an exhausted George is awakened by a knock at the terrace door and the appearance of Bruce Minton III ([[Pat Boone]]) assisting a petite blonde woman ([[Debbie Reynolds]]) swathed in a huge brown overcoat. Bruce came to her aid when he found her dazed and wandering on the road, completely naked. She does not remember much, but she recognized Charlie's house as they drove past it and it made her feel safe. Bruce rushes off to a dinner engagement, leaving a sleep-deprived George to cope with the delirious woman. The next morning, George awakes to her screams. It all comes back to her: She is Charlie, [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a woman. After getting over the shock, she convinces George of her identity by telling him about a dirty trick that she had recently played on him as a man. George realizes that this must be a case of [[karma|karmic retribution]] for all of the women Charlie has used and betrayed.\n\nAll manner of complications arise as Charlie decides to take advantage of the situation. George helps her by establishing her as Charlie's widow, figuring out their finances \u2014 they are both broke \u2014 and boosting her morale. From the beginning, Charlie finds herself subject to a whole new set of emotions and sensations. Her masculine mannerisms begin to fade, partly because Charlie is a consummate actor, but also because the change is more than skin deep. At one point, she bursts into uncontrollable tears. George comforts her as he would comfort a weeping girl, wiping her tears and stroking her hair to calm her down, and then pulls back, disturbed at the tenderness.\n\nAlthough Charlie has changed her gender, she is unable to change her ways: she decides to solve her money problems by using her intimate knowledge for blackmail and by marrying Bruce for money. The plans fall apart when Bruce, on the verge of passing out, reveals the depth of his love for her. Charlie takes pity on him and slips the engagement ring into his hand.\n\nEventually, in a grim role reversal that she recognizes all too well when it happens, Charlie ends up being chased around the house by Leopold, who cheerfully spouts amorous nonsense but is, in fact, intent on rape. Rusty arrives, gun in hand, and just as Charlie climbs onto the terrace railing to jump, Rusty shoots her; she plunges into the ocean below. George, who has arrived in the midst of the m\u00e9l\u00e9e, leaps after Charlie, but there is no sign of a body. After lecturing the Sartoris for their actions, George orders them to leave and never tell anyone about it. The couple reconcile and Leopold promises eternal gratitude to George.\n\nGeorge is asleep in a chair; the sound of a woman's voice calling \"Charlie\" over and over again wakes him. This time there are two beings on the terrace \u2014 a woman ([[Debbie Reynolds]]) and her [[Great Dane]], Charlie. George quickly establishes her bona fides as a real person, Virginia Mason. She takes one look at him and decides he needs food. She commands Charlie to sit and stay. Virginia and George talk in the kitchen; it is clearly [[love at first sight]]. The dog goes into the living room, to the bookcase, to Charlie's secret cache of vodka (behind ''[[War and Peace]]''). The bottle falls and breaks; Charlie laps a bit from the floor and looking heavenward, begins to howl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as George Tracy\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Charles Sorel / Virginia Mason\n* [[Pat Boone]] as Bruce Minton III\n* [[Joanna Barnes]] as Janine Highland\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Sir Leopold Sartori\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Franny Salzman (as Ellen McRae) \n* [[Laura Devon]] as Rusty Sartori\n* [[Martin Gabel]] as Morton Craft\n* [[Roger C.

He later admitted to having a drinking problem around this time and shot some scenes for the movie while drunk.... This film remains resolutely undiscovered by queer/feminist film analysts, despite its subject matter and bisexual director... I think this is in part because Reynolds\u2019 performance is so utterly sexless. It holds any feeling of kinkiness at bay. However, there's no denying it because Boone plays a guy who effectively tries to make out with a dude.\" The magazine also pointed out the opening scene features a tracking shot at a party where a man gets upset and shoots the man sleeping with his wife just like in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997).<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-surprisingly-interesting-cinema-of-pat-boone/|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|date=10 September 2019|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|title=The Surprisingly Interesting Cinema of Pat Boone}}</ref>\n\n==Television adaptation==\nIn 1985, ''Goodbye Charlie'' was made into a TV series (starring [[Suzanne Somers]] as the reincarnated Charlie), but only the pilot episode was broadcast.<ref>{{IMDb title|0250409|Goodbye Charlie (TV pilot)}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1964]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0058154}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|goodbye_charlie}}\n* {{TCMDb title|16777}}\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A07E3D8133AE13ABC4152DFB767838F679EDE Review of film] at [[New York Times]]\n* {{IBDB title|2873}}\n{{Vincente Minnelli}}\n\n[[Category:1964 films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films about reincarnation]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vincente Minnelli]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Harry Kurnitz]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andr\u00e9 Previn]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:1964 comedy films]]\n[[Category:CinemaScope films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
