It stars [[Michael Fassbender]] as the eponymous Counselor as well as [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Javier Bardem]] and [[Brad Pitt]]. The film deals with themes such as greed, mortality, love, and trust in the context of the Mexican drug trade. The extremely violent and bloodthirsty activities of [[drug cartels]] are depicted as the Counselor, a high-level lawyer, gets involved in a drug deal around the troubled [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez|Ciudad Juarez, Mexico]]/[[Texas]] border area.\n\n''The Counselor'' was chosen as the closing film at the 2013 [[Morelia International Film Festival|Morelia Film Festival]] and also played the [[Cork Film Festival]]. The film was theatrically released on October 25, 2013 and is dedicated to Scott's brother, [[Tony Scott]], who died in 2012. It received mixed reviews and grossed $71&nbsp;million worldwide against a budget of $25&nbsp;million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Mexico, cocaine is packaged in barrels and concealed in a sewage truck, and driven across the border to the United States where it's stored at a sewage treatment plant.\n\nA lawyer from Texas who is known only as \"The Counselor\" goes to Amsterdam to meet with a diamond dealer to purchase an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Laura. Returning to the United States, The Counselor attends a party back in Texas thrown by drug dealer Reiner and his girlfriend Malkina. He discusses an upcoming drug deal he is going in on with Reiner, which would be The Counselor's first. Their discussion ends with Reiner describing a device called \"the ''bolito''\" which after being pulled around one\u2019s neck, self-constricts and decapitates the victim. Afterwards, at a dinner with Laura, The Counselor proposes marriage to her and she accepts.\n\nThe Counselor meets with Westray, a business associate of Reiner's, to deliver his investment for the upcoming drug deal. Westray informs the Counselor of the deal's 4000% return rate, but cautions the Counselor about becoming involved, saying that Mexican cartels are merciless. Despite this, the Counselor remains outwardly confident and unconcerned. Following the conversation with Westray, The Counselor visits a prison inmate named Ruth, a court-appointed client of his who is on trial for murder. Ruth explains that her son is a biker who was recently arrested for speeding and cannot post bail. She asks the Counselor for help and he agrees to bail Ruth's son out for her as a favor.\n\nMalkina senses an opportunity to undermine the Counselor's upcoming deal and to profit for herself. To that end, she employs \"the Wireman\" to help her steal the drugs. After discovering that the biker is working for the cartels and has plans to pick up a truck with a drug shipment, the Wireman executes a plan to steal the component needed to start the truck by decapitating the biker with a wire stretched across an empty desert road. With the component in his possession, the Wireman steals the truck containing the cocaine.\n\nLearning of the theft, Westray meets with the Counselor to notify him of the biker's true identity, a valued drug cartel member known as \"the Green Hornet.\" He explains that the biker is now dead, with the cocaine also being stolen, bleakly intoning the Counselor's culpability in the eyes of the cartel. Westray says he is leaving town immediately and suggests the Counselor do the same. Westray explains that the cartel's ruthlessness extends to creating \"[[snuff film]]s\" where kidnapping victims are filmed being decapitated. The Counselor makes an urgent call to Laura, arranging to meet her in another state, where he will explain the situation to her.\n\nWhile transporting the drugs, the Wireman is pulled over by two cartel members pretending to be police officers. A gunfight ensues, resulting in the death of the Wireman, his accomplice, one of the cartel members, and an innocent bystander. The surviving cartel member repossesses the truck with the drugs and gets it delivered to its final destination. Reiner is accidentally killed by cartel members while they are attempting to capture him. The cartel then kidnaps Laura.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, the Counselor contacts ''Jefe'', a high-ranking cartel member, for suggestions on what to do next and to plead to spare Laura's life. Jefe begins speaking philosophically, citing the life and poetry of [[Antonio Machado]] to underline his advice. Jefe darkly and mordantly advises the Counselor to resign himself to his fate that was created by the choices he made long beforehand. He explains that despite the Counselor's willingness to exchange his life for Laura's, it is too late.\n\nThe Counselor remains in Mexico, defeated and in mourning. A package is slipped under the door of his hotel room and in it he finds a DVD with \"''Hola!''\" written on it. Realizing that the disc likely contains a snuff film of Laura sent by the cartel, he breaks down. In an unnamed location, Laura's headless body is dumped into a landfill.\n\nMalkina's failed effort to steal the drugs does not deter her. She tracks Westray to London, where she hires a woman to seduce him and steal his bank codes. She then has accomplices steal Westray's laptop, and he is killed with the \"''bolito''\" device that Reiner had previously described. Malkina then meets her banker at a restaurant, coolly explaining how she wants her profits and accounts to be handled and plans to move to Hong Kong.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as the Counselor\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Malkina\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Reiner\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Laura\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Westray\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Ruth\n* [[Natalie Dormer]] as the Blonde\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as the Priest\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as the Diamond Dealer\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as 'Jefe'\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Michael\n* [[Velibor Topi\u0107]] as the Sedan Man\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Tony\n* [[Emma Rigby]] as Tony's girlfriend\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Randy\n* [[Dean Norris]] as the Buyer\n* [[Richard Cabral]] as 'the Green Hornet', a biker who is Ruth's son\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as the Wireman\n* [[Alex Hafner]] as the Second Patrolman\n* [[Andrea Deck]] as the Watching Girl\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Literary references==\nIn the second half of the film, ''Jefe'' recites directly from the poem ''Campos de Castilla'' by Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]]. \"''Caminante, no hay camino. Se hace camino al andar'',\" which translates in its original context as: ''Wanderer, there is no road; the road is made as you go along''. Jefe shares this line from the poem as well as details about Machado's reflections regarding the prospects of his own life after learning of his wife being diagnosed with terminal tuberculosis. Jefe concludes by telling the Counselor, \"You are the world you have created. And when you cease to exist, that world you have created will also cease to exist.\"<ref>{{cite web |first= Vincent |last= Carrella |title= The Crossing, The Counselor and the Timely Death of Cormac McCarthy |publisher= Serpent Box |date= October 28, 2013 |url= http://serpentbox.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/the-crossing-the-counselor-and-the-timely-death-of-cormac-mccarthy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223211518/https://serpentbox.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/the-crossing-the-counselor-and-the-timely-death-of-cormac-mccarthy/ |archive-date=December 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nOn January 18, 2012, it was reported that novelist [[Cormac McCarthy]] had sold his first [[spec script]], ''The Counselor'', to [[Nick Wechsler (producer)|Nick Wechsler]], Steve Schwartz and Paula Mae Schwartz, who had previously produced the [[The Road (2009 film)|film adaptation]] of McCarthy's novel ''[[The Road]]''.<ref name=\"McCarthy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/no-country-old-men-novelist-cormac-mccarthy-sells-first-spec-script-34512 |title=Cormac McCarthy Sells First Spec Script |work=TheWrap.com |publisher=The Wrap News Inc |date=January 18, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> On January 31, it was reported that [[Ridley Scott]] was currently considering several directorial projects, but that there was a strong possibility that ''The Counselor'' would be his next film and his follow-up to ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.<ref name=\"ScottTalks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/01/ridley-scott-in-talks-for-cormac-mccarthys-the-counselor |title=Ridley Scott in Talks For Cormac McCarthy's 'The Counselor' |author=Fleming, Mike |website=Deadline Hollywood |publisher=PMC |date=January 31, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> On February 9, it was confirmed that Scott would direct.<ref name=\"ScottConfirmed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/ridley-scott-confirmed-to-direct-cormac-mccarthy-penned-the-counselor |title=Ridley Scott confirmed to direct Cormac McCarthy penned 'The Counselor' |author=Shirey, Paul |work=JoBlo.com |publisher=Joblo Media Inc |date=February 9, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> Scott also became a producer.
