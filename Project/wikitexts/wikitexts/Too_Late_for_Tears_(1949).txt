It concerns a ruthless [[femme fatale]]'s murderous attempt to hold on to a suitcase containing US$60,000 (${{Inflation|US-GDP|60000|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}) that does not belong to her. The screenplay was written by [[Roy Huggins]], developed from a serial he wrote for the ''Saturday Evening Post''.\n\nThe film was reissued as '''''Killer Bait''''' in 1955. ''Too Late for Tears'' has been in the public domain for many years; there are several different edits of the film with different running times.<ref>{{IMDb title|0041968|Too Late For Tears}}</ref> On January 25, 2014, a restored 35mm print was premiered by the Film Noir Foundation at Noir City 12 at the [[Castro Theatre]] in San Francisco. The film was restored by [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]] and the Film Noir Foundation, with the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] providing some of the necessary funding. The restoration combined 35mm dupe negative elements from France with some material from surviving 35mm and 16mm prints.<ref>Jeremy Arnold, [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/5793/too-late-for-tears#articles-reviews?articleId=1091929 \u201cToo Late for Tears (1949)\u201d], [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM.com]] ''(Retrieved 2022-09-24.)''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Toolatefortears.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Don DeFore]] and [[Lizabeth Scott]]]]\n\nJane and Alan Palmer fortuitously come into possession of a bag filled with cash. They check the bag into Union Station while they determine whether to keep it or turn it over to the authorities. Danny Fuller appears at the Palmer apartment while Alan is at work, asks Jane about the money, and threatens her.\n\nJane agrees to split the money with Danny, kills Alan, and threatens to blackmail Danny unless he helps her cover up the murder.  Soon, Jane faces not only her mistrust of Danny, but also inquiries from Alan's sister, Kathy, and a stranger named Don Blake who suddenly appears claiming to be Alan's old Army buddy.  Don and Kathy become attracted to each other.\n\nJane eventually claims the money bag and locates Danny who tells her the money is a blackmail payoff for an insurance scam. Jane kills Danny and flees to Mexico with the money.  Don finds Jane in a hotel room and reveals he is the brother of her first husband, Bob, and suspects her of his \"suicide.\" The police rush into the room and Jane accidentally falls off the balcony to her death.  Don finds Kathy in the hotel lobby and it is revealed they are now married and will shorten their honeymoon to return to the U.S.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lizabeth Scott]] as Jane Palmer\n* [[Don DeFore]] as Don Blake/Blanchard\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Danny Fuller\n* [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]] as Alan Palmer\n* [[Kristine Miller]] as Kathy Palmer\n* [[Barry Kelley]] as Lieutenant Breach\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nWhen the film was released ''The New York Times'' wrote:\n{{blockquote|If proof be needed at this point that money is the root of all evil\u2014a theme, incidentally, which has been the root of more than one motion picture\u2014then ''Too Late for Tears,'' which came to the Mayfair on Saturday, is proof positive. For producer Hunt Stromberg, director Byron Haskin and scenarist Roy Huggins, who adapted his own ''Saturday Evening Post'' serial, herein have fashioned an effective melodramatic elaboration of that theme. Despite an involved plot and an occasional overabundance of palaver, not all of which is bright, this yarn about a cash-hungry dame who doesn't let men or conscience stand in her way, is an adult and generally suspenseful adventure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C00E1DF133FE33BBC4D52DFBE668382659EDE |title=The Screen In Review; 'Too Late for Tears,' Adult and Suspenseful Adventure Film, Is New Bill at Mayfair |author=A.

Jane's drive for wealth was so extreme that she will not stop at murder to rise above her impoverished middle-class circumstances, and her warped character is used to show how money can't buy one happiness. The husky-voiced winsome smiling Lizabeth Scott turns in a finely tuned performance as the femme fatale; while Dan Duryea is in his element as the alcoholic weak-kneed cad, who shows he doesn't have as much stomach for his criminal mischief as does his lady accomplice.<ref>[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/toolatefortears.htm Schwartz, Dennis].
