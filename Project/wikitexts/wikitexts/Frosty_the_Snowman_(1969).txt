It is the first television special featuring the character Frosty the Snowman. The special first aired on December 7, 1969 on the [[CBS]] television network in the United States;<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |access-date=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/164/mode/2up |pages=164\u2013165}}</ref> it has aired annually for the network's Christmas and holiday season every year since.

But after noticing the high hot temperature and fearing that he would melt, Frosty, along with a young girl named Karen and a rabbit named Hocus Pocus, must go to the North Pole to be safe from melting.\n\n[[Arthur Rankin Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] wanted to give the show and its characters the look of a [[Christmas card]], so [[Paul Coker Jr.]], a greeting card and ''[[MAD Magazine|Mad]]'' magazine artist, was hired to do the character and background drawings. The animation was produced by [[Mushi Production]] in Tokyo, Japan, with [[Hanna-Barbera]] staffer Yusaku \"Steve\" Nakagawa and then-Mushi staffer [[Osamu Dezaki]] (who is uncredited) among the animation staff. Durante was one of the first people to record the song when it was released in 1950 (though at the time the song had slightly different lyrics); he re-recorded the song for the special.\n\nRankin/Bass veteran writer [[Romeo Muller]] adapted and expanded the story for television, as he had done with the \"Animagic\" stop motion production of ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]''.\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the special number 9 on its 10 Best Family Holiday Specials list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/574 574]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/574}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn a schoolhouse on Christmas Eve, inept magician Professor Hinkle unsuccessfully performs his tricks during a Christmas party, upon being dismissed, the children go outside to play in the snow where they build a snowman and name him \"Frosty.\" Professor Hinkle chases his hat over his rabbit Hocus Pocus, which blows off by the wind and is caught by Karen who puts it on Frosty's head and brings him to life. Professor Hinkle reclaims the hat when it gets blown off and declines that he saw Frosty come to life. Later, Hocus brings the hat back to the children, who bring Frosty back to life again.\n\nFeeling the temperature rising, Frosty fears he will melt unless he can get to the North Pole. The children suggest putting him on a train to get there and they parade through town on the way to the train station, shocking several townspeople. Because they have no money for tickets, Hocus, Frosty and Karen secretly board a northbound freight train's refrigerator car while Professor Hinkle schemes to reclaim the hat.\n\nAs the train continues northward, Frosty notices Karen getting colder. When the train stops to let a passenger train pass, the group disembarks in search of somewhere to warm Karen, with Hinkle following in pursuit. By nightfall, Frosty, Karen and Hocus struggle through the forest where Hocus convinces the forest animals to build a campfire for Karen. Fearing that fire will not be enough, Frosty decides to look for [[Santa Claus]] who they assume can save Karen and bring him to the North Pole. Hocus then goes off in search of Santa and, soon after, Professor Hinkle arrives and Karen and Frosty flee and stumble upon a greenhouse that the latter enters to warm Karen up, only for Professor Hinkle to arrive and lock them both inside.\n\nBy the time Hocus brings Santa to the greenhouse, Frosty has already melted. Santa explains to Karen that Frosty is made of Christmas snow and will return every winter; he opens the door and the winter wind reassembles Frosty. As they are about to put the hat on, Hinkle intervenes, and Santa threatens to never bring him another Christmas present if he reclaims the hat. After Hinkle runs home to write apologies, hoping to get a new hat for Christmas, Santa brings Frosty back to life, drops Karen off at her house, and takes Frosty to the North Pole, promising that he will return every year with the magical Christmas snow.\n\nAs the credits roll, Frosty leads a parade with the children, Hocus, the narrator (Jimmy Durante), and the rest of the town, including Professor Hinkle who is now sporting his new hat. As the parade ends, Frosty boards Santa's sleigh and they fly off to the North Pole with Frosty altering the song's last lyric, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be back on Christmas Day!\u201d\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jackie Vernon (comedian)|Jackie Vernon]] as Frosty\n* [[Jimmy Durante]] as the Narrator\n* [[June Foray]] as Karen, Karen's friends, and Teacher\n* [[Billy De Wolfe]] as Professor Hinkle\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Traffic Cop, Ticket Man, and Santa Claus\n\n==Production credits==\n* Producers/Directors: [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], [[Jules Bass]]\n* Writer: [[Romeo Muller]]\n* Based on \"Frosty the Snowman\" by [[Steve Nelson (songwriter)|Steve Nelson]] and [[Walter E.

It was paired with ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (TV special)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'' on [[LaserDisc]] in 1992. Upon its 1989 and 1993 releases, the special was also bundled in box sets with the other Rankin/Bass Christmas specials including ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus is Comin' to Town]]'', the 1973 [[Chuck Jones]] holiday special, ''A Very Merry Cricket'' and the sequel ''[[Frosty Returns]]'' which aired on [[CBS]] in 1992. In 1998, [[Sony Wonder]] and [[Western Publishing|Golden Books Family Entertainment]] released the special on VHS, and also paired it with these other Rankin/Bass Christmas specials including ''Cricket on the Hearth'' in the separate Holiday Classics Collection box sets.\n\n===DVD and Blu-ray===\nThe special was also released on [[DVD]] by Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment in 2001 and [[Classic Media]] in 2002 and 2004, and by [[Genius Products|Genius Entertainment]] in 2007. [[Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment|Vivendi Entertainment]] re-released it on DVD and for the first time on [[Blu-ray]] on October 12, 2010, and on the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack on November 6, 2012. Most DVD releases also include ''Frosty Returns''. On September 8, 2015, Classic Media re-released both the special and ''Santa Claus is Comin' to Town'' in their 45th Anniversary Collector's Edition on Blu-ray and DVD in addition to the 50th Anniversary release of ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' in 2014. [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] released a Deluxe Edition of the special, along with other specials on Blu-ray and DVD, on October 16, 2018.\n\n==Sequels==\nFrosty returned in several sequels:\n\n* ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]''&nbsp;\u2013 This 1976 sequel by Rankin/Bass was also written by Romeo Muller. Narration is provided by [[Andy Griffith]] (Jimmy Durante retired after a stroke in 1972) and Jackie Vernon reprised the role of Frosty. The animation was produced by [[Topcraft]] in Japan. Unlike the original, the sequel takes place later in the winter season and is based upon the 1934 song \"[[Winter Wonderland]].\" The plot follows Frosty's pursuit of a wife and the town's efforts to preserve him into the springtime. [[Jack Frost]] is introduced as the new antagonist, and no characters besides Frosty and the traffic cop return from the original. As the special takes place in the late winter, it makes no mention of Christmas (the original song likewise did not mention Christmas).\n* ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]]''&nbsp;\u2013 This 1979 Rankin/Bass feature-length sequel was filmed in the \"Animagic\" stop-motion style of ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]''. While the Frosty special is 30 minutes long, and the Rudolph special runs 60 minutes, this film is feature-length, at 97 minutes long (120 minutes on television, including commercials). Jackie Vernon returned as the voice of Frosty for the final time. Jack Frost also makes a brief return from ''Frosty's Winter Wonderland''. Although set during the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], this sequel is the only one to mention Christmas, and Santa Claus plays a major role. This is also the only ''Frosty'' special not to feature a narrator.\n* ''[[Frosty Returns]]''&nbsp;\u2013 This 1992 half-hour special is not truly a sequel to the original since it was produced not by Rankin/Bass but by [[CBS]], and the characters, setting, voices and animation (by [[Bill Melendez]]) have all changed. Frosty's physical appearance, personality, and humor are markedly different, and he has the ability to live without his top hat, in direct contrast with the Rankin/Bass specials. Despite this, it was included as a bonus on previous [[DVD]] releases. [[John Goodman]] provides the voice of Frosty in this special, and [[Jonathan Winters]] serves as narrator. The special avoids all mention of Christmas and has an environmentalist theme, as Frosty works to stop a corporate executive whose spray product wipes out snow.\n* ''[[The Legend of Frosty the Snowman]]''&nbsp;\u2013 This 2005 straight-to-video film was produced by [[Classic Media]], the previous rights holder for the original [[Rankin/Bass]] special, and the remainder of their pre-1974 library. This movie has been bundled with the original 1969 Rankin/Bass special and the CBS sequel and aired on [[Cartoon Network]]. The story features almost entirely new characters and there are some inconsistencies in continuity, but Frosty's appearance closely resembles the Rankin/Bass character design, and Professor Hinkle appears in a flashback cameo role in the comics as the father of Mr. Tinkerton. Frosty is voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]], best known as the voice of [[Patrick Star]] on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', while [[Burt Reynolds]] voices the narrator.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Rankin/Bass Productions films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* ''[https://www.cbs.com/shows/holiday_central/ Holiday Central]'' at CBS.com\n* {{IMDb title|0064349|Frosty the Snowman}}\n\n{{Portal bar|film|United States|Japan|1960s}}\n{{Rankin-Bass}}\n{{Christmas}}\n{{Frosty the Snowman}}\n\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s American television specials]]\n[[Category:1960s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1969 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s supernatural films]]\n[[Category:1969 animated films]]\n[[Category:1969 films]]\n[[Category:1969 in American television]]\n[[Category:1969 television specials]]\n[[Category:American animated television films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s animated television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n[[Category:Christmas television specials]]\n[[Category:Films about magic and magicians]]\n[[Category:Films based on songs]]\n[[Category:Television shows directed by Jules Bass]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Arthur Rankin Jr.]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maury Laws]]\n[[Category:Frosty the Snowman television specials]]\n[[Category:Rankin/Bass Productions television specials]]\n[[Category:Santa Claus in film]]\n[[Category:Santa Claus in television]]\n[[Category:Supernatural comedy films]]\n[[Category:Supernatural fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Television shows written by Romeo Muller]]\n[[Category:American Christmas television specials]]\n[[Category:Animated Christmas television specials]]"}]}}}}
