By 1982, Americans lost much of their faith in their government following the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Watergate scandal]],<ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/68867-atomic-cafe-2496077449.html PopMatters]</ref> and the seemingly never-ending [[arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20686938?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101424275191 McLane Betsy]. \"Film Quarterly\", film review, Spring 1983. Last accessed: November 27, 2012.</ref> ''The Atomic Cafe'' reflects and reinforces this idea as it exposes how the atomic bomb's dangers were downplayed and how the government used films to shape public opinion.\n\n''The Atomic Cafe'' was also released during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s forced [[civil defense]] revival.<ref>[http://www.conelrad.com/jayne_loader.html ''Conelrad: All Things Atomic'']. ''The Atomic Cafe'', Jayne Loader Interview.  Last accessed: November 26, 2012.</ref> Barry Posen and Stephen Van Evera explain this revival in their article \"Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment\" published in ''International Security''. They argue that in 1981\u201382 the Reagan Administration was moving from an essentially defensive grand strategy of containment to a more offensive strategy.  Due to the greater demands of its more offensive strategy \"the Reagan Administration ... proposed the biggest military buildup since the [[Korean War]].\"<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2538484?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101424275191 Posen, R. Barry] \"Defense Policy and the Reagan Administration: Departure from Containment\", Journal article. Last accessed: November 27, 2012.</ref> Of key relevance to ''The Atomic Cafe'', the Reagan move toward offense included the adoption of a more aggressive nuclear strategy that required a large U.S. nuclear buildup.  Containment only required that U.S. strategic nuclear forces be capable of one mission: inflicting unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union even after absorbing an all-out Soviet surprise attack. To this \"assured destruction\" mission the Reagan administration added a second \"counterforce\" mission, which required the capacity to launch a nuclear first strike against Soviet strategic nuclear forces that would leave the Soviets unable to inflict unacceptable damage on the U.S. in retaliation. The U.S. had always invested in counterforce but the Reagan administration put even greater emphasis on it.  The counterforce mission was far more demanding than the assured destruction mission, and required a vast expansion of U.S. nuclear forces to fulfill. Civil defense was a component of a counterforce strategy, as it reduced Soviet retaliatory capacity, hence civil defense was a candidate for more spending under Reagan's counterforce nuclear strategy.  Posen and Van Evera argue that this counterforce strategy was a warrant for an open-ended U.S. nuclear buildup.\n\nBob Mielke, in \"Rhetoric and Ideology in the Nuclear Test Documentary\" (''Film Quarterly'') discusses the release of ''The Atomic Cafe'':  \"This satire feature was released at the height of the nuclear freeze movement (which was in turn responding to the Reagan administration's surreal handling of the arms race.)\"<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1525/fq.2005.58.3.28?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101424275191 Mielke Bob]. \"Film Quarterly\", film review, Spring 2005.
