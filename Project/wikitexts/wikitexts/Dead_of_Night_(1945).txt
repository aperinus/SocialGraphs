The individual segments were directed by [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[Charles Crichton]], [[Basil Dearden]] and [[Robert Hamer]]. It stars [[Mervyn Johns]], [[Googie Withers]], [[Sally Ann Howes]] and [[Michael Redgrave]]. The film is best remembered for the concluding story featuring Redgrave and an insane [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]'s malevolent [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist's dummy|dummy]].\n\n''Dead of Night'' is a rare British horror film of the 1940s; horror films were banned from production in Britain during the war. It had an influence on subsequent British films in the genre. Both of John Baines' stories were reused for later films and the ventriloquist dummy episode was adapted into the pilot episode of the long-running CBS radio series ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]''.\n\nWhile primarily in the horror genre, the film has shades of the comedy that would make the studio's name.\n\n==Plot==\nWalter Craig arrives at a country cottage in [[Kent]], where he is greeted by his host Elliot Foley. Craig is an architect whom Foley has invited to his home to consult on some renovations. Upon entering the sitting room of the cottage, Craig tells Foley and his assembled guests that, despite never having met any of them, he has seen them all in a recurring dream.\n\nCraig appears to have no prior personal knowledge of them, but is able to predict events in the house before they unfold. Craig partially recalls that something awful will later occur. Dr. van Straaten, a psychologist, tries to persuade Craig that his fears are unfounded. The other guests attempt to test Craig's foresight and entertain each other with tales of strange events they experienced or were told about.\n\nRacing car driver Hugh Grainger recalls lying in hospital after an accident. One night, the peripheral noises of the ward cease and the time on his bedside clock changes. He opens the curtains to see that it is daytime, and a horse-drawn hearse is parked outside. The hearse driver calls up, \"just room for one inside, sir\". After being discharged from the hospital, Grainger waits for a bus. The bus conductor, who exactly resembles the hearse driver, tells him, \"just room for one inside, sir\". Grainger does not board the bus. As it drives away, the bus swerves and plunges down an embankment.\n\nSally O'Hara remembers attending a Christmas party at a mansion. During a game of [[hide-and-seek]], Sally hides behind a curtain and is found by Jimmy, who tells her of a murder that once happened in the mansion. She finds a door which leads to a nursery, where she hears a young boy, Francis Kent, weeping. She consoles him and tucks him into bed. When she returns to the main room, she is told Francis Kent was murdered by his sister Constance.\n\nJoan Cortland tells of an incident in which she gave her husband Peter a mirror for his birthday one year. Upon looking into it, he sees himself in a room other than his own. Joan learns that the mirror's previous owner, Francis Etherington, killed his wife on a suspicion of adultery, before slitting his own throat in front of the mirror. Peter, too, accuses Joan of being unfaithful and attempts to strangle her, but she breaks the mirror, returning Peter to his normal mental state.\n\nFoley recounts two golfers, George Parratt and Larry Potter, who both fell in love with a woman named Mary Lee. They decide to play a round of golf for Mary's hand in marriage. Parratt wins by cheating, and Potter drowns himself in a nearby lake. When he next plays golf, Parratt is interrupted by Potter's ghost. Potter demands he give up Mary or else he will continue to haunt him, but finds he has forgotten how to vanish. On the night of Parratt and Mary's wedding, Parratt unwittingly causes {{em|himself}} to vanish, leaving Potter the opportunity to charm Mary.\n\nDr. van Straaten recollects interviewing ventriloquist Maxwell Frere, who performed with a dummy named Hugo. Upon meeting American ventriloquist Sylvester Kee, Hugo continually speaks about abandoning Frere and working with Kee instead. Frere attempts to silence Hugo, but Hugo bites his hand, drawing blood. Some time later at a hotel bar, Hugo insults a woman, and Frere is blamed. Kee brings Frere and Hugo to Frere's hotel room, placing Hugo on Frere's bed. The next morning, Frere accuses Kee of stealing Hugo, and finds Hugo in Kee's room. He shoots Kee and is arrested. Van Straaten arranges for Hugo to be brought to Frere's cell, where they have an argument that ends in Frere suffocating and smashing Hugo. Later, in an asylum, Frere speaks with Hugo's voice.\n\nIn the country home, Craig strangles Dr. van Straaten. Craig then hallucinates about the stories told by the other guests, before awakening in his bedroom as a phone rings. He receives a call from Elliot Foley, inviting him to his country home to consult on some renovations. Craig's wife suggests that spending a weekend in the country might help him get rid of his nightmares. Craig then drives up to Foley's cottage in Kent as in the start of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n===Overarching story at farmhouse===\n(Directed by [[Basil Dearden]])\n*Anthony Baird (credited as Antony Baird) as Hugh Grainger\n*[[Roland Culver]] as Eliot Foley\n*[[Renee Gadd|Ren\u00e9e Gadd]] as Mrs. Craig\n*[[Sally Ann Howes]] as Sally O'Hara the teenager\n*[[Mervyn Johns]] as Walter Craig\n*[[Judy Kelly]] as Joyce Grainger\n*Barbara Leake as Mrs. O'Hara\n*[[Mary Merrall]] as Mrs. Foley\n*[[Frederick Valk]] as Dr. van Straaten\n*[[Googie Withers]] as Joan Cortland\n\n===The Hearse Driver===\n(Directed by [[Basil Dearden]]; based on \"The Bus-Conductor\" by [[E.
