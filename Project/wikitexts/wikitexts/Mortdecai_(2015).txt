The film is adapted from the novel series ''[[Mortdecai]]'' (specifically its 1972 first installment ''Don't Point that Thing at Me'') written by [[Kyril Bonfiglioli]]. It stars [[Johnny Depp]] in the title role and also features [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Olivia Munn]], [[Paul Bettany]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]]. Released by [[Lionsgate]] on January 23, 2015, ''Mortdecai'' was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $47 million against its estimated $60 million budget, and was critically panned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/25/mortdecai-box-office-flop_n_6542100.html |title='Mortdecai' Is One Of Johnny Depp's Worst Flops Ever |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-01-25 |access-date=2015-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stephanie Garcia |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mortdecai-becomes-johnny-depps-fifth-consecutive-box-office-bomb-10003543.html |title=Mortdecai becomes Johnny Depp's fifth consecutive movie to flop at the box office - News - Films |work=The Independent |date=2015-01-26 |access-date=2015-06-12 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nLord Charlie Mortdecai, an 'art dealer' and swindler, is accosted in Hong Kong by one of his victims, a gangster named Fang. Jock, Mortdecai's faithful manservant, extricates his master before they can be killed.\n\nReturning to London, Mortdecai and his wife, Johanna, consider ways to pay off their crushing tax debt. At the same time in Oxford, a painting by [[Francisco Goya]] becomes the target of an elaborate theft, resulting in the murder of an art restorer. Inspector Alistair Martland is put on the case. He, in love with Johanna since college, puts pressure on Mortdecai to assist him. Martland believes the prime suspect to be Emil Strago. Mortdecai agrees to help in exchange for 10% of the insurance money.\n\nMortdecai interviews people affiliated with the art world, including Spinoza, an art smuggler. While they argue, Strago arrives and shoots at them, killing Spinoza; Mortdecai escapes unharmed, although he accidentally shoots Jock in the process. Johanna meets with 'The Duke', who knows the thief and says that the painting conceals the location of a hoard of Nazi gold. Mortdecai is kidnapped by thugs working for a Russian named Romanov because they think that Mortdecai has the painting. Romanov threatens torture unless Mortdecai surrenders it, but he escapes through a window with Jock.\n\nMartland sends Mortdecai to America to meet with potential Goya buyer Milton Krampf. Planning to sell his beloved [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] to the American, he tries to see if Krampf is involved with the theft. After Mortdecai arrives in Los Angeles, Krampf shows him that the Goya was smuggled into the US in the Rolls after it had been stolen from Strago and stashed there.\n\nKrampf invites Mortdecai to the party, where he will show the Goya. Jock and Mortdecai try to steal it during the party, as do Krampf's daughter Georgina and Strago. She attempts to seduce Mortdecai while Strago steals the painting. Johanna arrives with Martland and catches her husband with Georgina. Mortdecai flees to help Jock steal the painting, but finds Krampf has been murdered by Strago and the painting is gone. Strago is caught, but Georgina helps him escape with the painting. Mortdecai, Jock, Martland and Johanna find them in a motel where Martland sets fire to the Goya, causing the building to explode. It is revealed that the painting was a fake; The Duke has hidden the real one.\n\nThe Mortdecais retrieve the painting, putting it up for auction. The sale attracts Fang and Romanov, whose thugs Mortdecai and Jock waylay. In the auction room, Strago attempts to kidnap Johanna while Mortdecai bids up the 'Goya'. Sir Graham eventually wins it for Romanov and Martland apprehends Strago during the commotion. Sale proceeds pay off their debt, but they are still broke.\n\nThe painting is revealed to be another fake, and Romanov plots his revenge whilst his thugs begin to torture Sir Graham.\n\nIn the closing scene, the Mortdecais share a bubble bath while admiring the real Goya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Charlie Mortdecai\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Inspector Alistair Martland\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Johanna Mortdecai\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Jock Strapp\n* [[Jonny Pasvolsky]] as Emil Strago\n* [[Olivia Munn]] as Georgina Krampf<ref>{{cite web | title=Watch Johnny Depp In 'Mortdecai' Movie Trailer [VIDEO] Gwyneth Paltrow, Olivia Munn, Ewan McGregor Costar In New Comedy | work= Mstarz.com | url=http://www.mstarz.com/articles/41703/20141111/watch-johnny-depp-mortecai-movie-trailer-video.htm |access-date=November 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Milton Krampf\n* [[Michael Culkin]] as Sir Graham\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as Romanov\n* [[Alec Utgoff]] as Dmitri\n* [[Paul Whitehouse]] as Spinoza\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as the Duke\n* Austin Lyon as Hotel Clerk\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as Auctioneer\n* [[Junix Inocian]] as Fang Fat\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Principal photography]] and production began in [[London]] on October 21, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Principal Photography Begins for Mortdecai, Starring Johnny Depp|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=110465|access-date=October 23, 2013|newspaper=comingsoon.net|date=October 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mortdecai Starring Johnny Depp Begins Production in London|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/mortdecai-starring-johnny-depp-begins-production-in-london|access-date=October 23, 2013|newspaper=movieweb.com|date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nParts of the film were shot on location at [[Hedsor House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] in the UK,<ref name=\"Hedsor House\">{{cite web | title = Hedsor House used in the film Mortdecai (2015) | publisher = Hedsor House | year = 2015 | url = http://www.hedsor.com/news/johnny-depp-stars-in-mortdecai/ | access-date = January 20, 2015 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150121173845/http://www.hedsor.com/news/johnny-depp-stars-in-mortdecai/ | archive-date = January 21, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> where Depp, Munn, and Bettany filmed scenes in Hedsor House's Boudoir and Bridal Suites.\n\nScenes were also shot on location at the [[National Art Library]] in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.<ref name=\"National Art Library\">{{cite web | title = I'm sure I've seen that Library before (2014) | publisher = Victoria and Albert Museum | year = 2014 | url = http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/national-art-library/im-sure-ive-seen-that-library-before | access-date = January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Goya painting is a [[pastiche]] or modern version of the 1805 ''[[Portrait of the Marchioness of Santa Cruz]]'' (Madrid, [[Prado Museum]]).\n\n== Release ==\nOn April 23, 2014, [[Lionsgate]] announced that the film would be released on February 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lesnick |first=Silas |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=117447 |title=Lionsgate Sets Mortdecai, Starring Johnny Depp, for February 6, 2015 |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=April 23, 2014 |access-date=January 23, 2015}}</ref> On September 24, 2014, the release date was shifted to January 23, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|title=Johnny Depp Comedy 'Mortdecai' Shifts to January 2015 Release Date|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/johnny-depp-comedy-mortdecai-shifts-to-january-2015-release-date-1201313324/|access-date=September 25, 2014|publisher=variety.com|date=September 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing and promotion ===\nA photo from the film featuring Depp was revealed on May 8, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=DAVIS|first=EDWARD|title=First Look: Johnny Depp Gets Mustachioed & Debonair In Spy Thriller Comedy 'Mortdecai'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/first-look-johnny-depp-gets-mustachioed-debonair-in-spy-thriller-comedy-mortdecai-20140508|access-date=May 9, 2014|newspaper=indiewire.com|date=May 8, 2014}}</ref> Four character posters - featuring Depp, Paltrow, McGregor, and Munn with mustaches - were released in November 2014.
