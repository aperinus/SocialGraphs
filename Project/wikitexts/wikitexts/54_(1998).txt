Shane longs for a more glamorous life across the river in New York's [[Manhattan]], so one night he talks his two friends into going to Studio 54, a disco nightclub. Once inside, Shane is exposed to the flashy, [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] world of 54, with unbridled alcohol, drugs, and open sex. Against his father\u2019s wishes, Shane returns to 54 the next night and is hired by Steve as a [[Busser|busboy]]. Shane eventually moves out of his family's house in Jersey City after fighting with his father over his new job, and moves in with Greg and Anita in Manhattan.\n\nAfter a short time bussing tables, Shane gets promoted to bartender with the help of a club regular Billie Auster, a customer who has a [[one-night stand]] with Shane. Shane's promotion causes tension with Greg as Greg feels that he didn't get the job because he wouldn't let Steve perform [[oral sex]] on him. Shane gains status and does an interview article/[[beefcake]] photo shoot for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview Magazine]]'', uses drugs, and sleeps with multiple women as he makes a name for himself. After a while, Shane begins to feel as if people only want him for sex.\n\nShane\u2019s fame also affects his relationships with his friends and family. Greg, who now deals drugs on the side for extra money, criticizes Shane for his conceited attitude on Christmas Eve and accuses him of trying to sleep with Anita after catching him making a pass at her once before at their apartment. Shane\u2019s father Harlan, whom he hasn\u2019t seen or spoken to since he moved to New York City, rejects him when he comes home to visit on Christmas Day after a female family friend who got into 54 one night informs Harlan that she saw Shane doing drugs there. However, Shane does experience some brief happiness during the holidays when he strikes up a short-lived romance with his celebrity crush (and fellow New Jerseyan) Julie Black, a soap opera starlet determined to succeed in the film industry.\n\nShane discovers Julie with Roland Sachs, an agent that she plans to sleep with, causing Shane to reject her. In his anger, Shane gets into a fight with Steve. Steve fires Shane and has him thrown out of the club. Simultaneously, the FBI raids 54 and arrests Steve, as he\u2019s been skimming money from the club\u2019s nightly take. As Shane leaves 54 in disgrace, Julie passes by him, and they part ways but agree to remain friends.\n\nAn epilogue reveals the fates of the main characters. Julie moves to Hollywood and gets a small part in a movie. Anita records a moderately successful album with [[Casablanca Records]] and Greg gets a job in construction after six months' probation for dealing drugs at 54. Shane works nights as a restaurant manager in [[Greenwich Village]] and takes business classes at [[New York University|NYU]] during the day. Steve is convicted and sentenced to 18 months in jail, causing 54 to close as a result; upon release, he is forced to sell 54 but remains as a consultant under the new management. Greg and Anita reunite at the newly reopened 54, where Steve is hosting a one-night welcome-back party for all of his old friends and employees after his release from prison. Ultimately, 54 closes permanently in 1986, and Steve dies of AIDS in 1989 at age 45.\n\n===Director's cut additions===\nThe director's cut opens with a new narration of the movie's original opening as Shane is seen leaving 54 after being thrown out on New Year\u2019s Eve. Shane\u2019s narration from the theatrical version is eliminated.\n\nShane is openly [[bisexual]]. In a moment of confusion, he kisses Greg in the VIP room on Christmas Eve. Shane then has sex with Anita in the ladies\u2019 room after she and Greg have a fight. Anita sees Steve watching them. She hits Shane in the stomach and runs out of the ladies' room in shame.\n\nWhen Shane runs low on cash due to his numerous debts, Greg lets him in on his drug-dealing operation. Shane steals some of Steve's skimmed cash as capital and repays it on New Year's Eve.\n\nGreg eventually agrees to let Steve perform oral sex on him for the bartender job, but Steve says he'd rather watch Greg and Anita have sex instead, as he did on Christmas Eve. Greg goes to the cloakroom to confront Anita and sees her hugging Shane. Greg gets into a fistfight with Shane. Shane [[Free base|freebases]] cocaine to ease his emotional pain.\n\nAfter Greg and Anita reconcile following her interrupted debut performance, Anita leaves with Billie for a [[photo op]]. Shane discovers [[G-man|G-men]] raiding Steve\u2019s office and runs back upstairs to warn Greg, but Greg ignores him.\u00a0Greg then runs to get his things from his locker when he sees Shane being thrown out of the club, but discovers that a G-man has already beat him to it and has found his drugs.\n\nAfter Shane is thrown out of 54, he sees Greg running up behind him. Shane offers him his garbage bag cloak, and Greg begrudgingly accepts. Anita runs to them in a fancy fur coat and cloaks Greg in it with her as they both depart. Greg calls for Shane to come along with them, just as Julie pulls up alongside in her limousine and offers Shane a ride. Shane declines and leaves with Greg and Anita, the three of them staying together as a family instead of drifting apart.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Shane O'Shea\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Anita Randazzo\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Julie Black\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Steve Rubell]]\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Billie Auster\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Greg Randazzo\n* [[Sherry Stringfield]] as Viv\n* [[Cameron Mathison]] as Atlanta\n* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Grace O'Shea\n* [[Skipp Sudduth]] as Harlan O'Shea\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Key\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Ricko\n* [[Lauren Hutton]] as Liz Vangelder\n* [[Michael York]] as Ambassador\n* [[Ellen Albertini Dow]] as Disco Dottie (Mona)\n* [[Erika Alexander]] as Ciel\n* [[Kohl Sudduth]] as Rhett\n* [[Lorri Bagley]] as Patti\n* [[Barbara Radecki]] as TV Host\n* [[Ron Jeremy]] as Ron\n* [[Bruce MacVittie]] as Music Producer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBased on two [[short film]]s [[Mark Christopher (director)|Mark Christopher]] made, [[Miramax Films]] persuaded Christopher to direct the full-length feature about Studio 54. He had spent five years researching the club and the time period while working on a screenplay. Miramax purchased a partial screenplay in 1995 and developed the script with the filmmaker for over a year.{{sfn|Biskind|2004|pp=293-294, 322}}\n\nChristopher shot the film in [[Toronto]] over two months in the fall of 1997.{{sfn|Biskind|2004|p=320}} However, studio head [[Harvey Weinstein]] and Christopher differed on their respective visions of the film. Christopher intended for the film to capture Studio 54\u2019s notoriety as \u201cthe epicenter of the gay cultural explosion in New York City,\u201d and wanted the story to be told from the perspective of \u201cShane, a kid from New Jersey who sleeps his way to the top of the 54 pecking order, which means that he becomes one of the shirtless bartenders for which the club was notorious, golden boys who flexed and preened for the clientele of both sexes, occasionally deigning to grant sexual favors in return for money and drugs\u201d.{{sfn|Biskind|2004|p=293}} Conversely, Weinstein wanted a more commercial film in the vein of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', with its gay storyline removed.{{sfn|Biskind|2004|pp=322-323}}\n\nWeinstein screen tested Christopher\u2019s cut of the film on [[Long Island]] in early 1998. Audiences at this screening reacted negatively to the lead character's bisexuality, particularly to a scene where Shane and Greg kiss as well as the happy ending for both characters and Anita.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ascher-Walsh|first=Rebecca|date=4 September 1998|title=The 411 On '54'|language=|magazine=[[Entertainment
