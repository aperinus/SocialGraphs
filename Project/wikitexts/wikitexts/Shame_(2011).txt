He has frequent sex with prostitutes, views [[Pornography|porn]], and masturbates several times daily. One day, Brandon makes eye contact with a woman wearing an engagement ring on the subway during his morning commute. She initially reciprocates but becomes uncomfortable. When they exit, she disappears into the crowd. Brandon and his married boss, David, hit on women at a club. Later, Brandon has sex in a back alley with the woman David was pursuing at the club.\n\nBrandon has been ignoring calls from his sister, Sissy, a lounge singer. He arrives at his apartment and is startled to find her in his shower, thinking it may have been a burglar. Sissy has a few gigs in the city and asks to stay; he later hears her pleading on the telephone with her lover not to reject her.\n\nBrandon and David watch Sissy perform \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in a bar, which makes Brandon emotional. David flirts with her and notices the scars of self-inflicted wounds on her arms. Sissy has sex with David in her brother's bedroom. Later that night, Sissy attempts to get in bed with Brandon; he orders her out of the room.\n\nAfter Brandon's company computer system is infected with a [[computer virus]], they find that his [[hard drive]] is full of pornography. David assumes Brandon's intern is responsible.\n\nBrandon goes on a date with co-worker Marianne, who is recently separated and believes in commitment, while Brandon dislikes the idea of marriage and admits that his relationships never last longer than four months. When they reach the subway, they go home separately.\n\nThat night, Sissy discovers Brandon masturbating in his bathroom. He attacks her and accuses her of spying on him. She finds his laptop open on a pornographic webcam site; Brandon slams it shut, and a disturbed Sissy leaves. Brandon disposes of his pornography, sex toys, and laptop. In the office, he kisses Marianne and the two get a [[The Standard, High Line|hotel room]], but Brandon cannot get an erection. Marianne leaves; later, Brandon has aggressive sex with a prostitute in the same room.\n\nBrandon tells Sissy that David has a family and asks her to leave. She says that, as family, they should help each other, but Brandon calls her irresponsible and a burden. Brandon goes to a bar and propositions a woman, describing explicitly what he would do to her. She is close to succumbing when her boyfriend intervenes. Brandon laughs in his face. After he leaves, the boyfriend follows and brutally beats him. When he is barred from another club, he goes to a nearby gay bar and is fellated by a man. After leaving, he listens to a voicemail from Sissy, crying as she says that they are not bad people but just come from a bad place. Brandon has a threesome with prostitutes.\n\nWhile Brandon is riding the subway home, the passengers are asked to disembark due to a police emergency, implicitly a suicide. He frantically calls Sissy, but she does not answer. Arriving home, he finds Sissy on the bathroom floor covered in blood, having slashed her wrists. He attempts to stop the bleeding while phoning for help. She survives and he comforts her in hospital. After leaving, he walks until he collapses, sobbing, in the rain.\n\nBack on the subway, Brandon sees the woman with the engagement ring again. He makes eye contact with her. She stands up, ready to exit the train at an approaching station. Brandon does not take his eyes off her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Brandon Sullivan\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Sissy Sullivan\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as David\n* [[Nicole Beharie]] as Marianne\n* Alex Manette as Steven\n* Lucy Walters as The Subway Lady\n* Elizabeth Masucci as Elizabeth\n* [[Amy Hargreaves]] as Hotel Lover\n* [[Hannah Ware]] as Samantha\n* [[Robert Montano]] as Waiter\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\nMcQueen worked with producer [[Iain Canning]] on the 2008 film ''[[Hunger (2008 film)|Hunger]]'' and they reunited to develop ''Shame'' with Canning and [[Emile Sherman]]'s UK/Australia-based [[See-Saw Films]].
