It features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robert De Niro]], with [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Val Kilmer]] in supporting roles.<ref name=var/> The film follows the conflict between an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective, played by Pacino, and a career thief, played by De Niro, while also depicting its effect on their professional relationships and personal lives.\n\nMann wrote the original script for ''Heat'' in 1979, basing it on [[Chicago]] police officer [[Chuck Adamson]]'s pursuit of criminal Neil McCauley, after whom De Niro's character is named.<ref>{{cite news | author=George M. Thomas | title=He's a Goofy Goober; 'Heat' | newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal | date=February 27, 2005}}</ref> The script was first used for a television pilot developed by Mann, which became the 1989 television film ''[[L.A. Takedown]]'' after the pilot did not receive a series order. In 1994, Mann revisited the script to turn it into a feature film, co-producing the project with [[Art Linson]]. The film marks De Niro and Pacino's first on-screen appearance together following a period of acclaimed performances from both. Due to their esteemed reputations, promotion centered on their involvement.\n\n''Heat'' was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on December 15, 1995, to critical and commercial success. It grossed $187 million on a $60 million budget, while receiving praise for Mann's direction and screenplay, action sequences, sound mixing, and the performances of Pacino and De Niro. Although it did not receive any major award nominations, ''Heat'' is regarded as one of the most influential films of its genre and has inspired several other works. A planned sequel was announced in July 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leston |first=Ryan |date=2022-07-20 |title=Michael Mann\u2019s Heat 2 'Already Underway' |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/michael-manns-heat-2-already-underway |access-date=2022-08-04 |website=IGN |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- [[WP:FILMPLOT]]  400-700 words. -->\nNeil McCauley is a professional thief based in [[Los Angeles]]. He and his crew \u2013 Chris Shiherlis, Michael Cheritto, Trejo, and newly hired hand Waingro \u2013 rob $1.6 million in [[bearer bonds]] from an armored car. During the heist, Waingro kills a guard without provocation. McCauley kills a second guard who attempts to pull out his [[Pocket pistol|concealed weapon]], and Cheritto kills the third guard so as to not leave any witnesses. Later, McCauley prepares to kill Waingro, but Waingro escapes.\n\n[[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and his team investigate the robbery. Hanna, a dedicated lawman and [[United States Marine Corps|former Marine]], has a strained relationship with his third wife Justine, and struggles to connect with his stepdaughter, Lauren. McCauley follows a code: \"allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner\". While at a bar, McCauley meets Eady, a young graphic designer with whom he begins a relationship.\n\nMcCauley's [[fence (criminal)|fence]], Nate, suggests he sell the stolen bonds back to their original owner, [[money laundering|money launderer]] Roger Van Zant. Van Zant agrees, but instead arranges an ambush. Anticipating a trap, McCauley and his crew counter-ambush, kill the hitmen, and vow to kill Van Zant. Waingro murders a [[prostitute]]; Hanna's team investigate, discovering evidence that leads them to the murder of other prostitutes, victims of a [[serial killer]]. An [[informant]] of the LAPD connects Cheritto to the robbery, and Hanna's team begin monitoring him, leading them to the rest of the crew and their next target, a precious metals depository. Hanna's team stakes out the depository, but when a careless officer makes a noise, McCauley has his crew walk off the job.\n\nMcCauley's crew agree to one last bank robbery worth $12.2 million. Hanna tracks McCauley and pulls him over on the [[Interstate 105 (California)|105 Freeway]], inviting him to coffee. They discuss their dedication to their respective jobs and the limitations of their personal lives; Hanna describes his failing marriage and McCauley confides that he is similarly isolated. Though they admit their respect for one another, both acknowledge that they will kill the other if necessary. Waingro makes a deal with Van Zant to help eliminate McCauley's crew. Trejo quits the bank robbery at the last moment, claiming the LAPD is following him too closely. McCauley recruits an old colleague, Don Breedan, to take Trejo's place as the getaway driver, and the crew carries out the heist.\n\nActing on a tip from Van Zant's bodyguard, the LAPD intercepts the crew as they leave the bank, resulting in a massive shootout where Breedan and several officers are killed. McCauley manages to escape with a wounded Shiherlis. Cheritto attempts to flee, but is shot dead by Hanna. After leaving Shiherlis with Nate, McCauley arrives at Trejo's house to find him mortally wounded and his wife killed. Trejo reveals Waingro and Van Zant's involvement before asking McCauley to kill him. McCauley breaks into Van Zant's mansion and shoots him dead. Upon learning of McCauley's connection to Waingro and discovering that Waingro is hiding at a hotel, Hanna's unit decides to use him as bait to lure McCauley. As McCauley prepares to flee the country, Eady discovers his criminal identity, but agrees to go with him. Before escaping, Shiherlis attempts to reconcile with his wife Charlene, who has been forced by the LAPD to bring in her husband. He encounters her at her hotel, she warns him away with a hand gesture, and he escapes.\n\nHaving separated from Justine, Hanna finds Lauren has attempted suicide in his own hotel room and rushes her to the hospital; he reconciles with Justine after they learn that Lauren has survived. McCauley drives to the airport with Eady, but he learns Waingro's location and abandons his usual caution to seek revenge. McCauley infiltrates the hotel, pulls the fire alarm, bursts into Waingro's room and kills him. As McCauley returns to Eady, he is spotted by Hanna. McCauley abandons Eady, fleeing onto the tarmac at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], pursued by Hanna. The two stalk each other, and Hanna shoots McCauley in the chest. Hanna takes McCauley's hand as McCauley dies of his wounds.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- All 19 cast from tombstone opening credits, roles and order per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Neil McCauley\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Chris Shiherlis\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Nate\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Michael Cheritto\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Justine Hanna\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Eady\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Charlene Shiherlis\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Sergeant Bobby Drucker\n* [[Wes Studi]] as Lieutenant Sammy Casals\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Detective Mike Bosko\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Don Breedan\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Roger Van Zant\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Lauren Gustafson\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as Kelso\n* [[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]] as Waingro\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Alan Marciano\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Trejo\n* [[Susan Traylor]] as Elaine Cheritto\n* Kim Staunton as Lillian\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as Hugh Benny\n* [[Jerry Trimble]] as Detective Danny Schwartz\n* [[Tone Loc]] as Richard Torena\n* [[Ricky Harris]] as Albert Torena\n* [[Ray Buktenica]] as Timmons\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Dr. Bob\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Ralph\n}}\n\nAdditional cast members include [[Martin Ferrero]] as a construction clerk and [[Hazelle Goodman]] as the mother of a prostitute murdered by Waingro.
