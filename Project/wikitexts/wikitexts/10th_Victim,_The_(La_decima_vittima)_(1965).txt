An [[international co-production]] between Italy and France, it is based on [[Robert Sheckley]]'s 1953 short story \"[[Seventh Victim]]\".\n\nTaking place in the year 2079 in the aftermath of [[World War III]], the film's focus is on a government-endorsed program known as \"The Big Hunt\", whereby contestants from around the world act as \"hunters\" and \"victims\" in two-person battles to the death as a means of avoiding mass warfare. The plot follows veteran Big Hunt contestants Caroline Meredith (Andress) and Marcello Poletti (Mastroianni), who are respectively assigned the roles of hunter and victim for one such confrontation, which is complicated by their budding romance. Like Petri's other films, ''The 10th Victim'' is a work of socio-political satire, while also combining science fiction themes with conventions of the ''[[commedia all'italiana]]'' genre.{{sfn|Curti|2021|pp=77\u2013102}}\n\nAn avid reader of science fiction, Petri began work on an adaptation of Sheckley's story in 1961; producer [[Carlo Ponti]] came onboard the project due to the involvement of Mastroianni. A variety of screenwriters worked on the script to varying degrees without receiving an onscreen credit, including [[Suso Cecchi D'Amico]], [[Nate Monaster]] and [[Ernesto Gastaldi]]. Ponti's lack of interest in the science fiction genre led to his mandating of more comedic elements in the story against Petri's wishes, including altering its original, pessimistic ending. Backed by financial support from [[Joseph E. Levine]]'s [[Embassy Pictures]], filming took place primarily on location in [[Rome]] and New York City from June to September 1964; produced at the height of the [[pop art]] movement in Italy, Petri sought to create a vision of the future that juxtaposes that style's imagery with Rome's ancient and modern architectural structures, such as the [[Colosseum]] and the [[EUR, Rome|EUR district]].{{sfn|Curti|2021|pp=77\u2013102}}\n\nUpon release, ''The 10th Victim'' performed below Ponti's expectations in Italy and received mixed reviews from critics.{{sfn|Curti|2021|pp=77\u2013102}} In the decades since its initial release, the film has garnered a [[cult following]], and its imagery has been referenced or parodied in other films, notably the ''[[Austin Powers (series)|Austin Powers]]'' franchise; it is also considered to be a forerunner to works depicting televised fights to the death, such as ''[[The Hunger Games]]''. A [[novelization]] of the film, written by Sheckley, was published in 1966,<ref>{{cite web | author=Di Filippo, Paul | title=The 10th Victim | work=[[Science Fiction Weekly]] | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/classic/sfw9935.html | access-date=2007-01-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071115042707/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/classic/sfw9935.html | archive-date = November 15, 2007}}</ref> this was followed by two sequels, ''[[Victim Prime]]'' and ''Hunter/Victim'' in 1987 and 1988, respectively.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Playing the Universe: Games and Gaming in Science Fiction | first1=Pawe\u0142 | last1=Frelik | first2=David G. | last2=Mead | year=2007 | publisher=[[Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University]] Press | page=134 | isbn=978-83-227-2656-3}}</ref> Although several attempts to produce a remake of ''The 10th Victim'' have been announced, none have entered production.<ref name=Remake1>{{cite web | title=Morgan Creek tackles Tenth Victim | work=[[ScreenDaily]] |first=Mike  |last=Goodridge | url=https://www.screendaily.com/morgan-creek-tackles-tenth-victim/4018542.article |date= May 13, 2004|access-date=July 19, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 21st century, [[World War III]] has recently ended. To prevent a fourth war, individuals with violent tendencies get a chance to kill in \"The Big Hunt\", the most popular form of entertainment in the world, which also attracts participants who are looking for fame and fortune. It includes ten rounds for each competitor, five as the hunters and five as the victims. The survivor of ten rounds becomes extremely wealthy and retires.\n\nCaroline Meredith is a huntress who has just killed her ninth victim and is looking for a tenth. To maximize financial gain, Meredith wants to get a perfect kill in front of the cameras as she has negotiated a major [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] from the Ming Tea Company. Marcello Poletti is assigned as the victim; his winnings from six kills have already been spent by his mistress, Olga, and his ex-wife, Lidia.\n\nCaroline goes to Rome and impersonates a reporter whose assignment is to study the sexual preoccupations of Italian men. She requests an interview with Marcello at the [[Temple of Venus and Roma|Temple of Venus]]. Suspicious, Marcello arranges for Caroline to be eaten by a crocodile before the cameras of a competing television company, but she escapes. Caroline lures Marcello to the beach and convinces him that she is in love with him. She drugs Marcello and hauls him back to the Temple of Venus.\n\nCaroline shoots Marcello in front of the television cameras, but Marcello survives because he has loaded the gun with blanks. He then shoots her but she is saved by her bulletproof armor plate. Marcello and Caroline decide to escape from the Big Hunt and go on a plane, where they decide to get married. The movie ends with the pilot shooting flowers to the two.\n\n==Differences from the original story==\nThe original short story was written from the point of view of a man hunting his seventh target, a woman, whereas in the movie she is the hunter.  He finds her apparently defenceless sitting in a caf\u00e9.  Talking to her, she tells him how she is new to the game but could not bear to kill her own target, and now expects to die.  The hunter falls in love with his victim, as in the movie, and eventually reveals who he is.  She has tricked him; she shoots him, joining the ranks of the \"Tens\".\n\nThe story was adapted for radio on ''[[X Minus One]]'' in 1957.<ref>{{cite news|id={{ProQuest|114061707}}|title=ON RADIO|date=March 6, 1957|work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Elsa Martinelli in La decima vittima.jpg|thumb|244px|[[Elsa Martinelli]] as Olga.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Marcello Polletti\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as Caroline Meredith\n* [[Elsa Martinelli]] as Olga\n* [[Salvo Randone]] as Professor\n* [[Massimo Serato]] as Lawyer Rossi\n* [[Milo Quesada]] as Rudi\n* Luce Bonifassy as Lidia Poletti\n* [[George Wang (actor)|George Wang]] as Chinese Hunter\n* Evi Rigano as Victim\n* Walter Williams as Martin\n* Richard Armstrong as Cole\n* [[Anita Sanders]] as Relaxatorium Hostess\n* [[Mickey Knox (actor)|Mickey Knox]] as Chet\n* [[Jacques Herlin]] as Masoch Club Owner\n* Wolfgang Hillinger as Baron Von Aschenberg\n{{div col end}}\n{{small|'''Source:'''}}<ref name=Archivio />\n\n==Release==\n''The 10th Victim'' was released in Italy on December 3, 1965.{{sfn|Curti|2021|p=98}} The film grossed a little over 620 million ''[[Italian lira|lire]]'' in Italy upon its theatrical release.{{sfn|Curti|2021|p=99}} The film was distributed abroad, including in the United States and Canada by [[Embassy Pictures]] in late December 1965.{{sfn|Curti|2021|p=99}}<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite news|author=Bosley Crowther|title=Screen: Mastroianni vs. Miss Andress:Futuristic '10th Victim' Opens at 2 Theaters|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04EFDE1739E33ABC4951DFB467838E679EDE|url-status=dead|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530125833/https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04EFDE1739E33ABC4951DFB467838E679EDE|archive-date=2004-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 80% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.35/10.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web | title=The 10th Victim (La Decima vittima) (The Tenth Victim)  | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_10th_victim/ |access-date=August 1, 2019 }}</ref> In contemporary reviews, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' praised the visuals of the film, but stated that \"the film is never quite as much fun as it should be, possibly because of rather ponderous dubbing and possibly because imaginative camera angles cannot totally make up for lapses in narrative.\"<ref name=\"mfb-review\" /> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted a \"wildly imaginative plot\" but declared the film overall to be \"a clever but patently self-conscious exercise ...
