The film also co-stars [[Marsha Mason]], [[Everett McGill]], and [[Mario Van Peebles]], and was released in the United States on December 5, 1986. The story centers on a U.S. Marine nearing retirement who gets a platoon of undisciplined Marines into shape and leads them during the American [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983.\n\nThe title comes from the [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge]] in the [[Korean War]], where Eastwood's character had earned the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1983, [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Thomas Highway finagles a transfer back to his old unit, [[2nd Reconnaissance Battalion]], [[2nd Marine Division|Second Marine Division]]. En route, he meets fellow passenger and aspiring rock musician Corporal \"Stitch\" Jones, who borrows money from Highway for a meal at a rest stop and then steals his bus ticket, leaving him stranded.\n\nWhen Highway finally arrives, his new commanding officer, Major Malcolm Powers, seeing him as old-fashioned, assigns him to the Reconnaissance Platoon, part of his assault battalion, which includes Jones. As the men's previous platoon sergeant, awaiting his retirement, had permitted their inactivity, Highway quickly puts the men on a rigorous training program. Their desperate plan to intimidate him with resident [[Bodybuilding|body builder]] \"Swede\" Johanson, just released from the [[Military prison|brig]], fails after Highway overpowers Swede. They begin to shape up and develop ''[[esprit de corps]]''.\n\nHighway repeatedly clashes with Powers and First Platoon Staff Sergeant Webster over his unorthodox training methods (such as firing an [[AK-47]] over his men's heads to familiarize them with the weapon's distinctive sound). Seeing Highway's platoon as simply a training tool for a supposedly elite First Platoon, Powers proceeds to arrange for First Platoon to beat Highway's men in every field exercise. However, Highway's old comrade-in-arms, [[Sergeant Major]] Choozhoo, and his nominal superior officer, the college-educated but inexperienced First Lieutenant Ring, support him. After learning of his Medal of Honor award during the Korean War, Highway's men gain respect for him and close ranks against their perceived common enemy.\n\nHighway attempts adapting his mindset to romance his ex-wife Aggie, a barmaid at a local beer joint who is dating the establishment's owner Roy, even reading women's magazines to understand the female mind. Initially resenting their failed marriage, Aggie tentatively reconciles with Highway. The [[22nd Marine Amphibious Unit]] is then deployed for the [[invasion of Grenada]].\n\nAfter a last-minute briefing on the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2}}, Highway's platoon mounts their [[UH-1 Huey]], and are dropped by [[helocast]] into the water before the rest of Powers' [[Battalion Landing Team]]. While advancing inland, they come under heavy enemy fire. Highway improvises, ordering Jones to provide cover using a bulldozer so they can advance and destroy an enemy machine gun nest. Their celebration after subsequently rescuing American students from a medical school is short-lived, as Choozhoo discovers that [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Cubans]] are manning a key enemy position that will have to be taken to prevent further incidents. Powers, not wanting Highway to outdo him, orders the recon platoon to advance on the position, but not to attempt any engagement or take the position until First Platoon arrives.\n\nRing and Highway advance on the position, but come under heavy fire from 2 armored cars and infantry. The platoon hides inside an abandoned building, but when the Cubans attack, Profile is killed and his radio destroyed, impeding direct communication. Ring proposes making a long-distance call to [[Camp Lejeune]] for air support and sends Jones to repair the phone line before borrowing a credit card to complete the call, but enemy fire severs the line as he completes calling in the coordinates for an air-strike. Unsure if the call went through, Highway goes to put out a marker for the air support to locate the position but is fired upon and knocked unconscious. Assuming Highway is dead, the platoon exits the building to engage the Cubans, but then the air support arrives and repels the enemy. Ring and a revived Highway then disregard Powers' order, advance upon and take the position, and capture and detain the Cuban soldiers.\n\nMajor Powers arrives with Webster, reprimands Ring and threatens Highway with a [[court-martial]]. However, the commanding officer of the regiment to which Powers' battalion belongs, Colonel Meyers (a combat veteran who had served in the same battalion as Highway in the [[Vietnam War]]), arrives by helicopter and after listening to Powers' and Highway's reports, commends Highway and punishes Powers with transfer back to his former support unit for discouraging the Recon Marines' aggressive fighting spirit.\n\nHighway and his men are warmly received upon returning to the States. Jones informs Highway that he is going to re-enlist and make a career in the Corps, while Highway confides to Jones he is taking mandatory retirement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Tom Highway\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Aggie Highway\n* [[Everett McGill]] as [[Major]] Malcolm A.

Eastwood was interested in the script and asked his producer, Fritz Manes, to contact the US Army with a view of filming the movie at [[Fort Bragg]].<ref>Suid, Laurence M. (June 14, 2002). ''Guts and Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film''. pp. 558\u2013559. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9018-1}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Army read the script and refused to participate, due to Highway being portrayed as a hard drinker, divorced from his wife, and using unapproved motivational methods to his troops, an image the Army did not want. The Army called the character a \"stereotype\" of World War II and Korean War attitudes that did not exist in the modern army and also did not like the obscene dialogue and lack of reference to women in the army. Eastwood pleaded his case to an Army general, contending that while the point of the film was that Highway was a throwback to a previous generation, there were values in the World War II- and Korean War-era army that were worth emulating.\n\nEastwood approached the [[United States Marine Corps]], which expressed some reservations about some parts of the film, but provided support. The character was then changed to a Marine. (This raised some conceptual difficulties, given that the [[Battle of Heartbreak Ridge]] primarily involved the Army. This is explained very briefly in the film when Sergeant Major Choozoo tells Stitch Jones that he and Highway were in the Army's [[23rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|23rd Infantry Regiment]] at the time and \"joined the Corps later\"; the 23rd Regiment was at Heartbreak Ridge) The Marine Corps first cooperated with the film project by allowing much of the filming to be done at [[Camp Pendleton]]. The Marines planned to use it to promote its \"[[Toys for Tots]]\" campaign, but upon viewing a first cut, quickly disowned the film because of the language.\n\nMarines who viewed the film cited numerous issues with the way they were portrayed. Major Powers, the battalion's inexperienced S-3 Operations Officer, is repeatedly shown disparaging and insulting Gunny Highway, as well as showing blatant favoritism regarding \"his\" Marines of the First Platoon. In reality, this would not have happened, given Highway's Medal of Honor. Much of the \"training\" done before the Grenada invasion was highly inaccurate, including the fact that Highway's Marine Recon unit did not have a [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] to deal with his men if injured. Even on a relatively small budget, the technical advice was poor. The [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] originally supported the film, but withdrew its backing after seeing a preview in November 1986.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-03/entertainment/ca-344_1_marine-corps At Least Some Marines Are Gung-ho For 'Ridge'] - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 December 1986</ref> Eastwood was paid $6 million for directing and starring in the film.<ref>Munn, p. 212</ref>\n\nBeginning in summer 1986, ''Heartbreak Ridge'' was filmed at Camp Talega (the location of the [[barracks]]), Chappo Flats (the location of the [[parachute rigging]] scene) and Mainside (the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] [[headquarters]]) on California's [[Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base]], the former campus of the San Diego Military Academy, SDMA [[Solana Beach, California|Solana Beach]] and Puerto Rico's [[Vieques Island]].<ref name=\"Hughes2001\"/>\n\nThe sequence involving the bulldozer is based on a real event during the invasion of Grenada involving Army General [[John Abizaid]], former commander of [[US Central Command]].<ref>''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', September 3, 2006.</ref> The [[Invasion of Grenada|American attack on Grenada]] is in some respects accurate, although it was really [[U.S. Army Rangers]] that secured the University Medical School.
