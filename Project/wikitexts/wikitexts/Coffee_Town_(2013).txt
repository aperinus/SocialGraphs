When the corporate owners of the shop have plans to convert the coffee house into a modern Coffee Town and Bistro, Will enlists the help of his two best friends \u2013 lighting salesman Chad and local police officer Gino \u2013 to save his office. In order to thwart the plans of Coffee Town's corporate owners, the trio plan to stage a robbery, creating the illusion of a crime-riddled neighborhood that is not suitable for a bistro.
