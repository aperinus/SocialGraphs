The plot is about the monitoring of [[East Berlin]] residents by agents of the [[Stasi]], [[East Germany]]'s secret police. It stars [[Ulrich M\u00fche]] as Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, [[Ulrich Tukur]] as his superior Anton Grubitz, [[Sebastian Koch]] as the playwright Georg Dreyman, and [[Martina Gedeck]] as Dreyman's lover, a prominent actress named Christa-Maria Sieland.\n\nThe film was released in Germany on 23 March 2006. At the same time, the screenplay was published by [[Suhrkamp Verlag]]. ''The Lives of Others'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The film had earlier won seven [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] awards\u2014including those for best film, best director, best screenplay, best actor, and best supporting actor\u2014after setting a new record with 11 nominations. It also won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] and [[European Film Award for Best Film]], while was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. ''The Lives of Others'' cost US$2 million<ref name=\"arnyt\" /> and grossed more than US$77 million worldwide {{As of|2007|11|lc=on}}.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\nReleased 17 years after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], marking the end of the German Democratic Republic, it was the first notable drama film about the subject after a series of comedies such as ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' and ''[[Sonnenallee]]''. This approach was widely applauded in Germany even as some criticized the humanization of Wiesler's character. The film's authenticity was considered praiseworthy given that the director grew up outside of East Germany and was 16 when the Berlin Wall fell.<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite journal |last=Ash |first=Timothy |author-link=Timothy Garton Ash |date=2007-05-31 |title=The Stasi on Our Minds |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2007/05/31/the-stasi-on-our-minds/ |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2014-11-17 |quote=It was therefore with particular interest that I recently sat down to watch The Lives of Others, this already celebrated film about the Stasi, made by a West German director who was just sixteen when the Berlin Wall came down.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add additional details to the plot unless you also trim elsewhere. It is slightly above what is recommended in [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nIn 1984 [[East Germany]], [[Stasi]] ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Gerd Wiesler, code name HGW XX/7, is ordered to spy on the playwright Georg Dreyman, who had so far escaped state scrutiny due to his Communist views and international recognition. Wiesler and his team bug Dreyman's apartment, set up surveillance equipment in an attic and begin reporting Dreyman's activities. Wiesler learns that Dreyman has been put under surveillance at the request of the Minister of Culture, Bruno Hempf, who covets Dreyman's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland. After an intervention by Wiesler leads to Dreyman's discovering Sieland's relationship with Hempf, he implores her not to meet him again. Sieland flees to a nearby bar where Wiesler, posing as a fan, urges her to be true to herself. She returns home and reconciles with Dreyman.\n\nAt Dreyman's birthday party, his friend Albert Jerska, a [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklisted]] theatrical director, gives him [[sheet music]] for ''Sonate vom Guten Menschen'' (''Sonata for a Good Man''). Shortly afterwards, Jerska hangs himself. A grieving Dreyman decides to publish an anonymous article in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', a prominent West German newsweekly. Dreyman's article accuses the state of concealing the country's elevated suicide rates. When Dreyman and his friends feign a defection attempt to determine whether or not his flat is bugged, a now-sympathetic Wiesler does not alert the border guards or his superior Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz and the conspirators believe they are safe. Since all East German [[typewriter]]s are registered and identifiable, an editor of ''Der Spiegel'' smuggles Dreyman an [[Groma B\u00fcromaschinen|ultra-flat typewriter]] with a red ribbon. Dreyman hides the typewriter under a floorboard of his apartment but is seen by Sieland.\n\nA few days later, Dreyman's article is published, angering the East German authorities. The Stasi obtain a copy, but are unable to link it to any registered typewriter. Livid at being rejected by Sieland, Hempf orders Grubitz to arrest her. She is blackmailed into revealing Dreyman's authorship of the article, although when the Stasi search his apartment, they do not find the typewriter. Grubitz, suspicious that Wiesler has mentioned nothing unusual in his daily reports of the monitoring, has him do the follow-up interrogation of Sieland. Wiesler makes Sieland reveal the typewriter's location.\n\nGrubitz and the Stasi return to Dreyman's apartment. Sieland realises that Dreyman will know she betrayed him and flees the apartment. When Grubitz removes the floorboard however, the typewriter is gone \u2013 Wiesler having removed it before the search team arrived. Unaware of this, Sieland runs to the street in despair and right into the path of a truck. A shocked Dreyman runs out after her and Sieland dies in his arms. Unable to prove his interference, Grubitz informs Wiesler that both the investigation and Wiesler's career are over; his remaining years with the Stasi will be in Department M, a dead-end assignment for disgraced agents. The same day, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] is elected [[leader of the Soviet Union]], beginning the process that will lead to the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet bloc]].\n\nOn 9 November 1989, Wiesler is steam-opening letters when a co-worker hears about the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] on the radio. Realising what this means, Wiesler silently gets up and leaves the office, inspiring his co-workers to do the same.\n\nTwo years later, Hempf and Dreyman meet while attending a performance of Dreyman's play. Dreyman asks the former minister why he was never monitored. Hempf tells him that he had been under full surveillance in 1984: \"We knew everything.\" Surprised, Dreyman searches his apartment, finds the now-abandoned listening devices and rips them off the walls.\n\nAt the [[Stasi Records Agency]], Dreyman reviews the files kept while he was under surveillance. He reads that Sieland was released just before the second search and could not have removed the typewriter. As he goes through the files, he is confused by the large amount of contradictory information, but as he reaches the final report and sees a fingerprint in red ink, he realises that the officer in charge of his surveillance{{snd}}Stasi officer HGW&nbsp;XX/7{{snd}}had concealed his activities, including his authorship of the suicide article, and also removed the typewriter from his apartment. Dreyman tracks down Wiesler, who now works as a deliverer of advertisement brochures, but is unsure how to thank him and decides not to approach him.\n\nTwo years later, Wiesler passes a bookstore window display promoting Dreyman's new novel, ''Sonate vom Guten Menschen''. He enters the bookstore and opens a copy of the book, discovering that it is dedicated \"To HGW XX/7, in gratitude\". Wiesler buys the book. When asked if he would like the book giftwrapped, Wiesler replies: \"No, it's for me.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ulrich M\u00fche]] as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler\n* [[Martina Gedeck]] as Christa-Maria Sieland\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as Georg Dreyman\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz\n* [[Thomas Thieme]] as Minister Bruno Hempf\n* [[Hans-Uwe Bauer]] as Paul Hauser\n* [[Volkmar Kleinert]] as Albert Jerska\n* [[Matthias Brenner]] as Karl Wallner\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Herbert Knaup]] as Gregor Hessenstein, ''[[Der Spiegel]]''-journalist\n* [[Charly H\u00fcbner]] as Udo Leveh, Wiesler's night shift\n* [[Bastian Trost]] as H\u00e4ftling 227, prisoner\n* [[Marie Gruber]] as Frau Meineke, neighbour\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Volker Michalowski|de}} as typewriter expert\n* [[Werner Daehn]] as Stasi officer-in-charge at house search\n* [[Hinnerk Sch\u00f6nemann]] as Axel Stiegler, joketeller at Stasi\n* Gabi Fleming as the prostitute \"Ute\"\n* [[Ludwig Blochberger]] as Benedikt Lehmann, Wiesler's student\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]'s parents were both from East Germany (originally they were from [[former eastern territories of Germany|further east]]; the [[von Donnersmarck]]s belonged to [[Silesia]]n nobility but the region was transferred to Poland from Germany after World War II).

He was listening to music and recalled [[Maxim Gorky]]'s saying that [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s favorite piece of music was [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]''. Gorky recounted a discussion with Lenin:\n\n{{blockquote|And screwing up his eyes and chuckling, [Lenin] added without mirth:\n\nBut I can't listen to music often, it affects my nerves, it makes me want to say sweet nothings and pat the heads of people who, living in a filthy hell, can create such beauty.  But today we mustn't pat anyone on the head or we'll get our hand bitten off; we've got to hit them on the heads, hit them without mercy, though in the ideal we are against doing any violence to people.

Knabe objected to \"making the Stasi man into a hero\" and tried to persuade Donnersmarck to change the film.
