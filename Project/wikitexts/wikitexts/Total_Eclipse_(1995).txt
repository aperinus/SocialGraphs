Based on letters and poems, it presents a historically accurate account of the passionate and violent relationship between 19th-century [[France|French]] poets [[Arthur Rimbaud]] ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) and [[Paul Verlaine]] ([[David Thewlis]]), at a time of soaring creativity for both men.<ref name=\"MazierskaGoddard2014\">{{cite book|author1=Ewa Mazierska|author2=Michael Goddard|title=Polish Cinema in a Transnational Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-1-58046-468-0|pages=290\u2013}}</ref> Warner Bros. has included the film in the catalogue of [[Warner Archive Collection]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wbshop.com/products/total-eclipse-1995-mod |title=Total Eclipse (1995) (MOD) |website=WB Shop |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507043803/https://www.wbshop.com/products/total-eclipse-1995-mod |archive-date=2020-05-07 |access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing this section. The plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe older [[Paul Verlaine]] meets [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s sister, Isabelle, in a caf\u00e9 in [[Paris]]. Isabelle and her mother want Verlaine to hand over any copies he may still have of Rimbaud's poems so that they can burn them; they fear the lewdness of his writings. Verlaine reflects on the wild relationship he formed with Rimbaud, beginning when the teenaged Rimbaud had sent his poetry to Verlaine from his home in the provinces in 1871. Verlaine, instantly fascinated, impulsively invites him to his rich father-in-law's home in Paris, where he lives with his young, pregnant wife. The wild, eccentric Rimbaud displays no sense of manners or decency whatsoever, scandalising Verlaine's pretentious, [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in-laws.\n\nThe 27-year-old Verlaine is seduced by the 16-year-old Rimbaud's physical body as well as by the unique originality of his mind. The staid respectability of married, [[heterosexual]] life and easy, [[middle class]] surroundings had been stifling Verlaine's admittedly [[sybaritic]] literary talent. His taking up with Rimbaud is as much a rebellion and a liberation as it is a giving in to self-indulgence and [[Sadomasochism|masochism]]. Rimbaud acts as [[Sadomasochism|sadistically]] to Verlaine as does Verlaine to his young wife, whom he eventually deserts. A violent, itinerant relationship ensues between the two poets, the sad climax of which arrives in [[Brussels]] when a drunken and enraged Verlaine shoots and wounds Rimbaud and is sentenced a fine and two years in prison for [[sodomy]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].\n\nIn prison, Verlaine converts to [[Christianity]], to his erstwhile lover's disgust. Upon release he meets Rimbaud in [[Germany]], vainly and mistakenly seeking to revive the relationship. The two men part, never to meet again. Bitterly renouncing literature in any form, Rimbaud travels the world alone, finally settling in Abyssinia (modern day [[Ethiopia]]) to run a \"trading post\". There he has a mistress and possibly a young boy-lover. A [[tumour]] in his right knee forces him back to France where his leg is amputated. Nevertheless, the [[cancer]] spreads and he dies at the age of 37. When he dies, the image of one of his most famous poems, ''Le Dormeur du val'', appears.\n\nDuring her conversation with Verlaine, Isabelle Rimbaud asserts that her brother had accepted [[Confession (religion)|confession]] from a priest right before he died, showing Christian penitence, which is why only the censored versions of his poetry should survive. Verlaine pretends to agree but tears up her card after she leaves. Later, Verlaine, drinking [[absinthe]] (to which he has become addicted), sees a vision of the sixteen-year-old Rimbaud, returned from some transcendent realm to express the love and respect Verlaine has thus posthumously earned. The film ends with the young Rimbaud walking alone on a mountain range, Verlaine proclaiming that they were both happy together, and Rimbaud claiming to have finally found eternity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Arthur Rimbaud]]\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Paul Verlaine]]\n* [[Romane Bohringer]] as Mathilde Maut\u00e9\n* [[Dominique Blanc]] as Isabelle Rimbaud\n* Felicie Pasotti Cabarbaye as Isabelle, as a child\n* Nita Klein as Rimbaud's Mother\n* [[James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e]] as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\n* Emmanuelle Oppo as Vitalie\n* Denise Chalem as Mrs. Maut\u00e9 de Fleurville\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as Mr. Maut\u00e9 de Fleurville\n* [[Christopher Thompson (actor)|Christopher Thompson]] as Carjat\n* Bruce Van Barthold as Aicard\n* [[Christopher Chaplin]] as Charles Cros\n* [[Christopher Hampton]] as The Judge\n* [[Mathias Jung]] as Andr\u00e9\n* Aza Declercq as prostitute\n}}\n\n==Critical response==\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 22% \"rotten\" score with critics (four of the eighteen reviews being positive) against a 61% score with audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/total_eclipse |title=Total Eclipse (1995) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=1 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn 1999, a [[DVD]] edition of the film was released.
