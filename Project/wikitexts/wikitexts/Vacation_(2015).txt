It stars [[Ed Helms]], [[Christina Applegate]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], and [[Chevy Chase]]. It is the fifth theatrical installment of the [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|''Vacation'' film series]], serving as a standalone sequel to ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' (1997). It is also the second not to carry the ''National Lampoon'' name after ''Vegas Vacation'', and was released by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Warner Bros.]] on July 29, 2015. It grossed $104 million on a $31 million budget and received generally negative reviews.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nRusty Griswold is now working as a pilot for a low budget [[regional airline]] called Econo-Air, living in Suburban Chicago and shares a stale relationship with his wife Debbie and their two sons, their shy and awkward 14-year-old James, and their sadistic 12-year-old Kevin. The gloating from his friends Jack and Nancy Peterson about a family trip they had in [[Paris]] doesn't help his situation.\n\nHe desires to relive the fun of his family vacations and holiday gatherings from his childhood. These memories prompt him to abandon his family's annual trip to their cabin in Cheboygan, Michigan (which the rest of the family secretly hated), and instead drive cross country from Chicago to Walley World, just like he did with his parents and sister. For the trip, Rusty rents a Tartan Prancer, an ugly, over-complicated [[Albania]]n [[SUV]].\n\nAlong the way, the Griswolds take many detours. The first stop is in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where it's revealed that the otherwise mild-mannered Debbie was an extremely promiscuous Tri Pi sorority sister in college nicknamed 'Debbie Do Anything'. To prove that she was the rebellious student, Debbie attempts to run an obstacle course while drunk, but fails miserably. While staying at a [[motel]], James meets Adena, a girl his age that he saw while driving on the highway, but she is scared away by Rusty's failed attempts to be a \"wingman\".\n\nIn Arkansas, they are led to a supposedly hidden hot spring by a \"helpful\" local, eventually realizing that it's actually a raw sewage dump. They return to their SUV, only to see that it's been broken into and sprayed with graffiti, as well as finding their luggage and cash stolen.\n\nThey stop in Plano, Texas, to get help from Rusty's sister Audrey and her attractive husband Stone Crandall. Rusty begins to suspect problems in his relationship with Debbie due to her seeming acceptance of Stone's obviously outward sexual advances, but she rebuffs his suspicions; Stone then walks in on the couple and makes a show of his muscular body and oversized genitalia.\n\nSpending the following night at a [[Wigwam Motel]] in Arizona, Rusty and Debbie sneak away and attempt to have sex at the [[Four Corners Monument]], where officers from all four states confront the couple. When the officers start arguing about who gets to make the arrest, Rusty and Debbie are able to escape. James encounters Adena again, and finally asserts himself against Kevin thanks to encouragement from Adena.\n\nThe next morning, they nearly get killed by Chad, a [[Grand Canyon]] rafting guide, who had just been dumped by his fianc\u00e9. Later, their SUV runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, and Rusty's unfamiliarity of the key fob causes the vehicle to explode, leading him to walk off dispirited and alone, thinking about the disastrous trip. Unfortunately, they have been tracked down by a seemingly unstable truck driver, who they think has been stalking them throughout the trip. In actuality, the trucker has been instead trying to return Debbie's missing wedding ring. He ends up giving them a lift to [[San Francisco]].\n\nThere, they spend the night at a [[bed and breakfast]] run by Rusty's parents, Clark and Ellen. They intend to fly home the next day, but Rusty and Debbie confront each other about their stale marriage and decide to start over again. With some encouragement from Clark the next morning, Rusty borrows his father's [[Wagon Queen Family Truckster]] and drives Debbie and the boys to Walley World to ride their newest roller coaster, the ''Velociraptor''.\n\nAfter spending the entire day waiting in line, they are cut off by Ethan, a rival pilot who Rusty knows in Chicago, and his family before the announcement of the park's closing. A fight breaks out, which the Griswolds win, forcing the other family to flee. The Griswolds finally board the ride, but it stalls halfway up the butterfly inversion, and they are rescued after several hours.\n\nRusty uses his airline connections to book a vacation in Paris with just Debbie and himself after sending the boys home where their neighbors will look after them. On the plane to Paris, they are seated in [[jump seat]]s next to a lavatory. Exasperated, Debbie learns that it will be a 12-hour flight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Russell \"Rusty\" Griswold, a pilot for Econo-Air living in Suburban Chicago\n** [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Jason Lively]], [[Johnny Galecki]], and [[Ethan Embry]] appear in archival photos from the previous ''Vacation'' films.\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Debbie Fletcher Griswold, Rusty's wife.\n** Emily Kincaid as young Debbie Fletcher\n* [[Skyler Gisondo]] as James Griswold, Rusty and Debbie's older son.\n** Cameron McIntyre as young James Griswold\n* [[Steele Stebbins]] as Kevin Griswold, Rusty and Debbie's younger son.\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Stone Crandall, an up-and-coming anchorman and Audrey's husband.\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Audrey Griswold-Crandall, Rusty's sister.\n** [[Dana Barron]], [[Dana Hill]], [[Juliette Lewis]], and [[Marisol Nichols]] appear in archival photos from the previous ''Vacation'' films.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Clark Griswold, Rusty and Audrey's father who now owns a bed and breakfast in San Francisco.\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Ellen Griswold, Rusty and Audrey's mother who now owns a bed and breakfast in San Francisco.\n* [[Charlie Day]] as Chad, a suicidal [[river rafting]] guide who was recently dumped by his girlfriend.\n* Catherine Missal as Adena, James' love interest.\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Ethan, an airline pilot and Rusty's rival.\n* [[Norman Reedus]] as Trucker, an unnamed truck driver who stalks the Griswold family.\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Jack Peterson, a friend of the Griswold family.\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Nancy Peterson, the wife of Jack and friend of the Griswold family.\n* [[Elizabeth Gillies]] as Heather, a member of the Tri Pi sorority that is a fan of Debbie.\n* [[Tim Heidecker]] as Utah Cop\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Colorado Cop\n* [[Kaitlin Olson]] as Arizona Cop\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as New Mexico Cop\n* [[Hannah Jeter|Hannah Davis Jeter]] as The Girl in the Red Ferrari, a different girl driving a Red Ferrari who tries to flirt with Rusty only to get struck by a semi-trailer truck.\n* [[David Clennon]] as Co-Pilot\n* [[Colin Hanks]] as Jake\n* [[Ryan Cartwright]] as Terry\n* [[John Francis Daley]] as Robert\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn February 2010, it was announced by [[New Line Cinema]] (owned by [[Warner Bros.]], which released the previous films) that a new ''Vacation'' film was being produced.<ref name=update1>{{cite web|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|title=New Line ready for another 'Vacation'|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118015026/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=December 18, 2012|date=February 10, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907210036/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118015026|archive-date=September 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Executive Producer was [[Steven Mnuchin]].
