The film was made by [[Ecosse Films]].\n\n==Plot==\nAmerican movie star Lara Tyler is hounded by the press as she prepares to wed English author James Arber. Despite the efforts of Lara's managers Steve and Emma, the secret wedding is interrupted by [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] Marco Ballani, who is determined to photograph the \"wedding of the decade\". Lara resolves to find a more remote location for her nuptials.\n\nKatie Nic Aodh returns to her hometown on the tiny Scottish island of Hegg after breaking off her engagement. She moves back into \"The Sunrise\", the [[bed and breakfast]] run by her terminally ill mother Iseabail, and takes up her former job as a shop assistant. Encouraged to write a [[guide book]] on Hegg, Katie documents the island\u2019s eccentricities.\n\nCaptivated by James' enchanting \u2013 albeit fictional \u2013 description of Hegg in his latest book, Lara chooses to have their wedding on the island. They stay at the local castle, which Steve transforms to match the book. Katie unsuccessfully flirts with an incognito James, and Marco comes to stay at the Sunrise, disguised as a monk. Suspicious of Marco and recognizing Steve from the tabloids, Iseabail deduces what is happening and calls the press. Spotting Marco staking out the wedding chapel, Lara runs off.\n\nWith Lara missing, Steve proceeds with the ceremony, using a \"decoy bride\" to convince Marco he has succeeded in photographing the wedding, but without informing James. Katie reluctantly accepts the role for \u00a35,000. Heavily veiled, she arrives at the Chapel and exchanges vows with James, but her dreadful American accent alerts him to the deception. The wedding party returns to the castle as the media descend on Hegg. Steve locks Katie and James in the bridal suite, keeping the press focused on the castle until Lara can be found. Katie and James bicker, and realize they may have been officially married.\n\nDisguised as an elderly local, Lara sees Iseabail with a substantial payment for notifying the press. Lara is touched when Marco, unaware of her true identity, reveals that he has fallen in love with Lara Tyler. Infiltrating the castle, Marco bursts into the suite. He and James tussle, before Marco declares his love for Lara and leaves to find her. James follows suit, but is forced to rescue Katie when she falls into the moat.\n\nThey go to the Sunrise, and bond as they change out of their wet clothes. Marco intercepts Lara\u2019s voicemail for James to meet her at a nearby cove. Recognized by Marco's editor, Lara kicks him in the face, before forcing Iseabail to toss her money off the cliffs. Finding Katie with James \u2013 wearing the vintage bagpiper's costume left by Katie's absentee father \u2013 Iseabail reveals that she summoned the press to the wedding. Believing Katie has orchestrated everything for money, James leaves to meet Lara.\n\nAn elderly deaf couple mistake James for Katie's father, and he attempts to play the bagpipes for them as they dance. Realizing she has fallen for him, Katie finds James. He is attacked by Katie's ex-boyfriend Angus, who begs her to take him back, but she declines. She and James consult Reverend McDonough, who declares that if James can reach Lara before nightfall, their wedding can proceed; he dissolves James and Katie's marriage. Katie confesses her feelings for James, but leads the paparazzi away as he meets Lara and the reverend, with Marco watching nearby.\n\nMonths later, Katie prepares to leave Hegg; she traveled the world with her mother before she died, with Lara's help, and her guidebook has been published. Departing by boat, she sees James arriving on the island. Having come to find her, he reveals that he has dedicated his latest book to her. They reunite on the docks, and share a kiss. Lara visits Marco, and they are caught by another paparazzo.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Katie,<ref name=\"sd\">{{cite news| url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/tennant-macdonald-eve-walk-down-the-aisle-with-decoy-bride/5013816.article | work=Screen Daily | title=Tennant, MacDonald, Eve walks down the aisle with decoy bride | first=Geoffrey | last=Macnab | date=14 May 2010 | accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> the decoy bride.\n* [[David Tennant]] as James Arber,<ref name=\"sd\" /> a best-selling English writer engaged to Lara.\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Lara Tyler,<ref name=\"sd\" /> an American movie star.\n* [[Michael Urie]] as Steve Korbitz,<ref name=\"hr\" /> Lara's manager.\n*[[Sally Phillips]] as Emma, Steve's assistant \n* [[Maureen Beattie]] as Iseabail,<ref name=\"hr\" /> Katie's mother.\n* [[Federico Castelluccio]] as Marco Ballani,<ref name=\"hr\" /> a photographer obsessed with Lara.\n* [[Dylan Moran]] as Charley, Marco's editor.\n* [[Jeannie Fisher]] as Aileen, a resident of Hegg.\n* [[Hamish Clark]] as Angus, Muireen's husband and Katie's ex-boyfriend.\n* [[James Fleet]] as Laird.\n* Sally Howitt as Muireen.\n* Hannah Bourne as Chloe.\n* Matthew Chalmers as Callum.\n* Rony Bridges as Roan.\n* Victoria Grove as Anais Anais.\n* Alisha Bailey as Surelle.\n* Alex Childs as TV host.\n* [[Tony Roper (actor)|Tony Roper]] as Reverend McDonough.\n* [[Ben Addis]] as Journalist 1\n* William Owen as Journalist 2\n* Calum MacNab as Journalist 3\n* Ross Armstrong as 1st Paparazzo\n* [[Samuel Roukin]] as 2nd Paparazzo\n* Patrick Regis as Hollywood Minister\n* Danny Bage as Hotel Doorman\n* Tona Gray as Elderly Woman\n* Gil Kolirin as Security Guard\n* [[Robert Fyfe]] as Ancient Crofter\n* Maryann Turner as Ancient Crofter's Wife\n* Achara Kirk as Tourist\n\n==Production==\nDavid Tennant said that the film was an homage to the 1983 Scotland-set film ''[[Local Hero (1983 film)|Local Hero]]''.<ref name=Scotsman />  The fictional island of Hegg was inspired by [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Eigg]].<ref name=Scotsman />  It received the largest grant possible from [[Scottish Screen]], \u00a3300,000.<ref name=Scotsman>{{cite news|title=Hollywood comes to isle of 'Hegg' in a Local Hero for the 21st century|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/hollywood-comes-to-isle-of-hegg-in-a-local-hero-for-the-21st-century-1-804304|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nRehearsals started in London on 21 June 2010.
