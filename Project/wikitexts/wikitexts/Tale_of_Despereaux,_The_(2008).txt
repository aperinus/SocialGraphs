The story is based on the 2003 novel [[The Tale of Despereaux|of the same name]] by [[Kate DiCamillo]]. The film is narrated by [[Sigourney Weaver]] and stars [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Emma Watson]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Frank Langella]], [[William H. Macy]], [[James Nesbitt]], [[Tony Hale]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Tracey Ullman]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], and [[Stanley Tucci]]. Animation was provided by [[Framestore|Framestore Animation]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] on December 19, 2008. It is the second theatrically-released computer-animated film distributed by Universal Pictures, following ''[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie]]''. ''The Tale of Desperaux'' grossed $86.9 million against a $60 million budget and received generally mixed reviews: many critics praised the film for its animation, voice acting, and the title character, coupled with complaints that it had an unoriginal and scrambled story.\n\n==Plot==\nA sailor named Pietro and his rat-companion Roscuro dock in the French kingdom of Dor\u2014famous around the world for its delicious soups\u2014during the \"Royal Soup Day.\" The chief cook, Chef Andre, makes good soup due to Boldo, a magical genie who emerges from his pot and who is made entirely of food. Roscuro sneaks into the royal banquet-hall and falls into the Queen's soup, giving her such a fright that she has a heart-attack and dies. The entire hall erupts into panic and the guards pursue Roscuro. He attempts to flee the castle but sees Pietro's ship has sailed away. He narrowly escapes being killed as he falls  through a sewer drain which leads to the castle dungeons. He is found in the dungeons and taken in by Botticelli Remorso, the leader of the large rat population. Distraught over his wife's death, the King forbids the consumption all things related to soup and declares rats \"illegal.\" Without its soup, Dor becomes impoverished and dreary. Andre is banned from making soup and Boldo stops appearing. The King's daughter\u2014Princess Pea\u2014despairs over the sad state of the kingdom and how her father's grief-based reclusive behavior shuts her\u2014and the world\u2014out.\n\nIn a mouse village within an abandoned kitchen storage room, Despereaux is born into the Tilling family. As he grows up, it is clear he is different from other mice: he is not timid\u2014but rather is brave and curious\u2014unnerving other mice around him. In an effort to teach him to be a \"proper mouse,\" his brother Furlough takes him to the royal library to show him how to chew books, but Despereaux is more interested in reading them. He becomes fascinated by books about daring knights and trapped princesses. One day, Deperaux encounters and converses with Princess Pea. He promises to finish the story about a trapped princess and tell her how it ends. Upon discovering Despereaux has violated mouse law by talking to a human, his parents Lester and Antoinette turn him over to the mouse council to avoid blame.\n\nThe council banishes Despereaux to the dungeons, where he meets and tells the princess story to the jailor, Gregory, who stops listening and leaves Despereaux alone. Deperaux is captured by the rats and thrown into their arena with a cat. As Despereaux is about to be eaten, Roscuro saves his life by asking Botticelli to give Despereaux to him to eat. Having been unable to adjust to being a sewer rat, Roscuro is desperate to hear about the outside world. The two become friends, as every day Despereaux tells him the stories and of the princess and her sadness. Wishing to make amends for all the trouble he's caused, Roscuro sneaks into Pea's room and tries to apologize to her, but she lashes out at him, and he's pursued by guards once again. Hurt by this, Roscuro vows revenge. He enlists the help of Miggery \"Mig\" Sow, Pea's young, hard-of-hearing maid who longs to be a princess herself, by convincing her she can take Pea's place if she kidnaps her. After Mig drags Pea to the dungeons, Roscuro double-crosses her and locks her in a cell.\n\nMeanwhile, Despereaux discovers the princess is in danger and he tries to tell the King who is too despondent to hear him. Despereaux tries to get help elsewhere; he tries to enlist his family, but they are afraid by his presence (thinking he is a ghost); he rings the town's bell to prove his survival. Andre, having had enough of the law, gets back to making soup, which brings the enchanted smell back to the kingdom and brings back Boldo. Despereaux tries to get help from Andre and Boldo, but only Boldo agrees and takes him back to the dungeons. On route, they are attacked by rats; Boldo sacrifices himself to allow Desperaux to reach the arena.\n\nIn the arena, Roscuro sees the apologetic sincerity in Pea's eyes and regrets his actions, but an enraged Botticelli signals the rats to eat Pea. Despereaux releases the cat to chase some of the rats away, and fights the others off as sunlight flows into the rat town. Despereaux is captured by Botticelli, but Roscuro saves him by reflecting the light at Botticelli, sending him falling into the arena. With the combined effort from Desperaux, Roscuro and Pea, Botticelli is trapped in a cage with the cat.\n\nIn the aftermath, Roscuro apologizes to Pea once again and she apologizes too; Mig is reunited with Gregory, who turns out to be her long-lost father, and they go back to their farm together.  Meanwhile, the King overcomes his grief and allows soup and rats back in the kingdom; the mice finally stop cowering (much to the mouse council's disdain); Roscuro returns to his life at sea with the light and gentle breeze, and Despereaux himself departs on a journey to see the world.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Despereaux Tilling, the brave but nonconforming mouse who does not run from danger as a mouse should.\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Chiaroscuro \"Roscuro\", the rat who currently lives at sea, and formerly worked for Botticelli\n* [[Emma Watson]] as Princess Pea, the human princess who befriends Despereaux\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Miggery \"Mig\" Sow, Princess Pea's servant girl\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Botticelli Remorso, the evil leader of the rat world\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Gregory, the jailer and Mig's father\n* [[William H.

[[Sylvain Chomet]] was employed by [[Gary Ross]] and Allison Thomas as director early on, before the film was approved for funding by [[Relativity Media]], with pre-production (including character design, the first drafts of the screenplay written by [[Will McRobb]] and [[Chris Viscardi]], and the addition of the original character of Boldo) taking place at his studio [[Django Films]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Chomet came up against creative and ethical differences with the producers and was eventually fired from the project and thrown out of the studio space allocated to the film.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/movies/27movi.html?_r=1&ei=5070&emc=eta1|title=Name Game: A Tale of Acknowledgment for 'Despereaux'|last=Cieply|first=Michael|author2=Charles Solomon |date=2008-09-27|work=The New York Times|pages=B7|access-date=2009-04-06}}</ref> [[Mike Johnson (animator)|Mike Johnson]] was hired to replace Chomet as director,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/mike-johnson-helm-tale-despereaux|title = Mike Johnson to Helm Tale of Despereaux}}</ref> before the role eventually went to [[Sam Fell]] and Rob Stevenhagen.<!--Broken reference!<ref name=\"trailer\" />--> {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Music==\n\nThe score to ''The Tale of Despereaux'' was composed by [[William Ross (composer)|William Ross]], who recorded his score with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Sony Scoring Stage.<ref name=scoring>{{cite news | author=Dan Goldwasser | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/166 | title=William Ross scores ''The Tale of Despereaux'' | publisher=ScoringSessions.com | date=2008-12-15 | access-date=2008-12-15 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n''The Tale of Despereaux'' was theatrically released on December 19, 2008, by [[Relativity Media]].\n\n===Home media releases===\nThe film was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on April 7, 2009.
