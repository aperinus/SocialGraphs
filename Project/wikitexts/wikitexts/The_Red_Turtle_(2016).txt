He discovers that he is on a deserted island with plenty of fresh water, fruit and a dense [[bamboo forest]]. He builds a raft from bamboo and attempts to sail away, but his raft is destroyed by an unseen monster in the sea, forcing him back to the island. He tries again with a larger raft, but is again foiled by the creature. A third attempt ends with the raft destroyed but this time he is confronted by a giant turtle with a bright red shell.\n\nThat evening, the man sees the red turtle crawling up the beach. In anger, he hits it on the head with a bamboo stick, then flips it over onto its back, stranding it. While working on another raft, he feels remorse and returns to the turtle but it is too heavy for him to flip over. He fetches water for it, but when he returns, it is dead. He falls asleep next to it. In the morning, the man is surprised to find a red-haired woman lying unconscious inside the shell, which has split. He fetches water for her and builds a shelter to protect her from the sun. When rain hits, the woman wakes up and goes swimming. The woman casts the shell adrift on the sea and the man does the same to his raft. The two fall in love.\n\nThe couple have a red-haired son. The curious boy finds a glass bottle and his father and mother tell him their story. After accidentally falling into the sea, the boy learns he is a natural swimmer, and swims with three green turtles. He swims back to his mother, who hugs him and looks out at the sea with apprehension. The boy grows into a young man. One day, a [[tsunami]] hits. After the tsunami recedes, the young man searches for his parents and finds his mother wounded with no sign of his father. He calls the three turtles and they help him swim out into the sea, where they find his father desperately clinging to some bamboo. They rescue him, the young man finds his glass bottle, and the family clean up the wreckage and burn the dead bamboo.\n\nOne day the young man has a dream about swimming away into the sea. He says goodbye to his parents and swims away with the three green turtles. The man and woman continue to live on the island and grow old together, still very much in love. One night, after gazing at the moon, the man closes his eyes and dies. The woman grieves. She lies next to him, and lays her hand on his. Her hand transforms into a flipper and, now the red turtle, she crawls down the beach and swims away.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was co-produced by [[Wild Bunch (company)|Wild Bunch]] and [[Studio Ghibli]] in association with [[Why Not Productions]], along with funding and support from Prima Linea Productions, [[Arte France Cin\u00e9ma]], CN4 Productions, and [[Belvision]] in France, and [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Hakuhodo|Hakudodo DY Media Partners]], [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Japan]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation]], and [[Toho]] in Japan. According to Vincent Maraval, head of Wild Bunch, he visited Studio Ghibli in Japan in 2008 and met with [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. Miyazaki showed him the short film ''[[Father and Daughter (film)|Father and Daughter]]'' and asked him to find its director, Micha\u00ebl Dudok de Wit, with the prospect of co-producing a feature film. Wild Bunch approached Dudok de Wit in London and convinced him to take on the project. The screenplay was written by Dudok de Wit and [[Pascale Ferran]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=P\u00e8re|first=Olivier|date=18 February 2014|url=http://www.arte.tv/sites/fr/olivierpere/2014/02/18/arte-france-cinema-coproduit-the-red-turtle-premier-long-metrage-danimation-de-michael-dudok-de-wit/|title=Arte France Cin\u00e9ma coproduit The Red Turtle, premier long m\u00e9trage d'animation de Michael Dudok de Wit|language=fr|work=arte.tv|publisher=[[Arte]]|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Goodfellow|first=Melanie|date=24 April 2014|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes/cannes-wild-bunch-unveils-first-titles/5086970.article|title=Wild Bunch unveils first titles on Cannes slate|work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere on 18 May at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/assets/File/WEB-2016/PDF/2016_HORAIRES%20CANNES%20web%281%29.pdf|title=Screenings Guide|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref> On 13 June, it was screened as the opening film of the 2016 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Goodfellow|first=Melanie|date=28 April 2016|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/annecy-animation-festival-unveils-2016-line-up/5103120.article|title=Annecy animation festival unveils 2016 line-up|work=[[Screen International]]|access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref> The regular French release was 29 June 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=243780.html|title=La Tortue rouge|language=fr|work=[[AlloCin\u00e9]]|access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was released in Japan on 17 September 2016, by [[Toho]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-12-11/studio-ghibli-co-produced-film-the-red-turtle-opens-next-september/.96375|title= Studio Ghibli Co-Produced Film The Red Turtle Opens Next September|date= 11 December 2015|access-date= 12 December 2015|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> The movie was released on DVD and Blu-Ray by [[Walt Disney Japan]] through the ''Ghibli Ga Ippai'' label on March 17, 2017, with the Blu-Ray version also containing Micha\u00ebl Dudok de Wit's other short films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.disney.co.jp/studio/news/20170111_03.html|title = \u5f85\u671b\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\uff01\u300e\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb \u3042\u308b\u5cf6\u306e\u7269\u8a9e\u300f\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30fb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\uff06DVD\u30013/17(\u91d1)\u767a\u58f2\uff01\uff5c\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ec\u30a4\u30fbDVD\u30fb\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u914d\u4fe1\uff5c\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u516c\u5f0f}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired the North and Latin American distribution rights for the film<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ford|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-sony-pictures-classics-takes-895659|title=Cannes: Sony Pictures Classics Takes 'The Red Turtle'|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=19 May 2016|access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref> and was released in the United States on 20 January 2017.\n\n''The Red Turtle'' was played in the London Film Festival on 5 October 2016 and eventually released in the United Kingdom by [[StudioCanal]] on 26 May 2017.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studiocanal.co.uk/title/the-red-turtle-2015/|title = The Red Turtle (2015) -Studiocanal UK - Europe's largest distribution studio STUDIOCANAL UK}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''The Red Turtle'' received critical acclaim.
