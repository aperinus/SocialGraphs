Both a [[prequel]] and [[sequel]] to ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'' (2012), it takes place before and after the events of the first film. The film is the [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of [[Cedric Nicolas-Troyan]], who was a [[visual effects supervisor]] and [[second unit director]] on the first film. It is written by [[Craig Mazin]] and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]], based on characters created by [[Evan Daugherty]], which like the first film were inspired by the fairy tale \"[[Snow White]]\" compiled by the [[Brothers Grimm]], as well as \"[[The Snow Queen]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. Reprising their roles from the first film, the cast includes [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Nick Frost]] and [[Sam Claflin]]. The film also introduced new characters played by [[Emily Blunt]], [[Jessica Chastain]] and [[Rob Brydon]].\n\n''The Huntsman: Winter's War'' premiered in [[Hamburg]] on March 29, 2016 and was released in the United States on April 22, 2016, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with praise for the visuals and cast, but many feeling the film was unnecessary. It grossed $165 million worldwide against an estimated $115 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nEvil sorceress [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]]'s powers allow her to know that her younger sister Princess [[The Snow Queen|Freya]], whose powers have not yet emerged, is not only involved in an illicit affair with nobleman Andrew, but is also pregnant with his child. Freya gives birth to a baby girl, but discovers that Andrew has murdered their child. In grief-fueled rage, her broken heart freezes over and she kills him with her sudden emergence of powers - the elemental control of ice.\n\nFreya runs away, building herself a new kingdom in the icy mountains in the north. Ruling as the much-feared Ice Queen, she orders parents to be killed and their children to be brought to her castle so they can be trained as an army to conquer for her. She teaches them to avoid the pain of love that she suffered but despite it, two of her best huntsmen, [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric]] and Sara, fall in love. Sara claims Eric in \"marriage\" by giving him her mother's medallion necklace. They plan to escape to a free life together, but are discovered by Freya. Sara is apparently killed while Eric is beaten and thrown into a river.\n\nSeven years later, after Ravenna's death (in [[Snow White and the Huntsman|the first film]]), Queen [[Snow White]] falls ill after hearing Ravenna's [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] beckon her. Because of its dark magic, she orders it to be taken to Sanctuary, the magical place that sheltered her during the events leading to Ravenna's defeat. Snow White's husband, William, informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing en route. Knowing its dark magic can make Freya stronger, Eric agrees to try and retrieve the Mirror; Snow White's dwarf ally [[Seven Dwarfs|Nion]] and his half-brother Gryff accompany him.\n\nThey travel to the last location of the soldiers. Eric discovers they killed one another with their own weapons. The trio are attacked by Freya's huntsmen and are rescued by Sara, revealed to be alive. Sara explains that she was imprisoned by Freya and only escaped recently. She has not forgiven Eric, thinking that he abandoned her. They decipher that Eric was shown an illusion of Sara's death while she was made to see him running rather than fighting. Eric convinces her that Freya tricked them.\n\nThe group go to the forest of the goblins who stole the mirror. During the fight, Sara notices that Eric still wears the necklace she gave him. They retrieve the mirror and save each other in another fight. That night, Eric and Sara have sex. The next morning, Freya attacks and reveals that Sara has been loyal to her all along. Sara shoots an arrow at Eric and Freya departs with the Mirror, unaware that Sara purposely hit Eric's medallion necklace, protecting him from dying. At her palace, Freya asks the Mirror who is the \"fairest of them all,\" resurrecting Ravenna, who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her.\n\nEric attempts to assassinate Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. Ravenna begins to attack the huntsmen and Freya, who has come to regard the huntsmen as her own children, protects them with an ice wall. As Eric, Sara and the huntsmen climb over the wall to retrieve the Mirror and help Freya, the sisters argue. Ravenna lets slip that she's responsible for Freya's powers. Suspicious, Freya forces Ravenna to reveal that the Mirror had told her Freya's child would become more beautiful than Ravenna. Ravenna then enchanted Andrew to kill the baby. Outraged, Freya turns on her sister, but is impaled by her. With her remaining strength, she freezes the Mirror and Eric shatters it, destroying Ravenna. As Freya dies, she smiles at a vision of her younger self holding her baby.\n\nWith Freya's death, those who had been imprisoned by her magic are set free. Eric and Sara are free to have a life together for the first time.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], [[Snow White]], having recovered from her illness, is seen from behind, as a mysterious golden bird lands on the balcony next to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric]]: An exceptional warrior and Freya's former Huntsman.\n** [[Conrad Khan]] as Young Eric\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]]: Snow White's evil stepmother.\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as [[The Snow Queen|Queen Freya]]: Ravenna's sister.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Sara: Eric's wife who was thought to be dead by and through Freya's deceiving powers.\n** Niamh Walter as Young Sara\n* [[Nick Frost]] as [[Seven Dwarves|Nion]]: a Dwarf who previously helped Eric and Snow White defeat Ravenna's army.\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Prince Charming|King William]]: the King of Tabor and Snow White's husband who helped her and Eric defeat Ravenna's army.\n* [[Rob Brydon]] as Gryff: A debt-collecting Dwarf who is Nion's half-brother.\n* [[Sheridan Smith]] as Bromwyn: A feisty and greedy Dwarf who becomes allies with Nion and Gryff.\n* [[Alexandra Roach]] as Doreena: A female Dwarf and Nion's love interest.\n* [[Sope Dirisu]] as Tull: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n* [[Sophie Cookson]] as Pippa: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n* [[Sam Hazeldine]] as Liefr: A fellow warrior raised by Freya.\n* [[Colin Morgan]] as Andrew: Freya's lover.\n* [[Robert Portal]] as the unnamed King and husband of Ravenna and the ruler of an unnamed Kingdom.\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Mirror Man]] {{small|(voice)}}: The physical form of the Magic Mirror.\n* [[Madeleine Worrall]] as Eric's Mother\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Narrator\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Snow White]] (uncredited;
