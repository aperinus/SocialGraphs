It is a continuation to the [[German folklore]] [[fairy tale]] \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", in which the titular siblings are now grown up and working as a duo of [[witch]] exterminators for hire. The film stars [[Jeremy Renner]] and [[Gemma Arterton]] in the title roles with [[Famke Janssen]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]], [[Pihla Viitala]] and [[Derek Mears]] as the supporting cast.\n\nIn 2010, after being approached by [[Gary Sanchez Productions]], Wirkola pitched the film to [[Paramount Pictures]]. Renner was cast as Hansel in September 2010 whilst the role of Gretel was planned for [[Noomi Rapace]] before Arterton's casting in January 2011. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2011, taking place at [[Babelsberg Studio]] in Germany. Filming concluded in June that year. Originally scheduled for release in March 2012, the film was delayed to allow additional time to shoot a [[post-credits scene]] with Renner.\n\n''Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 25, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX 3D]], as well in [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] motion theaters and select international [[4DX]] theaters. The film was panned by mainstream critics, particularly for what they saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence, although genre critics were more positive. The film topped the domestic [[box office]] on its opening weekend and was a success worldwide. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nAs in the classic fairy-tale, Hansel and Gretel are abandoned by their father in a forest, and the children enter a [[Gingerbread#Gingerbread houses and decorations|gingerbread house]] and are captured by a [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Witchcraft|witch]]. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat sweets to fatten him up and enslaves Gretel. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the oven.\n\nIn the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed [[Witch-hunt|witch hunters]], slaying hundreds of witches. The pair are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel changed with a magic-induced form of [[diabetes]] and needs a shot of [[insulin]] every few hours or he will die.{{#tag:ref|In Tommy Wirkola's original treatment, Gretel developed an eating disorder, but that idea was dropped.<ref name=co/>|group=N}}\n\nNow adults, Hansel and Gretel arrive in the town of [[Augsburg]] and prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing a beautiful young woman named Mina for witchcraft. Mayor Englemann has hired the siblings to rescue the town's missing children, who are presumed abducted by witches. Berringer hires trackers for the same mission in the hopes of disgracing the mayor and cementing his power. Hansel and Gretel capture the horned witch and discover that the witches are preparing for the coming [[Lunar eclipse#Blood moon|Blood Moon]], where they plan to sacrifice twelve children to gain immunity to fire, their greatest weakness.\n\nThe grand witch, Muriel, attacks the town with her army and abducts another child. She attacks Gretel, who is rescued by Ben, a local teenager and avid fan of theirs who plans to become a witch hunter himself. Hansel falls from a witch's broomstick and is lost in the forest. The next morning, Mina finds him stuck in a tree and takes him to a nearby spring, where she heals his wounds and they make love in the healing waters of the spring. Gretel is attacked by Berringer and his posse, who beat her before being stopped by Muriel's [[troll]], Edward. Edward kills Berringer and his men and tells Gretel that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel discover an abandoned cabin that they learn is a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel tells them the truth of their past.\n\nHansel and Gretel's mother was a [[white witch]] named Adrianna who married a farmer, explaining the siblings' immunity to [[black magic]]. On the night of the last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna too powerful and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, she revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father, who had been trying to protect them by leaving them in the forest.\n\nThe siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel to complete her long-due ceremony. Hansel wakes up with Mina, who reveals herself to be a white witch. She heals him again and uses a [[grimoire]] to bless his arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben disrupt the Blood Moon [[Witches' Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Mina slaughters the dark witches with a [[Gatling gun]] while Hansel frees the children. Edward defies Muriel and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house, now rotted and decayed. Muriel kills Mina before Hansel shoots her. The siblings engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with them decapitating her with a shovel. They burn her body on a [[pyre]] and collect their reward for rescuing the children. In the end, they head out on their next witch hunt, now accompanied by Ben and Edward.\n\n===Extended cut===\n\nAside from additional profanity, gore, and sexual content, and a few extra lines, the extended version features a few extra scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=328186|title=Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (Comparison: Theatrical Version - Unrated Extended Cut)|last=Wurm|first=Gerald|work=Movie-Censorship.com|date=July 8, 2013|access-date=October 22, 2013}}</ref> In one scene, Berringer blames the Mayor for the witches' attack and murders him in public.
