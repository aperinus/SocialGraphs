The film stars [[Elizabeth Taylor]] (who also produced) as [[Katherina (Kate) Minola|Kate]] and [[Richard Burton]] as [[Petruchio]], who were both nominated for [[BAFTA Award]]s for their acting. It features [[Cyril Cusack]], [[Michael Hordern]], [[Michael York]], and [[Victor Spinetti]] in supporting roles.\n\n''The Taming of the Shrew'' premiered with a [[Royal Film Performance]] on 27 February 1967. At the [[40th Academy Awards]],  it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction - Set Decoration]]. Burton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Comedy or Musical]], and the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical]]. Burton and Taylor also received [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] nominations.\n\nThis was one of three Shakespearen film adaptations directed by Zeffirelli, followed by [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|''Romeo and Juliet'']] in 1968, and [[Hamlet (1990 film)|''Hamlet'']] in 1990.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{main article|The Taming of the Shrew#Synopsis}}\n\nBaptista Minola is attempting to marry off his two daughters; however, he will marry off his youngest, Bianca only if someone will marry his eldest, [[Katherina (Kate) Minola|Katherina]]. Katherina is an ill-tempered [[wikt:shrew|shrewish]] woman but a lusty young nobleman, [[Petruchio]], takes on the challenge of taming and marrying her. A subplot involves the wooing of Bianca by several suitors including handsome Lucentio, foppish Hortensio, and elderly Gremio.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Elizabeth Taylor]] as [[Katherina (Kate) Minola|Kate]]\n*[[Richard Burton]] as [[Petruchio]]\n*[[Cyril Cusack]] as Grumio\n*[[Michael Hordern]] as Baptista Minola\n*[[Alfred Lynch]] as Tranio\n*[[Alan Webb (actor)|Alan Webb]] as Gremio\n*[[Michael York]] as Lucentio\n*[[Natasha Pyne]] as Bianca\n*[[Victor Spinetti]] as Hortensio\n*[[Roy Holder]] as Biondello\n*[[Mark Dignam]] as Vincentio\n*[[Giancarlo Cobelli]] as The Priest\n*[[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as The Pedant\n*[[Ken Parry]] as The Tailor\n*Anthony Gardener as The Haberdasher\n*[[Bice Valori]] as The Widow\n*Gianni Magni as Curtis\n*[[Lino Capolicchio]] as Gregory\n*Roberto Antonelli as Philip\n*[[Alberto Bonucci]] as Nathaniel\n*[[Milena Vukotic]] as Antonia}}\n\n{{small|Sources:<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/23856|access-date=2021-12-02|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Taming of the Shrew (1967)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7a1a4e|access-date=2021-12-02|website=BFI|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally intended to be a vehicle for [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]]. Taylor and Burton put over a million dollars into the production and, instead of a salary, took a percentage of profits. It was shot entirely at [[Dino De Laurentiis]]\u2019 studios in [[Rome]].\n\nUnlike her husband, Taylor had never performed Shakespeare before, and she was said to be very nervous prior to the beginning of the shoot. As she found her way into the role, and became more confident, she asked Franco Zeffirelli if she could shoot everything from the first day of shooting again, as she didn't think her performance was up to scratch. Zefferilli assured her it was, but she was persistent, and on the last day of principal photography, the entire first day was shot again.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film's premiere was the [[Royal Film Performance]] at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on February 27, 1967, attended by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]].<ref name=\"AFI\">{{AFI film|23856}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=8 March 1967|page=7|title=Royal Film Show Yields $100,800}}</ref> It had its US premiere at the [[Coronet Theatre (New York)|Coronet Theatre]] in New York City on March 8, 1967, starting its regular run the following day.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=8 March 1967|page=9|title=B'way Hurt by Rain, Snow; 'Dutchman' Big $19,000; 'Deadlier' OK 16G, 2d; 'Oh Dad' Fine 28G; 'Tobruk' 21G, 4th}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Taming of the Shrew'' grossed $8 million in North America,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1967/0TASH.php|publisher=Nash Information Services|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|title=The Taming of the Shrew|access-date=8 March 2012}}</ref> earning $3,540,000 in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] during 1967,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Big Rental Films of 1967 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=Variety, Inc. |date=3 January 1968 |page=25 |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-01-03-1968-25 |access-date=5 July 2018}} Please note these figures refer to [[Gross rental|rentals accruing to the distributors]].</ref> making it the [[1967 in film|25th highest grossing picture of 1967]].

Other scenes are trimmed of dialogue, or have lines moved from one to another. The film also adds additional scenes, with little or no dialogue, focusing on Kate and Petruchio.\n\nTaylor plays Kate\u2019s final, [[The Taming of the Shrew#Female submissiveness|controversial speech]] without any obvious irony (such as [[Mary Pickford]]\u2019s wink in the [[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|1929 film]]); however, her taming is apparently undercut by her quick exit from the banquet, which forces Burton\u2019s Petruchio to chase after her amid jeers from the other men. According to [[Harold Bloom]]'s take on the play, Katherina is \u201cadvising women how to rule absolutely, while feigning obedience\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Taming of the Shrew|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300109825|series=The Annotated Shakespeare|location=New Haven|page=161|chapter=An Essay by Harold Bloom|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kdg_RU5aQFUC&pg=PA161}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1967]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|23856}}\n* {{Allmovie title|48590|The Taming of the Shrew}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0061407|title=The Taming of the Shrew}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=3751|title=The Taming of the Shrew}}\n* {{Internet Archive film clip|id=TheTamingOfTheShrew-Featurette|description=of a featurette from the films opening}}\n* [http://www.enotes.com/william-shakespeare/taming-shrew eNotes Article]\n* [http://phoenixcinema.wordpress.com/2009/06/11/the-taming-of-the-shrew-1967/ Phoenix Cinema Article]\n\n{{Franco Zeffirelli}}\n{{The Taming of the Shrew}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taming of the Shrew, The}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1967 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nino Rota]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Zeffirelli]]\n[[Category:Films based on The Taming of the Shrew]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 16th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Suso Cecchi d'Amico]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Dehn]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:British historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]\n[[Category:1960s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
