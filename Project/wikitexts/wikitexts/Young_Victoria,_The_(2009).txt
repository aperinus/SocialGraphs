Produced by [[Graham King]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson]], and [[Timothy Headington]], the film stars [[Emily Blunt]], [[Rupert Friend]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Harriet Walter]], [[Mark Strong]], and [[Jim Broadbent]] among a large [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAs screenwriter, Fellowes sought to make the film as historically accurate as possible. With this in mind, [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] and historical consultant [[Alastair Bruce of Crionaich|Alastair Bruce]] were hired, and filming for ''The Young Victoria'' took place at various historical landmarks in England to further the film's authenticity. Despite this, some aspects of the film have been criticised for their historical inaccuracies.\n\n[[Momentum Pictures]] released the film in the United Kingdom and [[Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group]] opened ''The Young Victoria'' in [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States. Critical reception was generally positive.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Queen Victoria#Heir presumptive|Princess Victoria of Kent]] is the [[heir presumptive]] to the British throne during the reign of her uncle [[King William IV]] and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her. On one side is her mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], and the comptroller of the Duchess's household, [[Sir John Conroy]], who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a [[regency]] and giving him and her mother power if she assumes the throne while still a minor. On the other side is her uncle, King [[Leopold I of Belgium]], who uses family ties to secure an alliance between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and Belgium. He wants his nephew [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], who is Victoria's cousin, to marry her. Albert is then coached in Victoria's likes and dislikes. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], to visit. Victoria and Albert develop a mutual fondness, despite Victoria knowing that their uncle sent Albert to romance her. They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home.\n\nAt a birthday reception in [[Windsor Castle]], the King states his wish to be closer to Victoria and insults her mother. When the King increases Victoria's income, it is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening their animosity. The King then sends the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] to advise her. Victoria agrees to make Melbourne her private secretary, and he appoints her [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], who are from families politically allied to him.\n\nKing William dies shortly after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately exerts her independence, including physically distancing herself from her mother and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], Victoria announces she intends to devote herself to serving her country and its people. Victoria moves into the newly-built [[Buckingham Palace]]. Her aunt, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], advises her against acquiescing too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert visits again, and he and Victoria further bond while discussing their mutual interest in societal issues. Victoria resists a more intimate relationship, however, and Albert leaves.\n\nWhen [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] becomes the Prime Minister-designate, he wishes to replace some of Victoria's ladies-in-waiting with supporters of his own party. When the queen refuses, Peel rejects the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent [[Bedchamber crisis|crisis]] damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace. The turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters, and she invites him back to Britain. Protocol prevents him from proposing marriage, so she asks him.\n\nTheir short honeymoon is loving, but Albert soon grows frustrated at his initial powerlessness. Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to assume more duties. Albert then reorganises the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling the Duchess of Kent's funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, Albert blocks Lord Melbourne and King Leopold from influencing his wife. However, he and Victoria fiercely quarrel after Albert goes over her head with Peel to replace some of her ladies-in-waiting.\n\nWhen an anarchist attempts to shoot Victoria during an open-carriage ride, Albert is wounded when he shields her. His bravery leads to their reconciliation, and Melbourne urges her to share her work for social welfare with Albert. Their first child's birth helps reconcile Victoria and her mother, who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis.\n\nThe final [[title card]] sketches in their successful future until Albert's death at age 42.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Emily Blunt @ Adjustment Bureau Premiere 02.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Emily Blunt ''(pictured)'' starred as Queen Victoria.]]\n\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as [[Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]]\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]]\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I of Belgium]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[John Conroy|Sir John Conroy]]\n* [[Jesper Christensen]] as [[Christian Friedrich, Baron Stockmar|Baron Stockmar]]\n* [[Harriet Walter]] as [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]]\n* [[Jeanette Hain]] as [[Baroness Louise Lehzen]]\n* [[Julian Glover]] as the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]\n* [[Michael Maloney]] as [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]]\n* [[Michiel Huisman]] as [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]\n* [[Genevieve O'Reilly]] as [[Lady Flora Hastings]]\n* [[Rachael Stirling]] as the [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]]\n* [[David Robb]] as [[Lord John Russell]]\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIt was [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], a great-great-great-grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her with the help of an historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both \"fought for their love\" in the midst of public scrutiny.<ref name=\"bruniinterview\">{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/movies/13ferguson.html |first=Frank|last=Bruni |author-link=Frank Bruni | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Duchess of York as Film Producer | date=10 December 2009 | access-date=28 July 2011}}</ref> A friend set up a meeting with producer [[Graham King]],<ref name=\"bruniinterview\" /> to whom she pitched the idea along with several others.<ref name=\"wpostreinvent\">{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/18/AR2009121800070_2.html |first=Mary |last=Jordan |author-link=Mary Jordan (journalist)| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=With her film 'The Young Victoria,\" Sarah Ferguson reinvents herself yet again | date=20 December 2009 | access-date=20 July 2011}}</ref> At the time wrapping up his work on ''[[The Departed]]'',<ref name=bruniinterview/> King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years.<ref name=prodnotes/> The producer later remembered, \"she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria\u2019s early life: the precise span covered in ''The Young Victoria''.
