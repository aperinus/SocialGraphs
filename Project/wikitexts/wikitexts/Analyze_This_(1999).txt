The plot follows a crisis-stricken [[American Mafia|mafioso]] ([[Robert De Niro]]) who solicits the assistance of a reluctant [[psychiatrist]] ([[Billy Crystal]]).\n\n''Analyze This'' was given a wide release by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[Roadshow Entertainment]] on March 5, 1999, grossing $176.9 million worldwide, and received positive reviews. Due to its success, it was followed by the [[sequel]] ''[[Analyze That]]'' in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Crime boss|Mob boss]] Paul Vitti and his ''[[consigliere]]'' Manetta are discussing an upcoming meeting and the Mafia's present-day problems over lunch. Just as Manetta warns Paul to look out for Primo Sindone (an up-and-coming mafioso who wants to be ''[[Capo dei capi|capo di tutti capi]]''), gunmen drive past and kill Manetta. Paul narrowly escapes.\n\n[[Psychiatry|Psychiatrist]] Ben Sobel is stressed: his son from his first marriage spies on his sessions, his patients are not challenging enough, and his wedding to Laura MacNamara is upcoming. Ben [[Rear-end collision|rear-ends]] a car belonging to Paul and the trunk opens, revealing a man bound and gagged inside, which Ben and his son do not notice. Jelly, one of Paul's men, takes the blame, but Ben gives Jelly his business card in case he changes his mind regarding compensation.\n\nDuring a meeting, Paul has a [[panic attack]] and tells Jelly that he needs to see a psychiatrist, but it has to be kept a secret, and Jelly recommends Ben. Paul visits Ben, claiming his friend needs therapy, but Ben sees through the lie. As he realizes Paul is talking about himself, it impresses Paul enough to want to see him constantly, to Ben's frustration. Ben goes to Miami for his wedding and Paul, Jelly, and the crew follow. Paul explains he has been suffering from [[erectile dysfunction]] and Ben suggests the source of the problem might be stress.\n\nThe next day, Paul has another panic attack and requests to see Ben. Paul explains his history with his father to him, who thinks this might have something to do with Paul's [[anxiety]]. The wedding is interrupted when an [[Contract killing|assassin]] is killed by Jelly. Ben confronts Paul and causes him to lose his temper. Ben suggests he resolve his anger by calling Primo and telling him how he feels. Paul phones Primo and starts doing it, but ends up threatening to kill him.\n\nBen and his family return to New York, where they find a fountain in their garden, a gift from Paul. The FBI arrive and request Ben inform on Paul, but he refuses despite the FBI's threats. He changes his mind when the FBI play a tape in which Paul reveals his intention to kill Ben after the meeting (which the FBI had altered: Paul was actually saying he would kill anyone who threatened Ben). \n\nAt his next meet-up with Paul, Ben wears a wire, but discards it when he learns that, as a child, he witnessed his father being murdered. Paul, informed that Ben was working with the FBI, takes him to a secluded place to kill him. They get into a heated argument, and Paul breaks down as he admits that he blames himself for his father's death. Just then, two hitmen arrive to kill Paul, but Jelly kills them both. Paul apologizes for planning to kill Ben, and the two part ways.\n\nThe day of the meeting arrives, but Paul has a severe panic attack. Jelly interrupts Ben's wedding, requesting Ben attend the meeting as Paul's ''consigliere''. He is reluctant, but his ego causes him to patronize Primo until he finally pulls a gun. Paul arrives, orders Primo to stand down, and announces he knows a traitor in his own family killed Dominic, but will not seek revenge as he instead will retire from the Mafia. Outside, a standoff ensues between Paul's and Primo's men, during which Ben sacrifices himself for Paul. The FBI intervenes, the mobsters are arrested, and Ben is taken to the hospital.\n\nBen visits Paul in prison, and Paul thanks Ben for his help before informing him that Primo is dead. At home, Ben dances with his new wife as [[Tony Bennett]] serenades them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Paul Vitti\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Ben Sobel\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Laura MacNamara\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Primo Sidone\n* [[Joseph Rigano]] as Manetta\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Jelly\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Caroline\n* [[Max Casella]] as Nicky Shivers\n* Kyle Sabihy as Michael Sobel\n* [[Rebecca Schull]] as Dorothy Sobel\n* [[Pat Cooper]] as Salvatore Masiello\n* [[Leo Rossi]] as Carlo Mangano\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Dr. Shulman\n* [[Tony Darrow]] as Moony\n* [[Ira Wheeler]] as Scott MacNamara\n* [[Elizabeth Bracco]] as Marie Vitti\n* [[Bill Macy]] as Dr. Isaac Sobel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Analyze This'' was co-produced and co-financed by the American [[Warner Bros.]] and the Australian [[Roadshow Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-mar-05-fi-14164-story.html|title=For Warner and Roadshow Studios, No Need to Analyze Joint Ventures|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 5, 1999}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Analyze This'' opened in 2,518 theaters and earned an average of $7,017 per location, for an estimated $18 million opening, putting it at number 1 at the box office for that weekend; it exceeded the $13 million debut of Crystal's ''[[City Slickers]]'' in 1991.<ref name=\"opening\" /> It would also break ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]''{{'}}s record for having the largest opening weekend for a [[Robert De Niro]] film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/112637456/de-niro-crystal-draw-audiences/ |title=De Niro, Crystal draw audiences |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106180937/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/112637456/de-niro-crystal-draw-audiences/ |newspaper=[[St. Cloud Times]] |page=14 |date=March 9, 1999 |access-date=November 6, 2022 |archive-date=November 6, 2022 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-status=live}} {{Open access}}</ref> The film held this record until the release of ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' in October 2000.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Reese|first=Lori|title=''Meet the Parents'' tops the box office|url=https://ew.com/article/2000/10/08/meet-parents-tops-box-office/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=September 22, 2022|date=October 8, 2000}}</ref> The opening weekend audience skewed older, with 75% over the age of 25, and audience demographics being 54% female to 46% male.<ref name=\"opening\">{{cite web | date = March 7, 1999 | author = Andrew Hindes | title = Adults take to 'This', Teens steer 'Cruel' to No. 2 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url = https://variety.com/1999/film/news/adults-take-to-this-1117492025/ }}</ref> The film went on to earn $107 million at the domestic box office and a further $70 million at the international box office, for a worldwide total of $177 million.<ref name=\"NUM\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 69% from 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10.
