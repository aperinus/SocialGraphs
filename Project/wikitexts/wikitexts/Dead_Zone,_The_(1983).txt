The screenplay, by [[Jeffrey Boam]], is based on the 1979 [[The Dead Zone (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]]. The film stars [[Christopher Walken]], [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Herbert Lom]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Anthony Zerbe]], and [[Colleen Dewhurst]]. Walken plays a schoolteacher, [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]], who awakens from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive reviews. The novel also inspired a television series of the [[The Dead Zone (TV series)|same name]] in the early 2000s, starring [[Anthony Michael Hall]], the 2-hour pilot episode of which borrowed some ideas and changes used in the 1983 film.\n\nIn the novel, the phrase \"dead zone\" refers to the part of Johnny Smith's brain that is irreparably damaged, resulting in his dormant psychic potential awakening. When some information in Johnny's visions is beyond his perception, he considers that information as existing \"in the dead zone.\" In the film adaptation, the phrase \"dead zone\" is that part of his psychic vision that is missing \u2014 a blank area that he cannot see. This \"dead zone\" refers to an outcome that is not yet determined, meaning Johnny can change the future.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster in [[Castle Rock (Stephen King)|Castle Rock]], [[Maine]], schoolteacher Johnny Smith politely declines when his girlfriend Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car accident that leaves him in a coma. Awakening under the care of neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak, Johnny finds that five years have passed, and Sarah is now a married mother.\n\nJohnny discovers that he can now see aspects of a person's life through physical contact. As he touches a nurse's hand, he sees her daughter trapped in a fire. He also sees that Weizak's mother, long thought to have died during [[World War II]], is still alive, and that a pushy reporter's sister killed herself.\n\nAs news of his gift spreads, Sheriff George Bannerman asks Johnny for help with a series of murders. At first Johnny declines but he eventually agrees to help, and, through a vision at the crime scene, discovers that deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before they can arrest him, Dodd commits suicide. Dodd's mother shoots Johnny before being killed by Bannerman.\n\nNow walking with a cane after the shooting, Johnny moves away and attempts to live a more isolated life. He tutors children, working from home, until wealthy Roger Stuart convinces him to visit and tutor his son, Chris. Johnny soon receives a vision of Chris and two other boys drowning in a local pond during an ice hockey game. He implores Stuart to change his plans, but Stuart refuses and fires Johnny. Later, Johnny finds out that Chris had stayed home from the game and is still alive. Johnny realizes he has a \"dead zone\" in his visions, where the future is changeable.\n\nJohnny soon meets Greg Stillson, a superficially charismatic [[third party (politics)|third-party]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]], for whom Sarah and her husband volunteer. Johnny shakes Stillson's hand and has a vision of Stillson as President ordering what appears to be a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]]. Johnny seeks out Weizak's advice, asking, for instance, if he would have killed [[Adolf Hitler]] if he had the chance, knowing beforehand the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but is a worthwhile sacrifice.\n\nSarah and her family attend a rally for Stillson. Johnny also sneaks in with a rifle; he shoots at Stillson but misses. In the ensuing commotion, Stillson grabs Sarah's baby and holds him as a human shield, which a photographer captures on film. Before Johnny can fire again, he is shot by Stillson's bodyguard. Johnny touches Stillson's hand and foresees that, after the photograph is published, Stillson's career ends and he commits suicide, thus averting the nuclear attack. Johnny lies dying as Sarah embraces him and tells him that she loves him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]]\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Sarah Bracknell\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Sheriff George Bannerman\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Dr. Sam Weizak\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Roger Stuart\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Henrietta Dodd\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Greg Stillson\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as Deputy Frank Dodd\n* Simon Craig as Chris Stuart\n* G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs as Sonny\n* [[Sean Sullivan (actor)|Sean Sullivan]] as Herb Smith\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Vera Smith\n* Barry Flatman as Walt Bracknell\n*[[Peter Dvorsky (actor)|Peter Dvorsky]] as Dardis\n*[[Leslie Carlson]] as Brenner\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter King's novel ''The Dead Zone'' was released in 1979, [[Lorimar Film Entertainment]] began developing a film adaptation. Producer Carol Baum gave the book to screenwriter [[Jeffrey Boam]] and asked him to write a screenplay. \"I saw it had great possibilities and agreed to do it,\" Boam said.<ref name='cinefan_deadzone'>{{cite journal | title = The Dead Zone | journal = Cinefantastique | date = Dec 1983 \u2013 Jan 1984 | first = Tim | last = Lucas | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 24\u201335}}</ref> He developed a script with director [[Stanley Donen]], who left the project before the film had reached production at Lorimar.<ref name='eon_mag'>{{cite web | url = http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-the-last-crusade-of-screenwriter-jeffrey-boam/ | title = Exclusive Interview: The Last Crusade of Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam | last = Ferrante | first = A.C. | date = May 1, 2013 | work = Assignment X/EON Magazine | publisher = Midnight Productions, Inc.}}</ref> Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box-office failures, and soon after, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] bought the rights to ''The Dead Zone''.

Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King's book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was ''use'' that episodic quality, because I saw ''The Dead Zone'' as a triptych.\"<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story,<ref name='hollywood_sk'>{{cite book | last1 = Magistrate | first1 = Tony | title = Hollywood's Stephen King | chapter = Defining Heroic Codes of Survival | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | year = 2003 | location = New York City | pages = 120 | isbn = 0312293216}}</ref> including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,\" he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/>\n\nKing is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"<ref name='sk_universe'/>\n\nBefore Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, [[Bill Murray]] was considered for the role<ref>{{cite web|last=Locke|first=Greg W.|title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn't Take|date=26 August 2011|url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 November 2011|access-date=25 May 2015}}</ref> as it was King's first choice.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015}}</ref> Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead.<ref name=cast>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&q=hal+holbrook+the+dead+zone&pg=PA66|last=Mell|first=Eila|title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|year=2015|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476609768}}pages 66-67</ref> Cronenberg also wanted [[Hal Holbrook]] to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.<ref name=cast/>\n\nIn addition to Donen, both [[John Badham]] and [[Michael Cimino]] were also considered to direct.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lambie |first=Ryan |title=Why The Dead Zone Is One of the Best Stephen King Films|date=21 February 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]] |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-dead-zone/33989/why-the-dead-zone-is-one-of-the-best-stephen-king-films |access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nShooting started in early January 1983<ref>Lucas, p. 24</ref> and took place in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara]] of Cronenberg's native [[Ontario]], Canada. The so-called [[Screaming Tunnel]], located in nearby [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], was also used as the backdrop for one scene. The [[gazebo]] was built by the film crew and donated to [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]].<ref name=afi/>\n\nAccording to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, ''The Dead Zone'' was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario, which lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy, snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural shooting locations, despite it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times. [[Canada's Wonderland]], a theme park 30&nbsp;km north of [[Toronto]]'s city limits, was also used as a filming location.\n\n===Music===\nThe music soundtrack, composed by [[Michael Kamen]], was recorded by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[London]], at the famous EMI [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and led by [[Sidney Sax]]. This is the only Cronenberg film since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979) for which [[Howard Shore]] was not composer.\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Dead Zone'' received very positive reviews on release.<ref name=afi/> It holds an approval rating of 88% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.60/10. The site's consensus reads, \"''The Dead Zone'' combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Zone|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_zone/|url-status=live|access-date=August 2, 2022|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Dead Zone|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-dead-zone|url-status=live|access-date=August 15, 2021|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars, describing ''The Dead Zone'' as by far the best of the half-a-dozen cinematic adaptations of King's novels to that date. He praised Cronenberg's direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the entire cast, especially Walken: \"Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy's story.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=26 October 1983|title=The Dead Zone|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/the-dead-zone-1983|access-date=14 September 2016}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the film as \"a well-acted drama more eerie than terrifying, more rooted in the occult than in sheer horror.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=FILM: 'DEAD ZONE,' FROM KING NOVEL|date=21 October 1983|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05E1DC123BF932A15753C1A965948260?|access-date=14 September 2016|archive-date=August 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806022348/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05E1DC123BF932A15753C1A965948260%3F|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' was more critical of the film, describing it as \"By no means a bad film, just a disappointingly bland and superficial one ... in which director David Cronenberg relinquishes the one thing that had always set him apart from his Canadian colleagues: his willingness to follow his intuitions rather than the logic of a script.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=The Dead Zone|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-dead-zone/Film?oid=1066637|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722080754/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-dead-zone/Film?oid=1066637|archive-date=July 22, 2010|access-date=August 15, 2021|website=[[Chicago Reader]]|date=October 26, 1985}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[List of American films of 1983]]\n* [[The Dead Zone (TV series)|''The Dead Zone'' (TV series)]], a television series also based on the novel\n* \"[[Treehouse of Horror XV|The Ned Zone]]\", a segment of ''The Simpsons''{{'}} \"Treehouse of Horror XV\" episode that parodies the novel and film\n* \"[[Christopher Walken#Appearances on Saturday Night Live|Ed Glosser, Trivial Psychic]]\", a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch featuring Christopher Walken that parodies the film\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0085407}}\n* {{Amg movie|12729}}\n* {{tcmdb title|4842}}\n* {{Mojo title|deadzone}}\n\n{{The Dead Zone}}\n{{David Cronenberg}}\n{{Media based on Stephen King works}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Horror Film 1972\u20131990}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dead Zone, The}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1983 horror films]]\n[[Category:1983 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1983 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American political thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about assassinations]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films based on American horror novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on American thriller novels]]\n[[Category:Films about psychic powers]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Stephen King]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Cronenberg]]\n[[Category:Films set in Maine]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Dino De Laurentiis]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Debra Hill]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Boam]]\n[[Category:Films about precognition]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]"}]}}}}
