The story takes place mainly in rural [[Berkeley County, South Carolina|Berkeley County]] in [[South Carolina]] and depicts Benjamin Martin (Gibson), an American colonist opposed to going to war with [[British Empire|Great Britain]] who, along with his adult son, (Ledger) gets swept into the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] when his home life is disrupted and one of his sons is murdered by a cruel British officer (Isaacs). Rodat has said Martin is a composite character based on four historical men: [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], [[Francis Marion]], [[Daniel Morgan]] and [[Thomas Sumter]].\n\nMost of the film's events occur in the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern theater]] of the war. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, it was harshly criticized by British critics and historians and stirred controversy in the United Kingdom due to its themes of anti-British sentiment, its fictionalized portrayal of British figures and atrocities, including killing wounded soldiers and prisoners of war, the film's main villain shooting a child in cold blood and an [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]] scene in which a church filled with colonists is locked and burned which was controversial due to it being similar to the [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre]], a World War II war crime perpetrated by the [[Waffen-SS]] in June 1944. In his review of the film, critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, \"None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-patriot-2000|title=The Patriot |first=Roger |last=Ebert |access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1776, Captain Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the [[French and Indian War]] and a [[widower]] with seven children, is called to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to vote in the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] on a levy supporting the [[Continental Army]]. Fearing war against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and not wanting to force others to fight when he will not, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed, and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Army.\n \nTwo years later, Charleston [[Siege of Charleston|falls]] to the [[British Army|British]] and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle before British [[Dragoon]]s led by Colonel William Tavington arrive, arrest Gabriel with the intention of hanging him as a spy, and seize Benjamin's African American workers for their own use. When Benjamin's son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house [[arson|burned]] and all wounded [[Regular Army (United States)|Americans]] executed. After the British leave, Benjamin, accompanied by his two younger sons, set up a row of [[muskets]] and ambush the British convoy transporting Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, slaughters several British troops with his [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \"Ghost\".\n\nGabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. While traveling, they witness American soldiers and militiamen under General [[Horatio Gates]] [[Battle of Camden|engaging]] the British Army. Benjamin points out the foolishness of undisciplined and untested men fighting well-trained British regulars on open ground; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed. Benjamin meets his former commanding officer, Col. Harry Burwell, who appoints him as [[colonel]] of a newly raised [[militia (United States)|militia]] unit due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under his father's command. Benjamin is tasked with weakening [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]'s regiments through a sustained campaign of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Benjamin is also provided the service of French Major Jean Villeneuve, who helps train the militia and promises more French aid.\n\nGabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention an incident at Fort Wilderness. Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son: while fighting in the British Army, he and several other soldiers discovered French soldiers committing an atrocity against British colonists. The enraged men caught up with the retreating French at Fort Wilderness and killed all but two of them. The survivors were forced to gather the heads of their comrades and present them to the [[Cherokee]], convincing the tribe to betray the French and side with the British. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.\n\nBenjamin's militia carries out brutal ambushes of British patrols and supply caravans, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two [[Great Dane]]s, and burn the bridges and ferries needed by Cornwallis. The general angrily blames Tavington for his setbacks, but when Benjamin uses what Cornwallis perceives as a dishonorable [[ruse of war|ploy]] to free some of the captured men, he reluctantly permits Tavington to do whatever he pleases if it puts a stop to the attacks. With the reluctant aid of Wilkins, a local Loyalist, Tavington has the homes of several militiamen burned and their families executed. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a [[Gullah]] settlement with formerly enslaved residents. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed, Anne.\n\nTavington's [[brigade]] raids a town that has been secretly providing the militia with food. He has all the residents, including Anne and her parents, assembled in the church and demands the location of their camp. After their location is given, he has the doors barricaded, and orders the church to be burned, killing everyone inside. When they discover the tragedy, Gabriel and several other soldiers attack Tavington's encampment; Tavington is wounded but manages to kill Gabriel before retreating. Benjamin mourns and contemplates desertion before being reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' troops in a [[decisive victory|decisive battle]] at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. Benjamin rallies his side, and he and Tavington meet in personal combat. Tavington disarms and wounds Benjamin with his saber, before preparing to deliver the [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]. At the last second, Benjamin dodges the attack and impales Tavington twice in the abdomen and throat respectively, killing him. The battle is a Continental victory, and Cornwallis sounds the retreat.\n\nAfter many retreats, Cornwallis is [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns to his family, with Charlotte carrying their new baby, and discovers members of his former militia unit rebuilding his homestead on their old town road.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Captain/Colonel Benjamin Martin <br />A veteran of the [[French and Indian War]], the hero of the fictional Fort Wilderness, and widowed father of seven children, He is based on a composite of historical characters which include [[Thomas Sumter]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], and [[Francis Marion]].<ref name=DVD />\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Charlotte Selton <br />Benjamin's sister-in-law and later wife.

In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel's child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin, and gave the Martin character six children to signal this preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson's seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin had seven children. Like the character [[William Wallace]], which Gibson portrayed in ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'' five years earlier, Martin is a man seeking to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life of an innocent family member is taken.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Harrison Ford]] turned down the lead role of Benjamin Martin because he considered the film \"too violent,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11455239/Harrison-Ford-his-life-and-career.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11455239/Harrison-Ford-his-life-and-career.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Harrison Ford: his life and career|first=Telegraph|last=Reporters|date=March 6, 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and that, \"it boiled the American Revolution down to one guy wanting revenge.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/premium/the-enduring-appeal-of-harrison-ford/|title=The Enduring Appeal Of Harrison Ford|website=PEOPLE.com}}</ref> Gibson was paid a record salary of $25 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=Spring 2000|issue=540|page=117|title=Livin' Large}}</ref> [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], and [[Brad Renfro]] were considered to play Gabriel Martin.

Retrieved October 31, 2007.</ref></blockquote>\n\n''The Patriot'' does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character's guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the [[French and Indian War]], leading him to repentantly repudiate General Cornwallis for the brutality of his men.\n\nConservative radio host [[Michael Graham (radio personality)|Michael Graham]] rejected Hibbert's criticism of Marion in a commentary published in ''[[National Review]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Was Francis Marion a slave owner? Was he a determined and dangerous warrior? Did he commit acts in an 18th century war that we would consider atrocious in the current world of peace and [[political correctness]]?

This decision received criticism from [[Spike Lee]], who in a letter to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' accused the film's portrayal of [[slavery]] as being \"a complete [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]] of history\".<ref name=PCOLHolywoodreporter>[http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,340343,00.html \"Spike Lee slams Patriot\"], ''Guardian Unlimited'', July 6, 2000.

Ben Fenton, commenting in the [[The Daily Telegraph|''Daily Telegraph'']], wrote:\n\n<blockquote>There is no evidence that Tarleton, called 'Bloody Ban' or 'The Butcher' in rebel pamphlets, ever broke the [[Laws of war|rules of war]] and certainly did not ever shoot a child in cold blood.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=June 19, 2000|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html |access-date=April 17, 2017 |location=London}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Tarleton gained the reputation among Americans as a butcher for his involvement in the [[Battle of Waxhaws]] in South Carolina, he was a hero in the City of Liverpool. [[Liverpool City Council]], led by [[Mayor]] Edwin Clein, called for a public apology for what they viewed as the film's \"[[character assassination]]\" of Tarleton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriotic Liverpool up in arms over Gibson's blockbuster|work=Guardian Unlimited |date=June 30, 2000 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,338280,00.html |access-date=October 31, 2007 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nWhat happened during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, is the subject of debate. According to an American field surgeon named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a [[white flag]] of surrender, \"expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare\". While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton's horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out \"indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages\".\n\nIn Tarleton's own account, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge in which he was knocked out for several minutes and that his men, thinking him dead, engaged in \"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/americanrevolution/p/battle-of-waxhaws.htm |title=American Revolution: Battle of Waxhaws |first1=Kennedy |last1=Hickman |publisher=About.com |access-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTarleton's role in the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas is examined by Ben Rubin who shows that historically, while the actual events of the Battle of the Waxhaws were presented differently according to which side was recounting them, the story of Tarleton's atrocities at Waxhaws and on other occasions became a rallying cry, particularly at the [[Battle of King's Mountain]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Ben|title=The Rhetoric of Revenge: Atrocity and Identity in Revolutionary Carolinas|journal=Journal of Backcountry Studies|volume=5 |issue=2 |year=2010|url=http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ojs/index.php/jbc/article/viewFile/102/84|access-date=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The tales of Tarleton's atrocities were a part of standard U.S. accounts of the war and were described by [[Washington Irving]] and by Christopher Ward in his 1952 history, ''The War of the Revolution'', where Tarleton is described as \"cold-hearted, vindictive, and utterly ruthless. He wrote his name in letters of blood all across the history of the war in the South.\"<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 17</ref> Not until Anthony Scotti's 2002 book, ''Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton'', were Tarleton's actions fully reexamined. Scotti challenged the factual accounts of atrocities and stressed the \"propaganda value that such stories held for the Americans both during and after the war\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Scotti, Anthony Jr. |title=Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton|location=Boise, MD|publisher=Heritage Books|date=July 2002|isbn=978-0788420993}}</ref> Scotti's book, however, did not come out until two years after ''The Patriot''. Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself.<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in [[Leintwardine]], [[Herefordshire]], England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended. He outlived Col. [[Francis Marion]] who died in 1795, by 38 years. Before his death,  Tarleton had achieved the military rank of [[General]], equal to that held by the overall British Commanders during the American Revolution, and became a [[baronet]] and a member of the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\n\n===Depiction of atrocities in the Revolutionary War===\n''The Patriot'' was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], including the killing of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and wounded soldiers and burning a church filled with townsfolk. While atrocities occurred during the war, the most striking of the film's depictions of British atrocities\u2014the burning of a church full of unarmed colonial civilians\u2014had virtually no factual basis nor parallel in the American or European 18th century wars, with the exception of the [[Massacre at Lucs-sur-Boulogne]] ([[:fr:Massacre des Lucs-sur-Boulogne|fr]]) in 1794, which was a purely French affair with no connection to British troops nor the American Revolution. The ''[[New York Post]]'' film critic [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at [[Salon.com]]:\n\n<blockquote>The most disturbing thing about ''The Patriot'' is not just that German director [[Roland Emmerich]] (director of'' [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]])'' and his screenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops in the [[Normandy landings]] from his script for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'') depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to [[war crime]]s carried out by German troops\u2014particularly the [[SS]] in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda... They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour]]\u2014and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters... So it's no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of [[blood libel]] against the British people.<ref>Jonathan Foreman, [http://www.salon.com/2000/07/03/patriot_3/ 'The Nazis, er, the Redcoats are coming!'], Salon.com, July 3, 2000. Retrieved October 2, 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' film critic [[Stephen Hunter]], a historian of the era, said: \"Any image of the American Revolution which represents you Brits as Nazis and us as gentle folk is almost certainly wrong. It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that is something that I am afraid has been lost to history....[T]he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Ben |title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=June 19, 2000 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html}}</ref> The historian Richard F.
