It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega and composer [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]].\n\nThe film centres on a teenage [[street gang]] who have to defend themselves from predatory [[alien invader]]s on a [[Council house|council estate]] in [[South London]] on [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office but received a positive critical reception, with particular praise for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance. It also received several international accolades.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/movies/attack-the-block-review.html|title=Inner City vs. Outer Space|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis|date=28 July 2011|access-date=11 August 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|archive-date=5 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605020627/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/movies/attack-the-block-review.html|url-status=live}}</ref> A sequel is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Guy Fawkes Night]], trainee [[nurse]] Samantha Adams (Jodie Whittaker) is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard) and leader Moses (John Boyega). When a [[meteorite]] falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a dog-sized alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer Ron (Nick Frost) and his boss Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), a local gang leader.\n\nMore objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger and more threatening. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman.\n\nThe gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, a [[High-rise building|tower block]], but are attacked by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide and Pest is bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a [[samurai sword]]. Realizing that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.\n\nThe gang moves upstairs to the flat (apartment) owned by Tia (Danielle Vitalis), Dimples (Paige Meade), Dionna and Gloria, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and [[Decapitation|decapitating]] Dennis. The girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen attack the gang, but an alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift; only Hi-Hatz makes it out alive.\n\nMaking their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using [[fireworks]] as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find that Hi-Hatz is waiting for them there, who prepares to shoot Moses but he is then suddenly attacked and killed by aliens who break in through a window. The group flee and are joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a [[zoology]] student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nIn the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the [[ultraviolet]] light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like [[spore]]s, drifting through space on [[solar wind]]s until they chance on a [[habitable planet]]; after landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong [[pheromone]] to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species; Moses may well be carrying the female's scent (from the kill at the start) which may be attracting males to the block. Moses persuades Pest to return Samantha's stolen ring and together they form a plan. As Samantha has not been stained with the alien pheromone she can to go to Moses's flat and turn on the [[Gas stove|gas oven]].\n\nSamantha successfully bypasses the aliens and turns on the gas in the flat. She leaves the tower block, and Moses, with the corpse of the small alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas-filled apartment with all of the aliens following him. He throws the corpse into the apartment; with a firework he ignites the room and leaps out of the window. The resulting explosion kills all the aliens and leaves the high-rise flat in flames.\n\nIn the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers who had arrested Moses earlier. Instead, Samantha says the boys are her neighbours and they protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses; they both smile.\n\n==Cast==\nRepresentative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke [[Multicultural London English]] during the film) were young, relative unknowns and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.<ref>DVD \"making of\" featurette</ref> John Boyega found out about this film from an advert placed on the internet. The cast includes:\n\n* [[John Boyega]] as Moses, a low-level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.\n* [[Alex Esmail]] as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and loyal second-in-command of Moses's gang. \n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Dennis, a hotheaded [[pizza delivery boy]] and the enforcer of the gang.\n* Leeon Jones as Jerome, the most level-headed member of the gang and the most academically inclined. \n* Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a [[Dumpster|skip]] (dumpster) after he is cornered by the aliens.\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone.\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Brewis, a posh student stoner who is one of Ron's customers.\n* Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who is Ron's feared boss.\n* Danielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who is Moses's love interest and friend to the gang.\n* [[Paigey Cakey|Paige Meade]] as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang.\n* Sammy Williams as Probs, a child who wishes to join Moses's gang.\n* Michael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend, who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang.\n* Chris Wilson as arresting Police Officer.\n\n==Production==\n[[Big Talk Productions#Big Talk Pictures|Big Talk Pictures]], known for films including ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' and ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|Scott Pilgrim vs. The World]]'', produced the film alongside [[Film4 Productions|Film4]], [[UK Film Council|The UK Film Council]] and [[StudioCanal]].<ref name= \"BFI\">{{cite web |title=Attack the Block|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8dd444e3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715062204/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8dd444e3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 July 2012 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. The director wanted to counter the trend of '[[hoodie]] horror' films which demonised urban youths.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gallagher |first1=Paul |title=Cornish Nasties |url=https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/2011-04-28/18/ |publisher=The List |access-date=25 September 2019 |date=28 April 2011 |archive-date=25 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925134512/https://archive.list.co.uk/the-list/2011-04-28/18/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Cornish also based the character of the [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] Brewis on himself in his twenties.\n\n===Filming===\n''Attack the Block'' is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the [[London]] district of [[Stockwell]]. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:\n<blockquote>\nWe wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early on, and since we couldn't show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Location |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/location-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block Minisite |publisher=Film 4 |access-date=28 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe name Wyndham Tower appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional [[High-rise building|tower block]], referencing the English science-fiction writer [[John Wyndham]]. (Wyndham's 1953 novel,'' '[[The Kraken Wakes]]' '', similarly begins with aliens invading Earth from Outer Space.) The science fiction writer [[J. G. Ballard]] is also referenced by one of the housing estate street names, Ballard Street; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban tower blocks, including ''[[High-Rise (novel)|High-Rise]]'' where mayhem breaks out in a high-rise London apartment block.\n\nThe film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots<ref>{{cite web|title=The Look|url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block|work=Attack the Block minisite|publisher=Film 4|access-date=28 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212045710/http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block|archive-date=12 December 2011}}</ref> on the [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Elephant and Castle]]; Myatts Field, Brixton; [[Oval tube station|Oval Underground station]] and the [[Bemerton Estate]] in [[Islington]].

In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house Fido.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2011/06/09/creating-the-monsters-of-attack-the-block/#null|title=3D World magazine - Creative Bloq}}</ref> The creatures have no eyes and hunt and find mates using an extremely evolved sense of smell; their movement is enabled mainly through echolocation. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of [[dolphin]] [[sonar]] mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.<ref>DVD commentary track {{specify|date=February 2014}}<!-- time stamp? --></ref> Some [[puppet]]s were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical===\nStudioCanal's British distribution company [[Optimum Releasing]] released the film in the [[United Kingdom]] on 11 May 2011.
