[[Principal photography]] took place in [[the Bahamas]], [[Italy]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Czech Republic]], with interior sets built at [[Pinewood Studios]] and  [[Barrandov Studios]]. ''Casino Royale'' is notable for primarily featuring practical stuntwork as opposed to [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] placements seen in other ''Bond'' films.\n\n''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 16 November, and in the United States a day later. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig's reinvention of the character and its departure from the tropes of previous ''Bond'' films. It grossed over ${{Format price|616000000}} worldwide, becoming the fourth [[2006 in film|highest-grossing film of 2006]] and the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012). The sequel, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] operative James Bond gains his licence to kill and promotion to [[00 agent]] status by assassinating the traitorous Dryden and his contact at the British Embassy in Prague. In Uganda, [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], to [[Le Chiffre]], an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le Chiffre [[Short (finance)|shorts]] the stock of aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet using insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn Madagascar, Bond blows up an embassy in the course of killing bomb-maker Mollaka. MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Using information captured from Mollaka, Bond is led to corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios in the Bahamas, who had hired Mollaka at Le Chiffre's request. After winning his Aston Martin DB5 in a poker game and seducing Dimitrios' wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami and kills him, then chases down the new attacker Dimitrios has hired. Bond thwarts the destruction of Skyfleet's prototype airliner, costing Le Chiffre his hundred-million dollar investment. Surmising that somebody talked, he tortures Solange to death.\n\nTo recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre organizes a [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent protecting the $10 million buy-in. They meet their contact Ren\u00e9 Mathis in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money is missing, ambushes Le Chiffre but allows him to continue playing to win back the money, though Bond kills both Obanno and his bodyguard. Bond loses his stake as Le Chiffre has been tipped off about his own tell. Vesper refuses to cover the $5 million rebuy, but fellow player [[Felix Leiter]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, stakes Bond the money to continue in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody. Le Chiffre's lover Valenka poisons Bond's martini but Vesper rescues him. He returns to the game and wins. Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper to trap Bond, and brings them to an abandoned ship where he tortures Bond to reveal the password to the winnings, but Bond resists. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre, sparing Bond and Vesper.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and recovers with Vesper at his side. He has Mathis apprehended after revealing that Mathis was the one who tipped off Le Chiffre about his tell. Bond resigns from MI6 and he and Vesper run away to Venice. When M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realizes Vesper has betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where gunmen take her captive upon spotting him. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing it to sink into the Grand Canal. He kills the gunmen, but Vesper is imprisoned in an elevator. She drowns after locking herself inside to prevent Bond from rescuing her, while Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond, who has returned to service, the organization behind Le Chiffre{{Refn|Later revealed to be Quantum in the 2008 film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', which is itself revealed to be a subsidiary of [[SPECTRE|Spectre]] in the [[Spectre (2015)|2015 film of the same name]]|name=Spectre|group=n}} threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a double agent. When Bond denounces Vesper as a traitor, M deduces that she likely made a deal with White, trading the money for Bond's life. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, Bond checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. Shooting him in the leg, 007 introduces himself: \"The name's Bond, James Bond\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: A British MI6 officer newly assigned 00 status, giving him a licence to kill.

Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design / Casino Royale's Title Sequence|publisher=[[Framestore]] |url=http://www.framestore.com/#/Design/CasinoRoyale,TitleSequence |access-date=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the film, [[Chris Corbould]], the special effects and miniature effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".<ref name=\"Real\"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In the scene, Bond drives a [[Excavator|digger]] towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B G-BDXJ, which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0297.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org &#124; Ask Us - Boeing 747 in Casino Royale|website=www.aerospaceweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,<ref name=\"Real\"/> with tank consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal.
