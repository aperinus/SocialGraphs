Charlie's job as a [[Batman (military)|batman]] is to keep his boss and other high-ranking officers supplied with luxury goods and amiable Englishwomen. He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham, who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war. Charlie's pleasure-seeking \"American\" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the \"practising coward\" Charlie irresistible.\n\nProfoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the United States Army and its Air Force overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion. The admiral decides that \"The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor\". A combat film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a \"Tomb of the Unknown Sailor\". He orders Charlie to get the film made.\n\nDespite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Charlie and his now gung ho friend, Commander \"Bus\" Cummings, find themselves and a film crew on board ship with the combat engineers who will be the first sailors ashore. When Charlie tries to retreat from the beach, Cummings shoots him in the leg with a Colt .45 pistol. A German artillery shell lands near the limping-running Charlie, making him the first American casualty on Omaha Beach. Hundreds of newspaper and magazine covers reprint the photograph of Charlie running ashore, alone, making him a war hero. Having recovered from his breakdown, Jessup is horrified by his part in Charlie's apparent death. He plans to use the heroic death in support of the Navy when testifying before a Senate committee. Emily is devastated to have lost another person she loves to the war.\n\nThen comes unexpected news: Charlie is not dead but alive at the Allied 6th relocation center in Southampton, England. A relieved Jessup plans to show him off during his Senate testimony as the \"first man on Omaha Beach\", a ''sailor''. Limping from his injury and angry about his senseless near-death, Charlie plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth about what happened, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice. By recounting what he had told her previously, Emily persuades Charlie to choose happiness with her instead, and to keep quiet and accept his role as a hero.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[James Garner]] as Lt.

He said, \"I found the book, which is serious in tone, essentially a funny satire, and that's how I'm treating it.\"<ref name=chayefsky/>\n\nThe screenplay's theme of cowardice as a virtue has no parallel in the novel; in fact, the novel does not mention cowardice at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nThe screenplay implies, but never explicitly explains, what is meant by the term \"Americanization.\" The novel uses \"Americanized\" to refer to a woman who accepts, as a normal condition of wartime, the exchange of her sexual favors for gifts of rare wartime commodities. Thus, in reply to the question \"Has Pat been Americanized?\", a character answers:\n{{blockquote|Thoroughly. She carries a diaphragm in her kitbag. She has seen the ceilings of half the rooms in [[The Dorchester|the Dorchester [hotel]]]. She asks that it be after dinner: she doesn't like it on an empty stomach. She admits she's better after steak than after fish. She requires that it be in a bed, and that the bed be in [[Claridge's]], [[Savoy Hotel|the Savoy]], or the Dorchester.<ref name=huie/>}}\n\nThis theme runs throughout the novel. Another character says, \"We operate [[Brothel#Military brothels|just like a whorehouse]] ... except we don't sell it for cash. We swap it for Camels [cigarettes] and nylons [stockings] and steak and eggs and lipstick ... this dress ... came from [[Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store|Saks Fifth Avenue]] in the [[Diplomatic bag|diplomatic pouch]].\" Emily asks Jimmy, \"Am I behaving like a whore?\" Jimmy replies, \"Whoring is a peacetime activity.\"<ref name=huie/>\n\nThe screenplay uses [[Hershey bar]]s to symbolize the luxuries enjoyed by Americans and their \"Americanized\" companions, but the novel uses strawberries.<ref name=huie/>\n\nThe novel briefly mentions that Emily's mother, Mrs. Barham, has been mentally affected by wartime stress, but she is not a major character. There is no mention of her self-deception or pretense that her husband and son are still alive. The film contains a long scene between Charlie and Mrs. Barham, full of eloquent antiwar rhetoric, in which Charlie breaks down Mrs. Barham's denial and reduces her to tears while insisting that he has performed an act of kindness. The novel has no parallel to this scene.\n\nIn the film, Charlie is comically unprepared to make the documentary film demanded by Admiral Jessup and is assisted only by bumbling drunken servicemen played by [[Keenan Wynn]] and [[Steve Franken]]. But in the novel, Charlie has been a [[public relations]] professional in civilian life, takes the assignment seriously and leads a team of competent cinematographers.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nIn a contemporary review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised Chayefsky's screenplay as including \"some remarkably good writing with some slashing irreverence.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=October 28, 1964|title='The Americanization of Emily' Arrives|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E7D91E3FEE32A2575BC2A9669D946591D6CF|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Americanization of Emily'' has a 93% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on fourteen reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 7.39/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/americanization_of_emily/|title=The Americanization of Emily (1964)|website=RottenTomatoes.com|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> In ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' magazine, Nick Schager wrote, \"Though a bit overstuffed with long-winded speeches, Chayefsky's scabrously funny script brims with snappy, crackling dialogue.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-americanization-of-emily|title=The Americanization of Emily|last=Schager|first=Nick|magazine=Slant|date=May 24, 2005|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> In ''A Journey Through American Literature'', academic Kevin J.
