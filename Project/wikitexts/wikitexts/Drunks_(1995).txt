At the same time, some were critical of the dramatic elements of the film.\n\nJay Carr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote: \"''Drunks'' isn't afraid to make its characters seem like people you'd run into on the subway. Most of the notes it strikes are convincing. We'll be hearing more from Cohn.\"<ref name=BOSTON/>\n\nGary Kamiya of the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' wrote: \"There's enormous drama in the stories told by the recovering alcoholics in this movie, but very little drama \u2013 except melodrama \u2013 in the movie itself,\" but also added, \"Still ''Drunks'' is worth seeing for its exceptional acting and the empathy it brings to the damaged lives of its courageous characters.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Kamiya |first=Gary |date=October 13, 1995 |title='Drunks' not quite up to a testimonial for AA |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/461775656/ |work=[[The San Francisco Examiner]] |location=San Francisco, California, United States |page=C3 |access-date=April 11, 2022 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrie Rickey]] of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote: \"Lewis, who resembles a debauched [[Al Pacino]] (if that's not redundant), is impressive in a dramatic turn. Likewise Wiest, Rollins and Posey, and likewise Spalding Gray... Yet while each character's confession is profoundly moving, Drunks finally lacks the cumulative impact we expect in a drama. Like a war movie in which an element of suspense is which character will be killed, the only element of suspense in Drunks is which character will backslide.\"<ref name=PHILLYINQ2/>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Although ''Drunks''...has its moments of staginess, the actors' understated characterizations go a long way toward keeping the movie from turning into a series of speeches. Mr. Lewis is especially impressive in the way he takes a role that many actors would be tempted to shout to the rafters and lets his panicky wide eyes convey the character's desperation.\"\n\nSusan Kirr of the [[Austin American-Statesman]] wrote: \"While the monologues (many of them improvised and shot in one long take) are often pointed and touching, others fall flat, showing the mechanism unfolding clumsily. After several of these confessions, the film starts to resemble ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', as one painful story after another is contrasted with an all-out attempt to break through and succeed.\"<ref name=NYT/>\n\n[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Allowing for a certain theatricality, ''Drunks'' is totally persuasive in its account of recovering alcoholics helping one another in a painful and often desperate struggle for sobriety. Although \"Drunks\" is an ensemble endeavor sprinkled with distinguished names, comedian Richard Lewis, in his first leading dramatic role, is undeniably its star and a commanding one at that.\"<ref name=LATIMES/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|drunks}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 drama films]]\n[[Category:1995 independent films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joe Delia]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
