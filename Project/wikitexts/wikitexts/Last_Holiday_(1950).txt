During a routine visit to his physician, he is told that he has a [[terminal disease]] and only a short time to live. He decides to spend his final days in an expensive hotel. Once there, he acquires friends and a love interest who eventually learn of his plight.\n\n==Synopsis==\nGeorge Bird (Guinness), an ordinary, unassuming salesman of agricultural implements who inexplicably speaks with a posh public school accent, visits a physician for a routine check-up and is told he has [[List of fictional diseases#In film|Lampington's disease]], a newly identified condition which allows him only a few weeks to live. He accepts the doctor's advice to take his savings and enjoy himself in the little time left to him.\n\nA bachelor with no family or friends, Bird decides to spend his last days at an upmarket residential hotel among its elite clientele. By chance, a salesman in a used clothing store has acquired two suitcases, covered with international labels. The cases are full of a deceased [[Lord]]'s bespoke tailored wardrobe that perfectly fits Bird. Bird acquires the wardrobe and luggage that give him the appearance of a wealthy gentleman.\n\nBird's unassuming attitude generates a great deal of interest among the hotel's residents because he wears the same expensive clothes as all the other guests. He is seen as an enigma to be solved, with wild speculations offered as to his identity and possible noble lineage. The hotel's housekeeper, Mrs. Poole (Walsh), guesses the truth, and Bird confides his secret to her. Bird quickly acquires friends and influence, falls in love (possibly for the first time in his life), sets wrongs to right, and is offered lucrative business opportunities. But these successes only serve to make him reflect on the irony that he will have no time to enjoy them.\n\nDuring a strike by the hotel's staff, Bird comes into contact with Sir Trevor Lampington (Thesiger), the doctor after whom Lampington's disease was named. He insists that Bird cannot possibly have the disease as he has no symptoms, and contacts the hospital to ask it to check. Just as the hospital discovers its error Bird enters and it is confirmed that he indeed was given the wrong diagnosis.\n\nOverjoyed, he is ready to begin life afresh with his new sweetheart, friends and business opportunities.\n\nIn a twist ending, however, he is tragically killed in a car accident on the way back to the hotel. He takes a shortcut through the sleepy village of Fallow End, where a man has just set his sick old dog down on the road to have a \u201clast sniff round\u201d before taking him to be put to sleep. Swerving to avoid the dog, Bird runs head-on into a lorry. Meanwhile, the hotel guests, having learned the truth about Bird's identity and misdiagnosis, are irritated that he has not appeared for a dinner celebrating his good news. As the evening wears on, most of them express their doubts about him, and one of them, Bellinghurst, concludes the meal with an arrogant, longwinded  \u201ctoast\u201d to Bird, who is presumably back in his place. In hospital, resigned to his fate, Bird tells a nurse to \u201cgive his love\u201d to all his friends at the hotel. Mrs. Poole silences Bellinghurst and shames the rest with the news that Mr. Bird is dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alec Guinness]] as George Bird\n*[[Beatrice Campbell]] as Sheila Rockingham\n*[[Brian Worth (actor)|Brian Worth]] as Derek Rockingham\n*[[Kay Walsh]] as Mrs. Poole\n*[[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Chalfont\n*[[Sid James]] as Joe Clarence\n*[[Jean Colin]] as Daisy Clarence\n*[[Helen Cherry]] as Miss Mellows\n*[[Muriel George]] as Lady Oswington\n*[[Esma Cannon]] as Miss Fox\n*[[Moultrie Kelsall]] as Sir Robert Kyle\n*[[Bernard Lee]] as Inspector Wilton\n*[[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan|Coco Aslan]] as Gambini\n*[[Heather Wilde]] as Maggie the maid\n*[[Ernest Thesiger]] as Sir Trevor Lampington\n*[[Eric Maturin]] as Wrexham\n*[[Campbell Cotts]] as Cabinet Minister Bellinghurst\n*[[Brian Oulton]] as Prescott (Bellinghurst's assistant)\n*Mme.
