It was directed by [[Paul Weiland]] and starred [[Bill Cosby]], who also produced the film and wrote its story. The film also starred [[Gloria Foster]] as the villain, and [[Joe Don Baker]]. The film was shot in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It earned several [[Golden Raspberry Awards]];  Cosby himself denounced and disowned it in the press in the weeks leading up to its release. It received negative reviews from critics and has often been considered to be [[List of films considered the worst#Leonard Part 6 (1987)|one of the worst films ever made]].\n\n==Plot==\nBill Cosby plays Leonard Parker, a retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] spy who now operates a restaurant. According to the opening sequence of the film, the title refers to the idea that this film is actually the sixth installment of a series of films featuring the adventures of Leonard with parts one through five concealed in the interest of world security. In reality, no Leonard films precede this one.\n\nThe theatrical release poster points out that Leonard Parker is, at the time of his reluctant return to action, coping with domestic issues:\n\n{{blockquote|His daughter is engaged to a man old enough to be his father.\n\nHis estranged wife behaves like she is younger than their daughter.\n\nAnd now his government has asked him to save the world. Again.}}\n\nThe film starts with Parker being called out of retirement by his CIA director Snyderburn (Baker) to save the world from evil [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] Medusa Johnson (Foster), who brainwashes animals to kill people. During the film, he infiltrates the International Tuna factory (Medusa Johnson's hideout), fights vegetarians dressed in bird costumes and \"horny\" bees, and successfully steals her mind control device. However, Medusa kidnaps Leonard's wife and blackmails the CIA into returning the device to her. Leonard then enlists laboratory rabbits to attack other CIA agents in an effort to regain the mind control device. Leonard again infiltrates Johnson's headquarters to rescue his wife, is captured and tortured by lobsters, but uses their claws to remove his restraints. Freed from his cell, he attacks Medusa's henchmen with \"magic meat\" he acquired from a [[Romani people|Gypsy]], frees the captive animals, and destroys the base using [[Alka-Seltzer]]. He escapes by riding an ostrich across the roof and, despite ostriches being flightless birds, he is flown to the ground by the animal.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Cosby]] as Leonard Parker\n* [[Tom Courtenay]] as Frayn\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Nick Snyderburn\n* [[Moses Gunn]] as Giorgio Francozzi\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as Medusa Johnson\n* Pat Colbert as Allison Parker\n* [[Victoria Rowell]] as Joan Parker\n* [[John Hostetter]] as Adams\n\n==Production==\nCosby says he got the idea for the film from watching ''Rambo''. He said he thought to himself \"Man, there's got to be a place for a hero who has to deal with a heavy who's got a bigger gun than he has.\" Cosby described the lead as a \"high-tech comic-book character.\" He said, \"I've put stuff in here for the women, I've put stuff in here for the kids.\"<ref>Bill Cosby makes the most of 50: [CITY Edition]\nWaters, Harry F. St. Petersburg Times 22 Sep 1987: 1D.</ref>\n\nAsked years later about his work on the film, director [[Paul Weiland]] recalled:\n\n{{blockquote|It was a terrible mistake. ... When anyone gets into that position (Bill Cosby's position of power in the 1980s), they are surrounded by sycophants and no one tells them the truth. But Cosby just wasn't funny. I couldn't tell him directly. I'd say it feels slow, and he'd say, 'You worry about construction, let me worry about funny.'<ref>{{cite news|author=Simon Hattenstone|title=Through slick and thin Paul Weiland, adman turned Hollywood film-maker, talks about stars, egos and his latest movie, City Slickers II|work=The Guardian|date=1994-09-22}}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie received overwhelming negative reviews.<ref>\n{{cite news|title=Cosby's 'Leonard' a Super-Inane Superspy|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1987-12-18|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-18/entertainment/ca-19771_1|access-date=2010-12-12|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709120346/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-18/entertainment/ca-19771_1|archive-date=2012-07-09|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite news|title=Confessions of a Film Masochist: Nothing Explains 'Leonard Part 6'-That's Why It's Fun|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1988-01-24|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-24/entertainment/ca-38089_1_leonard-part|access-date=2010-11-09|first=Chris|last=Willman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103145643/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-24/entertainment/ca-38089_1_leonard-part|archive-date=2012-11-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref> When the film was released in 1987, even Cosby himself said that he was so disappointed with it that he publicly advised people not to waste their money on it.<ref name=LATimes>\n{{cite news|title=Leonard RIP?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1987-12-20|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-20/entertainment/ca-29856_1_leonard-part|access-date=2010-12-26|first=Pat H.|last=Broeske|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119151239/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-20/entertainment/ca-29856_1_leonard-part|archive-date=2012-01-19|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] called it \"one of the worst movies of the year\" and strongly criticized the obvious [[Coca-Cola]] product placement in one of the film\u2019s close-up scenes, saying that Cosby \"ought to be ashamed of himself.\"<ref>''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]''.
