It tells the tale of two very different women in late-19th-century Mexico who become a bank robbing duo in an effort to combat a ruthless enforcer terrorizing their town.\n\nThis is the first film that Cruz and Hayek starred in together. It was a co-production among France, the United States and Mexico. Filming took place in [[Sierra de \u00d3rganos National Park]] in the town of [[Sombrerete]], Mexico, as well as in the Mexican states of [[Durango]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Sierra%20de%20Organos,%20Sombrerete,%20Zacatecas,%20Mexico|title=Filming Location Matching \"Sierra%20de%20Organos,%20Sombrerete,%20Zacatecas,%20Mexico\" (Sorted by Popularity Ascending)}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1890s Mexico, Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez ([[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]) is an uneducated, poor farm-girl whose caring father is being forced off his land by a cruel U.S. land baron named Tyler Jackson ([[Dwight Yoakam]]). Sara Sandoval ([[Salma Hayek]]) is the highly educated, wealthy daughter of the arrogant owner of the nearby properties, and has recently returned from Europe where she attended numerous grade schools and colleges in England, Spain, and France for several years. In one fell swoop, both Mar\u00eda's and Sara's fathers fall under attack by the baron, (Sara's father is killed, Mar\u00eda's is shot but survives) giving him free rein in the nearby territories. As an act of revenge, Mar\u00eda and Sara team up to become bank robbers, stealing and giving back to the poor Mexicans who have lost their lands.\n\nAt first, the pair's relationship is characterized by petty cattiness stemming in part from their different backgrounds, but under the tutelage of famed bank robber Bill Buck ([[Sam Shepard]]) they learn to trust each other. During their crucial training session at the edge of a cliff, the two women test their strength by hanging from a metal bar over a wide river. At the point of exhaustion Mar\u00eda tells Sara she cannot swim before losing her grip on the bar. Sara voluntarily drops into the river and saves her. The two women put aside their differences and agree that, while they are not friends yet, they can at least work together as partners. Mar\u00eda turns out to be a crack shot and, while Sara can barely hold a gun, she shows that she is an expert with throwing knives.\n\nAngered by the recent attacks by two women, who are now known by the public as the \"Bandidas\", Jackson brings in a specialist criminal investigator named Quentin Cooke ([[Steve Zahn]]). When Sara and Mar\u00eda learn this, they capture Cooke and seduce him to help them. He has already figured out that Sara's father was murdered and therefore discovers that his client is a criminal.\n\nThe trio embark upon bigger, more ambitious heists, during which Mar\u00eda and Sara compete for Quentin's affections. In a move to make the money they have stolen useless, Jackson moves the gold that backs the money on a train up towards U.S. territories. Midway, he decides to steal the gold, betraying the Mexican government. The Bandidas hunt him down, but when they get their chance to kill him, they decline to do so, feeling it would make them no better than him. Jackson manages to draw his gun and almost gets a shot off at Mar\u00eda but Sara shoots first, killing him. Quentin meets with his fianc\u00e9e, much to Mar\u00eda's heartbreak. She and Sara ride off into the sunset, their eyes set on Europe, where Sara says the banks are bigger.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Sara Sandoval\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez \n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Quentin Cooke \n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as Tyler Jackson\n* [[Denis Arndt]] as Ashe\n* Jose Maria Negri as Padre Pablo\n* Audra Blaser as Clarissa Ashe\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Bill Buck  \n* [[Ismael 'East' Carlo]] as Don Diego Sandoval\n* [[Edgar Vivar]] as The Bank Manager\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Bandidas'' earned $18,381,890 worldwide<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=bandidas.htm|title=Bandidas (2006) - International Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|website=Boxofficemojo.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> including $3,153,999 in [[Mexico]] and $2,380,000 in [[Russia]].
