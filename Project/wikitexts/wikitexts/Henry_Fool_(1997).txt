Set like previous Hartley films in less affluent parts of [[Long Island]], it recounts how the lives of a fatherless family are overturned by a mysterious outsider and how, as in ''[[The Unbelievable Truth (film)|The Unbelievable Truth]]'', expectation and reality again conflict.\n\nThe film won the [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|best screenplay award]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4910/year/1998.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916171849/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4910/year/1998.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-16 |title=Festival de Cannes: Henry Fool |accessdate=2009-09-30 |work=festival-cannes.com }}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Fay Grim]]'', was released in 2006. Another sequel, titled ''[[Ned Rifle]]'', was released in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nSocially inept garbage-man Simon Grim is befriended by Henry Fool, a witty rogue and untalented novelist just released from seven years in jail for attempting sex with an underage girl. Henry opens the world of literature to Simon, and inspires him to write \"the great American poem.\" Simon struggles to get his work recognized, and it is often dismissed as pornographic and scatological, but Henry continues to push and inspire Simon to get the poem published.\n\nHenry carries around a bundle of notebooks that he refers to as his \"Confession,\" a work that details aspects of his mysterious past that he one day hopes to publish, when he and the world is ready for them. Henry's hedonistic antics cause all manner of turns in the lives of Simon's family, not least of which is impregnating Fay, Simon's sister.\n\nAs Simon begins an ascent to the dizzying heights of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning poet, Henry sinks to a life of drinking in low-life bars as his own attempts at fame result in rejection, even by Simon's publisher in whose firm Henry once worked as the janitor. The friends part ways until Henry, trying to save an underage girl abused by her stepfather, kills the man and, helped by Simon, tries to flee the country.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Thomas Jay Ryan]] as Henry Fool\n*[[James Urbaniak]] as Simon Grim\n*[[Parker Posey]] as Fay Grim\n*[[Liam Aiken]] as Ned\n*Maria Porter as Mary\n*[[James Saito]] as Mr. Deng\n*[[Kevin Corrigan]] as Warren\n*[[Camille Paglia]] as herself\n*[[Nicholas Hope]] as Father Hawkes\n*Toy Connor as Teenager at World Of Donuts\n\n==Production==\n''Henry Fool'' was directed, written, co-produced and composed by [[Hal Hartley]].<ref name=SC/> He began writing the project in the 1980s, and spent years developing and fine-tuning it.<ref name=Gayne>{{cite web |last=Gayne |first=Zach |title=Interview: Hal Hartley And Aubrey Plaza Talk Ned Rifle |url=http://screenanarchy.com/2015/04/interview-hal-hartley-and-aubrey-plaza-talk-ned-rifle.html |website=Screen Anarchy |access-date=June 3, 2022 |date=April 6, 2015}}</ref> Significant writing took place in 1995, and Hartley realized that Henry would be the story's main character, rather than Simon.<ref name=Kohn/> Hartley wanted the story to incorporate current events, adding elements such as Congressional races and Internet censorship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dawson |first=Nick |title=Hal Hartley, Fay Grim |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/1264-hal-hartley-fay-grim/ |website=Filmmaker |access-date=June 3, 2022 |date=May 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe characters of Henry and Simon were partly inspired by the relationship between writers [[James Joyce]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].<ref name=SC/> [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']] was also an inspiration for the film,<ref name=SC/><ref name=Gayne/> with Hartley comparing Henry to [[Mephistopheles]].<ref name=SC/><ref name=Salon>{{cite web |last=Spitz |first=Marc |title=Hal Hartley's epic oral history: The \"Henry Fool\" trilogy, Parker Posey and the real sage of '90s indie film |url=https://www.salon.com/2015/04/03/hal_hartleys_epic_oral_history_the_henry_fool_trilogy_parker_posey_and_the_real_sage_of_90s_indie_film/ |website=Salon |access-date=June 3, 2022 |date=April 4, 2015}}</ref> Another inspiration for Henry was [[John Falstaff]],<ref name=Kohn>{{cite web |last=Kohn |first=Eric |title=Hal Hartley's Grim Family: An Oral History From 'Henry Fool' to 'Ned Rifle' |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/hal-hartleys-grim-family-an-oral-history-from-henry-fool-to-ned-rifle-63538/ |website=IndieWire |access-date=June 3, 2022 |date=April 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Salon/> while Hartley compared Simon with [[Kaspar Hauser]].<ref name=SC/> Hartley included gross-out humor, such as vomiting,<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Anthony |title=Hal Fool: The Push, Pull and Play of Hal Hartley, Part II |url=https://www.indiewire.com/1998/06/hal-fool-the-push-pull-and-play-of-hal-hartley-part-ii-82771/ |website=IndieWire |access-date=June 3, 2022 |date=June 19, 1998}}</ref> because he wanted the film to discuss serious topics in a non-academic atmosphere: \"I didn't want Henry and Simon to be wearing tweed coats and have Ph.D.s.
