It explores the careers and musical styles of prominent [[Rock music|rock]] guitarists [[Jimmy Page]], [[the Edge]], and [[Jack White]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=cannes2007&jump=story&articleid=VR1117985122&cs=1 |work=Variety |title='Loud' rocks guitar documentary; Davis Guggenheim to unveil film at Cannes |first=Phil |last=Gallo |date=2008-05-05}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]], and received a wide release in the United States on August 14, 2009, from [[Sony Pictures Classics]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film documents the varied playing and recording styles of guitarists [[Jimmy Page]], [[The Edge]], and [[Jack White]].\n\nPage's history with guitar traces back to his childhood when he played in a [[skiffle]] band. After desiring to do more than play pop music, Page \"retires\" from guitar playing to attend art school. He later revives his music career as a session guitarist, only to be discouraged by the realization that he is playing others' music and stifling his own creativity. At that point, Page begins to write and perform in the bands [[The Yardbirds]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page discusses the skiffle and [[blues]] music that influenced him at the time. For many of Page's scenes, he is seen visiting [[Headley Grange]], where several songs from ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' were recorded, and in one scene, explains how the distinctive drum sound from \"[[When the Levee Breaks#Led Zeppelin version|When the Levee Breaks]]\" was achieved from the acoustics of the house in which it was recorded.\n\nThe Edge's history with guitar traces back to building a guitar with his brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] and learning to play. In the film, he visits [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and recalls forming [[U2]] in his childhood. He also demonstrates his playing technique, in how he eliminates certain strings from chords, as well as his use of echo and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] effects to \"fill in notes that aren't there\". He also discusses his purchase of his signature guitar, the [[Gibson Explorer]], in [[New York City]] and the [[punk music]] that influenced him. In other scenes, he plays early demo tapes of \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\", discusses his inspiration for \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\", and spends time experimenting with guitar effects for the riffs to \"[[Get on Your Boots]]\".\n\nJack White traces his musical background to his childhood in a rundown neighborhood of [[Detroit]]. Living with two drum sets and a guitar occupying his room and sleeping on a piece of foam due to taking out his bed for more room for his music, White struggled to find a musical identity, as it was \"uncool\" to play an instrument and his nine siblings all shared a musical propensity. His strong interest in blues and [[Traditional music|roots music]] opposed the [[hip hop]] and [[house music]] popular in the predominantly Latino south Detroit neighbourhood at the time. White eventually finds a niche in a [[garage rock]] band called [[The Upholsterers]] while working as an [[upholsterer]], which paves the way for his future bands [[The White Stripes]] and [[The Raconteurs]]. White's philosophy is to limit and challenge himself in various ways to force creative approaches to recording and playing.\n\nThe touchstone of the film is a meeting of the three guitarists dubbed \"The Summit\". In these scenes, the three guitarists not only converse about their influences and techniques, but they also play each other's songs together, showing each other how to play \"[[I Will Follow]]\", \"[[Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground]]\", and \"[[In My Time of Dying#Led Zeppelin version|In My Time of Dying]]\". The film concludes with the men playing an impromptu cover version of [[The Band]]'s \"[[The Weight]]\" on [[acoustic guitar]]s.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Album ratings\n|MC=70/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/itmightgetloud?q=it%20might%20get%20loud |title=It Might Get Loud Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-08-14 |access-date=2011-01-31}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]''\n| rev1score = {{Rating|8|10}}<ref name=\"classic\" >{{cite magazine |title=It Might Get Louder |journal=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |date=February 2010 |last=Elliott |first=Paul|issue=141 |page=97}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Alexander2\">{{cite magazine |title=One Louder! |journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date=February 2010 |last=Alexander |first=Phil |page=77  }}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''\n| rev3score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"uncut\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/film/jimmy_page/reviews/13904|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101062220/http://www.uncut.co.uk/film/jimmy_page/reviews/13904|title=It Might Get Loud|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|first=Barney|last=Hoskyns|author-link=Barney Hoskyns|access-date=February 26, 2014|archive-date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:U2 Guitarist Edge leaves Bay St. Bistro to Tiff 08 Press Conference for It Might Get Loud.jpg|thumb|U2 guitarist [[The Edge]] on route to a press conference for the film at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]\nThe film premiered at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]], and played at both [[Sundance Film Festival]] and the [[59th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2009.
