The film follows Alex Hesse, an Austrian-American scientist who agrees to undergo a [[male pregnancy]] from a newly developed drug Expectane.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIES : High Atop Mount Goofiness : When it comes to taking an unlikely premise--say, a pregnant Schwarzenegger--and turning it into a blockbuster comedy, nobody's earned his stripes like Ivan Reitman. |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1994-11-20|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-20/entertainment/ca-65006_1_ivan-reitman |access-date=2010-12-02|first=Michael|last=Walker}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released in the United States the day before Thanksgiving on November 23, 1994, to mixed reception and did not match the box office performance of Reitman's earlier films starring Schwarzenegger: 1988's ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'', which also starred DeVito and Schwarzenegger as a comedic duo, and 1990's ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]''. Schwarzenegger and Thompson received [[52nd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominations for their performances. The film's theme song, [[Patty Smyth]]'s \"Look What Love Has Done\" was also recognized, going on to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\nAustrian research geneticist Dr. Alex Hesse and his [[obstetrician|OB]]/[[gynecologist|GYN]] colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast invent a [[fertility drug]], \"Expectane\", designed to reduce the chances of a [[miscarriage]]. With the drug unapproved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the colleagues are unable to test the drug and cannot continue their research. Head of the review board Noah Banes informs Larry that while the FDA denied human experimentation, the team has received a donation from geneticist Dr. Diana Reddin from the [[ovum]] cryogenics department.\n\nAlex plans to start over in Europe, but Larry suggests they can still perform the experiment, with Canadian firm Lyndon Pharmaceutical offering to fund them provided they find a volunteer. Alex questions the likelihood of a pregnant woman taking an unapproved drug, but Larry suggests omitting the volunteer's gender and convinces him to impregnate himself with an ovum codenamed \"Junior\".\n\nThat night, Alex dreams his potential offspring has his own face. As weeks go by, he complains to Larry of sore nipples, and chats incessantly about walks, massages, and naps. Contemplating fatherhood after watching television commercials, Alex breaks down sobbing. When the time comes for Alex to end the experiment and release the results to Lyndon Pharmaceutical, he continues taking the drug and decides to carry the pregnancy to term; initially annoyed, Larry agrees to keep it hidden. Alex develops a relationship with Diana, and reveals his pregnancy to Angela, Larry's ex-wife, who also happens to be pregnant with the personal trainer of [[Aerosmith]]'s child.\n\nDiana is stunned and angry when it is revealed that the \"Junior\" ovum is hers, and Banes attempts to take credit for the experiment. Disguised as a woman, Alex hides in a retreat for expectant mothers, blaming his masculine appearance on anabolic steroid use. Diana visits, telling him it does not matter who is pregnant because he is the father and she is the mother. Larry reveals the experiment's data to Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who agree to partner with them.\n\nAlex experiences abdominal pain from the start of labor, calling for Larry and Diana. As Diana rushes to the resort, Larry tells a fellow doctor to prepare for an emergency [[cesarean section]]. A hospital staffer overhears and alerts Banes, who summons the media and the University Dean, hoping to take credit for the world's first pregnant man. Warned by a colleague, Larry creates a decoy for Alex to allow a private c-section. When Larry arrives, the news media only see the pregnant Angela, discrediting Banes, who is fired by the Dean. Diana and Alex enter the hospital by the fire escape, and he has an emergency c-section. Sent to keep Angela company in the waiting room, Diana finds her in labor and becomes her delivery coach. Alex gives birth to a healthy baby girl, and Larry announces the arrival to Diana, who is assisting Angela with contractions. Diana leaves Angela with Larry and rushes to see the baby, whom she and Alex name Junior. Larry delivers Angela's child and they reconcile to raise the boy, Jake, as their own.\n\nOne year later, the families all go on vacation together and celebrate the birthdays of Junior and Jake. Diana is pregnant with their second child, and Angela mentions wanting another baby but not wishing to endure pregnancy again; they all try to convince a reluctant Larry to carry the child.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTADATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Dr. Alexander \"Alex\" Hesse \n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Dr. Larry Arbogast\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Dr. Diana Reddin\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Noah Banes\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Angela\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Louise\n* [[James Eckhouse]] as Ned Sneller\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as Willow\n* [[Welker White]] as Jenny\n* [[Kathleen Chalfant]] as Casitas Madres receptionist\n* Merle Kennedy as Samantha\n* [[Judy Collins]] as Naomi\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOriginally developed under the title of ''Oh Baby'', the film was announced during production of Reitman's ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' as a reteam for him and Schwarzenegger.<ref>{{cite news|title=  Warners preps for presidency  |last=Archerd|first=Army|date=May 7, 1992|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| url=https://variety.com/1992/voices/columns/warners-preps-for-presidency-1117862349/|access-date=June 26, 2021}}</ref> Emma Thompson signed to star in February 1994 following her Academy Award Nominations for ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' and ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Thompson inks for U's 'Junior' |last=O'Steen|first=Kathleen|date=February 16, 1994|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/thompson-inks-for-u-s-junior-118402/|access-date=June 26, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nFollowing the successful collaborations between Schwarzenegger and Reitman on ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988) which grossed $217 million worldwide<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990) which grossed $202 million,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kindergarten Cop|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kindergartencop.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s Leonard Klady predicted that the film, which opened the day before Thanksgiving, would be the biggest of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Junior|last=Klady|first=Leonard|date=November 20, 1994|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/junior-2-1200439307/|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref> The film was the biggest to open over the Thanksgiving weekend with a gross of $10 million in 3 days but was only placed fourth overall for the weekend with just half the gross of ''[[The Santa Clause]]''.<ref>{{cite web|website=Box Office Mojo|title=November 25-27, 1994|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1994&wknd=47&p=.htm|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref> In North America, the film did not perform as expected and only grossed slightly more than half its budget ($37 million<ref name=\"BOM\"/> vs. $60 million) but grossed a total of $108 million worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 39% approval rating with an average score of 5/10, based on 36 collected reviews.
