It was shot in the [[Chicago, Illinois]] area. The premiered at the 2001 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and went on to screen in limited release in the United States on November 16, 2001.\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Frank Sangster is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. His life takes an interesting turn when a beautiful and seductive new patient, Susan Ivey, comes to him seeking a [[root canal]] and a little pain relief.\n\nOn Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some [[Ibuprofen]] to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is [[allergic]] to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive [[pain-killer]] [[Demerol]]. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist.\n\nSusan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, claiming to have mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's [[narcotics]]. The next day, there is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of [[cocaine]] hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest.\n\nThat night Frank goes to Susan's hotel room to demand the empty containers, threatening that he'll call the [[police]] if she doesn't provide them. Once again, she overrides his initial intentions and seduces him, with the result that they have sex and he spends the night with her.\n\nThe next day at his office, Frank is confronted by Susan's brother, Duane Ivey having a violent scene, saying: \"Stay the hell away from my sister\" and \"I don't appreciate your threats\". Duane ends the conversation with, \"I don't ever want to see you again, because if I do, goddamn it, I'm gonna hurt you.\"\n\nThat night, Frank returns to Susan's hotel room and, assuming that Susan is the form he sees the bed, starts talking to her. The person under the blanket turns out to be not Susan but brother Duane, who leaps up and attacks Frank, attempting to strangle him. Frank takes scissors from a nearby desk and stabs Duane in the hand, impaling him and embedding the scissors. Frank flees, stopping off at a bar to calm down. On arriving at home, just minutes ahead of his girlfriend Jean, he finds Duane dead on the floor.\n\nPolice arrive on the scene to question Frank. Comically adding to Frank's distress and anxiety is actor Lance Phelps, a hack actor doing research for a role, and permitted by the police to question Frank at aggressive levels that cause Frank heightened discomfort. After the police arrive and depart, Frank tells Jean about the whole ordeal.\n\nA while later, Frank is arrested for the murder of Duane Ivey based on finding Frank's teeth marks on the body - that someone else put there after killing Duane. After Frank breaks free, all of Chicago is on the look out for him. He goes to his office in the night, only to find his brother Harlan lying dead.\n\nAt this point, it is revealed that Frank's girlfriend Jean is behind all of the killing. Jean had been conspiring with Harlan, whom she'd been having an affair with, to use Susan to frame Frank for selling drugs so she could take full control of the company she and Frank had started together. However, Duane came along with Susan, which was not part of the plan, and Jean ended up killing him, using Frank's dentures to make the bite marks. Unfortunately for Harlan, her plan was to eventually kill him as well with the shotgun to tie up all loose ends and make it appear that Frank killed him after Duane.\n\nRealizing he'll never be free without starting over, Frank pulls out all of his dead brother's teeth, as well as all of his own. Frank uses his dental skills to place his own teeth into his dead brother's skull, and then sets fire to the dental office with Harlan's corpse, replete with replaced teeth, left inside. Frank and Susan, now lovers, escape to France, where they live happily ever after in a little cottage on the countryside.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean's attempts to frame Frank fall apart. Unbeknownst to her, Harlan was playing with a medical video camera while he was shot and the recovered footage shows Jean firing the shotgun at the camera holder but fails to show it was Harlan who was shot. Therefore, the police wrongly assume that Jean shot Frank and arrest her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Dr. Frank Sangster\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Susan Ivey\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Jean Noble\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Harlan Sangster\n* [[Scott Caan]] as Duane Ivey\n* [[Lynne Thigpen]] as Pat\n* [[JoBe Cerny]] as Pharmacist Wayne Ponze\n* Preston Maybank as Melvin Gelding, DEA Agent\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Lance Phelps\n* [[Keith David]] as Detective Lunt\n* Len Bajenski as Trooper Jarvis\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nScreenwriter David Atkins wrote the screenplay while working in the dental practices of his father and brothers. \"I was looking for an everyman kind of character, and I just thought a dentist is a perfect everyman.
