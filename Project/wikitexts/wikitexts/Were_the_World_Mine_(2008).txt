Although now in his senior year, he is still persecuted by the aggressive [[rugby football|rugby]] team, on whose captain, Jonathon (Nathaniel David Becker), he has a crush. Timothy lives with his mother, Donna (Judy McLane), who is struggling with her son's [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and with getting a job, and his father who is not a part of his life.\n\nTimothy is cast as [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] in the senior production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. While reviewing his lines, he discovers the recipe for creating the flower [[love-in-idleness]]. Timothy uses the flower to have the [[Homophobia|homophobic]] town take a \"walk in his shoes\". The entire town is thrown into chaos as previously heterosexual community members fall in love with their same-sex friends, bosses, and co-workers: whomever they first saw after being sprayed by the flower. The school drama teacher, Ms. Tebbit ([[Wendy Robie]]), guides Timothy towards the question of whether his actions have caused more harm than good.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Tanner Cohen]] as Timothy\n* [[Wendy Robie]] as Ms. Tebbit\n* Judy McLane as Donna\n* [[Zelda Williams]] as Frankie\n* [[Jill Larson]] as Nora Bellinger\n* Ricky Goldman as Max\n* Nathaniel David Becker as Jonathon\n* [[Christian Stolte]] as Coach Driskill\n* [[David Darlow (actor)|David Darlow]] as Dr. Lawrence Bellinger\n* [[Parker Croft]] as Cooper\n* Brad Bukauskas as Cole\n* Reid Dawson as Russ\n* Alexander Aguilar as Taylor\n* Yoni Solomon as Bradley\n* Colleen Skemp as Becky\n* Waymon Arnette as Henry\n* Zach Gray as Ian\n* Julia Black as Crystal\n* Peggy Roeder as Cole's Mother\n* [[Paul Lisnek]] as a Newscaster\n}}\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"Oh Timothy\" \u2013 Jonathon\n# \"Pity\" \u2013 Frankie\n# \"Audition\" / \"Be As Thou Wast Wont\" \u2013 Timothy, Ms. Tebbit\n# \"He's Gay\" \u2013 Frankie\n# \"Were the World Mine\" \u2013 Timothy, Jonathon\n# \"The Course of True Love\" \u2013 Timothy, Frankie, Coach Driskill, Nora, Max, Donna\n# \"All Things Shall Be Peace\" \u2013 Ms. Tebbit, Timothy\n# \"Sleep Sound\" \u2013 Timothy\n# \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" \u2013 Frankie, Cooper\n\n==Production==\nThe film is a feature-length version of director Gustafson's 2003 short film, ''Fairies'', which also stars Wendy Robie.
