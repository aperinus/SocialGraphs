Every evening, the two meet to have tea and count the stars. This evening, Hedgehog is bringing Bear-Cub some [[Raspberry|raspberry-jam]] as a special treat. As Hedgehog heads out, a sinister-looking [[Eurasian eagle-owl|eagle-owl]] begins to stalk him.\n\nAs he walks through the woods, Hedgehog sees a beautiful white horse. As Hedgehog watches, the horse disappears into the heavy fog. Curious as to whether the horse will drown in the fog, Hedgehog decides to explore the fog for himself. As he travels into a valley, the fog is soon so thick that Hedgehog loses his way.\n\nBelieving that he has spotted the white horse, Hedgehog instead discovers a leaf floating down with a snail riding on it. Hedgehog tries to touch the snail, but it floats away and disappears. Another shadowy creature resembling an elephant appears. It is so large and frightening that Hedgehog runs away, only to be startled by a black bat. All the while, the white horse is seen in glimpses.\n\nFinally, Hedgehog spots the largest shape of all. Setting down his jam, he picks up a stick and pokes at the large shape to find that it is a hollow tree. Suddenly, he realizes that he has lost his jam and searches frantically for it, only to find himself surrounded by the owl, the bat, and the shadowy elephant. He becomes more and more confused and frightened until a friendly dog emerges from the fog and returns the jam to Hedgehog.\n\nHedgehog attempts to find a way out of the fog, but falls into a river. He is resigned to let the river take him where it will, but a mysterious voice asks what is wrong. The voice (implied to belong to a fish) takes Hedgehog to shore, where Hedgehog finds himself back in the woods, free from fog. Hedgehog thanks his rescuer.\n\nResuming his journey, Hedgehog runs into Bear-Cub (voiced by [[Vyacheslav Nevinny]]), who has been searching for his friend. At first, Bear-Cub scolds Hedgehog for being so late that the tea has gone cold and the fire has burned down, but eventually, Bear-Cub admits that he was worried that something ill had become of Hedgehog and that there would be no-one with whom to watch the stars.\n\nThe two friends sit by the fire and drink their tea. Bear-Cub talks on and on about how glad he is to have found his friend, but Hedgehog stares in silence at the stars, wondering what became of the white horse.<ref>{{cite book|author=Maureen Thomas,Fran\u00e7ois Penz|title=Architectures of Illusion: From Motion Pictures to Navigable Interactive Environments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yyqK3iMgHQC&q=Hedgehog+Fog+Norstein&pg=PT76|year=2003|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-841-50045-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Whitehead|title=Animation: The Pocket Essential Guide|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wH0CQAAQBAJ&q=Hedgehog+Fog+Norstein&pg=PA113|year=2004|publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD - ROW|isbn=978-1-848-39836-8}}</ref>\n\n== Creators ==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0401\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0437 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \"\u0401\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u0442\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435\".jpg|thumb|Hedgehog in Kyiv]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
