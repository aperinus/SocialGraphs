The film is based on both the autobiography [[Before Night Falls|of the same name]] by [[Reinaldo Arenas]]\u2014published in English in 1993<ref>[http://www.cinetropic.com/before/index.html Before Night Falls] cinetropic.com.</ref>\u2014as well as [[Jana Bokov\u00e1]]'s 1990 documentary ''Havana''.\n\nThe screenplay was co-written by Schnabel, L\u00e1zaro G\u00f3mez Carriles and Cunningham O'Keefe. The film stars [[Javier Bardem]] (his international film debut, and who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]), [[Johnny Depp]], [[Olivier Martinez]], [[Andrea Di Stefano]], [[Santiago Magill]] and [[Michael Wincott]]. The film had its world premiere at the 2000 [[Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the film, Arenas is born in [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] in 1943 and raised by his single mother and her parents, who soon move the entire family to [[Holgu\u00edn]]. After moving to [[Havana]] in the 1960s to continue his studies, Reinaldo begins to explore his ambitions, as well as his [[Homosexuality|sexuality]]. After receiving an honorary mention in a writing contest, Arenas is offered the chance to publish his first work. Through his work and friendships with other openly gay men (such as Pepe Malas and Tomas Diego), Arenas manages to find himself.\n\nThe political climate in Cuba becomes increasingly dangerous, and in the early 1970s Arenas is arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting minors, and for publishing abroad without official consent. In the next decade, he is in and out of prison, attempting and failing to leave the country several times.\n\nIn 1980, Arenas finally leaves Cuba for the United States, starting a new life with his close friend Lazaro Gomez Carriles. A few years later, Arenas is diagnosed with [[AIDS]], and after spending several years suffering he dies in 1990.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as [[Reinaldo Arenas]]\n* [[Olivier Martinez]] as L\u00e1zaro G\u00f3mez Carriles\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Bon Bon / Lt.
