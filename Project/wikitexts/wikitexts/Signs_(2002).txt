Night Shyamalan]] and produced by Shyamalan, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Sam Mercer]]. The film was produced by [[Blinding Edge Pictures]] and [[The Kennedy/Marshall Company]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Touchstone Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Touchstone Home Entertainment]] in home media format. Its story focuses on a former [[Episcopal priest#Anglican or Episcopalian|Episcopal priest]] named Graham Hess, played by [[Mel Gibson]], who discovers a series of [[crop circle]]s in his cornfield and that the phenomenon is a result of [[extraterrestrial life]]. It also stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Rory Culkin]], and [[Abigail Breslin]]. ''Signs'' explores the themes of faith, kinship, and extraterrestrials.<ref name=\"Film\">[[M. Night Shyamalan|Shyamalan, M. Night]] (Director). (2002). ''Signs'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Touchstone Pictures]].</ref>\n\nFollowing its premiere in theatres nationwide on August 2, 2002, the film grossed $227,966,634 in domestic ticket receipts screening at 3,453 theatres during its widest release. It earned an additional $180,281,283 in business through international release, to top out at a combined $408,247,917 in gross revenue. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including those from the [[Online Film Critics Society]] and the [[8th Empire Awards|Empire Awards]]. The film also won an award from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]. Considering its $72 million budget costs, the film was considered a strong financial success after its theatrical run, and was met with positive reviews from critics, with many praising its atmosphere, cinematography, score, and story but others criticizing aspects of the script. The high-definition Blu-ray Disc edition of the film featuring the director's audio commentary, the making of the film, and deleted scenes was released in the United States on June 3, 2008. The original motion picture soundtrack, which was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], was released on the opening day by the [[Hollywood Records]] label.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nFormer [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest Graham Hess lives on a [[rural]] farm in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]] with his [[asthma]]tic preteen son, Morgan, and young daughter, Bo. Graham's younger brother Merrill, a failed minor league baseball player, has been helping the family since Graham's wife Colleen died in a traffic accident six months earlier. Graham abandoned the church in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nWhen large [[crop circle]]s appear in the Hess' cornfield, they are initially attributed to vandals. However, other crop circles begin to appear globally, and lights from invisible objects hover over many of Earth's cities. One night, Graham and Merrill chase a figure into the field, and Graham glimpses another among the corn stalks, followed by strange clicking noises broadcast through Bo's old [[baby monitor]]. To the family's continued terror, news footage emerges of what appears to be an alien creature.\n\nAfter receiving a phone call from Ray Reddy, the man responsible for his wife's death, Graham travels to Reddy\u2019s home and finds him sitting in his car outside of the house. Reddy expresses remorse for Colleen's death and warns Graham that a creature is locked inside his pantry. Believing that the aliens avoid water, he leaves for a lakeside. Graham enters the house and uses a kitchen knife to peer under the pantry door. A clawed hand emerges and swipes at Graham; he cuts off the fingers in a panic.\n\nAs the worldwide alien invasion begins, the family barricades themselves inside their house. When the aliens break in, the family takes shelter in the basement. Morgan has an asthma attack but survives the night. The family emerges the next morning after the radio reports that the aliens have abruptly abandoned Earth after it was discovered that [[liquid water]] is deadly to them.\n\nThe alien previously trapped inside Reddy's pantry enters the house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen's dying words, Graham tells Merrill to \"swing away\" using his [[baseball bat]]. The alien sprays Morgan with toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken son as Merrill bashes the creature and smashes glasses of water at it; eventually killing it. Outside, Graham administers Morgan's medication, realizing that his son's constricted lungs prevented him from inhaling the toxins; an act that Graham attributes to the intervention from a [[God|higher power]].\n\nMonths later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal and Graham returns to the church.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Father Graham Hess, a farmer and former [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]<ref>{{Cite news |date=2002-08-24 |author=Ted Parks |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-24-me-signs24-story.html |title='Signs' Offers Plenty to Think About |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgprgU7x-sC&q=signs+2002+movie+mel+gibson+%22Episcopal%22&pg=PA12|title=The Blackwell Guide to Theology and Popular Culture|last=Cobb|first=Kelton|date=2008-04-15|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-77770-1|language=en}}</ref> priest.

William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review that: <blockquote>With ''Signs'', composer James Newton Howard again joins director M. Night Shyamalan for their third collaboration following ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. From his opening \"Main Theme,\" Howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful. He overloads his lower tones, employing eight basses, five percussionists, and even a tuba, but also uses a large string section for short, fast, repetitive figures meant to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. This is not particularly imaginative music, just good old Saturday afternoon scary movie fare, the only distinguishing characteristic about it -- consistent with Shyamalan's style -- that it is so relentless. There's just no let up; dread pervades every moment of the director's films, to the point of emotional exhaustion for some, and the score has to have the same uncompromising approach, which can make it a little hard to take when listened to all the way through.</blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n<!-- NOTE: when updating Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic ratings, you should also update the \"access-date\" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. -->\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 237 critics, with an average rating of 6.80/10.

Night Shyamalan's ''Signs'' is the work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air.

In the first, she sits with a toddler Morgan and baby Bo in a rocking chair while Graham watches. In the second, she dances with him. She hums the same tune in both scenes.\n* ''The dead bird'': With no sound, this scene shows Graham going back home from Ray's, and after a short time, a dead bird near the road (after supposedly hitting an invisible forcefield) is shown.\n* ''The attic door and the third story'': The longest deleted scene, it starts with Merrill finding out about the not-boarded attic door. Despite Graham's efforts to call him back, Merrill goes up the stairs and manages to hold the door by climbing up a chair and putting his hands at the door. Trying to help, Graham looks for a way to hold the door. He gets a tall shelf and places it under the door. Knowing this is only a temporary solution, Graham gets his family and takes them to the kitchen and puts some chairs at the door to hold the aliens out of the room. There, he tells the \"third story\", about Merrill, in which he dislocated his arm. While Graham is telling the story, the shelf is destroyed from the attic door slamming on top of it repeatedly and the aliens gain access to the house. Everyone goes down to the basement, the only safe room available, as the aliens begin forcing the kitchen door open.\n\nIt was the second top DVD [[video rental]] in the United States during the first quarter of 2003, earning {{US$|34,700,000|long=no|2003|round=-6}} in US DVD rental revenue by March 2003.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kipnis |first1=Jill |title=Home Video: Rental Spending Up 8% In Q1 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=26 April 2003 |volume=115 |issue=17 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44 |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]] |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[List of films featuring extraterrestrials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Signs_(film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0286106|Signs}}\n* {{Allmovie title|263250|Signs}}\n\n{{M.
