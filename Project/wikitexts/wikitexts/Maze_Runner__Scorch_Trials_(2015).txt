The film is the sequel to the 2014 film ''[[The Maze Runner (film)|The Maze Runner]]'' and the second installment in [[Maze Runner (film series)|''The Maze Runner'' film series]]. It was directed by [[Wes Ball]], with a screenplay by [[T.S. Nowlin]]. Adding to the original film's cast of [[Dylan O'Brien]], [[Kaya Scodelario]], [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], [[Dexter Darden]], Alexander Flores, [[Ki Hong Lee]], and [[Patricia Clarkson]], the new supporting cast includes [[Nathalie Emmanuel]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Jacob Lofland]], [[Katherine McNamara]], [[Barry Pepper]], [[Rosa Salazar]], [[Lili Taylor]], and [[Alan Tudyk]].\n\nThe plot of ''The Scorch Trials'' takes place immediately after the previous installment, as Thomas (O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers have just escaped from the facilities of the powerful World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD), which had imprisoned them. On the run in the desert and ruined cities, they must escape WCKD soldiers and face the perils of the Scorch, a desolate landscape filled with dangerous obstacles. Filming began in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on October 27, 2014, and officially concluded on January 27, 2015.\n\n''Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials'' was released in select international territories starting September 9, 2015, in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[4DX]] and [[Barco Escape]], and was released on September 18, 2015, in the United States in 2D and premium large-format theaters by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was originally set to be released in [[IMAX]], but this was canceled, except Japan (converted to 3D), as ''[[Everest (2015 film)|Everest]]'' had all worldwide IMAX screens booked until the release of the film ''[[The Walk (2015 film)|The Walk]]''. ''The Scorch Trials'' received mixed reviews: some commended its action sequences and performances; others criticized the film for its lack of plot and character advancement. Like its predecessor, the film was a commercial success grossing $30.3&nbsp; million on its opening weekend, making it the ninth-highest grossing debut in September.<ref name=\" BOM\" /> The film went to the number one spot at the box office during its opening weekend, and grossed $312&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nThe concluding entry, titled ''[[Maze Runner: The Death Cure]]'', was released on January 26, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nA mother drops off her scared reluctant son, Thomas, with the scientist Ava Paige and troops of the organization WCKD. Thomas and other abandoned children are placed in a walled maze in a place known as the Glade as part of its scientific testing.\n\nYears later, shortly after being rescued from the Maze, Thomas and the remaining Gladers (Teresa, Newt, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Jack) are taken to a facility run by Mr. Janson. He says that the facility is a haven protecting them from the Flare virus and the \"Cranks\", and provides the supplies. Under Mr. Janson's care, they discover that they were not the only Gladers and that many more mazes were constructed, aside from their own. Thomas becomes suspicious of Mr. Janson and investigates. With help from Aris, the first maze survivor to arrive in the facility (from another maze), Thomas discovers that WCKD's leader, Ava, is still alive and that Mr. Janson is working for WCKD when they discuss experiments on the Immunes and that Janson has yet to find the Right Arm, a resistance group in the mountains. The group, including Aris, escapes the facility to the deserted outside world, the Scorch. Mr. Janson orders WCKD troops to track them down.<ref name=\"wiki plot\">[[File:CC BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] The plot description was copied from [http://mazerunner.wikia.com/wiki/Maze_Runner:_The_Scorch_Trials Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials] at the Maze Runner Wiki, which is licensed under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license].</ref>\n\nThe group arrives at an abandoned shopping mall and encounters the Cranks, humans zombified by the Flare virus. Winston gets infected by one of them. When morning comes, they find the city in ruins and the WCKD still searching for them. Winston's infection becomes worse, which forces the others to let him kill himself to prevent his transformation. While crossing the desert, the group takes shelter in the abandoned facility as a deadly lightning storm hits, nearly killing them all. Inside, they discover that it is filled with chained Cranks. The group meets Brenda and Jorge, who leads a dangerous band of survivors and have used the Cranks as guard dogs. Brenda and Jorge agree to take them to the Right Arm and abandon their group of survivors. Minutes later, WCKD, led by Janson, storms the place, only for the facility to be destroyed by Jorge's explosives. Thomas and Brenda are left behind, as the rest escape with Jorge. As Thomas and Brenda escape the Cranks, Brenda is infected. Thomas experiences a flashback of him and Teresa working for WCKD in which Thomas tries to warn Teresa of WCKD's plans, only for both to be separated by WCKD's troops. As Thomas and Brenda reunite with the rest of the group, Jorge interrogates Marcus, a survivor who secretly works for WCKD, into revealing the location of the Right Arm.<ref name=\"wiki plot\" />\n\nThe group eventually arrives at a road block, where several people shoot at them. As Jorge is about to activate a device, a woman asks him to drop the device, aims her rifle at him, freezes when she recognizes Aris, and reveals herself to be Harriet. She and Sonya take Brenda, Aris, Jorge and the Gladers to the Right Arm's outpost relief camps, where other immune survivors are present. Vince, who leads the Right Arm, greets them. As Brenda's infection gets worse, Vince threatens to shoot her, only to be stopped by Mary Cooper, a former WCKD scientist who reveals that Thomas was their informant, who has also helped the Right Arm take down WCKD's illegal major operations ever since. As Mary halts Brenda's infection by using an enzyme cure, Mary explains that the enzyme must be harvested from an Immune's body, not manufactured and that arguments over the methods of manufacturing the cure with Ava led to Mary's departure from WCKD. That evening, Teresa tells WCKD of her location since she believes that WCKD's motivations are good, which leads to an ambush by WCKD. Soldiers quickly overwhelm the Right Arm Rebels and line up the survivors in front of Ava Paige and Janson, who arrive in a berg (a very large aerial vehicle employed by\u00a0WCKD as transportation). Teresa explains to Thomas that she got her memories back from WCKD whilst with Mr. Janson. Mary is shot and killed by Janson, and WCKD troops take the immune survivors for experimentation, including Minho, Sonya and Aris. With only a fraction of survivors left at the site, [[Maze Runner: The Death Cure|Thomas plans to infiltrate WCKD]].<ref name=\"wiki plot\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dylan O'Brien]] as Thomas\n* [[Kaya Scodelario]] as Teresa\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]] as Newt\n* [[Dexter Darden]] as Frypan\n* [[Nathalie Emmanuel]] as Harriet\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Jorge\n* Alexander Flores as Winston\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Janson\n* [[Ki Hong Lee]] as Minho\n* [[Jacob Lofland]] as Aris\n* [[Katherine McNamara]] as Sonya\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Vince\n* [[Rosa Salazar]] as Brenda\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Mary Cooper\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Marcus (credited as \"Blondie\")\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Ava Paige\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nOn October 13, 2013, almost a year before ''The Maze Runner'''s release, it was reported that [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] had started work on ''The Scorch Trials''.
