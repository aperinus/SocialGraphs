Set in the [[Middle East]], it follows the attempts of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[General Intelligence Department (Jordan)|GID of Jordan]] to catch \"al-Saleem\", a terrorist. Frustrated by their target's elusiveness, differences in their approaches strain relations between a CIA operative, his superior, and the head of Jordanian Intelligence. The supporting cast features [[Mark Strong]], [[Oscar Isaac]], and [[Golshifteh Farahani]].\n\nThe screenplay, based on the 2007 [[Body of Lies (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[David Ignatius]], examines contemporary tension between [[Western world|Western]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] societies, and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. Principal photography for the film began on September 5, 2007 and concluded in December 2007.<ref name=\"Cinemaholic\">{{cite web|url=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-body-of-lies-filmed/|title=Where Was Body of Lies Filmed?|publisher=The Cinemaholic|date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> The film was shot largely on location in the United States and [[Morocco]], after authorities in [[Dubai]] refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes.\n\nCritics praised Scott's direction and visual style, as well as the performances of its two leads, but criticized his formulaic handling of the story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high-altitude spy planes. The film was released in the United States on October 10, 2008 and grossed $118 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nCentral Intelligence Agency case officer Roger Ferris is tracking a high-ranking terrorist leader called Al-Saleem in [[Iraq]]. He meets Nizar, a member of the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in North America.\n\nDespite the objections of his boss, Ed Hoffman, Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell; when Nizar is captured, Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent his exposing the identities of Ferris and his associate, Bassam. However, furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and Bassam go to search the safe house in [[Balad, Iraq|Balad]], Iraq, Nizar had told them about. Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter, but Bassam is killed in the explosion.\n\nMeanwhile, unknown terrorists in the UK plan to follow up on bus bombings in [[Sheffield]] with more attacks in [[Manchester]], but they blow themselves up when the police arrive at their house. Having recovered from his injuries, Ferris is assigned to [[Jordan]] to continue searching for Al-Saleem. There, Ferris meets with and negotiates a collaboration with Hani Salaam, head of the Jordanian [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]]. From the intelligence Ferris harvested from the Balad safe house, Hoffman locates an Al-Saleem safe house in Jordan and orders Ferris to watch it. Unbeknownst to Ferris, Hoffman organizes a simultaneous side operation via a local agency. Ferris' CIA subordinate, Skip, identifies the local agency asset as Ziyad Abishi.\n\nAbishi blows his cover with a terrorist from the safe house. The terrorist flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, and Ferris chases and kills him in such a place and manner that implies the death is a random robbery. Using back channels, Salaam corroborates this interpretation of killing with those who remain at the safe house. Ferris lambastes Hoffman for running side operations which he feels are interfering with and undermining the operational integrity of the primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for dog bites he suffered while eliminating the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha and begins developing romantic feelings for her. In Europe the bombers strike again at an [[Amsterdam]] flower market, killing 75 people and wounding hundreds more.\n\nHaving recognized one of the men living in the safe house as former small-time criminal Mustaffa Karami, Salaam takes Karami into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not co-operate. Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unbeknownst to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Skip to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Salaam \ncatches Ferris' associate Skip, accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, blames Ferris' duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house, and exiles Ferris from Jordan.\n\nFerris returns to Hoffman in Washington, and they devise a new plan to find Al-Saleem. Suspecting he is motivated more by pride than ideology, they stage a fake terrorist attack and set up Omar Sadiki, an innocent Jordanian architect, as its instigator, hoping Al-Saleem will come out of hiding and attempt to contact him. Al-Saleem sees TV news coverage of the attack and takes the bait. Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan and shares his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, although Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack. He is later found beaten and killed.\n\nFerris goes back to his apartment and discovers that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris' lies. Ferris offers himself in exchange to Aisha's kidnappers and is brought to the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]. At the exchange location, Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris.\n\nFerris is taken across the border to [[Syria]], where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, breaks two of his fingers, turns on a video camera, and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Salaam's security officer.\n\nSalaam visits Ferris in the hospital, and reveals that he had faked Aisha's abduction and orchestrated Ferris' capture by Al-Saleem using Karami as a go-between. Having lost the will to fight in this particular war, Ferris goes off the grid and goes to see Aisha again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Roger Ferris, a field officer working in [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA's]] [[Near East]] Division and later CIA [[Station Chief]] of [[Amman]], Jordan.\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Ed Hoffman, chief of CIA's Near East Division and Ferris' boss.\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Hani Salaam, intelligence chief and director of the Jordanian [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]].\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Aisha, a nurse in Amman and Ferris' love interest.\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Bassam, CIA field operative in [[Iraq]] and Ferris' associate.\n* [[Ali Suliman]] as Omar Sadiki, a Jordanian architect with very low-profile contact with [[Al-Qaeda]] and CIA's mole to catch Al-Saleem.\n* [[Alon Abutbul]] as Al-Saleem, head of an independent terrorist group based in Jordan, aligned with Al-Qaeda.\n* [[Vince Colosimo]] as Skip, CIA field operative in Jordan.\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Garland, a [[computer geek]] employed by the CIA to instrument [[Black Ops|black ops]].\n* [[Mehdi Nebbou]] as Nizar, former [[linguist]], Al-Qaeda operative and attempted defector.\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Holiday, Ferris' predecessor as CIA's Jordan station chief.\n* [[Kais Nashef|Kais Nashif]] as Mustafa Karami, former petty criminal-turned-Al-Qaeda operative under Al-Saleem who later became Hani Salaam's informer.\n* Jamil Khoury as Marwan Se-Kia, GID operative and security officer of Hani Salaam.\n* [[Lubna Azabal]] as Cala, Aisha's sister.\n* [[Annabelle Wallis]] as Hani's Girlfriend in Bar\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Ferris's Attorney\n* [[Giannina Facio]] as Hoffman's wife\n\n[[Carice van Houten]] was cast as Roger's wife Gretchen Ferris, but all her scenes were deleted and she does not appear in the final cut.\n\n==Themes==\nRidley Scott has made a previous film about the conflict between the Western and Arab civilizations, ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' (2005), set during the Crusades. ''Body of Lies'' resumes this theme in the context of modern intelligence operations and terrorism.<ref name=\"Mccarthy\">{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/awards/body-of-lies-1200471951/|title=Body of Lies|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 2, 2008|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film puts two contrasting characters on the same side. Ferris, the CIA man on the ground, is a dedicated Arabist fluent in the language; he relies on trust, local knowledge and [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]]. Hoffman, his superior, who is detached at home in Washington, D.C., and at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in Virginia, is more Machiavellian: he authorizes deceit, double-crossing, and violence by telephone and without scruple. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' interpreted him as \"a greedy, American domestic animal\u2014an advanced-media freak, always eating\".<ref name=\"Denby\">{{cite news|last=Denby|first=David| url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/13/good-fights-david-denby|title=Good Fights|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=October 13, 2008|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite news|author-link=A.

The terrorists avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak on the phone) and surveillance technology (high altitude spy planes offer a different point of view throughout).<ref name=\"Ebert\"/> David Denby of ''The New Yorker'' said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.<ref name=\"Denby\"/>\nDespite Hoffman's distance, the force and unintended consequences of his schemes are often borne by Ferris. The difference is underlined when Ferris, suffering weakened credibility, injured colleagues and personal risk, is reminded by Hoffman that \"we are a results-driven organization\".<ref name=\"Scott\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{rquote|right|It's about Islam, where we are and where we're not, and it's a very interesting, proactive, internalized view of that whole subject.|[[Ridley Scott]]<ref>{{cite news | title=Ridley Scott, the man who brought us Blade Runner, Alien and Gladiator \u2013 to name a few \u2013 is back, this time with American Gangster | work=[[Irish Independent]]  | date=2007-11-16 }}</ref>}}\nIn March 2006, [[Warner Bros.]] hired screenwriter [[William Monahan]] to adapt the novel ''Penetration'' by [[David Ignatius]] into a feature film, which would be directed by [[Ridley Scott]].<ref name=team>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117939610.html?categoryid=1972&cs=1 | title=Warner sets spy team | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=2006-03-12 | access-date=2007-04-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527162107/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117939610.html?categoryid=1972&cs=1 | archive-date=2009-05-27 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In April 2007, with the novel re-titled ''[[Body of Lies (novel)|Body of Lies]]'' and the film similarly re-titled, actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was cast in the lead role.<ref name=star>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Fleming | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962692.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=DiCaprio to star in 'Body of Lies' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=2007-04-08 | access-date=2007-04-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529185903/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962692.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | archive-date=2009-05-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref> DiCaprio chose to pursue the role because he considered it a throwback to political films in the 1970s such as ''[[The Parallax View]]'' (1974) and ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975).

Their previous experience meant they \"knew every stone in the desert\" and they were allowed access to many locations, including the Ministry of Finance, which was dressed as Jordan's secret service headquarters, Casablanca airport and a military airfield. The basketball stadium in [[Rabat]] was used as the U.S. embassy in Jordan: a CIA office set was built inside the stadium, favoured because its design allowed the cameras to shoot both interior and exterior vistas, thus showing the characters looking out on people and tanks passing in the streets.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> A nine-week shoot also took place at CLA Studios and in the desert around the city of [[Ouarzazate]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2007-09-08-487934708_x.htm | title=Russell Crowe filming in Maryland |work=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett Company]] | date=2007-09-08 | access-date=2007-11-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first=Ali | last=Jaafar | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975732.html?categoryId=1445&cs=1 | title=Moroccan studios having a mixed year | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=2007-11-09 | access-date=2007-11-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713095116/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975732.html?categoryid=1445&cs=1 | archive-date=2008-07-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Cinematography===\n''Body of Lies'' was [[Alexander Witt]]'s first credit as a [[Cinematographer|director of photography]]; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a [[second unit]] camera operator on ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]'' (1989). He shot the film in the [[Super 35]] format with [[Lens (optics)|spherical lenses]], and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the [[anamorphic format|anamorphic]] alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nScott is known for his skill at filming with multiple camera set-ups and ''Body of Lies'' used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, \"Actors like multiple cameras because they\u2019re always on-camera, so they\u2019re always in character and not wasting time off-camera.\" One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs.<ref name=\"Thompson\" /> Richard Cronn, the [[gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]], attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, \"Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for \u2013 he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he will cut it.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nIn line with the film's use of practical locations, the photography and design departments worked together to incorporate practical light sources such as \"lots of bare bulbs, lots of primitive fixtures\". In the climactic torture scene, filmed in an ancient, windowless prison cell outside of Rabat, they used only [[Diegesis#In film|diegetic]] light: two strong torches carried by the actors playing the torturers. It was filmed with three cameras and bounce cards were used to reflect light onto the actors' faces. Just a little smoke was sprayed in to augment the atmosphere but not dull the contrast.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nScott has used many gradations of lens filter in the past, but declined to do so on ''Body of Lies''. One obtains better finesse using the [[digital intermediate]] during [[post-production]] and does not risk losing light while selecting filters during expensive on-set time. The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and [[Morocco]] were allowed to show through.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nIn the film, images from unmanned aerial drones show the viewer the point of view of CIA commanders in Washington. These were filmed by John Marzano (Aerial Director Of Photography) using a helicopter mounted with a Wescam 35 on the nose of a helicopter, and Cineflex's V14 surveillance system, hanging from the side. Its 1\u201340 zoom allowed the filmmakers to fly very high and then zoom out of Ferris strolling through a market-place, creating the film's final shot.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Body of Lies (soundtrack)}}\nThe film score was composed by [[Marc Streitenfeld]], who has now composed music for Ridley Scott for three features.
