It stars [[Gordon MacRae]], [[Shirley Jones]] (in her film debut), [[Rod Steiger]], [[Charlotte Greenwood]], [[Gloria Grahame]], [[Gene Nelson]], [[James Whitmore]], and [[Eddie Albert]]. The production was the only musical directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]].<ref name=\"Chapin\" /> ''Oklahoma!'' was the first feature film photographed in the [[Todd-AO]] [[70 mm film|70 mm]] [[widescreen]] process (and was simultaneously filmed in [[CinemaScope]] 35mm).\n\nSet in [[Oklahoma Territory]], it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams (Jones) and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain (MacRae) and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry (Steiger).  A secondary romance concerns Laurey's friend, Ado Annie (Grahame), and cowboy Will Parker (Nelson), who also has an unwilling rival. A background theme is the territory's aspiration for statehood, and the [[Range war|local conflict between cattlemen and farmers]].\n\nThe film received a rave review from ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05E2DB1F3AEF34BC4952DFB667838E649EDE|title=Movie Review - The Screen: 'Oklahoma!'

In 2007, ''Oklahoma!'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-07-254/librarian-of-congress-announces-2007-film-registry/2007-12-27/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nGood-natured [[cowboy]] Curly McLain admires the beautiful morning while riding his horse to the farm of Laurey Williams, his secret love, and her aunt, Aunt Eller. At the farm he invites Laurey to a [[box social]] being held that night to raise money for a new schoolhouse. Frustrated that he waited so long to ask her, Laurey refuses his invitation. Curly tempts her by describing the surrey he plans to drive her in, then tells her he made the story up to get back at her for refusing him. Laurey gets her own revenge by agreeing to go with their menacing field hand, Jud Fry.\n\nCowboy Will Parker arrives by train from a trip to [[Kansas City]] and seeks out his sweetheart, Ado Annie, who, in Will\u2019s absence, has become smitten with itinerant peddler Ali Hakim. Will tells Annie that he has earned the $50 her father, a farmer who does not like cowboys, told him he had to earn before he would allow him to marry Annie, but he spent it all on presents for her. Annie tries to resist Will, but eventually gives in, leaving her torn between Will and Ali.\n\nThe townspeople gather at Aunt Eller\u2019s farm to refresh themselves before the box social. Gertie, a flirtatious woman with a loud, annoying laugh, flirts with Curly and upsets Laurey, despite her promises to not let his games bother her, and Curly flirts back to make Laurey jealous. Curly asks Laurey again if she will go to the social with him, but Laurey, fearful of Jud, refuses again. Curly angrily confronts Jud in the smokehouse, leading to each man firing their gun. Curly stalks off and Jud again threatens Laurey if she changes her mind. Uncertain what to do, Laurey uses a bottle of smelling salts she bought earlier from Ali, hoping to find her answer in a dream. She dreams that she marries Curly, but Jud eventually kills him.\n\nAs Jud drives Laurey to the box social, he tells her he is in love with her and tries to kiss her. She whips the horses, causing them to bolt. Once Jud gets them under control, Laurey leaves Jud behind and drives to the social alone.\n\nAt the social, despite the host's encouraging everyone to get along, Ado Annie\u2019s father belittles the cowboys, causing a fight to break out which Aunt Eller breaks up. Will makes his $50 back by selling his presents to Ali Hakim, who pays Will more than each gift is worth to get Annie back together with Will. When the auction of ladies\u2019 picnic hampers begins, Ali Hakim deliberately outbids Will to get Annie to forget her feelings for him and so Will can keep the $50 he needs to marry Annie. Curly and Jud get into a bidding war over Laurey\u2019s hamper. Curly sells his saddle, horse, and gun to raise enough money to beat Jud\u2019s highest bid and win. Laurey fires Jud after he confronts her and Jud sneers that she will never be rid of him. When Laurey tells Curly what happened, he offers to stay the night at their farm for protection, then goes further and proposes marriage, which Laurey accepts. Meanwhile, Will tells Ado Annie she must stop flirting with other men, despite not being willing to stop flirting with other women. Ali Hakim tells Annie she is better off marrying Will and then resumes his travels.\n\nWeeks later, Curly and Laurey are married. After the ceremony, Jud appears and tries to kill Curly, but Curly kills Jud in self-defense.  The townspeople hold an impromptu trial in Aunt Eller\u2019s kitchen where Curly is found not guilty.  He and Laurey leave for their honeymoon, admiring the beautiful morning.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gordon MacRae]] as Curly McLain\n** [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]] as Dream Curly (dancer)\n* [[Shirley Jones]] as Laurey Williams\n** [[Bambi Linn]] as Dream Laurey (dancer)\n* [[Gene Nelson]] as Will Parker\n* [[Gloria Grahame]] as Ado Annie Carnes\n* [[Charlotte Greenwood]] as Aunt Eller\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Jud Fry\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Ali Hakim\n* [[James Whitmore]] as Andrew Carnes\n* [[Barbara Jo Lawrence|Barbara Lawrence]] as Gertie Cummings\n* [[Jay C.

The original specification for Todd-AO involved running at 30 frames per second which made it impossible to produce 35mm (which ran at 24 fps) reduction prints from the Todd-AO negative. Therefore, it was simultaneously shot in the more established [[CinemaScope]] 35&nbsp;mm format to allow presentation in theaters lacking 70&nbsp;mm equipment. Hence, there are actually two different versions of the film comprising different [[take]]s.<ref name=\"Chapin\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> Director Zinnemann mentioned that shooting the film in both formats was a \"precautionary measure\", as the (converted ca. 1930s Fearless Superfilm 65mm) Todd-AO camera was still being tested during production.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nThe many actors who tried out for the role of Curly included [[James Dean]] and [[Paul Newman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacklistedjournalist.com/column67i.html|title='A MYTH-SHATTERING BIOGRAPHY OF AN ICON: THE JAMES DEAN STORY' by Ron Martinetti, The Blacklisted Journalist, Bill Bast, The Iroquois, Dizzy, Rogers Brackett, Actors' Studio, Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, James Whitmore|website=www.blacklistedjournalist.com}}</ref> According to TCM, Dean \"made a sensational [screen] test with Rod Steiger in the 'Poor Jud Is Dead' number\", but as his voice wasn't strong enough, [[Gordon MacRae]] was cast in the main role.<ref name=\"TCM Oklahoma\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/18550|0/Oklahoma-.html Oklahoma!], TCM.

[[Eli Wallach]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]]<ref>''Ernest Borgnine Interview Part 1'' ''Cinema Retro'' magazine</ref> were considered for the role of Jud before [[Rod Steiger]] was cast.\n\n[[Robert Russell Bennett]] expanded his Broadway orchestrations, Jay Blackton conducted, and [[Agnes de Mille]] again choreographed.<ref name=\"TCM\" /> Costume designer [[Orry-Kelly]] was hired to oversee the costumes for the film with [[Ann Roth]] as his assistant.\n\n=== From stage to screen ===\nRodgers and Hammerstein personally oversaw the film to prevent the studio from making changes of the kind that were then typical of stage-to-film musical adaptations\u2014such as putting in new songs by different composers. They also maintained artistic control over the film versions of several of their other stage musicals.\n\nThe film ''Oklahoma!'' followed the original stage version extremely closely, more so than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation. However, it did divide the very long (more than 45 minutes) first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs in the process.\n* Rather than beginning offstage, \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'\" was now sung as Curly (Gordon MacRae) rode his horse from the now-seen cornfield \"as high as a [sic] elephant's eye\" to Aunt Eller's farm.\n* \"Kansas City\" was sung and danced at the local train station where Aunt Eller (Charlotte Greenwood) and other cowboys meet Will Parker (Gene Nelson), who has just returned from that city. Also, a few lyrics in the song, about a [[burlesque]] [[striptease]]r, had to undergo minor changes to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\">[[Audio commentary]] by Ted Chapin and Hugh Fordin, [[CinemaScope]] version of film, 2-DVD 50th Anniversary Edition (2005), [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]</ref> In the original [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] musical, the character of Will Parker sings:\n\n: ''I could swear that she was padded from her shoulder to her heel.''\n: ''But later in the second act when she began to peel,''\n: ''She proved that everything she had was absolutely real!''\n\n: For the film, these were changed to:\n\n: ''But then she started dancing and her dancing made me feel''\n: ''That every single thing she had was absolutely real!''<ref name=\"Chapin\" />\n* \"I Can't Say No\" was sung by Ado Annie (Gloria Grahame) at a lakeside where Laurey has been swimming.\n* \"Many a New Day\" was sung and danced in Laurey's (Shirley Jones) bedroom, as the women, stopping over at the farmhouse on their way to the Skidmore ranch, change their clothes for the upcoming box social that evening.\n\nIn a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of ''Oklahoma!'', Jud attempts to get revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on after the wedding, rather than simply attacking Curly with a knife, as in the stage version of the musical. As Curly and Laurey stand atop the burning haystack, Jud pulls a knife and taunts Curly. The couple jumps down, with Curly landing on Jud and inadvertently causing him to fall on his own knife.\n\nThe film omitted very little from the stage production, cutting only two songs (Ali Hakim's \"It's a Scandal, It's a Outrage\" and Jud's \"Lonely Room\"),<ref name=\"TCM\" /> and thus ran two-and-a-half hours, much longer than most other screen musicals of the time. It was the first of the huge [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] musical films that would eventually overrun Hollywood in the 1960s.\n\n== Release ==\nMagna held invitational screenings of ''Oklahoma!'' over three days at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City starting on October 11, 1955. The official public premiere was on October 13.<ref>{{AFI film|id=51607}}</ref> The film was shown on a two-a-day reserved seat policy with three shows at the weekends and holidays and grossed $573,493 in its first 12 weeks in New York.

As with its 1960s telecasts of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', CBS felt that the film needed a host to introduce it, so they brought in [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[Anissa Jones]], [[Johnny Whitaker]], and [[Kathy Garver]], all from the long-running CBS sitcom ''[[Family Affair]]'', to serve as hosts. The four of them, rather than appearing as themselves, spoke their lines in character, as if they were still playing their roles from the series. Because the film was shown on a Thursday evening, it occupied the same time slot in which ''Family Affair'' was shown in 1970,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt|date=March 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314052510/http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt |title=Prime Time TV Schedule 1967 to 1983 Seasons |archive-date=March 14, 2008}}</ref> which explains the selection of the four actors from the show to host the film.

He is the cowboy friend who buys Curly's saddle for $10 at the auction\u2014and who also comments that, the previous year, Ado Annie's sweet potato pie gave him a \"three-day bellyache\" (Platt is credited in the cast list of the film as a dancer).\n* Besides Platt, dancer Bambi Linn, who portrays the role of \"Dream Laurey\" in the film, had also been a member of the original Broadway cast, in a role alternately called Aggie, \"Pigtails\", or simply The Child.  She was sixteen years old.\n* Magna Corporation, creators and licensors of the [[Todd-AO]] widescreen process, offered Rodgers and Hammerstein a substantial stake in the company to secure their cooperation. This explains why a later Rodgers and Hammerstein film, ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'' (1958) was also photographed in Todd-AO.  ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) was photographed in Todd-AO as well; however, before the film went before the cameras, 20th Century Fox, the studio that produced ''The Sound of Music'', purchased the Todd-AO process from [[Mike Todd]].\n* [[Southern Pacific 1673]] was painted up and outfitted with turn of the century colors and equipment for the \"Kansas City\" number. The locomotive was retired in 1955 and given as a gift to the city of [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] where it can be seen on display at the historic depot.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1955]]\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Oklahoma!
