G. Ballard]]'s [[Crash (Ballard novel)|1973 novel of the same name]]. Starring [[James Spader]], [[Deborah Kara Unger]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Rosanna Arquette]], it follows a film producer who, after surviving a [[traffic collision|car crash]], becomes involved with a group of [[wikt:symphorophilia|symphorophiliacs]] who are aroused by car crashes, and tries to rekindle his sexual relationship with his wife.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], where it received the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Special Jury Prize]], a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury (for example, the previous year, both a Jury Prize and a Special Jury Prize were awarded). When then-jury president [[Francis Ford Coppola]] announced the award \"for originality, for daring and for audacity\", he stated that it had been a controversial choice and that certain jury members \"did abstain very passionately\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title='Secrets and Lies' Wins the Top Prize at Cannes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/21/movies/secrets-and-lies-wins-the-top-prize-at-cannes.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 21, 1996 |page=C-11 |access-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-date=July 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717220141/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/21/movies/secrets-and-lies-wins-the-top-prize-at-cannes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> It continued to receive various accolades, including six [[Genie Award]]s from the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]], including awards for Cronenberg as director and screenwriter; the film was also nominated in two further categories, including Best Picture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://playbackonline.ca/1996/12/02/18483-19961202/ |title=Crash, Lilies top Genies |last=Armstrong |first=Mary Ellen |date=December 2, 1996 |access-date=August 4, 2020 |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]] |archive-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804204848/https://playbackonline.ca/1996/12/02/18483-19961202/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film's initial release was met with intense controversy and opened to highly divergent reactions from critics; some praised the film for its daring premise and originality, others aimed criticism for having such a strange premise filled with graphic violence. It has since developed a [[cult following]] among Cronenberg fans.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Film producer]] James Ballard and his detached wife Catherine are in an [[open marriage]]. The couple engage in various trysts but, between them, have unenthusiastic sex. Their arousal is heightened by discussing the intimate details of their [[extramarital sex]]. She recounts sex that day with a stranger in a prop plane hangar. She was, however, left unsatisfied. When James replies he did not achieve satisfaction during his sexual encounter with one of his coworkers, Catherine replies, \"maybe the next one\".\n\nWhile driving home from work late one night, James' car collides head-on with another, killing its male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, Dr. Helen Remington, the driver and the dead passenger's wife, exposes a breast to James when she pulls off the shoulder harness of her seat belt.\n\nWhile recovering, James meets Helen again, as well as a man named Dr. Robert Vaughan, who takes a keen interest in the brace holding James's shattered leg together and photographs it. While leaving the hospital, Helen and James begin an affair, one primarily fueled by their shared experience of the car crash. Attempting to understand why they are so aroused by their car wreck, they go to witness one of Vaughan's cult meetings/performance pieces, during which he thoroughly re-creates [[Death of James Dean|the car crash that killed James Dean]] with authentic cars and stunt drivers. When Department of Transport officials break up the event, James flees with Helen and Vaughan.\n\nJames soon becomes one of Vaughan's followers who [[Sexual fetishism|fetishize]] car crashes, obsessively watching car safety test videos, photographing traffic collisions, and recounting the deaths of famous people in road accidents. Catherine, whom Vaughan has followed in his car on several occasions, begins to fantasize about him and James having sex. Although Vaughan initially claims that he is interested in the \"reshaping of the human body by modern technology\", his actual project is living out the philosophy that the car crash is a \"benevolent psychopathology that beckons towards us\".\n\nJames drives Vaughan's [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln convertible]] around the city while Vaughan picks up and has sex with a prostitute in the back seat. A short time later, James invites Catherine on one of his and Vaughan's drives. On an interstate, they come across a car wreck involving Colin Seagrave, a member of the group, who had been planning to authentically recreate the [[Jayne Mansfield#Death|car accident that killed Jayne Mansfield]] with Vaughan. Amongst the wreckage, the three see Colin's bloodied corpse, wearing a dress and a blonde wig to accurately resemble Mansfield. Vaughan photographs the wreck as they pass by. Afterward, when police search Vaughan's convertible regarding a pedestrian hit-and-run, James drives it through a [[car wash]] while Vaughan and Catherine have sex in the back seat.\n\nJames subsequently has another dalliance with Gabrielle, another of the group members whose legs are clad in restrictive steel braces and who has a [[vulva]]-like scar on the back of one of her thighs, an injury suffered in a crash. Later, Vaughan invites James to visit a tattooist who tattoos car emblems on Vaughan's body. Afterward, James and Vaughan, both highly aroused, have [[anal sex]] in Vaughan's car.\n\nVaughan and James go for a drive in separate cars, aggressively pursuing each other. On an overpass, Vaughan intentionally crashes his car, landing on a passenger bus below, killing himself. After Vaughan's death, Gabrielle and Helen visit a junkyard, and affectionally embrace while laying in the wreck of Vaughan's car.\n\nLater, James and Catherine perform a similar stunt, with James pursuing her on a freeway at a high speed. Catherine unbuckles her seatbelt as she sees James approaching, and he rams into the back of her car, forcing it to topple down into a grass median. James exits his car and approaches Catherine's, which has flipped upside down. Catherine lays partly under the car, apparently superficially injured. When James asks if she is okay, she tells him she is not hurt. As the couple kiss and begin to have sex near the wrecked vehicle, James whispers to her, \"maybe the next one\", implying that the only possible result of their extreme fetish is death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Spader]] as James Ballard\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Dr. Helen Remington\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Dr. Robert Vaughan\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Catherine Ballard\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Gabrielle\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Colin Seagrave\n* [[Judah Katz]] as Salesman\n* [[Nicky Guadagni]] as Tattooist\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Grip\n* [[David Cronenberg]] (''voice'') as Auto salesman\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was an [[international co-production]] between the British company [[Recorded Picture Company]], and Canadian companies [[Alliance Atlantis|Alliance Communications Corporation]], [[The Movie Network]], and [[Telefilm Canada]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Magistrale |first=Tony |author-link=Tony Magistrale |title=Hollywood's Stephen King |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8XtCwAAQBAJ&q=crash+Recorded+Picture+Company%2C++Alliance+Communications+Corporation%2C+The+Movie+Network%2C+and+Telefilm+Canada&pg=PA219 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2003 |page=219 |isbn=1403980519 |via=GoogleBooks |access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Controversies===\nThe film was controversial, as was the book, because of its vivid depictions of graphic sexual acts instigated by violence.\n\nAt the Cannes Film Festival, a screening provoked boos and angry bolts by upset viewers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Powell|first=Betsy|date=October 3, 1996|title=Head-on crash with controversy: David Cronenberg's Crash is arguably the most provocative film ever to come out of Canada.|work=Vancouver Sun}}</ref> In a 2020 interview, Cronenberg stated that he believed [[Francis Ford Coppola]], the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, was so vehemently opposed to ''Crash'' that other jury members in favor of the film banded together to present Cronenberg with a rare [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Special Jury Prize]].<ref name=\"2020Cronenberg\">{{cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/q-david-cronenberg-reflects-crash-193408727.html|title=Q-and-A: David Cronenberg reflects on 'Crash' and the future of COVID filmmaking|publisher=The Canadian Press via Yahoo News|access-date=August 18, 2020|archive-date=August 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820153347/https://ca.news.yahoo.com/q-david-cronenberg-reflects-crash-193408727.html|url-status=live}}</ref> So great was Coppola's distaste for the film that, according to Cronenberg, Coppola refused to personally present the award to the director.<ref name=\"2020Cronenberg\" />\n\nThe controversial subject matter prompted ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' to orchestrate an aggressive campaign to ban ''Crash'' in the United Kingdom.
