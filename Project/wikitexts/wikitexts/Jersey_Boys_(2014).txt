The film tells the story of the musical group [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]. Original band members [[Frankie Valli]] and [[Bob Gaudio]] (who also composed the film's music) serve as executive producers.\n\n''Jersey Boys'' was released in the United States on June 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jersey Boys - Broadway |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/172856/clint-eastwoods-jersey-boys-movie-starring-tony-winner-john-lloyd-young-sets-2014-release-date |title=Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys Movie, Starring Tony Winner John Lloyd Young, Sets 2014 Release Date &#124; Broadway Buzz |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2013-11-05 |access-date=2014-06-24}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the musical numbers but criticized the narrative and runtime, and grossed $67 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --->\nIn [[Belleville, New Jersey]] in 1951, [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]] performs together with his brother Nicky, and their friend [[Nick Massi]], as [[The Variety Trio]]. He meets 16-year-old Frankie Castelluccio, a barber's son, already well known in the neighborhood for his singing voice. Frankie has the admiration of [[Genovese Family]] mobster [[Angelo DeCarlo|Angelo \"Gyp\" DeCarlo]], who takes a personal interest in him.\n\nOne night, the group attempts a robbery of a safe, resulting in the police later arresting them. In court, Frankie is let off with a slap on the wrist, while Tommy is sentenced to six months in prison. After his release, Tommy reunites with the group, and adds Frankie as lead singer. Frankie changes his professional name to Frankie Vally, and then [[Frankie Valli]]. At a performance, Frankie is entranced by a woman named Mary Delgado. He takes her to dinner, and they are soon married.\n\nThe group, now called \"The Four Lovers\", is in need of a songwriter after Nicky leaves. Tommy's friend, [[Joe Pesci]], tells him about a talented singer-songwriter, [[Bob Gaudio]], and invites him to hear the group perform. Gaudio is impressed with Valli's vocals, and agrees to join.\n\nThe band, having recorded several demos, attempts to attract interest, but has little success. One day, in [[New York City]], producer [[Bob Crewe]] signs them to a contract. However, they quickly realize that it only allows them to perform back-up vocals for other acts. Crewe says that the group does not have a distinctive image or sound yet. Inspired by a bowling alley sign, the band is renamed \"The Four Seasons,\" and they sing a new song Gaudio has written, \"[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]\", to Crewe, who agrees to record it.\n\n\"Sherry\" quickly becomes a commercial success, followed by two more, \"[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]\" and \"[[Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)|Walk Like a Man]]\". However, before an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', Valli is approached by mobster Norman Waxman, a loan shark for one of the other [[Five Families]], who claims that Tommy owes him $150,000. Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mob's associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommy's irresponsibility, not being involved in the group's decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group.\n\nHaving to tour constantly to pay off the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now ex-wife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her.\n\nA few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommy's debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francine's death by [[drug overdose]]. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, \"[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]\", becomes a commercial success.\n\nIn 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band performs \"[[Rag Doll (The Four Seasons song)|Rag Doll]]\" onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has gone on to become an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning actor (his award-winning role was a fictionalized account of [[Thomas DeSimone|another real-life gangster]] named after Tommy DeVito). Nick claims to have no regrets about leaving the group, enjoying the time he spends with his family. Frankie is still touring through his solo career, but yearns for the days he performed with the rest. Bob has retired to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  Frankie states that the best time he had during his time with the Four Seasons was before their success, \"but four guys under a streetlamp, when it was all still ahead of us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[John Lloyd Young]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Jersey Boys \u2013 Broadway |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/171426/tony-winner-john-lloyd-young-confirmed-to-star-as-frankie-valli-in-clint-eastwoods-jersey-boys-movie |title=Tony Winner John Lloyd Young Confirmed to Star as Frankie Valli in Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys Movie |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2013-08-28 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as [[Frankie Valli|Francis \"Frankie\" Castelluccio/Valli]]\n*[[Erich Bergen]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Jersey Boys \u2013 Broadway |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/171050/erich-bergen-confirmed-to-play-bob-gaudio-in-clint-eastwoods-jersey-boys-movie |title=Erich Bergen Confirmed to Play Bob Gaudio in Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys Movie |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2013-08-08 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as [[Bob Gaudio]]\n*Michael Lomenda<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/07/18/torontos_michael_lomenda_tapped_for_lead_in_jersey_boys_movie.html |title=Toronto's Michael Lomenda tapped for lead in Jersey Boys movie |work=TheStar.com |date=2013-07-18 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as [[Nick Massi]]\n*[[Vincent Piazza]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/boardwalk-empires-vincent-piazza-closes-deal-to-join-jersey-boys-1200583021 |title='Boardwalk Empire's' Vincent Piazza Closes Deal to Join 'Jersey Boys' |publisher=Variety |date=2013-08-20 |access-date=2013-10-17 |first=Justin |last=Kroll}}</ref> as [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Gaetano \"Tommy\" DeVito]]\n*[[Christopher Walken]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23431577 |title=BBC News \u2013 Christopher Walken joins Jersey Boys film |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2013-07-24 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as [[Angelo DeCarlo|Gyp DeCarlo]]\n*Ren\u00e9e Marino<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Renee-Marino-to-Play-Mary-in-JERSEY-BOYS-Film-20130816 |title=Exclusive: Renee Marino to Play 'Mary' in JERSEY BOYS Film |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |access-date=2013-08-16}}</ref> as Mary Delgado\n*[[Kathrine Narducci]]<ref name=\"broadway1\">{{cite web |author=Jersey Boys \u2013 Broadway |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/171405/broadway-alum-erica-piccininni-kathrine-narducci-join-the-cast-of-clint-eastwoods-jersey-boys-movie |title=Broadway Alum Erica Piccininni & Kathrine Narducci Join the Cast of Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys Movie |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2013-08-27 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as Mary Rinaldi\n*Lou Volpe<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1742044/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title = Jersey Boys (2014) - IMDb|website = [[IMDb]]}}</ref> as Anthony Castelluccio\n*[[Freya Tingley]] as Francine Valli (age 17)\n**Elizabeth Hunter as Francine Valli (age 7)\n**Grace Kelley as Francine Valli (age 4)\n*[[Mike Doyle (actor)|Mike Doyle]] as [[Bob Crewe]]\n*Rob Marnell as [[Joe Long]]\n*[[Johnny Cannizzaro]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Johnny-Cannizzaro-and-Mike-Doyle-Join-JERSEY-BOYS-Film-20130808 |title=Johnny Cannizzaro and Mike Doyle Join JERSEY BOYS Film |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as Nick DeVito\n*Donnie Kehr<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Donnie-Kehr-Joins-JERSEY-BOYS-Film-as-Norm-Waxman-20130731 |title=Donnie Kehr Joins JERSEY BOYS Film as 'Norm Waxman' |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as Norm Waxman\n*[[Jeremy Luke]]<ref name=\"broadway2\">{{cite web |author=Jersey Boys \u2013 Broadway |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/170982/joey-russo-and-jeremy-luke-join-christopher-walken-in-clint-eastwoods-jersey-boys-movie |title=Joey Russo and Jeremy Luke Join Christopher Walken in Clint Eastwood's Jersey Boys Movie |publisher=Broadway.com |date=2013-08-05 |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref> as Donnie\n*Joey Russo<ref name=\"broadway2\"/> as [[Joe Pesci]]\n*[[James Madio]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4moviefreaks.com/2013/08/28/jersey-boys-fim-update |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005021653/http://www.4moviefreaks.com/2013/08/28/jersey-boys-fim-update/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-05 |title='The Jersey Boys \u2013 The Movie' Update!
