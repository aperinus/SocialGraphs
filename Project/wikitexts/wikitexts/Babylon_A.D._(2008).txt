Retrieved on 7 June 2022.</ref> Russian mobster Gorsky (Depardieu) hires the mercenary Toorop (Diesel) to bring a young woman known only as Aurora (Thierry) from Asia to New York City. Gorsky gives Toorop a variety of weapons and a [[Subdermal implant|subdermally implanted]] UN passport. Toorop, the girl, and her guardian Sister Rebeka (Yeoh), travel from the Noelite [[Convent]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] to reach New York via Russia.\n\nUnlike in the technologically advanced U.S., war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous, overpopulated slums. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display [[clairvoyance]] abilities. On one such occasion, Aurora, seemingly for no reason, panics and runs from a crowded train station, just before it explodes in a terrorist attack.\n\nThe protagonists must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. Later, they board a submarine that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the Captain of the submarine orders his crew to dive and he shoots some of the refugees still trying to get on board. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seems to know things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor administered a pill. The doctor told her to go to [[New York City]] and arranged for Toorop to escort them.\n\nAfter arriving in [[Alaska]] with help from Toorop's associate Finn (Strong), the protagonists are attacked by weaponized [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]]. Toorop manages to destroy all the drones, but also gets wounded. These perils cause Finn to betray the group, so Toorop shoots him dead.\n\nOnce in [[Harlem]], a news broadcast about the bombing of the Kyrgyzstan convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new [[Salvation in Christianity|salvationist]] religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again in a hotel room. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a [[Virginity|virgin]].\n\nLooking outside the hotel, Toorop sees Gorsky's men and the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them on the street. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. Just before they take her away, Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups to get the two women to safety. Gorsky's men fire guided missiles at Toorop that track his subdermal passport. Rebeka gets killed defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop, saying, \"I need you to live.\" Toorop's [[clinical death]] causes the guided missile to go off target (missing Toorop) and explode near Aurora instead; she inexplicably survives.\n\nDr. Arthur Darquandier (Lambert Wilson) revives Toorop using advanced medical techniques, but several of Toorop's body parts are replaced with [[cybernetics]] to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he implanted a [[supercomputer]] into her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time to use her as a \"[[Miraculous births|virgin birth]]\". After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but he failed. Darquandier remained \"dead\" until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop.\n\nDarquandier uses a machine to scan Toorop's memory to find out what Aurora said to him before and shortly after shooting him. In Toorop's memory, Aurora tells Toorop to \"go home\". Toorop and several of Darquandier's men leave the facility. En route to Darquandier's lab, Gorsky calls the High Priestess, demanding payment; during the subsequent [[Videotelephony|videocall]] the High Priestess kills Gorsky by nuclear missile. The High Priestess confronts and kills Darquandier, but Toorop has already escaped. Toorop goes to his old house in the forest, finds Aurora, and takes her to a hospital, where, 6 months later, she dies after giving birth. Aurora was \"designed to breed\", not to live, so her death after childbirth was preprogrammed. Toorop takes care of her two children.\n\nIn a scene that is only present in the theatrical cut but was removed from the director's cut, the twins are shown to be one that looks like Aurora and the other like Toorop.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Hugo Toorop, a [[mercenary]] and a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] (full name is \"Hugo Cornelius Toorop\" in ''[[Babylon Babies]]'' novel). He is a professional smuggler from upstate New York, who has been deported to Eastern Europe where he does mercenary jobs as a smuggler. He's an expert in advanced weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, tactics and culinary.\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Sister Rebeka, a nun from an ascetic branch of the Noelites. She's originally from [[San Francisco]]. When she was 17-years-old, she joined the Noelites in order to escape an abusive relationship. She ended up in their Mongolian convent where she became Aurora's guardian.\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Thierry]] as Aurora, a young woman who's been given shelter by the Noelite nuns. Since when she was a child, she showed supernatural knowledge in all kind of fields and by the age of two she was already able to speak 19 languages. She can also sense danger.\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Gorsky, a wealthy Russian mobster who hires Toorop to transport Aurora to the United States on behalf of the Noelite Church. He owns a private army and lives inside an [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]] fitted like a limo, constantly surrounded by a convoy of his soldiers.\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the Noelite church. She does not really care about the religion, and only seeks power and wealth. She is planning to use science to produce miracles, thus extending the popularity and reach of her church.\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Finn, a Russian smuggler who's an old associate of Toorop's. He is ready to help transport Aurora across borders, yet Toorop doesn't entirely trust him.\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as Dr. Arthur Darquandier, Aurora's disabled father who was presumed to be dead.\n* [[David Belle]] as Hacker Kid, the leader of Darquandier's henchmen who are following Toorop and Aurora to America.\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Banner]] as Killa, an underground fighter.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ostrava-Poruba.jpg|thumb|Preparing for the filming in Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic]]\n\n===Development===\n[[Mathieu Kassovitz]] worked on an English-language film adaptation of [[Maurice Georges Dantec]]'s French novel ''[[Babylon Babies]]'' for five years;<ref>{{cite web |author= Anne Thompson |title= Babylon A.D.: Kassovitz on Warpath Against Fox - Thompson on Hollywood on Variety.com |url= http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2008/08/babylon-ad-kass.html |website= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914092024/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2008/08/babylon-ad-kass.html|archive-date= 2008-09-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> in June 2005, this project got financing from [[StudioCanal]] and [[Twentieth Century Fox]].<ref>{{Cite news |date= 23 June 2005 | first= Michael |last= Fleming |title= Fox beckoned by 'Babylon' |url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117924999 | work= Variety }}</ref> The adapted screenplay was written by Kassovitz and screenwriter \u00c9ric Besnard.
