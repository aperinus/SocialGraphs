The screenplay by [[Terry Hayes]] was based on the 1963 [[Dead Calm (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]]; the film represents the first successful film adaptation of the novel after [[Orson Welles]] struggled for years to complete his own film based on it titled ''[[The Deep (unfinished film)|The Deep]]''. Filmed around the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the plot focuses on a married couple, who, after tragically losing their son, are spending some time isolated at sea, when they come across a stranger who has abandoned a sinking ship.\n\nThe film was one of the final projects Nicole Kidman worked on in her native Australia before achieving mainstream international success with 1990's ''[[Days of Thunder]]''. ''Dead Calm'' was generally well received, with critics praising Neill, Kidman, and Zane's performances and the oceanic cinematography, although some reviewers criticized elements of the script for being too sensational and the film's ending ([[Warner Brothers]] requested that it be reshot to provide a less ambiguous resolution for one of the characters) for being too over-the-top. Modern reviewers have tended to assess it even more favorably, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' naming it one of the 1000 best films ever made.\n\n==Plot==\nRae Ingram ([[Nicole Kidman]]) is involved in a car crash which results in the death of her son. Her older husband, [[Royal Australian Navy]] officer John Ingram ([[Sam Neill]]), suggests that they help deal with their grief by heading out for a vacation alone on their yacht. In the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], they encounter a drifting schooner that seems to be taking on water. A man, Hughie Warriner ([[Billy Zane]]), rows over to the Ingrams' yacht for help. He claims that his ship is sinking and that his companions have all died of food poisoning.\n\nSuspicious of Hughie's story, John rows over to the other ship, instructing Rae to assemble and load the ship's shotgun, though she ignores this. Inside, John discovers the mangled corpses of the other passengers and video footage indicating that Hughie may have murdered them in a feat of extraordinary violence. John rushes back to his own boat, but he's too late as Hughie awakes, knocks out Rae and sails their yacht away, leaving John behind.\n\nAs John attempts to keep Hughie's ship from sinking and catch up with them, Rae awakens and tries to convince Hughie to go back for her husband. Hughie denies her request and keeps on sailing, alternating between kindness and bouts of rage. John manages to get through to his wife on the radio, but the water damage makes him unable to reply save for clicks on his ship's radio receiver. He can respond only yes or no to her questions. John assures her that he is following close by. Rae tries to stall the yacht by turning off the engine and tossing the keys overboard. Her dog jumps in to retrieve the keys and brings them back as he had done earlier with his fetch ball. Hughie starts the yacht back up and tries to convince Rae to be friends with him. Rae accepts, attempting to earn his trust. After a while, she goes back to the radar room to contact John. A blip appears on the edge of the radar's range, signifying the damaged boat. She soon learns that it is too far gone and will sink in the next several hours. With John unable to come to her rescue, Rae assures her husband that she will come back for him. John's radio shorts before Rae has a chance to tell him that she loves him. Unable to make further contact with him, Rae breaks down and cries.\n\nHughie comes down to see Rae sobbing, and heads over to soothe her. Rae formulates a plan to seduce Hughie and gain his trust long enough for her to get to the shotgun on deck. She and Hughie start to make out and undress on the floor. Rae stalls for time by telling him that she has to go to the bathroom. She runs on deck to assemble the shotgun, but Ben the dog follows her. Before she has a chance to load the gun, the dog starts barking causing Hughie to go investigate. In a panic, Rae leaves the gun behind and takes cigarettes down with her as an excuse for being on deck. She eases his suspicion by taking him to the bedroom where she buys herself more time by letting him have sex with her. Later, Rae fixes some [[lemonade]], and places a heavy dose of her prescription sedatives into Hughie's drink after noticing the bottle on the counter. Claiming to go get dressed, Rae heads back for the shotgun, and is discovered soon after. As a fierce storm approaches, Rae and Hughie come to blows. Hughie takes hold of the shotgun, but the effects of the sedative cause him to aim poorly and shoot the radio by mistake. Rae eventually takes hold of a harpoon gun and locks herself in the bedroom. As the door opens she fires off a harpoon. Seeing blood she pushes it open, only to discover she killed her dog. Hughie comes out of hiding to strangle her, but passes out from the drugs. Rae ties him up and sails back to rescue John. Hughie recovers consciousness and cuts himself free with a shard of broken mirror, but after making his way to Rae, she shoots him in the shoulder with a harpoon and knocks him unconscious. She then sets him adrift in the yacht's life raft and continues to look for her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, the damage and the storm have caused the schooner to sink almost completely. The storm intensifies and breaks the ship's main mast, trapping John below deck. The water rises and eventually he is submerged over his head, able to breathe only through a piece of pipe leading to the deck. The only way he can go is down into the schooner's hull, in search of an opening. He takes one last breath from the pipe and dives. Through a gaping hole in the bottom of the hull, John emerges back on the surface. He sets the wreck on fire to signal his location to Rae, who is now desperate to find him. Dusk sets in as Rae notices the flames and sets course to the faint fire on the horizon. Without any means to signal his wife, all John can do is wait on a piece of floating debris. After night falls, the pair reunite when Rae arrives and pulls John aboard.\n\nLater they find the life raft and Rae shoots it with a flare, setting it on fire. The next day they are relaxing on deck when John takes a break from washing Rae's hair to prepare breakfast for her. Her eyes closed, Rae feels a pair of hands begin massaging her scalp and assumes it is John, but when she opens her eyes she sees a bloody Hughie, who begins to strangle her. While Rae struggles, John arrives from below deck. Seeing Rae being attacked, John shoots Hughie in the mouth with a flare, killing him instantly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Captain John Ingram, [[Royal Australian Navy|R.A.N.]]\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Rae Ingram\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Hughie Warriner\n\n==Production==\nThe movie is based on the novel ''[[Dead Calm (novel)|Dead Calm]]'' by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]], of which [[Orson Welles]] had started filming an adaptation starring himself, [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Laurence Harvey]] titled ''The Deep'' in the late 1960s but never completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/50-amazing-unmade-movies/3/|title=50 Amazing Unmade Movies|last=October 2013|first=Simon Kinnear 14|website=gamesradar|date=14 October 2013 |language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Producer [[Tony Bill]] had tried to buy the rights from Welles but was never successful. He mentioned this to Phil Noyce, giving him a copy of the book in 1984. Noyce enjoyed the book and showed it to [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] and [[Terry Hayes]], who were enthusiastic. Miller managed to persuade [[Oja Kodar]], Welles' companion who controlled the rights to the novel, to sell the book to [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell|Kennedy Miller]].<ref name=\"stratton2\">[[David Stratton]], ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p263\u2013265</ref><ref name=\"phil\">Brian McFarlane, \"Phil Noyce: Dead Calm\", ''Cinema Papers'', May 1989 p6\u201311</ref>\n\nThe book features several other main characters (including Hughie's wife and survivors John finds on the Orpheus), and presented Hughie as a nominally [[asexuality|asexual]] manchild.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} It also goes into further detail about what caused Hughie's psychotic break.\n\nThe movie was filmed over a 6 month span in [[Queensland]]'s [[Whitsunday Islands]] beginning in May 1987. George Miller directed some sequences himself, including one where Sam Neill's character is tormented in the boat by a shark. This scene ended up being dropped from the final film. The sequence in which John kills Hughie with a flare was filmed at the request of Warner Bros seven months after principal photography finished. As written, the film originally ended with Rae setting Hughie adrift on a [[life raft]] to ostensibly die at sea; the studio was unhappy with this ambiguity and wanted a definite fate for the film's antagonist.<ref name=\"stratton2\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Dead Calm'' has an 83% \"fresh\" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 30 reviews, albeit significantly lower with audiences, culminating in a score of 63% \"fresh\" and a critical rating of 7.5/10.<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_calm/ \"Dead Calm (1989)\"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207165539/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_calm/ |date=7 December 2008 }} Rotten Tomatoes.
