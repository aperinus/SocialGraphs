They decide to split up when their driver is fatally injured in a car crash and Addison murders a state trooper responding to the scene. They resolve to cross the U.S.-Canadian border during a blizzard. Meanwhile, after being released from prison, former [[boxing|boxer]] Jay calls his parents, retired [[sheriff]] Chet and his wife June, to say he'll be home for [[Thanksgiving]]. He confronts his former coach in [[Detroit]], demanding money owed him. The two get into a fight and Jay, thinking he has killed him and unwilling to return to jail, flees.\n\nHannah, the sheriff's deputy, is invited to join Jay's parents for Thanksgiving dinner. She is treated poorly by her father, Sheriff Becker, who does not want to include her in the hunt for the fugitives. Hannah, who has been accepted to be trained for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], excuses her father's behavior because of the loss of his wife several years ago. Jay finds a shivering Liza in the road and offers her a ride to the nearest gas station. Meanwhile, wandering in the snow, Addison murders an elderly man {{mdash}} losing a little finger in the struggle {{mdash}} and steals his damaged snowmobile. He is later forced to abandon the snowmobile, but not before [[cauterizing]] his wound on the still hot engine.\n\nWhen Jay and Liza stop at a bar during the blizzard, she sneaks back to his truck, finds Jay's address, and leaves Addison a message to meet her there. A romantic relationship develops between Jay and Liza, who have sex in a motel. Elsewhere, Addison invades a cabin in the woods and kills the abusive father of the family. After dumping the man's body, he tends to the distraught wife and her children. Hannah is called to investigate the situation in the cabin. Meanwhile, realizing that she has feelings for Jay, Liza calls Addison to say she couldn't proceed with the plan and that she'll find another ride. Jay confesses his feelings for her. Liza explains how her brother was her protector from their abusive father, who was killed when they were young.\n\nHannah and two officers reach the cabin. Hannah notices a man's corpse and tries to warn the officer at the door, but Addison shoots him with a shotgun. Addison flees on a snowmobile with Hannah and the other officer giving chase, and the officer is killed.\n\nAddison arrives at Jay's house and holds his parents captive. When Liza and Jay arrive for Thanksgiving dinner, Addison pretends at first not to know who Liza is. They eat dinner together. Addison sees Liza act protectively of Jay and his family. Hannah receives a call from a Detroit detective about Jay's coach, who is recovering from a concussion. She goes to the house and is also taken captive by Addison.\n\nBecker finds Addison's snowmobile at the house, draws a weapon and goes inside. He fires at Addison, but it turns out to be his daughter, Hannah, surreptitiously dressed by Addison in his own jacket. Becker is then shot by Addison. A struggle between Jay and Addison ensues outside. Jay overpowers Addison but releases him when Liza begs him to, reminding Jay that Addison is her brother. Addison points another gun at Jay and challenges Jay to proclaim his love for Liza, which Jay does. Before Addison can decide what to do next, Liza fatally shoots him. Other police arrive to discover Hannah's life has been saved by a bulletproof vest.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Addison\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Liza\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Jay\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Chet\n* Alain Goulem as Bobby\n* Allison Graham as Mandy\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as June\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Hannah<ref name=\"Mara&Williams\">{{cite web |url=http://moviecarpet.com/2011/02/28/kate-mara-and-treat-williams-join-eric-bana-and-olivia-wilde-for-blackbird-kin |title=Kate Mara and Treat Williams Join Eric Bana and Olivia Wilde for Blackbird (Kin) |date=February 28, 2011 |work=MovieCarpet.com |access-date=June 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822132740/http://moviecarpet.com/2011/02/28/kate-mara-and-treat-williams-join-eric-bana-and-olivia-wilde-for-blackbird-kin/ |archive-date=August 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Becker<ref name=\"Mara&Williams\" />\n* [[Jason Cavalier]] as Deputy Travis\n* Maxime Savaria as Deputy Brice\n* [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]] as Old Indian Hunter\n\n==Background==\nAs a passenger on [[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]] in 2005, flying for hours in a figure 8 over [[Southern California]] to prepare for a risky landing, Zach Dean contemplated his mortality and resolved to write a screenplay about family.<ref>{{cite web |work=24 Frames (Los Angeles Times) |title=An in-flight scare leads to a buzz script on the ground |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/03/jetblue-flight-292-dean-movie-2929-script.html#more |access-date=2015-12-25 |date=2010-03-24 |author=Steven Zeitchik}}</ref>  The rights to the script, originally titled ''Kin'', were optioned by Mutual Films and in 2010 it was reported that Bana, Wilde, and Hunnam were in casting talks.<ref>{{cite web |work=Variety |author=Stuart Oldham |url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/eric-bana-olivia-wilde-in-talks-for-kin-1118029185/ |access-date=2015-12-25 |date=2010-12-16 |title=Eric Bana, Olivia Wilde in talks for 'KIN'}}</ref> Shooting began in Canada in 2011.\n\n==Release==\n''Deadfall'' premiered at the 2012 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rooney |first1=David |title=Deadfall: Tribeca Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/deadfall-tribeca-film-review-317584/ |access-date=8 June 2021 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=27 April 2012}}</ref> It opened in theaters on December 7, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Hehir |first1=Andrew |title=Pick of the week: \"Deadfall\" is a sexy, snowbound rural noir |url=https://www.salon.com/2012/12/07/pick_of_the_week_deadfall_is_a_sexy_snowbound_rural_noir/ |access-date=8 June 2021 |publisher=Salon |date=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\n''Deadfall'' received negative reviews and has a rating of 35% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 81 reviews with an average rating of 4.93 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadfall_2012/ |title=Deadfall (2012) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref> The film also has a score of 52 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 24 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadfall |title=Deadfall Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |access-date=2015-09-20}}</ref> According to{{IMDb title|1667310|Deadfall}}, the film scored a 6.2 out of 10 stars with 39,570 star reviews.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation |title=Deadfall (2012) - IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667310/ratings/ |access-date=2022-10-07}}</ref> Over 23,000 of these star reviews were in the 6-7 range with only 18.0% of these climbing into the 8-10 range.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.magpictures.com/deadfall}}\n* {{IMDb title|1667310|Deadfall}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|deadfall_2012|Deadfall}}\n* {{allmovie|562264}}\n\n{{Stefan Ruzowitzky}}\n\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:2010s road movies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Marco Beltrami]]\n[[Category:Mutual Film Company films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
