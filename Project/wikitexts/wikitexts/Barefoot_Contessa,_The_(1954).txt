Mankiewicz]] about the life and loves of fictional Spanish sex symbol Maria Vargas. It stars [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Ava Gardner]], and [[Edmond O'Brien]]. The film's slow-paced plot focuses on social positioning and high-powered politics within the world of film and high society.\n\nFor his performance, O'Brien won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|corresponding Golden Globe]]. Mankiewicz was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\nThe majority of the film is explained by Harry Dawes (Bogart), narrating the events, with small sections narrated by Oscar Muldoon (O'Brien).\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Ava Gardner barefoot contessa crop.jpg|thumb|left|Gardner as Maria Vargas]]\nDown on his luck, a washed-up movie director and writer Harry Dawes is reduced to working for abusive, emotionally stunted business tycoon Kirk Edwards, who has decided that he wants to produce a film to boost his monumental ego. Looking for a glamorous leading lady, they go to a Madrid night club to see a dancer named Maria Vargas, about whom Kirk had already been told.\n\nMaria is a blithe but proud spirit who likes to go [[barefoot]] and has a troubled home life. Maria immediately likes Harry, whose work she knows, but takes an instant dislike to Kirk. Although she flees during their meeting, Harry tracks her down to her family home and convinces her to fly away with them to the United States to make her first film. Thanks to his expertise and the help of sweaty, insincere publicist Oscar Muldoon, her film debut is a sensation. With two subsequent films by this team, Maria becomes a respected actress, Harry's career is resurrected, and they become friends.\n\nDuring a party at Maria's house, Kirk and wealthy Latin American playboy Alberto Bravano become involved in an argument over Maria. Alberto had conspicuously admired Maria during the evening. When Alberto invites her to join him on his yacht in the Riviera, Kirk orders her to stay away from him. Offended by Kirk's attempted domineering, she accepts Alberto's invitation. Also seeing an opportunity, Oscar, tired of being Kirk's lackey, switches his allegiance to Alberto.\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Barefoot Contessa trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Bogart as director Harry Dawes]]\n\nMaria is now a great star, but she is not satisfied. She envies the happiness her friend Harry has found with his wife Jerry. Alberto is too frivolous and shallow for her. One evening at a casino, while Alberto is gambling, Maria takes some of his chips and cashes them, throwing the money to her gypsy lover from a window. When Alberto goes on a losing streak, he berates Maria in public for ruining his luck. Subsequently, he receives a slap in the face from Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini, who escorts Maria from the casino.\n\nMaria stays with Vincenzo and his widowed sister, Eleanora, at the count's palazzo. She has found the great love of her life, and they wed in a lavish ceremony, in which Harry gives away the bride. But there is a problem. The count and his sister are the last of the Torlato-Favrinis; without offspring, the noble line will die out. The count has a secret. Due to a war injury, he is impotent. He does not tell Maria about this until their wedding night.\n\nOn a rainy night, months later, with Harry in Italy, an unhappy Maria arrives at his hotel room, telling him about her husband's impotence, but confessing that she is pregnant. She believes Vincenzo will want this child in order to perpetuate the family lineage. Harry warns her Vincenzo is too proud to accept this, but Maria feels otherwise and plans to tell him about her pregnancy that night.\n\nAfter Maria leaves his hotel room, Harry notices Vincenzo's car trailing hers, and follows them. Back at the palazzo in the servants' quarters, Vincenzo shoots to death both Maria and her lover before she can tell him about the child. Harry arrives just as the shots are fired. He does not tell Vincenzo about the pregnancy. The story ends, as it began, with [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] at her funeral. Afterward, Vincenzo is taken away by the police.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Harry Dawes\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Maria Vargas\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as Oscar Muldoon\n* [[Marius Goring]] as Alberto Bravano\n* [[Valentina Cortese]] (billed as Valentina Cortesa) as Eleanora Torlato-Favrini\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Count Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini\n* [[Elizabeth Sellars]] as Jerry Dawes\n* [[Warren Stevens]] as Kirk Edwards\n* [[Franco Interlenghi]] as Pedro Vargas\n* [[Mari Aldon]] as Myrna\n* [[Alberto Rabagliati]] as Nightclub proprietor\n* [[Enzo Staiola]] as Busboy\n* [[Maria Zanoli]] as Maria's Mother\n* [[Renato Chiantoni]] as Maria's Father\n* [[Bill Fraser]] as J.
