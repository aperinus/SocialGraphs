Mankiewicz]] and produced by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] from a screenplay by Mankiewicz, based on the German play by [[Curt Goetz]], which was made into a movie in Germany (''[[Doctor Praetorius (film)|Doctor Praetorius]]'', 1950). Released by [[Twentieth Century Fox]], it stars [[Cary Grant]] and [[Jeanne Crain]], with supporting performances by [[Hume Cronyn]], [[Finlay Currie]], [[Walter Slezak]] and [[Sidney Blackmer]].\n\nIt was nominated for the [[Writers Guild of America]] screen Award for Best Written American Comedy (Joseph L. Mankiewicz).\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:People Will Talk (1951) trailer 1.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Still from film, Cary Grant at left, and Jeanne Crain at right]]\n\nDr. Noah Praetorius is a [[physician]] who teaches in a medical school and founded a clinic dedicated to treating patients humanely and holistically. A colleague who dislikes Praetorius's unorthodox but effective methods, Dr. Rodney Elwell, has hired a detective to investigate Praetorius. A housemaid who once worked for Praetorius reacts visibly when Elwell asks her about Praetorius's mysterious friend Mr. Shunderson, who rarely leaves Praetorius's side and has a deep, intuitive understanding of human and animal nature.\n\nMeanwhile, student Deborah Higgins enters Praetorius's life, displaying signs of emotional distress. After she faints during a lecture, Praetorius examines her and informs her that she's pregnant. Upset by this news, \"Mrs. Higgins\" admits that she's not really married. She will not reveal who the unborn child\u2019s father is, and says knowing about her condition would be too much for her own father to bear. In a hallway near Praetorius's office, she shoots herself.\n\nAfter successfully operating on Deborah, Praetorius tries to calm her by telling her there was a mistake in her pregnancy test, but she has fallen in love with him, and becomes upset at her own embarrassing behavior.  She runs away from the clinic, forcing him to find her so he can tell her she really is pregnant.\n\nPraetorius and Shunderson drive out to where Deborah and her father Arthur live, a farm owned by Arthur's brother, John. Deborah and Praetorius hide Deborah's shooting incident from her father, who is a failure in life and lives unhappily as a dependent of his stingy brother. Deborah is his only pride in life, which might become intolerable for him with a baby to take care of and his daughter's reputation ruined.\n\nWhile showing Praetorius the farm, Deborah admits her love for him. She also wonders why he is visiting and begins to suspect that he is attracted to her. After she seductively interrogates him, they share a passionate kiss. They soon get married, and Arthur comes to live with them. A few weeks later, Deborah suggests to Noah that she may be pregnant, and he admits that she was pregnant all along. She ruefully concludes that he married her out of pity, but he convinces her that he really did fall in love with her.\n\nElwell's detective discovers that Shunderson was once convicted of murder, and Elwell calls for a misconduct hearing against Praetorius. At the hearing, Praetorius explains that he started his career in a small town by opening a butcher shop as a front for his undeclared medical practice, because the people of the town didn't trust doctors. Elwell accuses Praetorius of  \"[[quackery]]\", but Praetorius defends himself with the fact that he was a licensed practitioner, describing how he was forced to leave town after his maid discovered his medical degree.\n\nPraetorius refuses to answer questions about Shunderson, but Shunderson explains that he served 15 years in prison for the alleged death of a man who had tried to murder him, then somehow survived being hanged after actually murdering the man, who had gone into hiding during the first trial. When he woke up, he was lying on a table in front of Praetorius, who was at that time a medical student examining what he believed was a [[cadaver]]. Praetorius kept Shunderson's survival a secret, and Shunderson became Praetorius's devoted friend. After this story is told, the chairman concludes the hearing in Praetorius's favor, and Elwell walks away alone and discredited.\n\nElwell had purposefully arranged for Praetorius's misconduct hearing to be scheduled for the same time as the student/faculty orchestra's concert.  After the hearing and Praetorius' acquittal, the film ends with Deborah, her father, and Shunderson in the audience watching Praetorius' good friend and confidant, physics professor Lyonel Barker,  play in the orchestra while Praetorius conducts it in the finale of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Dr. Noah Praetorius\n* [[Jeanne Crain]] as Deborah Praetorius\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Shunderson\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Prof. Rodney Elwell\n* [[Walter Slezak]] as Prof. Lyonel Barker\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as Arthur Higgins\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Dean Lyman Brockwell\n* [[Katherine Locke]] as Miss James\n* [[Parley Baer]] as Toy Store Salesman (uncredited)\n* [[Bess Flowers]] as Concert audience member (uncredited)\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Sarah Pickett, the housekeeper (uncredited)\n* [[Stuart Holmes]] as Board member (uncredited)\n* [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] as Student in classroom (uncredited)\n* [[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]] as John Higgins (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn August 30, 1951, <!-- The review is i itialed A.W. I could not determine for sure who was responsible for the piece. It would be good to give credit where it is due. --> ''The New York Times'' praised the film in a long review, predicting the kind of acclaim received by the producers' previous hit, ''All About Eve''. \u201cFor this merry melange of medicine, mystery and what must be the Mankiewicz philosophical code takes itself seriously but not so seriously as to avoid injecting as many chuckles as possible within the framework of an adult story\u2026 Using a script which is as sharp as a scalpel\u2026 the scenarist-director is relating the story of a strange, handsome medico a doctor who is not content to diagnose and cure but one who knows there is a vast difference between that concept and his duty which is \u2018to make sick people well\u2019\u2026.But a synopsis is merely a bare and unflattering skeleton. It does not reveal that Mr. Mankiewicz and crew are railing against callousness in medicine, that \u2018the human body is not necessarily the human being.\u2019 \u2026Cary Grant.. is obviously having the time of his life playing Dr. Prateorius\u2026his portrayal is an effective mixture of medicine and merriment. \u2026Despite the fact that Mr. Mankiewicz' script is in error sometimes\u2014atomic scientists are using atomic energy to make people well\u2014it does make its points clearly and with humor. \u2026(the film) does have something to say and it does so with erudition and high comedy, a compound that is vastly entertaining and rewarding.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE SCREEN: THREE NEWCOMERS ON LOCAL SCENE; 'People Will Talk,' Novelty on Medicine, With Cary Grant, Featured of the Roxy 'His Kind of Woman' Opens at Paramount--'Little Egypt' Arrives at Mayfair At the Paramount At the Mayfair|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/08/30/84858629.html?pageNumber=20|access-date=2021-11-15|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Political overtones==\nA review at the Films de France website<ref>[http://filmsdefrance.com/FDF_People_Will_Talk_1951_rev.html ''People Will Talk'' (1951) at filmsdefrance.co.] (retrieved 28 May 2013)</ref> postulates that the movie is a reaction to \"Mankiewicz\u2019s own experiences during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] Communist [[witch hunt]]s of the late 1940s and early 1950s, while he was president of the [[Directors Guild of America]] (1950-51)\".\n\nThe film's investigative trial parallels hearings by anti-Communist crusaders in the U.S. Congress. Just as some there refused to name names, Cary Grant's lead character declines to clear his own name by revealing the private business of another person, in this case a convicted murderer.\n\nThe review further advanced that the movie deals with many other issues, including the pregnancy of a single woman, the \"corrosive effect of unfettered capitalism, the human cost of the [[Korean war]], among others.\"\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score consists of two classical pieces: [[Johannes Brahms]]' ''Academic Festival Overture'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''Prize Song'', adapted and conducted by Alfred Newman.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0043915|title=People Will Talk}}\n* {{Amg movie|105876|People Will Talk}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=86482}}\n* {{AFI film|id=50245|title=People Will Talk}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=people_will_talk|title=People Will Talk}}\n\n{{Joseph L.
