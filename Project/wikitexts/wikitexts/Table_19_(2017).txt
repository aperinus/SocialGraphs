The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[June Squibb]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Stephen Merchant]], [[Wyatt Russell]], and [[Tony Revolori]].\n\nThe film was released on March 3, 2017, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], receiving generally mixed reviews from critics and grossed $5 million.\n\n==Plot==\nEloise McGarry attends her oldest friend Francie Millner's wedding. Originally maid of honor, she \"dropped out\" two months ago after her (now) ex-boyfriend Teddy, the best man and the bride's brother, broke up with her by text after two years together. Teddy is now back with his old girlfriend. At the reception, Eloise discovers she is seated at Table 19. As she considers leaving, a fellow guest named Huck offers unsolicited advice, and she decides to stay.\n\nEloise meets her table mates: Jerry and Bina Kepp, Facebook friends of the groom's father; teen Renzo Eckberg, whose mom is an acquaintance of the groom; Jo Flanagan, Teddy and Francie's childhood nanny; and Walter Thimble, the bride's cousin, who is out on parole. They discuss if Table 19 is a \"good table,\" Eloise tells them that she helped plan the wedding, and she knows Table 19 is for misfits.\n\nAs the newlyweds arrive and begin dancing, Eloise starts feeling insecure and dances with Huck, whom she kisses. When he refuses to sit with her, she realizes he is a wedding crasher and \"Huck\" is not his real name, and he leaves.\n\nAlthough not bonding initially, they come together when Jo realizes Eloise is pregnant. With the table's help, Eloise confronts Teddy about dumping her when she told him about the baby. Teddy says he broke up with her because she said they would be ridiculous parents, leaving Teddy hurt and worried he would disappoint her. The argument ends with them accidentally destroying the cake and hastily covering it up.\n\nBitter and covered in cake, Table 19 changes clothes and moves to Jo's room to [[Cannabis smoking|smoke pot]] and talk. Walter reveals he went to prison for stealing $125,000 from the father of the bride because a former friend conned him. Renzo came to the wedding in lieu of his junior prom, as his mom thought he could meet someone. Jo feels she has wasted her life and the children she cared for have forgotten her.\n\nThe table goes for a walk, and Jerry gives Renzo advice on how to pick up girls, while Eloise realizes Jo has terminal cancer and will die in the next year. Jo tells Eloise that if she has a daughter she should not name her \"Jo\" as it is a tough name for a girl. Bina admits to Jerry she came to the wedding to have an affair with an ex, who did not show. They fight, and she heads back inside with Walter.\n\nOn Jo's suggestion, the six try to find the wedding crasher Eloise met earlier. They learn \"Huck\" is actually the groom from another wedding. As payback, Walter steals Huck's wedding cake to replace the one they destroyed earlier.\n\nReturning to the reception, Table 19 is visited by the bride and groom, who express genuine happiness that everyone there has attended. Francie and Eloise talk briefly, Francie apologizes that she was seated so far away from her, and Eloise decides to leave early. Francie then assures Jo she has not forgotten her, telling a brief but touching childhood story about Teddy, inspiring the table to see him differently. They track down Eloise, encouraging her to tell him how she really feels. As the core wedding party leaves on a ferry, she tries to apologize to him from the dock, but he is too far away to hear her.\n\nEloise, Walter, Jo, and Renzo return to the wedding hall for the last of the cake. In their room, the Kepps discuss their fragile marriage and reconcile before joining them. Teddy suddenly reappears, dripping wet from jumping off the ferry, and asks Eloise to repeat what she said. Eloise asks that they be willing to forgive each other and they reconcile, and the entire group dances to one last song.\n\nA few months later, the Kepps have repaired their strained marriage, Jo has died of cancer, and the Kepps have taken in Jo's dog. Renzo has a girlfriend, and Walter refers to the other Table 19 guests as family. Eloise and Teddy are together and have had their baby. They mail birth announcements to their friends and family, including Table 19. The card reveals they had a son who they named Joe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Eloise McGarry\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Jerry Kepp\n* [[June Squibb]] as Jo Flanagan\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Bina Kepp\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Walter Thimble\n* [[Tony Revolori]] as Renzo Eckberg\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Teddy \n* [[Amanda Crew]] as Nikki \n* [[Thomas Cocquerel]] as Huck\n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Carol Millner \n* [[Oberhofer|Brad Oberhofer]] as Wedding Singer\n* [[Andy Daly]] as Luke Pfaffler \n* [[Maria Thayer]] as Infamous Kate Millner \n* [[Andy Blitz]] as Notorious Donny Haczyk \n* Rya Meyers as Francie Millner \n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Freda Eckberg\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2009, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired the film, with [[Jay Duplass]] and [[Mark Duplass]] set to direct their own screenplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/the-duplass-brothers-table-19-set-up-at-fox-searchlight/ |title=The Duplass Brothers' Table 19 Set Up at Fox Searchlight - /Film |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=2009-04-04 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref> In October 2011, [[Jeffrey Blitz]] was brought in to rewrite the script and direct the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Abrams |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/jeffrey-blitz-in-talks-to-helm-table-19-1118045182/ |title=Jeffrey Blitz in talks to helm 'Table 19\u2032 |publisher=Variety |date=2011-10-27 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref><ref name=Writer>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/anna-kendrick-lisa-kudrow-table-19-bart-freundlichs-wolves-specialty-box-office-preview-1202035487/ |title=Anna Kendrick & Lisa Kudrow Seated At 'Table 19\u2032; Bart Freundlich's Journey With 'Wolves' \u2013 Specialty B.O.
