It stars [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as a German stage actor (modeled on [[Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens]]) who finds unexpected success and mixed blessings in the popularity of his performance in a [[Faust|Faustian]] play as the Nazis take power in pre-[[World War II|WWII]] [[Germany]]. As his associates and friends flee or are ground under by the Nazi regime, the popularity of his character ends up superseding his own existence, until he finds that his best performance is keeping up appearances for his Nazi patrons.\n\nThe film was a co-production of Hungarian, Austrian, and West German studios; starring a mix of German and Hungarian-speaking actors. It premiered in [[Budapest]] on 11 February 1981, and received widespread acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film]], the first Hungarian picture to do so.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cunningham|first=John|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Cinema_of_Istv_n_Sz_bo/N1UZBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=mephisto%20(april%20OR%20october)%201981%20-wikipedia%20-imdb%20-ebay&pg=PA157&printsec=frontcover&bsq=mephisto%20(april%20OR%20october)%201981%20-wikipedia%20-imdb%20-ebay|title=The Cinema of Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3: Visions of Europe|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-231-17199-1|location=New York City|pages=157}}</ref> Brandauer's performance earned him multiple accolades, including [[BAFTA Award|BAFTA]] and [[German Film Award]] nominations, and launched his film career.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film adapts the story of [[Mephistopheles]] and [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]] by revealing the costs to the main character Hendrik H\u00f6fgen as he abandons his conscience and continues to perform, ingratiating himself with the [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in order to retain his job and improve his social position.\n\nH\u00f6fgen (modeled on German actor [[Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens]]) craves center stage. The first third of the film follows his career as a frustrated, passionate actor slogging it out in provincial theaters, occasionally dancing and singing and doing parts in films to gain notice. He even founds a Bolshevik theater with a friend to generate more work, in the avant-garde period of the early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power. Initially, Hendrik is more successful in his social and love life than as an actor. Both strands unite, however, when his new wife watches him play the ultimate role, Mephisto (the devil in the Faustus play), just before the Nazi party came to power in Germany. \n\nWhile his wife, leading actors, and friends go into exile, or protest against the new regime, Hendrik returns to Germany lured by the promise of forgiveness for his communist theatre escapade and a desire to act in his native language. When the Nazi party effectively offers to make him a star, he doesn't hesitate. Great roles and accolades quickly come his way, and Hendrik revels in his success. Hendrik reprises his greatest role as Mephisto and agrees to run the national theatre, working around the cultural restrictions and brutality of the Nazi government. He blithely overlooks the profound moral compromises of his situation, excusing himself by using the power of his close relationships with Nazi officials to help friends who would otherwise be targeted by the regime.\n\nThe plot's bitter irony is that the protagonist's fondest dream is to become Germany's greatest actor, playing [[Hamlet]] and Mephisto, but in order to achieve this dream he sells his soul. In the process, he realizes too late that he is not playing the role of Mephisto but that of Faustus; it is the Nazi leader with a major role in the film (modeled on [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]) who is the real Mephisto.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as Hendrik Hoefgen\n* [[Krystyna Janda]] as Barbara Bruckner\n* [[Ildik\u00f3 B\u00e1ns\u00e1gi]] as Nicoletta von Niebuhr\n* [[Rolf Hoppe]] as The General\n* [[Gy\u00f6rgy Cserhalmi]] as Hans Miklas\n*[[Karin Boyd]] as Juliette Martens\n* [[P\u00e9ter Andorai]] as Otto Ulrichs\n* Christine Harbort as Lotte Lindenthal\n* [[Martin Hellberg]] as Professor Reinhardt\n* [[Tam\u00e1s Major]] as Oskar Kroge\n* [[Ildik\u00f3 Kishonti]] as Dora Martin\n* M\u00e1ria Bisztrai as Motzn\u00e9\n* S\u00e1ndor Luk\u00e1cs as Rolf Bonetti\n* [[\u00c1gnes B\u00e1nfalvy]] as Angelika Siebert\n* [[Judit Hern\u00e1di]] as Rachel Mohrenwitz\n* Vilmos Kun as stage manager\n*[[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]] as man in tuxedo\n}}\n==Reception==\nThe film was the highest-grossing Hungarian film in the United States and Canada with a gross of $3.9 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=86|date=January 7, 1991|title=Pix from afar: National bests in the U.S.}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
