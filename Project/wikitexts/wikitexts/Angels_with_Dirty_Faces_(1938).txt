It stars [[James Cagney]], [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]], [[The Dead End Kids]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Ann Sheridan]], and [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]]. The [[screenplay]] was written by [[John Wexley]] and [[Warren Duff]] based on the story by [[Rowland Brown]]. The film chronicles the relationship of the notorious gangster William \"Rocky\" Sullivan with his childhood friend and now priest Father Jerry Connolly. After spending fifteen years in prison for armed robbery, Rocky intends to collect $100,000 from his co-conspirator Jim Frazier, a mob lawyer. All the while, Father Connolly tries to prevent a group of youths from falling under Rocky's influence.\n\nBrown wrote the scenario in August 1937. After pitching the film to a number of studios, he made a deal with [[Grand National Pictures]], who wanted Cagney to star in the lead role. However, the film never came to fruition, owing to Grand National's financial troubles that led to their bankruptcy in 1939. Cagney then returned to Warner the same year, taking Brown's script with him. Warner acquired the story and asked a number of directors to take on the project, eventually settling with Curtiz. Principal photography began in June 1938 at Warner's Burbank studios, and finished a week behind schedule in August, due mostly to the time it took to shoot Rocky's standoff with the police and eventual execution.<ref name=\"CagP26\" />\n\n''Angels with Dirty Faces'' was released on November 28, 1938, to positive reviews. At the [[11th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated in three categories: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Cagney), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Curtiz), and [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]] (Brown). ''Angels with Dirty Faces'' is considered by some to be one of the best films of all time, and is widely regarded as a defining moment in Cagney's career.<ref name=Neibauer173/><ref name=AnastasiaG>Anastasia & Macnow, chapter 46, pp. 1\u20133.</ref> It was shortlisted by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2008, and was voted 67th in a list of the \"100 Best Film Noirs of All Time\" by ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:1939 - Colonial Theater Ad - 20 Nov MC - Allentownn PA.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Newspaper ad in 1939]]\n<!-- Current length: 608 words. Maximum allowed: 700 words. See [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot. -->\nIn 1920,  two [[Irish-American]] youths, Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly, attempt to rob a railroad car carrying [[fountain pen]]s. Jerry escapes from the police, while Rocky is caught and sentenced to [[reform school]].\n\nFifteen years later, an older Rocky is arrested for armed robbery. His lawyer and co-conspirator, Jim Frazier, asks him to take the blame for the robbery and in exchange, he will keep Rocky's share of the robbery ($100,000) safe until the day he is released. Rocky agrees and is sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nAfter serving his sentence, Rocky returns to his old neighborhood and visits Jerry, who is now a Catholic priest. Jerry advises Rocky to get a place \"in the old parish\", so Rocky rents a room in a [[boarding house]] run by Laury Martin, a girl he bullied in school. He then pays a visit to Frazier's casino. Frazier claims to have been unaware of Rocky's release, but he promises to have the $100,000 ready by the end of the week, and he gives Rocky $500 spending money.\n\nAfter leaving Frazier's casino, Rocky has his [[Pickpocketing|pocket picked]] by a gang of young toughs: Soapy, Swing, Bim, Pasty, Crab, and Hunky. After Rocky tracks them down (they are in his old childhood hideout) and proves to them he is no sucker, the tough kids admit to an admiration of Rocky's reputation and criminal lifestyle. After retrieving his wallet and all the money therein, Rocky invites them to dinner. While they are eating, Jerry arrives and asks the gang why they have not been playing basketball. With Rocky's help, he convinces them to play against another team. At the match, the kids are very disorganized and fighting with the other team. Rocky asks Jerry if he can take over as referee. He takes the boys to task and they start to follow the rules. As Jerry and Laury watch on from the sidelines, Laury expresses her concern over the potential negative influence Rocky may be having on the gang, this is echoed by Jerry.\n\nLater, while walking home, Frazier's [[contract killer|hit squad]] makes an attempt on Rocky's life. Rocky easily spots his tail and outwits the mobsters's attempted hit. In retaliation, he kidnaps Frazier, raiding his house at gunpoint and stealing $2,000 and a [[ledger]]. Rocky then brazenly approaches Frazier's business partner, Mac Keefer and requests $100,000 in trade for Frazier's release. With no other option Mac agrees and pays Rocky but as Rocky leaves, he informs on him to the police. Rocky is arrested and sets about mocking the police for their lack of evidence, even goading them to ring his lawyer (Frazier).\n\nFrazier approaches Mac and learns of Rocky's arrest. He informs Mac that Rocky is in possession of the ledger. This forces Frazier to tell the police it was all a \"misunderstanding\", and Rocky is released. Jerry learns of the kidnapping, and decides to go to the press to expose corruption in New York. Rocky tries unsuccessfully to stop Jerry as he knows the other mobsters won't take kindly to what the priest is trying to do.\n\nOn the radio, Jerry denounces the corruption, as well as Rocky, Frazier and Keefer. Frazier and Keefer assure Rocky that no harm will come to Jerry, but he later overhears them renege on their earlier promise and also discovers that they plan to kill both Rocky and Jerry. To protect his friend, Rocky kills Frazier and Keefer instead and after escaping the casino, makes his way to an abandoned warehouse where he is forced to kill a police officer. A standoff ensues with other police.\n\nJerry arrives and informs the police that he can reason with Rocky and get him to surrender peacefully. The police reluctantly agree to let the priest go into the warehouse. Jerry sees a trapped Rocky and implores him to surrender peacefully, telling him the entire building is surrounded, but Rocky takes Jerry [[hostage]]. While trying to escape, Rocky is shot in the leg and caught. After standing trial, he is sentenced to death.\n\nIn Rocky's last few hours before this execution, Jerry visits with his old friend. He sees the negative impact Jerry could have on the [[Dead End Kids]]. Rocky informs Jerry that he intends to die proud and 'spitting in their eyes'. Jerry pleads with Rocky to look at the negative influence he has had on Soapy and the gang. He asks him to act like a coward and beg for mercy on his way to the death house, citing the impact it would have on the gang, potentially ruining the romantic image they have of the gangster lifestyle. Jerry begs Rocky to be braver and save Soapy from going down the same route he has gone himself. Rocky refuses, telling Jerry that his reputation is all that he has left.\n\nJerry walks with Rocky as he is being led to his execution. He implores his friend one last time but is gruffly rebuffed. As they enter the execution room, Rocky stoically shakes Jerry's hand and wishes him well before walking to the electric chair. Then out of nowhere Rocky seems to break down begging and screaming for mercy. Rocky begins whimpering like a coward and this requires the guards to subdue him and forcefully drag him to the chair. Rocky seemingly dies a coward's death. Later, Soapy and the gang read in the newspapers of how Rocky \"turned yellow\" in the face of his execution and they refuse to believe it. Jerry comes in and Soapy asks if it is true that Rocky had died a coward, and Jerry affirms that it is true. The gang no longer know what to think about Rocky, or the criminal lifestyle and Jerry then asks them to accompany him to go say a prayer for \"a boy who couldn't run as fast as I could\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Cagney]] as William \"Rocky\" Sullivan, a notorious gangster, who just got out of prison.

Therefore, Cagney had no choice and walked away until a better arrangement with Warner could be made. After filing a lawsuit to \"rectify the inequalities,\" Cagney started working for [[Grand National Pictures]], a small studio compared to Warner.<ref name=CagneyLawsuit>Cagney, chapter 4, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> At the time he was offered the role of Rocky Sullivan, Cagney had already made one film for Grand National, ''[[Great Guy]]'', but fearing he would be typecast in \"tough guy\" roles, as he had been at Warner, Cagney turned down the role and opted to star in ''[[Something to Sing About (1937 film)|Something to Sing About]]''.

At his brother's insistence, he took Brown's story with him and presented it to the studio. Warner acquired the story and then asked a number of directors to take on the project. LeRoy was the first, and although he showed interest, he was unable to commit because he was making films for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]; Warner then asked Brown, who showed no interest at all; and finally, Michael Curtiz, who accepted their offer.<ref name=\"RobertsonP47/48\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Ann SHERIDAN-James CAGNEY-Angels Dirty Faces-PHOTO2.jpg|upright=1.25|right|thumb|{{center|Sheridan and Cagney, circa. 1938}}]]\nAlthough Cagney had been convinced that he would never agree to play the role of a coward being dragged to his execution, he became enthusiastic about portraying Rocky, seeing it as an opportunity to prove that his acting range extended beyond tough guy roles.<ref name=PCircus>[http://www.parkcircus.com/assets/0008/4568/WarnerBros-at-90-FINAL.pdf Here's a look at Warner Bros.. 90 Years of Great Filmmaking] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208230014/http://www.parkcircus.com/assets/0008/4568/WarnerBros-at-90-FINAL.pdf |date=2015-12-08 }}, ''[[Park Circus (company)|Park Circus]]'', p. 4, published March 28, 2013.
