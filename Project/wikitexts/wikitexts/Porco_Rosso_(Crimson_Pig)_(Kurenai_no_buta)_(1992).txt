Animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]], [[Japan Airlines]] and the [[Nippon Television Network]], it was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. Its score is by Japanese composer [[Joe Hisaishi]].\n\nThe plot revolves around an Italian [[World War I]] ex-fighter ace, now living as a freelance [[bounty hunter]] chasing \"[[air pirate]]s\" in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. However, an unusual curse has transformed him into an [[anthropomorphic]] pig. Once called Marco Pagot (Marco Rossolini in the American version), he is now known to the world as \"Porco Rosso\", [[Italian language|Italian]] for \"Red Pig\" or \"Red Pork\".\n\nA first English-dubbed version was made for Japan Airlines and included in the Ghibli LD Box Set and on the first Region 2 DVD releases in 2002. The film was later redubbed by [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] and released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States and Canada on February 22, 2005. [[GKIDS]] re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on November 21, 2017, under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2022}}\nIn [[1929 in Italy|1929]], Porco Rosso, an Italian [[World War I]] fighter ace and freelance [[bounty hunter]] who has been cursed to have a pig\u2019s head, fends off an attack on an ocean liner by [[airborne pirates]]. Porco treats himself to dinner at the Hotel Adriano, which is run by his friend Gina.\n\nAt the hotel, the heads of the pirate gangs are contracting Curtis, an arrogant and ambitious American ace, to assist them in their next attacks. Curtis falls in love with Gina on the spot, but is frustrated to see his declarations rebuffed and her affection for Porco. After successfully executing a pirating mission, Curtis tracks down Porco, who is flying to [[Milan]] to have his plane serviced, and shoots him down as he experiences an engine outage, claiming to have killed him. Porco survives, though his plane is heavily damaged. Porco continues the trip by train with the remains of the plane, much to the irritation of Gina, who reminds him that there is a warrant for his arrest in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n\nPorco arrives discreetly in Milan to meet Piccolo, his [[mechanic]]. He learns that Piccolo's sons have emigrated to find work elsewhere due to the [[Great Depression]], and much of the engineering will have to be carried on by his young granddaughter Fio. In addition to this, the plane is rebuilt exclusively by Piccolo's female relatives, with even old grandmothers helping, in order to earn money. Porco is initially skeptical of Fio's abilities as a mechanic, but after seeing her dedication in the repair project he accepts her as a competent engineer. Once Porco's plane is finished, Fio joins him on his flight home, with the justification that if the [[OVRA|secret police]] arrest the team, they can say that Porco forced them to help and took Fio as a hostage. Stopping off to refuel on the way, Porco discovers that [[National Fascist Party|the new fascist government]] is beginning to hire seaplane pirates for their own use, thus putting him out of business.\n\nBack at the Hotel Adriano, Curtis proposes to Gina but she turns him down, saying that she is waiting for Porco Rosso. Upon returning home, Porco and Fio are ambushed by the pirates, who threaten to kill Porco and destroy his plane. Fio talks them out of it, but Curtis appears and challenges Porco to a final duel. Fio makes a deal with him declaring that if Porco wins, Curtis must pay off his debts owed to Piccolo's company, and if Curtis wins, he may marry her.\n\nThat night, while preparing shells for the dogfight, Porco tells Fio a story from World War I. Two days after Gina's first wedding to his friend Bellini, his squadron was attacked by [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Austro-Hungarian Aviation Troops#Aircraft|aircraft]]. Overwhelmed and unable to save his fellow pilots he entered a cloud to evade his pursuers. He recalls blacking out and awakening to find himself in complete stillness above the clouds, with a silver band shimmering high in the distant sky. [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and [[Central Powers|enemy]] aircraft, flown by the airmen who died in the dogfight\u2014Bellini included\u2014rise out of the cloud and fly upward towards the band, ignoring him. Porco soon sees that the band is in fact thousands of planes flying together. He blacks out again, and awakens flying low over the sea, alone. As she falls asleep, Fio (and the viewer) briefly see Marco's true face instead of the pig.\n\nThe next day, the duel is arranged and a large crowd gathers to observe. The indecisive and long dogfight between Porco and Curtis soon devolves into a [[bare-knuckle boxing]] match when both planes' machine guns jam. As they fight, Porco accuses Curtis of being a womaniser, but Curtis responds that he is worse- Fio adores him, and Gina is waiting on him to the exclusion of any other man, but he fails to reciprocate either of them, especially Gina. This comes as such a shock to Porco that Curtis is able to knock him down, only for Porco to be saved by a pirate referee signaling the end of a round. The fight ends with both combatants knocking each other out and falling under the shallow water.\nGina arrives and calls out to 'Marco' (Porco), who rises first and is declared the winner. She warns the crowd that the [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian air force]] has been alerted and are on their way, and invites everyone to regroup at her hotel. To Gina's frustration, Porco hands Fio over to Gina, requesting that she look after her, and turns away. Just before Gina's plane takes off, Fio leans out and gives Porco a kiss.\n\nAs the crowd leave, Porco volunteers to lead the air force away and invites Curtis to join him. Curtis reacts with surprise and asks Porco to turn around, suggesting that\u2014like Fio\u2014he had briefly seen Marco's true face. In the epilogue, Fio narrates as she flies in a jet seaplane that in the end Porco outflies the Italian air force and remains at large; Fio herself became president of the Piccolo company, which is now an aircraft manufacturer; Curtis became a famous actor; and the pirates continued to attend the Hotel Adriano in their old age. She does not divulge whether Gina's hope about Porco Rosso was ever realized, saying it is their secret. However, a red plane can be seen docked by Gina's garden as the jet flies over the hotel.\n\nAfter the credits, a familiar red seaplane soars in the sky before disappearing into the clouds.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Cast\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n!

The outbreak of [[Yugoslav wars|war in Yugoslavia]] cast a shadow over production and prompted a more serious tone for the film, which had been set in [[Dalmatia]]. The airline remained a major investor in the film, and showed it as an in-flight film well before its theatrical release.<ref name=Theowne>{{cite web|title=Porco Rosso Review|url=http://omohide.com/1624/porco-rosso-review/|work=Omohide|access-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726005154/http://omohide.com/1624/porco-rosso-review/|archive-date=July 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to this, the opening text introducing the film appears simultaneously in Japanese, Italian, Korean, English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, French, and German.

For the soundtrack, [[Tokiko Kato]] performs [[Le Temps des cerises|\"The Time of Cherries\"]] as well as an original song, \"Once in a While, Talk of the Old Days\".\n\n==History and politics==\n''Porco Rosso'' is one of the few films directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in which the historical and geographical settings are clearly defined and where most of the story could have happened in the real world.{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}} Marco is an Italian hero from the [[World War I|First World War]] and is shown fighting against Austro-Hungarian [[fighter planes]] in a flashback sequence. The story is set in [[Milan]], the [[Adriatic Sea]] east coast between [[Dalmatia]]n and [[Kvarner]] islands, and a fictionalized city of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] after its annexation to fascist Italy and [[Northern Italy]]. The concealed beach Porco uses as a hideout bears a strong resemblance to Stiniva, an inlet on the southern side of the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]].\n\nMiyazaki shed light on the political context of the making of the film in an interview with ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. He reflects that the conflicts that broke out during the film's production (such as those in [[Siege of Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik]] and elsewhere) made ''Porco Rosso'' a much more complicated and difficult film.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Jolin |first=Dan|title=Miyazaki on Miyazaki|journal= Empire |date= September 2009|issue=243 |page= 119}}</ref>\n\nEvident historical and political realism aside, at least one scholar has argued that the film's more overt historical references can be understood as representative of ''wakon y\u014dsai'' (<small>[[:jp:\u548c\u9b42\u6d0b\u624d|Jp]]</small>; \"[[Yamato-damashii|Japanese spirit]], Western learning\")\u2014a tendency, since the [[Meiji period]], for Japanese artists to paint Europe as spectacular, while simultaneously maintaining the distance necessary to preserve a distinct sense of Japanese identity. \"In Porco Rosso,\" states academic Chris Wood, \"Europe is tamed, rendered as a charming site of pleasurable consumption, made distant and viewed through a tourist gaze.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood|first1=Chris|title= The European fantasy space and identity construction in ''Porco Rosso'' |journal=Post Script|date=Winter\u2013Spring 2009 |volume= 28 |issue=2 |page=112 |access-date= July 31, 2019 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/39660078/european-fantasy-space-identity-construction-porco-rosso |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190801021746/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/39660078/european-fantasy-space-identity-construction-porco-rosso |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2019-08-01 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Homage to early aviation==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Museo Vigna di Valle Macchi 2009-06-06.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Aermacchi]]'s seaplanes at the [[Italian Air Force Museum]]]]\nThe fictional \"Piccolo\" aircraft company depicted in the film is based on the Italian aircraft manufacturers [[Caproni]] and [[Piaggio Aerospace|Piaggio]].

Piccolo mentions that it was used in a racing aeroplane for the [[Schneider Trophy]] race in the year before.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Italian seaplane designers set world speed records (such as the [[Macchi M.C.72]] designed by the Italian airplane designer [[Mario Castoldi]]). One of the test pilots killed during the attempt to set the speed record was named Bellini, the name given to Porco's pilot friend in the film. Italian top fighter aces [[Francesco Baracca]] and [[Adriano Visconti]] also appear in the film.<ref name=Fanacea/>\n\nMarco Pagot, the real name of the main character, is also a homage to the Pagot brothers, pioneers of Italian animation (Nino and [[Toni Pagot]] were the authors of the first Italian animated feature film, ''[[The Dynamite Brothers]]'', and Nino's son and daughter Marco and Gi Pagot<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cartoons-honor-italian-animation-brothers-134193|title=Cartoons honor Italian animation brothers|author=Eric J.

Curtis' airplane is a [[Curtiss R3C]], which was built for the 1925 [[Schneider Cup]] race (which Porco refers to when he first meets Curtis). His character is also an oblique reference to [[Ronald Reagan]], in that his ambitions lie not only in Hollywood, but also the Presidency. The rest of Curtis' character appears to come directly from the adventure film heroes portrayed by [[Errol Flynn]] at this time\u2014indeed, they share a jaw line\u2014including his buccaneering derring-do, willingness to fight, and overall demeanour combined with romantic ardour.\n\nMiyazaki revisited the theme of aviation history in his 2013 film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Japan on July 18, 1992 by [[Toho]], and was released on VHS by [[Tokuma Shoten]] in 1993. The movie was later reissued on VHS by [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan]] (now [[Walt Disney Studios Japan]]) on April 23, 1999, and was released on DVD on December 18, 2002. The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on November 6, 2013, with a reissue of the DVD following on July 16, 2014.\n\nAn English-dubbed version was made for Japan Airlines and was later included in the 1996 Ghibli ga Ippai Laserdisc Box Set and on the 2002 Japanese DVD release of the film.
