The film is based on [[Jacob the Liar|the book of the same name]] by [[Jurek Becker]]. The film stars [[Robin Williams]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Hannah Taylor-Gordon]], and [[Bob Balaban]]. The film is set in 1944 in a [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939\u20131944|ghetto]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|German-occupied Poland]] during the [[Holocaust]] and tells the story of a Polish-Jewish shopkeeper named Jakob Heym who attempts to raise the morale inside the ghetto by sharing encouraging rumors that he claims he has heard on a radio. It is a [[remake]] of the 1975 East German-Czechoslovak film ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jakob der L\u00fcgner]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn Poland of early 1944, a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] shopkeeper named Jakob Heym is summoned to the German headquarters after being falsely accused of being out after curfew. While waiting for the commander, Jakob overhears a German radio broadcast speaking about Soviet offensives. Returned to the ghetto, Jakob shares his information with a friend, sparking rumors that there is a secret radio within the ghetto. After hesitating, Jakob decides to use the chance to spread hope throughout the ghetto by continuing to tell the optimistic, fantastic tales that he allegedly heard from his \"secret radio\", and his lies keep hope and humor alive among the isolated ghetto inhabitants. He also has a real secret, in that he is hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from an [[extermination camp]] deportation train.\n\nHowever, the [[Gestapo]] learn of the mythical radio and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it. Jakob surrenders himself to the Germans as they demand the person with the radio give himself up or risk hostages being killed. During interrogation, Jakob tells the police commander that he had only listened to the radio inside his office. He is ordered to announce publicly that this was all a lie, so the ghetto's liquidation would then proceed in an orderly fashion. When presented to the public, Jakob refuses to tell the truth, but is shot before he can make his own speech.\n\nAt the film's ending, Jakob says, [[post-mortem]], that all the ghetto's residents were then deported and were never seen again. As in the novel, there is an alternate \"but maybe it wasn't like that at all\" ending where, following Jakob's death, the train carrying the Jewish prisoners to the death camps is halted by Soviet troops and the occupants released.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Jakob Heym\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Frankfurter\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Kowalsky\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Mischa\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Dr. Kirschbaum\n* [[Hannah Taylor-Gordon]] as Lina Kronstein\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Fajngold\n* [[Nina Siemaszko]] as Rosa\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Avron\n\n==Reception==\nProduced on a budget of $45 million, the film was released on September 24, 1999. According to [[Box Office Mojo]], it opened in 1,200 theaters and made $2,056,647 in its opening weekend, placing eighth at the box office. The film's total domestic gross was just $4,956,401.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nThe film holds a rating of \"rotten\" on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with only 29% positive reviews and an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's consensus states: \"Any real story is buried by awkward performances and contrived situations.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jakob_the_liar|title = Jakob the Liar}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars (out of four), comparing it to the similarly themed ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' by saying, \"I prefer ''Life Is Beautiful'', which is clearly a fantasy, to ''Jakob the Liar'', which is just as contrived and manipulative, but pretends it is not.\" He went on to say about the acting in the film: \"[[Robin Williams|Williams]] is a talented performer who moves me in the right roles, but has a weakness for the wrong ones. The screenplay and direction are lugubrious, as the characters march in their overwritten and often overacted roles toward a foregone conclusion.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990924%2FREVIEWS%2F909240305%2F |title=Roger Ebert's review of \"Jakob the Liar\" |access-date=2022-07-10 |archive-date=2012-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004194905/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990924%2FREVIEWS%2F909240305%2F |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s Todd McCarthy also made comparisons with ''Life is Beautiful'' in his review, but he noted that ''Jakob the Liar'' was shot in late 1997, before ''Life is Beautiful'' had even premiered in Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/reviews/jakob-the-liar-1200459127/|title = Jakob the Liar|date = 13 September 1999}}</ref>\n\nWilliams received a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for his performances in ''Jakob the Liar'' and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', but lost to [[Adam Sandler]], who was nominated for ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jacob the Liar|''Jacob the Liar'' (novel)]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0120716|title=Jakob the Liar}}\n* {{amg movie|180793|Jakob the Liar}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=jakob_the_liar|title=Jakob the Liar}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1999 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on German novels]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Edward Shearmur]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Films set in Poland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:American remakes of German films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Steven Haft]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
