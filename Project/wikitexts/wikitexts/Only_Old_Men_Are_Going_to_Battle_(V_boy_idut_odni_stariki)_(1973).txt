Runtime 92 min. Production by [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film combines two storylines: the main [[war film|war]] [[drama film|drama]] plot runs in parallel with vivid artistic performance \u2014 the fighter squadron doubles as an amateur musical group during rest time, led by its enthusiastic commander turned [[Conducting|conductor]].\n\nThe title comes from two scenes in the film, where the squadron is facing very difficult [[dogfight]]s with German fighter planes, so only \"old men\" are sent up, while those fresh from flying school have to wait on the ground together with the mechanics. Soon, of course, the newcomers have replaced most of those veterans and have become \"old men\" themselves, taking to the skies while a new group of newcomers wait on the ground with the mechanics.\n\n=== Plot Summary ===\n\nThe movie begins in the late summer of 1943 during the [[Battle of the Dnieper]].\n\nThe pilots of the 2nd [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]] of the Fighter Aircraft Guard Regiment are returning from the mission. However, the commanding officer, captain Titarenko, also known as \"Maestro,\" is missing. Nobody (except for Makarych, the technician) even hopes he survived, since he didn't even have enough fuel, but then suddenly the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] shows up and lands on the airfield. It turns out that Maestro was shot down behind enemy lines, however, the advancing USSR infantry saved him and he received a [[war trophy]] aircraft on an [[advance airfield]].\n\nThe next day the reinforcements come to the regiment and are being assigned to the squadrons. Several newcomers, including Second [[Lieutenant]] Aleksandrov and Third Lieutenants Shchedronov and Sagdullayev, ask for a place in the 2nd Squadron. Titarenko inquires about their musical skills: 2nd Squadron is also known as the \"Singing Squadron,\" as during free time they perform as an amateur orchestra with the commander himself acting as [[conducting|conductor]]. Shchedronov sings \u00ab[[Smuglyanka|Darkie]]\u00bb, earning the corresponding nickname.\n\nHaving only had a brief chat with the reinforcements, the \"old men\" take off to intercept a group of German [[bomber]]s. Experienced pilots don't allow the newcomers with them, saying only \"you\u2019ll have your share of fighting soon enough:\" they know that the new pilots have only received basic training due to a shortened curriculum and are not battle-ready.\n\nThey all return to the airfield safely, however, Maestro is furious: his [[wingman]], First Lieutenant Skvortzov, left the battle without a permit, and it appears he did so not for the first time. They have a serious discussion and it turns out that during the [[Battle of Kursk]] Skvortzov had barely survived an encounter with a German [[ace pilot]] and since then has had a subconscious fear of [[dogfight]]s. Depressed Skvortzov asks to be released from active duty and to be enlisted to an infantry regiment instead, however, Titarenko burns the report, deciding to give his friend another chance.\n\nIn between missions, the 2nd Squadron rehearses performances. Even Aleksandrov, despite his aversion to music, plays the [[tambourine]] and soon begins to run the rehearsals in lieu of the captain.\n\nEventually, the newcomers are allowed to fly. Aleksandrov [[crash landing|crash lands]] his aircraft, destroying it in the process and receives a strict reprimand from the captain. However, he doesn't take it seriously and light-heartedly goes to the field to catch some grasshoppers. Enraged Titarenko suspends the lieutenant from flying and puts him on \"eternal airfield duty,\" while the rest of the officers give Aleksandrov the nickname Grasshopper.\"\n\nTitarenko leaves on a [[reconnaissance]] mission on a trophy Messerschmitt. In his absence, a light bomber [[Polikarpov Po-2]], piloted by female officers Zoya and Masha, takes a [[forced landing]] on the airfield. Sagdullayev promptly falls in love with Masha, earning himself the nickname \"Romeo.\"\n\nTitarenko, who has returned from his recon mission, confirms that a large group of German tanks is nearby. When he decides the new reinforcements (except for Grasshopper) are battle-ready, he performs another reconnaissance flight. He finds out that the Germans have camouflaged their tanks with hay bales and sheds, but he's shot down on his way back. Maestro is saved by an allied infantry, which, however, mistakes him for a German pilot. They aren't persuaded by his Soviet uniform nor by his fluency in Russian, and attempt to [[lynching|lynch]] him. However, when an infantryman slaps Titarenko in the face, he punches the soldier back, knocking him to his knees and answered in a [[Mat (Russian profanity)|mat]] manner \u2014 that reassures the rest of the soldiers, who are sure that a German doesn't know the [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] like this.\n\nThe infantrymen gift the captain a horse, which he uses to get back to the airfield. Having returned, he learns from Makarych that during his absence Darkie has been killed: he was practicing cooperative actions with his partner and was shot down by a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] ace.\n\nIn the meantime, Romeo confesses his love to Masha.\n\nTitarenko joins [[CPSU]] and receives a task to lead the newcomers by example and to demonstrate to them the vulnerability of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring's]] ace pilots. Maestro challenges the Germans to a \"joust,\" but at the very beginning of the fight he decides that this is the last opportunity for his wingman to prove himself. Titarenko feigns a weapon malfunction, putting himself in a mortal peril, and Skvortzov overcomes his fear and comes to the rescue, shooting down one of the enemy aircraft.\n\nThe next day, German air forces perform a raid on the airfield. Still suspended from flights, Grasshopper steals the commander's fighter, takes off and shoots down an enemy aircraft, saving the base.\n\nThe squadron gives a performance, which, among others, is attended by female pilots from a nearby regiment. Skvortzov performs the song [[Nich Yaka Misyachna|Moonlight Night]]. The next day he performs a suicide [[kamikaze|ramming attack]], directing his flaming aircraft at an enemy railway.\n\nMore time passes. The USSR territory is almost completely liberated from German occupation. The \u00abold men\u00bb are preparing for battle, however, this now includes Romeo (First Lieutenant, Maestro's wingman) and Grasshopper (First Lieutenant, 2nd Squadron commander), while Maestro himself is now a [[major]] and a regiment commander. Fifteen minutes before takeoff, Romeo asks Maestro's permission to get married (since both he and Masha could be shot down any day) which Meastro gives right away. Once again the \"old men\" take off, and the newcomers from the reinforcements are left on the airfield.\n\nThe regiment returns from the mission, but it turns out that Romeo is heavily wounded. He manages to make it to the airfield and lands safely, but succumbs to his wounds right afterwards. When Maestro, Makarych and Grasshopper go to the female regiment to deliver the sad news to Masha, they learn that both Masha and Zoya were also killed that day. Makarych and Titarenko locate the women's graves and promise to return here and sing \"Darkie\" once again \"from the beginning to the end\" once the war is over.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:\u0412 \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u00ab\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438\u00bb \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0410.\u0414., \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0410.\u0412., \u041f\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0412.\u0418. \u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0420.\u0410. 2008\u0433\u043e\u0434 \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0427\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Only \u00abOld Men\u00bb Are Going Into Battle'' 35 years later (2008): Nemchenko, Fedorinsky, Pashchenko, and Sagdullaev]]\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u0412 \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u00ab\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438\u00bb.jpg|thumb|]]\n* [[Leonid Bykov]] as \u00abMaestro\u00bb Titarenko, commander of the 2nd Singing squadron\n* [[Sergey Podgorny]] as \u00abDarkie\u00bb Shchedronov, fighter pilot\n* Sergei Ivanov as \u00abGrasshopper\u00bb Aleksandrov, fighter pilot\n* [[Rustam Sagdullayev]] as \u00abRomeo\u00bb Sagdullayev, fighter pilot\n* [[Yevgeniya Simonova]] as Masha, female bomber navigator\n* [[Olga Mateshko]] as Zoya, female bomber pilot\n* [[Vladimir Talashko]] as Skvortzov, fighter pilot, Maestro's [[wingman]] and best friend\n* [[Aleksei Makarovich Smirnov|Aleksei Smirnov]] as Makarych, Maestro's technician\n* Viktor Miroshnichenko as Pop, the fighter regiment commander\n* [[Alim Fedorinsky]] as Alyabyev, fighter pilot\n* [[Vano Yantbelidze]] as Vano, fighter pilot\n* [[Aleksandr Nemchenko]] as Ivan Fedorovich, fighter pilot\n* [[Vilori Pashchenko]] as Vorobyev, fighter pilot\n* [[Gregory Hlady]] as Grasshopper's technician\n* Vladimir Volkov as political officer\n* Dmitri Mirgorodskiy as infantry captain\n* [[Yuri Sarantsev]] as Air Division commander\n* Valentin Grudinin as chief of Air Army intelligence department\n* Alexandr Milutin as fighter pilot\n\n== Script and production ==\nLeonid Bykov's childhood dream of becoming a pilot inspired his making of the film.\n\nThe story is based on the memoirs of the Soviet fighter ace [[Vitaly Popkov]] who fought with a real-life singing squadron boasting its own amateur choir. The squadron even toured the Soviet [[Rear (military)|rear]] with concerts and received fighter planes built with money donated by Soviet star musicians.\n\nMost of the elder cast and production members fought in the war themselves. Actor [[Aleksei Makarovich Smirnov|Aleksei Smirnov]] (Makarych) was a decorated war hero, an [[artillery]] sergeant; also a battlefield amateur musician as well.\n\n== Awards ==\nThe film won most of the [[Soviet bloc]] film prizes at the time, including the first prize in the 7th [[All-Union Film Festival]] in [[Baku]] in 1974.\n\n== Colorization ==\nIn 2009 a [[Film colorization|colorized]] version was released for TV and DVD, which resulted in a legal battle in Ukrainian courts between the copyright owners, Leonid Bykov's daughter and Ukrainian [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]], and the company behind the colorization, as the copyright owners claim that the colorization has been done against the wishes of Bykov, who intentionally chose to do the film in black and white, in order to match newly shot scenes with the newsreel material in the film. In May 2011, the District Court of Kiev ruled that the colorization was a breach of copyright and that the colorized version can't be shown or rented in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sd.net.ua/2011/05/23/sud-zapretil-cvetnuyu-versiyu-v-boj-idut-odni.html |script-title=ru:\u0421\u0443\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044e \u00ab\u0412 \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u00ab\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438\u00bb |trans-title=Court bans colorized version of \"Only 'old men' are going into battle\" |date=23 May 2011 |script-website=uk:\u0410\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0414\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0456\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043d\u044c |website=Ahentstvo Stratehichnykh Doslidzhen\u2019 |language=Russian |access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> The director re-worked the film's script to suit being shot in black and white after being denied color film stock on the grounds that color film was reserved for films about [[socialist realism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.1tv.ru/movies/statyi/hudozhestvennyy-film-v-boy-idut-odni-stariki |script-title=ru:\u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c \u00ab\u0412 \u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u201e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438\u201c\u00bb |trans-title=The film \"Only 'old men' are going into battle\" |date=6 May 2016 |script-website=ru:\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b |trans-website=[[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] |language=Russian |access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Only Old Men Are Going to Battle}}\n* {{IMDb title|0070861}}\n* [http://www.leonid-bykov.ru/fight/main_fight.htm Page about the film on the Leonid Bykov website] (in Russian)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Only Old Men Are Going Into Battle}}\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1973 drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s war drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet war drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Soviet historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian war drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1943]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Dovzhenko Film Studios films]]\n[[Category:World War II aviation films]]\n[[Category:Russian aviation films]]\n[[Category:Eastern Front of World War II films]]\n[[Category:Russian-language Ukrainian films]]\n[[Category:Russian war drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Russian musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian musical drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian World War II films]]\n[[Category:Soviet World War II films]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian World War II films]]"}]}}}}
