He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world \"travels\" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering [[writer's block]] and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a \"guy from the mailroom\", Gulliver [[plagiarism|plagiarises]] a report from other publications on the [[internet]]. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task \u2013 to travel to the [[Bermuda Triangle]] and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.\n\nUpon arriving in [[Bermuda]], Gulliver rents a ship and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, Gulliver is caught in a freak storm and the ship is overwhelmed by a [[waterspout]]. Gulliver washes up unconscious on the shore of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]], where he is immediately confirmed as a \"beast\" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his size, Gulliver is captured and imprisoned in a cave. There, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, despite Edward also pursuing her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, orders some commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore, from a [[fire]] by urinating on it.\n\nGulliver is declared a [[hero]] by Lilliput's citizens and lies that he is the President of Manhattan, says [[Yoda]] is his vice-president and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for Gulliver, and for being presented as an honorary [[general]] of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. The townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, when Gulliver receives angry [[voicemail]]s from Darcy, who has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and she has found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lays siege to the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the [[Round shot|cannonballs]] being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to have anything to do with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot he had made from a page he'd seen from Gulliver's ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock|Guitar Hero III]]'' game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the [[Mecha|pilot]].\n\nThe Blefuscians invade Lilliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is \"just the guy from the mail-room\" and nothing more. Edward banishes Gulliver to the shores of \"the island where we dare not go\" ([[Brobdingnag]]). There, he is snatched up by a \"little\" girl ([[Glumdalclitch]]) who towers over him. She captures him easily by trapping him inside a glass cup. When Gulliver wakes up, he finds himself in a pink dress in a bedroom of a doll house which begins to shake when the \"little girl\" pulls apart the wall of the bedroom who begins to stare emotionlessly and ominously at a tiny defenseless Gulliver. He then screams fearfully at the sight of the quiet giant \"little\" girl, she shoves a milk bottle in his mouth and forcefully feeds him excess milk. The girl treats him as a doll, playing with him roughly. Horatio, who has gone to find Gulliver after being spurned by Mary, reveals to Gulliver that Darcy was imprisoned by the Blefuscians after she was lost in the Bermuda Triangle in the same manner as Gulliver. Gulliver narrowly escapes with him, using a [[parachute]] that he took from the skeleton of a dead [[U.S. Air Force]] pilot sitting in the [[dollhouse]].\n\nOnce again accepting a duel from Edward, this time not only for Lilliput's freedom but for its fate as well \u2013 as Edward threatens to destroy it should Gulliver fail \u2013 Gulliver ultimately defeats him with the assistance of Horatio, who disables the machine's electrocuting weapon. Horatio is hailed a hero and gets King Theodore's permission to court the princess. Edward, reaching the point of insanity, threatens to kill the princess, but the princess, finally having enough of Edward, punches the traitor in the face in frustration. When King Theodore decides to sentence all Blefuscians to the gallows or to prepare for war, Gulliver then helps to make peace between the rival island-nations by reciting [[Edwin Starr]]'s \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\" and he, along with Darcy, return to [[New York City]] on their repaired ship. The film ends with Gulliver, now a legitimate travel writer, taking Darcy to lunch while holding hands, after returning from another travel assignment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Black]] as Lemuel Gulliver, a mail-room worker who becomes a journalist after plagiarizing a report and winds up in Lilliput after encountering a storm\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Horatio, a man from Lilliput who Gulliver befriends\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Princess Mary, the princess of Lilliput and King Theodore's daughter\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Darcy Silverman, a journalist and Gulliver's girlfriend \n* [[Billy Connolly]] as King Theodore, the king of Lilliput and Mary's father\n* [[Chris O\u2019Dowd]] as General Edward Edwardian, the commander of the Lilliput Army who begins despising Gulliver\n* [[T.J.
