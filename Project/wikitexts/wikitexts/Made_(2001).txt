It stars Favreau, [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Sean Combs]]. It was both Favreau's feature directorial debut and Combs\u2019 acting debut.\n\n==Plot==\nBobby has ties to the local mafia boss, Max, but works as an honest mason for Max's construction projects. He fights in amateur boxing matches on the side, but his career is lackluster (five wins, five losses, one draw). Struggling to support his stripper girlfriend Jessica and her daughter Chloe, Bobby decides to do a mafia job for Max. Against his better judgment, he brings along his ne'er-do-well friend Ricky.\n\nBobby and Ricky go to [[New York City|New York]] to act as Max's representatives for a money laundering deal with his [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] partner, Ruiz. They meet Jimmy, who will be their driver, and Horrace, who is connected to both Max and Ruiz. Ricky and Bobby squabble throughout their trip as Ricky tries to live large while Bobby wants to stay cautious and stick to the letter of Max's instructions. Ruiz has a low opinion of the pair, but sends them off to show his criminal contact, the Welshman, a good time. Gaffing several times along the way, the pair eventually manage to arrange a deal between Ruiz and the Welshman's [[The Westies|Westie]] contacts.\n\nRicky grows suspicious of Ruiz, and insists that they bring a gun to their meeting with the Westies. Bobby adamantly refuses. On the day of the meet, Ricky has disappeared, but Jimmy insists that Bobby carry on with the meeting. As Bobby begins to grow suspicious of Jimmy, he meets with the Welshman and the Westies. The Westies double-cross Bobby and the Welshman, but Ricky arrives from a side entrance with a gun. A Westie recognizes Ricky's weapon as a [[starter pistol]] and a fight breaks out. Jimmy arrives with a real pistol and sends the boys away while he deals with the Westies.\n\nBack in [[Los Angeles]], Bobby severs all business ties with Max. Arriving home, he discovers Jessica in bed with a client and snorting cocaine. Bobby tries to convince Jessica to clean up her act for Chloe's sake, but Jessica refuses. Instead, she asks that Bobby take custody of Chloe and leave. In an epilogue set at [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], we learn that Bobby and Ricky are now raising Chloe together, although the two friends still bicker constantly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Jon Favreau]] as Bobby Ricigliano\n*[[Vince Vaughn]] as Ricky Slade\n*[[Peter Falk]] as Max Reuben\n*[[Famke Janssen]] as Jessica\n*[[P.
