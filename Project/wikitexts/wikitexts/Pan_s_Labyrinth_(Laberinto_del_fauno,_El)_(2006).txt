The film stars [[Ivana Baquero]], [[Sergi L\u00f3pez (actor)|Sergi L\u00f3pez]], [[Maribel Verd\u00fa]], [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], and [[Ariadna Gil]].\n\nThe story takes place in Spain during the summer of 1944, five years after the [[Spanish Civil War]], during the early [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] period. The narrative intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown, abandoned [[labyrinth]] and a mysterious [[faun]] creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the [[Falange|Falangist]] Captain Vidal, hunts the [[Spanish Maquis]] who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, [[animatronics]], and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects to bring life to its creatures.\n\nDel Toro stated that he considers the story to be a [[parable]], influenced by [[fairy tales]], and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"SF\"/> to which ''Pan's Labyrinth'' is a [[spiritual successor]], according to del Toro in his [[Audio commentary|director's DVD commentary]]. The original Spanish title refers to the [[Faunus|fauns]] of [[Roman mythology]], while the English, [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] titles refer specifically to the faun-like [[Greek mythology|Greek deity]] [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.<ref name=\"SF\"/>\n\n''Pan's Labyrinth'' premiered on 27 May 2006 at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. The film was theatrically released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in Spain on 11 October and in Mexico on 20 October. ''Pan's Labyrinth'' opened to widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the visual effects, direction, cinematography and performances. It grossed $83 million at the worldwide box office and won numerous international awards, including three [[Academy Awards]], three [[BAFTA Award]]s including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]], the [[Ariel Award for Best Picture]], the [[Saturn Awards]] for [[Saturn Award for Best International Film|Best International Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor|Best Performance by a Younger Actor]] for [[Ivana Baquero]] and the 2007 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Long Form|Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]]. A sequel, titled ''3993'', was conceived by del Toro but ultimately cancelled. \n\nA novelization by del Toro and [[Cornelia Funke]] was published in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[fairy tale]], Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the [[underworld]], visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths, which act as portals, around the world in preparation for her return.\n\nIn 1944 [[Francoist Spain]], ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant but sickly mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in [[Morocco]], believes strongly in [[Falangism]] and has been assigned to hunt down [[Spanish Maquis|republican rebels]]. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone [[labyrinth]], but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a [[faun]], who believes she is the [[reincarnation]] of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom.\n\nOfelia completes the first task \u2014 retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad \u2014 but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake|mandrake root]], instructing her to keep it under Carmen's bed in a bowl of milk and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task \u2014 retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although [[Taboo#In religion and mythology|warned not to consume]] anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.\n\nDuring this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the rebels. After he murders two local farmers detained on false suspicion of aiding the rebels, Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then [[Euthanasia|euthanises]] at the rebel's own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator, Vidal kills him. Vidal later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and [[Maternal death|dies giving birth]] to Vidal's son.\n\nMercedes, having been discovered to be a spy, tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated and tortured. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the rebels. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia successfully retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth.\n\nThe faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by rebels, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told about him. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name. Pedro then shoots Vidal dead.\n\nMercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a motionless, dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her once more as \"Your Highness\". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies.\n\nThe epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ivana Baquero]] as Ofelia<!-- THIS IS THE CORRECT SPANISH SPELLING, NOT OPHELIA--> / Princess Moanna, a child who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June\u2013October 2005, when she was 11.) \"The character I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in and she was a little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife was crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age.\"<ref name=\"DH\">{{cite news|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090705114644/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/deltoro.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 July 2009 |title=Exclusive Interview: Guillermo del Toro \"''Pan's Labyrinth''\" |access-date=28 January 2007 |date=26 September 2006 |publisher=Dark Horizons |last=Fischer |first=Paul }}</ref> Baquero says that Del Toro sent her many comics and fairy tales to help her \"get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt\".

Del Toro met with L\u00f3pez in [[Barcelona]], a year and a half before filming began, to ask him to play Vidal. In parts of Spain, L\u00f3pez was considered a melodramatic or comedic actor, and the Madrid-based producers told del Toro, \"You should be very careful because you don't know about these things because you're Mexican, but this guy is not going to be able to deliver the performance\"; del Toro replied \"Well, it's not that I don't know, it's that I don't care\".<ref name=oscarwatch>{{cite news|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/pans-labyrinth-a-story-that-needed-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=Pan's Labyrinth: A Story that Needed Guillermo Del Toro |access-date=2 January 2018 |date=11 January 2007 |website=[[Awards Daily]] |last=Stone |first=Sasha |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126100819/http://www.oscarwatch.com/2007/01/pans_labyrinth_a_story_that.html |archive-date=26 January 2008 }}</ref> Of his character, L\u00f3pez said: \"He is the most evil character I've ever played in my career.

Even though his father's personality marked his existence\u2014and is certainly one of the reasons for his mental disorder\u2014that cannot be an excuse. It would seem to be very cynical to use that to justify or explain his cruel and cowardly acts. I think it is great that the film does not consider any justification of fascism.\"\n* [[Maribel Verd\u00fa]] as Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper. Del Toro selected Verd\u00fa to play the compassionate revolutionary because he \"saw a sadness in her which he thought would be perfect for the part\".<ref name=\"oscarwatch\"/>\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the [[Faun]] and the Pale Man.

No one else can play this part but you.\" Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, which he did not speak. Jones says he was \"terrified\" and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, \"I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right before I even went in,\" using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|title=Doug Jones En Espanol|access-date=27 January 2007|date=27 December 2006|publisher=CanMag|last=Topel|first=Fred|archive-date=16 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316095803/http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/6216|url-status=live}}</ref> Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Ad\u00e1n, \"an authoritative theatre actor\", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/labyrinth-s-faun-unmasked|title=Labyrinth's faun unmasked|access-date=11 May 2016|date=11 May 2016|publisher=straight.com|last=Eisner|first=Ken|archive-date=19 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519155331/http://www.straight.com/article/labyrinth-s-faun-unmasked|url-status=live}}</ref> Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aintitcool.com/node/31208|title=Capone chats with Abe Sapien, The Faun, The Old Man and The Silver Surfer!!!

He said, 'No, nothing is written'\". L\u00f3pez agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that \"it was exactly the same, it was incredible.

He stated on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|The Charlie Rose Show]]'' that every midnight, he would wake up, and a faun would gradually step out from behind the grandfather's clock.<ref>''Pan's Labyrinth'' DVD, U.S.</ref> Originally, the faun was supposed to be a classic half-man, half-goat faun fraught with beauty. But in the end, the faun was altered into a goat-faced creature almost completely made out of earth, moss, vines, and tree bark. He became a mysterious, semi-suspicious relic who gave both the impression of trustworthiness and many signs that warn someone to never confide in him at all.\n\nDel Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. [[Fernando Tielve]] and \u00cd\u00f1igo Garc\u00e9s, who played the protagonists of ''The Devil's Backbone'', make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in ''Pan's Labyrinth''. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' books, [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[Ficciones]]'', [[Arthur Machen]]'s ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and ''[[The White People]]'', [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s ''The Blessing of Pan'', [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s ''Pan's Garden'' and [[Francisco Goya]]'s works. In 2004, del Toro said: \"''Pan'' is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them.\"<ref>[http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28#28 Del Toro message board, Answers Archive Wed Nov 24, 2004 1:27 am] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050559/http://www.deltorofilms.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=28 |date=27 September 2007 }}, repost from elsewhere; Retrieved on 20 August 2007.</ref> It was also influenced by the illustrations of [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name=\"panspeople\">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1949245,00.html|title=Pan's people|date=17 November 2006|access-date=9 July 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Guillermo|last=del Toro|archive-date=29 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829040243/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1949245,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDel Toro wanted to include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale involved the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide it is better to avoid pain than to be given immortality.

Del Toro himself has said that he considers ''Pan's Labyrinth'' \"a truly profane film, a layman's riff on Catholic dogma\", but that his friend [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] described it as \"a truly Catholic film\".
