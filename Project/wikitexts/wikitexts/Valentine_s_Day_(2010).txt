The screenplay and the story were written by [[Katherine Fugate]], Abby Kohn, and Marc Silverstein. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Eric Dane]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Carter Jenkins]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Taylor Lautner]], [[George Lopez]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Julia Roberts]], Bryce Robinson and [[Taylor Swift]] in her film acting debut. The film received negative reviews but was a box office success.\n\n==Plot==\nFlorist Reed Bennett wakes up and proposes to his girlfriend Morley Clarkson, who accepts. However, Reed's closest friends, Alfonso Rodriguez and Julia Fitzpatrick, aren't surprised when Morley suddenly changes her mind and leaves Reed a few hours later.\n\nOn a flight to [[Los Angeles]], Kate Hazeltine, a captain in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] on a one-day leave, befriends Holden Wilson. Kate is travelling a long distance to get back home only for a short time, and Holden states that she must really be in love to do so. When the plane lands and Kate has to wait hours for the taxi, Holden offers his limousine to allow her to be there on time.\n\nJulia, an elementary school teacher, has fallen in love with cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Harrison Copeland, but does not know that he is married to Pamela. Harrison tells her that he needs to go to [[San Francisco]] for a business trip: on his way, he stops by at Reed's flowershop and orders two flower bouquets - asking for discretion. Wanting to surprise him and despite Reed's warnings, Julia flies to San Francisco, convinced that Reed was wrong. Julia finds out that he is married and finds him at a local restaurant. Dressed as a waitress, Julia makes a scene at the restaurant, making Pamela suspicious.\n\nOne of Julia's students, Edison orders flowers from Reed, to be sent to his teacher. Julia suggests to Edison to give the flowers to a girl named Rani in his class who has a crush on him after telling Edison the meaning of love.\n\nEdison's babysitter Grace Smart is planning to lose her [[virginity]] to her boyfriend Alex Franklin. The planned encounter goes awry when Grace's mother discovers a naked Alex in Grace's room, rehearsing a song he wrote for Grace.\n\nEdison's grandparents, Edgar and Estelle Paddington are facing the troubles of a long marriage. Estelle admits to Edgar about an affair she had with one of his business partners long ago. Although she is deeply sorry, Edgar is very upset.\n\nGrace's high school friends, Willy Harrington and Felicia Miller are experiencing the freshness of new love, and have agreed to wait to have sex.\n\nSean Jackson, a [[closeted]] [[gay]] professional football player, is contemplating the end of his career with his publicist Kara Monahan and his agent Paula Thomas. Kara is organizing her annual \"I Hate Valentine's Day\" party, but soon becomes interested in sports reporter Kelvin Moore, who was ordered to do a Valentine's Day report by his boss Susan Moralez, and who shares Kara's hatred of the holiday.\n\nSubstituting for Paula's absent secretary is one of the firm's receptionists, Liz Curran, who dates mail-room clerk Jason Morris. Jason is shocked when Liz turns out to be moonlighting as a [[phone sex]] operator. Liz explains that she is only doing this because she has a $100,000 student loan to pay off. Jason is upset, but eventually reconciles with her after seeing Edgar forgive Estelle.\n\nSean finally [[coming out|comes out]] on national television, and Holden, Sean's lover, goes back to him. Kate arrives home late at night to greet not her supposed boyfriend but her son Edison. Willy drops Felicia off at home after a date and they kiss. Kelvin and Kara hang out at Kelvin's news station where they later kiss. Alfonso dines with his wife, and Grace and Alex agree to wait to have sex. Edgar and Estelle reconcile and redo their marriage vows, Harrison's wife has left him because of his infidelity and Morley tries to call Reed, who is instead starting a new relationship with Julia. Paula receives a call from one of Liz's [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] clients and takes delight in expressing her dominance and sadism.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Morley Clarkson\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Susan Milton\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Kara Monahan\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Holden Wilson\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Sean Jackson\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Dr. Harrison Copeland\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Edgar Paddington\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Kelvin Moore\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Julia Fitzpatrick\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Jason Morris\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Elizabeth Curran\n* [[Carter Jenkins]] as Alexander Franklin\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Reed Bennett\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Paula Thomas\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as William Harrington\n* [[George Lopez]] as Alfonso Rodriguez\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Estelle Paddington\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Grace Smart\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Cpt.
