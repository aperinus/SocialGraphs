The film stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the title role, alongside [[Teresa Ann Savoy]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[John Steiner]] and [[John Gielgud]]. Producer [[Bob Guccione]], the founder of [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'']] magazine, intended to produce an erotic feature film narrative with high production values and name actors.\n\n[[Gore Vidal]] originated the idea for a film about the controversial Roman emperor and produced a draft screenplay under the working title ''Gore Vidal's Caligula''. The director, [[Tinto Brass]], extensively altered Vidal's original screenplay, however, leading Vidal to disavow the film. The final screenplay focuses on the idea that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\". The producers did not allow Brass to edit the film, and changed its tone and style significantly, adding graphic [[Unsimulated sex|unsimulated sex scenes]] featuring [[List of Penthouse Pets|Penthouse Pets]] as extras filmed in post-production by Guccione and Giancarlo Lui. Brass had refused to film those sequences, as both he and Vidal disagreed with their inclusion. The version of the film released in Italian cinemas in 1979 and in American cinemas the following year, disregarded Brass's intentions to present the film as a [[political satire]], prompting him to disavow the film as well.<ref>[http://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=5 What Culture#14] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806013308/https://whatculture.com/film/17-sex-scenes-that-supposedly-werent-simulated?page=5 |date=August 6, 2020 }}: Caligula</ref>\n\n''Caligula''{{'}}s release was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content; multiple cut versions were released worldwide, while its uncut form remains banned in several countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.refused-classification.com/censorship/films/caligula-1979.html |title=Film Censorship: Caligula (1979) |work=Refused-Classification.com |access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref> However, the film is considered to be a [[cult classic]]<ref name=Hawes1>{{cite book|last=Hawes|first=William |title=Caligula and the Fight for Artistic Freedom: The Making, Marketing and Impact of the Bob Guccione Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oflL1anesoYC&pg=PA1|date= 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5240-8|page=1}}</ref> with significant merit for its political content and historical portrayal.<ref>{{cite book |title=A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow |year=1980\u20131989 |author=Stephen Prince |page=350}}</ref> It is also considered to be the one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Caligula (1979)|worst films ever made]].\n\nThe script was later adapted into a [[novelisation]] written by [[William Joseph Johnston (novelist)|William Johnston]] under the pseudonym William Howard.<ref name=\"Spencer\">{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=David |date=January\u2013February 2010 |url=http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |title=IAMTW's Grand Master Scribe Award, The ''Faust'', Goes to the Genre's Most Prolific Practitioner |journal=Tied-In: The Newsletter of the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |publisher=International Association of Media Tie-in Writers |location=Calabasas, California |volume=4 |issue=1 |access-date=26 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084524/http://iamtw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/news-1-10.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018, ''Penthouse'' announced that a new Director's Cut of the film was being edited by [[Alexander Tuschinski]], with the approval of Brass's family.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Citation|last=Tuschinski|first=Alexander|title=Mission: Caligula|date=2018-07-26|url=https://vimeo.com/281814277|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> No release date for that cut has been confirmed.

One morning, a blackbird flies into his room; Caligula considers this a bad omen. Shortly afterward, one of the heads of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]], tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at [[Capri]], where the Emperor lives with his close friend [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]], dim-witted relative [[Claudius]], and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius's grandson) [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover [[Julia Drusilla|Drusilla]] persuades him to go.\n\nAt Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal diseases]], and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading [[sex show]]s that include deformed people and animals. Caligula observes with fascination and horror. Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus. Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve. Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.\n\nAfter Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the  [[Roman Senate]]. Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula sets up a [[Kangaroo court|mock trial]] in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]] banished from Rome. After Macro is executed in a gruesome [[Ludi|public game]], Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator [[Cassius Chaerea|Chaerea]] as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nDrusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess [[Isis]], the cult they secretly practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]], a priestess and notorious [[courtesan]], after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.\n\nAfter discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula develops a severe fever. Drusilla nurses him back to health. Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]]. During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he had had. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird.  Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever. Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula has a [[nervous breakdown]] and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body.\n\nNow in a deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla. After a brief stay in a city gaol, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe. The new reign he leads becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Rome{{mdash}}senators' wives are forced to work in the service of the state as prostitutes, estates are confiscated, the old religion is desecrated and the army is made to embark on a mock invasion of Britain. Unable to further tolerate his actions, Longinus conspires with Chaerea to assassinate Caligula.\n\nCaligula enters his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him. Another blackbird appears but only Caesonia is frightened of it. The next morning, after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea. Caesonia and Julia are murdered, and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach. With his final breath, the Emperor defiantly whimpers \"I live!\" as Caligula and his family's bodies are thrown down the stadium's steps and their blood is washed off the marble floor. Claudius witnesses the entire ordeal and is horrified even after being proclaimed Emperor by the Praetorian Guard.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast listed in order of closing credits-->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Caligula]]\n* [[Teresa Ann Savoy]] as [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]]\n* [[Guido Mannari]] as [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]]\n** [[Patrick Allen]] as Macro (English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)<ref name=Hawes233 />\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Marcus Cocceius Nerva (jurist)|Nerva]]\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Tiberius]]\n* [[Giancarlo Badessi]] as [[Claudius]]\n* Bruno Brive as [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]]\n* [[Adriana Asti]] as [[Ennia Thrasylla|Ennia]]\n* [[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Charicles\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as [[Cassius Chaerea]]\n** [[Joss Ackland]] as Cassius Chaerea (English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] voice) (uncredited)\n* [[John Steiner]] as Longinus\n* [[Mirella D'Angelo]] as [[Julia Livilla|Livilla]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Caesonia]]\n* [[Rick Parets|Richard Parets]] as [[Mnester]]\n* Paula Mitchell as Subura Singer\n* [[Osiride Pevarello]] as Giant\n* Donato Placido as Proculus\n* [[Anneka Di Lorenzo]] as [[Messalina]]\n* Lori Wagner as [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]]\n* Valerie Rae Clark as Imperial Brothel Worker \n* Susanne Saxon as Imperial Brothel Worker\n* Jane Hargrave as Imperial Brothel Worker\n* Carolyn Patsis as Imperial Brothel Worker\n* Bonnie Dee Wilson as Imperial Brothel Worker\n* as [[Incitatus|Caligula's horse]] (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Gore Vidal 3 Shankbone 2009 NYC cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gore Vidal]] was paid $200,000 to write the screenplay for ''Caligula'';<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> ultimately, the film credited no official screenwriter, only that it was \"adapted from a screenplay\" by Vidal.]]\n\nThe men's magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' had long been involved in film funding, helping invest in films made by other studios, including ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'', but it had never produced a film on its own.<ref name=\"Guccione interview\"/> The magazine's founder [[Bob Guccione]] wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor [[Caligula]].<ref name=epicencyclopedia115>{{cite book|author1=Constantine Santas|author2=James M.
