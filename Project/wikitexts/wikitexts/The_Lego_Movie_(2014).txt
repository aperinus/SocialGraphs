Based on the [[Lego]] line of [[construction toy]]s, its story focuses on Emmet, an ordinary [[Lego minifigure]] who helps a [[resistance movement]] stop a tyrannical businessman from gluing everything in the Lego world into his vision of perfection.

By August 2009, it was announced that [[The Hageman Brothers|Dan and Kevin Hageman]] were writing the script. [[Chris McKay]] was brought in to co-direct the film in 2011. It was strongly inspired by the visual aesthetic and stylistics of [[Brickfilm]]s and qualities attributed to [[Lego Studios]] sets. While tried to make the film's animation replicate a [[stop motion]] film, everything was done through computer graphics, with the [[Skeletal animation|animation rigs]] following the same articulation limits actual Lego figures have. Much of the cast were signed in to voice the characters in 2012, while the animation was provided by [[Animal Logic]]. [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] composed the film's musical score. The film was dedicated to Kathleen Fleming, the former director of entertainment development of the Lego company, following her death in [[Canc\u00fan, Mexico]], in April 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/kathleen-fleming-lego-production-exec-dies-at-39-1200449770/|title=Kathleen Fleming, Lego Production Exec, Dies at 39|work=Variety|date=May 3, 2013|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506114938/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/kathleen-fleming-lego-production-exec-dies-at-39-1200449770/|archive-date=May 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|language=es|url=https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2013/05/07/897932|title=Muere turista canadiense al caer de un balc\u00f3n en Canc\u00fan|date=May 8, 2013|website=Exc\u00e9lsior|access-date=February 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203030720/https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2013/05/07/897932|archive-date=February 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA [[Co-production (media)|collaboration]] between [[Production company|production houses]] from the United States, Australia, and Denmark, it was produced by [[Warner Animation Group]], [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], [[The Lego Group|Lego System A/S]], [[Rideback (production company)|Lin Pictures]] and [[Vertigo Entertainment]]. ''The Lego Movie'' premiered in Los Angeles on February 1, 2014, and was released in the United States on February 7. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $468.1 million worldwide against its $60\u201365 million budget, and received critical acclaim for its animation, story, humor and acting. The [[National Board of Review]] selected ''The Lego Movie'' as one of the top films of the year. It received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]], among [[List of accolades received by The Lego Movie|numerous other accolades]]. ''The Lego Movie'' is the first entry in what would become the [[The Lego Movie (franchise)|franchise of the same name]], which includes three more films\u2014''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017), ''[[The Lego Ninjago Movie]]'' (2017), and ''[[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn the [[Lego]] universe, the wizard Vitruvius fails to protect a superweapon called the \"Kragle\" from the evil Lord Business, but prophesies that a person called \"The Special\" will find the Piece of Resistance capable of stopping the Kragle. Lord Business claims it untrue and kicks Vitruvius off a cliff.\n\n8 1/2 years later in Bricksburg, construction worker [[Emmet Brickowski]] comes across Wyldstyle, a woman searching for something at Emmet's construction site. Emmet falls into a pit and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences visions and passes out.\n\nHe awakens in the custody of Bad Cop, Business's lieutenant, with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back. Emmet learns of Business's plans to freeze the world with the Kragle, a tube of [[Krazy Glue]] with the label partially rubbed out; the Piece of Resistance is the tube's cap. Wyldstyle rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special. They escape Bad Cop and travel to \"[[American frontier|The Old West]]\" where they meet a blind Vitruvius. He and Wyldstyle are Master Builders, capable of building anything without instruction manuals, who oppose Business's attempts to suppress their creativity. Though disappointed Emmet is not a Master Builder, they are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of \"the Man Upstairs\".\n\nEmmet, Wyldstyle, and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with [[Batman]]'s help and escape to Cloud Cuckoo Land where all the master builders are in hiding. The Master Builders are unimpressed with Emmet's cowardliness  and refuse to help him fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack and capture everyone except Emmet and his friends. Fellow Master Builder MetalBeard rescues Emmet from drowning and Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's headquarters and disarm the Kragle. The plan almost succeeds until Emmet and his friends are captured and imprisoned. Lord Business murders Vitruvius by decapitating him with a penny, throws the Piece of Resistance into an abyss, and sets his headquarters to self-destruct, leaving all present to die. Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy as he dies, but his spirit returns to tell Emmet it is his self-belief that makes him the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet flings himself off the edge in the tower and saves his friends and the Master Builders. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight Business's forces.\n\nEmmet finds himself in the human world where the events of his life are being played out in a basement by a young boy, Finn, on his father's Lego set. The father \u2014 \"The Man Upstairs\" \u2014 chastises his son for creating hodgepodges of different playsets and begins to permanently glue his perceived perfect creations together. Realizing the danger, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. In the human world, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and sees how he based the villainous Business on him. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is very special and has the power to change everything. Finn's father reconciles with his son, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle with the Piece of Resistance, and ungluing his victims with [[mineral spirits]] as Wyldstyle and Emmet enter a relationship. As Finn's younger sister joins in playing with the Lego sets, [[Duplo]] aliens arrive in the Lego universe and threaten destruction.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part]]'' (2019)}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of The Lego Movie characters{{!}}List of ''The Lego Movie'' characters}}\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Emmet Brickowski]], an [[everyman]] and [[construction worker]] from Bricksburg who is initially mistaken for the Special.\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Lord Business, an evil businessman who hates Master Builders, tyrant of Bricksburg and the Lego Universe who is the company president of the [[Octan|Octan Corporation]] under the name President Business.<ref name=USATodayMeet>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title='The Lego Movie' hopes to cement a built-in fan base|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/23/lego-movie-peek-will-ferrell/2918385/|access-date=October 24, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024043838/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/23/lego-movie-peek-will-ferrell/2918385/|archive-date=October 24, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-will-ferrell-liam-neeson-388097|title=Lego: Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson Join Animated Film|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 9, 2012|access-date=April 7, 2013|archive-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141850/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-will-ferrell-liam-neeson-388097|url-status=live}}</ref> \n** Ferrell also plays \"The Man Upstairs\", a Lego collector and Finn's father in the live-action part of the film.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Vitruvius, a blind and elderly wizard-like Master Builder.\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Lucy / Wyldstyle, a \"tough as nails\" and tech-savvy Master Builder.<ref name=\"EWKnowAllTheStuff\">{{cite magazine |last= Busis |first= Hillary |title= Want to know all the stuff 'The Lego Movie' is riffing on?
