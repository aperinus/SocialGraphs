It stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Uma Thurman]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Alan Arkin]] appearing in supporting roles.<ref name=challenging/> The film presents a [[biopunk]] vision of a future society driven by [[eugenics]] where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/resources/narrative-perspectives-neuroethics-in-books-and-film/ |title=NEUROETHICS &#124; The Narrative Perspectives |publisher=Neuroethics.upenn.edu |access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref> The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome [[genetic discrimination]] to realize his dream of going into space.\n\nThe film draws on concerns over [[reproductive technologies]] that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of [[destiny]] and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in ''Gattaca'' continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.\n\nThe film's title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]], the four [[nucleobases]] of [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html |title=Now: The Rest of the Genome |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |date=November 10, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> It was a 1997 nominee for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the \"not-too-distant\" future, [[eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those created as \"Valids\" while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"In-Valids\". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify Valids to qualify for professional employment while In-Valids are relegated to menial jobs.\n\nVincent Freeman was conceived naturally and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use IVF, PIGD, and genetic engineering in creating their second child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]\" by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\n\nYears later, Vincent works as an In-Valid, cleaning office spaces including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to masquerade as a Valid by using donated hair, skin, blood and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned as navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples, and hide his heart defect.\n\nWhen a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a [[Launch window|possible launch]], the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes near the crime scene.  Recognizing it as from an In-Valid rather than an employee, they immediately assume the owner to be a suspect and  launch an investigation. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, with whom he shares a mutual attraction. Though a Valid, Irene has an accidental higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing [[Silver medal|silver]] in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet still wasn't, and suffers under the 'burden of perfection'.\n\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigators. It is finally revealed that one of Gattaca's directors (Josef) killed the mission director because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent's presence at Gattaca. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton, unwilling to believe this, challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent's stamina surprises Anton, and Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him again and swims them both back to shore, proving to Anton that his status does not define him.\n\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last 'two lifetimes' upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open 'upstairs'. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final urine test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees health checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a Valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether he, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results, allowing Vincent to pass. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; in space, Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find a lock of Jerome's hair. As the film ends, Vincent muses that \"For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth = 25em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Vincent Freeman, impersonating Jerome Eugene Morrow\n** [[Mason Gamble]] as young Vincent\n** Chad Christ as teenage Vincent\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Irene Cassini\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jerome Eugene Morrow\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Anton Freeman\n** Vincent Nielson as young Anton\n** [[William Lee Scott]] as teenage Anton\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Director Josef\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Dr. Lamar\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Marie Freeman\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Antonio Freeman\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as delivery nurse\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as geneticist\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Caesar\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as German\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Detective Hugo\n* [[Dean Norris]] as cop on the beat\n* [[Ken Marino]] as sequencing technician\n* Cynthia Martells as Cavendish\n* [[Gabrielle Reece]] as Gattaca trainer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:CLA building complex.JPG|thumb|right|[[CLA Building]] complex]]\n[[File:Marin Civic Center interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marin County Civic Center]]]]\n\nThe film was shot under the working title ''The Eighth Day'', a reference to the seven days of creation in the Bible.
