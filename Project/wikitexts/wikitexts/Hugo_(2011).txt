Despite receiving acclaim from critics, the film was considered a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]], grossing just $185 million against its estimated $150 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1931 [[Paris]], 12-year-old Hugo Cabret lives with his widowed father, a clockmaker who works at a museum. Hugo's father finds a broken [[automaton]] \u2013 a mechanical man created to write with a pen. He and Hugo try to repair it, documenting their work in a notebook. When his father dies in a fire, Hugo goes to live with his father's alcoholic brother, Uncle Claude, who maintains the clocks at [[Gare Montparnasse]] railway station. When Claude goes missing, Hugo continues maintaining the clocks, fearing that the Station Inspector named Gustave Dast\u00e9 will send him away if Claude's absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine requires a heart-shaped key.\n\nHugo is caught stealing parts from a toy store, and the owner, Georges, takes his notebook, threatening to destroy it. Georges' [[godparent|goddaughter]] Isabelle suggests that Hugo confront Georges and demand it back. Georges proposes that Hugo work at his toy store as recompense, and after some time he might return the notebook. Hugo accepts and commences work, in addition to his job maintaining the clocks. Isabelle and Hugo become fast friends, and Hugo is astonished to see she wears a heart-shaped key, given to her by Georges. Hugo shows her the automaton, which they activate with the key. It draws a scene from the 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', once described to Hugo by his father. Isabelle identifies the drawing's signature as that of \"[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]\" \u2013 her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of drawings, but they are discovered by Georges.\n\nSeveral days later, at the Film Academy Library, Hugo and Isabelle find a book about the history of cinema that praises M\u00e9li\u00e8s' contributions. They meet the book's author, Ren\u00e9 Tabard, a film expert who is surprised to hear M\u00e9li\u00e8s is alive, as he disappeared after [[World War I]] along with the copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet M\u00e9li\u00e8s again, Ren\u00e9 agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges' home to show his copy of ''A Trip to the Moon''.\n\nFinding the heart-shaped key on the station railway tracks, Hugo drops down to the track to retrieve it, and is run over by [[Montparnasse derailment|an out-of-control train that smashes through the station]]. He wakes up from the nightmare, but hears an ominous ticking emanating from himself, and discovers he has been turned into the automaton. Hugo [[False awakening|wakes up again]]: it was only another nightmare.\n\nAt Georges\u2019 home, his wife Jeanne allows them in after Ren\u00e9 recognises her as [[Jeanne d'Alcy]], an actress in many of M\u00e9li\u00e8s' films. They play the film, waking Georges, who is finally convinced to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dreams. Georges recounts that, as a stage magician, he was fascinated by motion pictures and used film to create imaginative works through his [[Star Film Company]]. Forced into bankruptcy after the war, he closed his studio and sold his films. He laments that even an automaton he built and donated to a museum was lost; Hugo realizes it is the one he has repaired.\n\nHugo races to the station to retrieve the automaton but is caught by Gustave, who has learned of Claude's death. Gustave threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Hugo runs away and manages to evade Gustave by hiding on the outer face of the clock tower, precariously balancing hundreds of feet above the ground. After climbing back down, Hugo races to escape the station but drops the automaton on the tracks. He jumps down to retrieve it and is almost run over by a train, but Gustave saves him and the automaton. Georges arrives and tells Gustave, \"This boy belongs to me.\"\n\nSometime later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by Ren\u00e9. Hugo and his new family celebrate at the apartment, and Isabelle begins to write down Hugo's own story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as [[Hugo Cabret]]\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Isabelle\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] / Papa Georges\n* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as Inspector Gustave Dast\u00e9\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Claude Cabret\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Lisette\n* [[Jude Law]] as Mr. Cabret\n* [[Helen McCrory]] as [[Jehanne D'Alcy]] / Mama Jeanne\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Ren\u00e9 Tabard\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Monsieur Labisse\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Madame Emile\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Monsieur Frick\n* [[Kevin Eldon]] as policeman\n* [[Gulliver McGrath]] as young Tabard\n* [[Angus Barnett]] as a cinema manager\n* [[Ben Addis]] as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]\n* Emil Lager as [[Django Reinhardt]]\n* Robert Gill as [[James Joyce]]\n* Marco Aponte as Train Engineer Assistant\n}}\n\n[[Michael Pitt]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Brian Selznick]] have [[cameo appearance|cameo roles]].\n\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[GK Films]] acquired the screen rights to ''The Invention of Hugo Cabret'' shortly after the book was published in 2007.

Many of the early silent films shown in the movie are M\u00e9li\u00e8s' actual works, such as ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le voyage dans la lune]]'' (1902). However, the film does not mention M\u00e9li\u00e8s' two children, his brother Gaston (who worked with M\u00e9li\u00e8s during his film-making career), or his first wife Eug\u00e9nie, who was married to M\u00e9li\u00e8s during the time he made films (and who died in 1913).

The book is symbolic, as Hugo must avoid the \"righteous\" law enforcement (Inspector Gustave) to live in the station and later to restore the automaton both to a functioning status and to its rightful owner. The particular copy given to Hugo looks like the 1917 English-language edition (David McKay publisher, Philadelphia, United States) with cover and interior illustrations by N.C.
