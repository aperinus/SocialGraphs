The film stars [[Gerard Butler]] (who also co-produced), [[Aaron Eckhart]], and [[Morgan Freeman]] with [[Angela Bassett]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Cole Hauser]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Radha Mitchell]], and [[Rick Yune]] in supporting roles. The plot depicts a [[North Korea]]n-led [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] assault on the [[White House]], and focuses on disgraced [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Mike Banning's efforts to rescue [[U.S. President]] Benjamin Asher.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on March 22, 2013, by [[FilmDistrict]], and grossed $170 million against a $70 million production budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Fuqua's direction and Butler's performance, but criticized the overt violence and screenplay. ''Olympus Has Fallen'' was one of two films released in 2013 that depicted a terrorist attack against the White House; the other was ''[[White House Down]]''.\n\nA sequel, titled ''[[London Has Fallen]]'', was released on March 4, 2016, with the principal cast members reprising their roles, and a third film, ''[[Angel Has Fallen]]'', was released on August 23, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Ranger]], Mike Banning, is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent and detail leader in the Presidential Protection Division, maintaining a personal, friendly relationship with [[President of the United States|President]] Benjamin Asher, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Margaret, and their son Connor. On a snowy Christmas drive from [[Camp David]] to a campaign fundraiser, the [[Presidential state car (United States)|Presidential Limo]] transporting the [[First Family]] spins out of control on an icy bridge. Banning pulls Asher from the vehicle, but Margaret falls to her death.\n\nEighteen months later, Banning works at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], having been removed from the presidential detail. During Asher's meeting with [[South Korean Prime Minister]] Lee Tae-Woo at the [[White House]], the Koreans for United Freedom (KUF), a North Korean [[terrorist]] group led by Kang Yeonsak, mounts an air attack (with a [[USAF]] [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]]) and a large group of ground assault mercenaries to capture the building and kill most of the White House defense force. Aided by rogue members of the prime minister's own security detail, including ex-Secret Service Agent-turned-private security contractor Dave Forbes, they hold Asher and several top officials hostage in the [[PEOC]], executing Lee on live video. Before being killed, Agent Roma alerts [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Secret Service Director]] Lynne Jacobs that \"Olympus has fallen.\" Banning joins the White House's defenders during KUF's initial assault. He falls back into the White House, disabling internal surveillance and using Asher's satellite earphone to contact Jacobs and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Allan Trumbull, now [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]], in [[the Pentagon]]'s emergency briefing room, who authorize him to proceed.\n\nKang uses Asher's hostage status to force Trumbull to withdraw the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] and the [[United States Forces Korea|U.S. Forces]] from the [[Korean Peninsula]], removing American opposition to a third [[Korean War]]. He seeks to detonate the [[American nuclear arsenal]] to turn North America into an irradiated wasteland, as revenge for the death of his mother. To do this, he needs the access codes to the Cerberus system, held only by Asher, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Ruth McMillan, and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] Joseph Hoenig, all of whom are inside the PEOC. Asher orders McMillan and Hoenig to reveal their codes to save their lives, certain that he will not give up his own code.\n\nAfter finding Connor hiding in the building's walls and sneaking him to safety, preventing Kang from using him to force Asher to reveal his Cerberus code, Banning kills several of the commandos, including Forbes. [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[General (United States)|General]] Edward Clegg convinces Trumbull to order an aerial [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] assault on the White House. The KUF discovers and decimates the assault force using the advanced Hydra 6 anti-aircraft system. Kang retaliates by executing [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Charlie Rodriguez.\n\nBanning disables Kang's communications and provokes him into bringing several of his men into the open, killing them when they attempt to execute McMillan in front of the media and before they can retreat back to the bunker. With the KUF dwindling, Kang fakes his and Asher's death by sacrificing several of his commandos and the remaining hostages in a helicopter explosion; Banning sees through the ruse. With two codes already in hand, Kang eventually cracks Asher's code using a [[brute-force attack]] and activates Cerberus. Banning ambushes and kills Kang's remaining men when they attempt to escape with Asher. In the ensuing fight, Asher is shot, but Banning eventually stabs Kang in the head, killing him. Informed by Asher about Cerberus, Banning deactivates it with the assistance of Trumbull and his staff.\n\nBanning escorts Asher out of the White House to receive medical attention. Afterwards, Banning is reinstated to the head of the president's security detail as Asher speaks about the aftermath of the attack, assuring that America will prevail.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]]

For example, computers were used to create nearly all of the opening sequence in which the First Lady is killed in a car accident, with [[chroma key]] greenscreen technology used to composite the actors into the computer-generated snowy scenery. For scenes where actors walked in or out of the White House, a first-floor fa\u00e7ade and entrance were built; computers added the second floor, roof, and downtown D.C. cityscape. Action scenes with the White House in the background were filmed in open fields and the White House and D.C. were added in post-production.<ref>Ian Failes, [http://www.fxguide.com/featured/how-vfx-saved-washington-olympus-has-fallen/ \"How VFX saved Washington: Olympus Has Fallen\"].
