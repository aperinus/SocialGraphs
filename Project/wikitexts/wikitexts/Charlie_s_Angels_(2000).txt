It is the first installment in the [[Charlie's Angels (franchise)|''Charlie's Angels'' film series]], a continuation of the [[Charlie's Angels|television series of the same name]] created by [[Ivan Goff]] and [[Ben Roberts (writer)|Ben Roberts]], which is also a continuation of the series story. Unlike the original series, which had dramatic elements, the film features more comical elements.\n\nIt stars [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and [[Lucy Liu]] as three women working in a private detective agency in [[Los Angeles]]. [[John Forsythe]] reprised his role as the unseen Charlie's voice from the original series. [[Bill Murray]] also stars as [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]], replacing [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] who played the role in the original series. It also stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Tim Curry]] and [[Kelly Lynch]] while [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt LeBlanc]], [[Luke Wilson]] and [[Tom Green]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nIt was released on November 3, 2000, in the United States by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] under its [[Columbia Pictures]] label, and has grossed $264 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Diaz, Barrymore, Liu and Murray as well as its action sequences and humor, but criticisms aimed at the plot and \"lack of originality\".<ref name=\"metacritic\" />\n\n==Plot==\nNatalie Cook, Dylan Sanders, and Alex Munday are the \"Angels\", three talented, tough, attractive women who work as [[private investigator]]s together for unseen millionaire Charlie Townsend. Charlie uses speakers in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|Bosley]] works with them directly when needed.\n\nCharlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox, a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. He is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin, who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar.\n\nThe Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot a suspicious-looking man that they had previously seen from surveillance videos of Knox's kidnapping. Dubbing him the \"Thin Man\", the Angels chase him down and fight him; he gets away, but the Angels find Knox, safely held nearby.\n\nAfter the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood, Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Thin Man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer.\n\nDylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, and they end up having sex. Afterwards, he betrays her; simultaneously, attacks are made on Natalie and Alex, Bosley is captured by Vivian, and Corwin is murdered by the Thin Man. Knox tells Dylan his kidnapping was all faked to get the Angels to help him access the Redstar satellite network. He plans to use it along with his voice recognition software to find and kill Charlie, who Knox asserts killed his father in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nDylan escapes and reunites with Natalie and Alex, who also survived their attacks. They approach Charlie's office just as the building explodes. They find a radio receiver that Bosley is able to communicate through via a tooth implanted radio transmitter. Bosley provides enough information of where he's captured to allow Natalie to deduce its location, an abandoned lighthouse. With help from Dylan's boyfriend Chad, the Angels stealthily approach it. Upon finding Knox, Dylan is captured by his henchmen, and is tied up and gagged.\n\nThe Angels are too late to stop Knox from determining Charlie's location, though they rescue Bosley while Dylan fights off her captors. They come together to defeat Vivian, the Thin Man, and other assorted henchmen, but Knox blows up the lighthouse and flies off in an attack helicopter towards Charlie's house. Bosley helps the Angels board it, where Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards; blowing up the helicopter and killing Knox while the Angels land safely.\n\nSeeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the nearby beach house that Knox had targeted, but he has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie also tells them that Knox's father was an undercover double agent; he was discovered and killed by the enemy, but not by Charlie.\n\nWhen he speaks to the Angels by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan suspects she sees him nearby talking into a cell phone, but does not tell the group; opting to raise a toast to Charlie instead. Bosley playfully douses the Angels with his drink, and they chase him towards the ocean. From afar, a silhouetted Charlie watches them and walks off.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Charlies Angels movie still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the most widely reproduced publicity images from ''Charlie's Angels'' features (L to R) Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Barrymore in defensive posture as they prepare to subdue The Thin Man.]]\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Natalie Cook\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Dylan Sanders\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as Alex Munday\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]]\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Eric Knox\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Vivian Wood\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as the Thin Man, a mysterious assassin \n* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as Jason Gibbons, Alex's boyfriend\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Pete Kominsky, Natalie's love interest\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Roger Corwin, head of communications-satellite company Redstar\n* [[John Forsythe]] as the voice of Charles \"Charlie\" Townsend, the owner of the Townsend agency\n* [[Tom Green]] as Chad, a fisherman whom Dylan is dating\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Mr. Jones, Dylan's secret identity in the first scene\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Doris, a secretary at Redstar\n* [[Sean Whalen]] as Pasqual, a terrorist \n* [[Karen McDougal]] as Roger Corwin's girlfriend\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to [[Thandiwe Newton]], she was the original choice for Alex Munday, but declined as she did not want to be \"objectified\" or play racial stereotypes.
