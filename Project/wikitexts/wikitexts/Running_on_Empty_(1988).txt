The incident accidentally blinded and paralyzed a janitor who was not supposed to be there.  They have been on the run ever since, relying on an underground network of supporters who help them financially.  At the time of the incident, their son Danny was two years old. As the film begins, he is in his late teens, and the family, now with younger son Harry, are again relocating and assuming new identities.\n\nDanny's overwhelming talent as a [[pianist]] catches the attention of his music teacher at school.  The teacher begins to pry into Danny's personal life, particularly questioning why records from his previous school are unobtainable.  While he pushes Danny to audition for [[Juilliard]], Danny also falls in love with Lorna, the teacher's teenage daughter.\n\nAs the pressure to have his own life and realize his own dreams intensifies, Danny reveals his family secret to Lorna.  Meanwhile, Annie finds out about Danny's audition and begins to come to terms with the fact that she must let her son go and find his own way.  This does not sit well with Arthur even as Annie risks their safety to contact her estranged father and arrange a home and life for Danny if they should decide to leave him behind.\n\nWhen Arthur hears on the radio that one of their underground colleagues has been shot and killed running from the authorities, he realizes that it is better for his son to pursue his dreams than to continue living a dangerous life on the run from crimes for which Danny bears no responsibility.  The family leaves Danny behind and heads off for their next identity in a new town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Danny Pope\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Annie Pope\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Arthur Pope\n* Jonas Abry as Harry Pope\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Lorna Phillips\n* Ed Crowley as Mr. Phillips (Lorna's father)\n* [[Steven Hill]] as Donald Patterson (Annie's father)\n* [[Augusta Dabney]] as Abigail Patterson (Annie's mother)\n* [[L.
