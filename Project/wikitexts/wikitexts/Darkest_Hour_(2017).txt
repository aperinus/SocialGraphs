The film is an account of [[Winston Churchill]]'s early days as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] during the [[Second World War]] and the [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis]], depicting his refusal to seek a peace treaty with [[Nazi Germany]] amid their advance into Western Europe.

Chamberlain tells [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] colleagues he wants [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] as his successor, but Halifax does not feel he is right at that time. Chamberlain [[Norway Debate|decides to choose]] the only man whom the opposition parties will accept as the leader of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|national government]]: [[Winston Churchill]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], who correctly predicted the danger from [[Adolf Hitler]] before the war.\n\nThe next morning, [[Manstein Plan|Germany invades the Low Countries]]. Churchill is brusque with his new secretary [[Elizabeth Nel|Elizabeth Layton]] for mishearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine]]. King [[George VI]], who strongly distrusts Churchill due to his support for his brother [[Edward VIII]] during the [[Abdication of Edward VIII|abdication crisis]], reluctantly invites him to [[Churchill war ministry|form a government]]. Churchill includes Chamberlain (as [[Lord President of the Council]]) and Halifax (as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]]). Churchill has a poor reputation in Parliament because of his record in the [[Admiralty (United Kingdom)|Admiralty]], his role in the disastrous [[Gallipoli campaign]] in the First World War, his views on [[British Raj|India]], [[Russian civil war]] and his past defection to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\nParliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising \"[[Blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]\". Chamberlain and Halifax are appalled by Churchill's refusal to negotiate for peace and plan to resign from the government to force a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]], creating a situation in which Halifax would be likely to become the Prime Minister.\n\nChurchill visits [[Paul Reynaud|French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud]], who thinks Churchill delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the [[Battle of France]], while Churchill becomes furious that the French do not have a plan to counterattack. Although [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|US President Franklin Roosevelt]] is sympathetic to Churchill's plight, his actions are limited by an [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]]. Churchill draws ire from his cabinet and advisers for delivering a radio address in which he falsely implies the Allies to be advancing in France, earning him a rebuke from the King. Halifax and Chamberlain continue to push to use Italian Ambassador [[Giuseppe Bastianini]] as an intermediary with Germany.\n\nThe [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] is [[Battle of Dunkirk|trapped at Dunkirk]] and [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Calais]], and Britain begins preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]]. Against the advice of the War Cabinet Churchill orders [[Claude Nicholson (British Army officer)|Brigadier Nicholson]] in Calais to lead the [[30th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|30th Infantry Brigade]] to distract the enemy and buy time for the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk. Layton tells Churchill that her brother was killed during the retreat.\n\nThe debacle in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace, but chokes on the words as he tries to dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King explains that he has come to support Churchill to continue the war. Churchill's idea of a \"small boats\" evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]], is initiated. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the [[London Underground]] (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers their opinions; the civilians all want to continue to fight Hitler. Churchill addresses the Outer Cabinet<ref>To ensure that military decisions could be taken quickly without lengthy discussion, only a few chosen ministers sat in the small inner War Cabinet</ref> and other Members of Parliament and rallies their support.\n\nAs Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides first to listen to the address. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" should the Germans invade, to resounding support from the Opposition, while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]] MPs behind him sit silently, until Chamberlain mops his brow with his handkerchief, a prearranged signal that they should support the PM. Churchill exits the chamber to cheers and enthusiastic waving of [[Order Paper|order papers]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Top credited (longer than normal) in scrolling credits order, with character names as credited --->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Winston Churchill]]\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as [[Clementine Churchill]]\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as [[George VI|King George VI]]\n* [[Lily James]] as [[Elizabeth Nel|Elizabeth Layton]]\n* [[Ronald Pickup]] as [[Neville Chamberlain]]\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Viscount Halifax]]\n* [[Nicholas Jones (actor)|Nicholas Jones]] as [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]]\n* [[Samuel West]] as [[Anthony Eden]]{{efn|West is credited as playing \"Sir\" Anthony Eden, though Eden did not become a knight until 1954.}}\n* [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] as [[Clement Attlee]]\n* [[Richard Lumsden]] as [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]]\n* [[Malcolm Storry]] as [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|General Ironside]]\n* [[Hilton McRae]] as [[Arthur Greenwood]]\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]]\n* [[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]] as John Evans\n* [[Adrian Rawlins]] as [[Hugh Dowding|Air Chief Marshal Dowding]]\n* [[David Bamber]] as [[Bertram Ramsay|Admiral Ramsay]]\n* Paul Leonard as [[Dudley Pound|Admiral Dudley Pound]]\n* [[Demetri Goritsas]] as Cabinet Secretary Bridges\n* [[Olivier Broche]] as [[Paul Reynaud]]\n* [[Brian Pettifer]] as [[Kingsley Wood]]{{div col end}}\n\n[[David Strathairn]] provides the voice of [[Franklin D.

The situation in 1940 was as dire as depicted, but liberties were taken with the facts.  The shouting matches over possible peace negotiations were fictional. The journey on the [[London Underground]] was also fictional, and there is evidence that many British people were not immediately inspired by Churchill's speeches.<ref name= \"Broich\">{{cite news|last = Broich |first =John |title= What's Fact and What's Fiction in Darkest Hour |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/12/08/what_s_fact_and_what_s_fiction_in_darkest_hour.html |access-date= 4 February 2018|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |date= 8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence that Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax were planning an imminent vote of no confidence, though that threat existed until the mid-war victories in [[North African campaign|North Africa]].  It is a fact that Churchill was an object of suspicion for his fellow Tories.<ref name= \"Broich\" /> The Labour Party confirmed that they would serve in a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|national government]] under a leader other than Chamberlain, but did not name Churchill.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://gulfnews.com/culture/books/how-churchill-replaced-chamberlain-1.2158652 |publisher=[[Al Nisr Publishing]] | title= How Churchill replaced Chamberlain |work=[[Gulf News]]| first= Richard | last= Overy | date=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Adam Gopnik]] wrote: \"... in late May of 1940, when the Conservative grandee Lord Halifax challenged Churchill, insisting that it was still possible to negotiate a deal with Hitler, through the good offices of Mussolini, it was the steadfast [[Anti-fascism|anti-Nazism]] of [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] and his Labour colleagues that saved the day \u2013 a vital truth badly underdramatized in the current Churchill-centric film, ''Darkest Hour''\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url= https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/never-mind-churchill-clement-attlee-is-a-model-for-these-times | title= Never Mind Churchill, Clement Attlee Is a Model for These Times | magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] | date=2 January 2018 | access-date= 16 April 2018 | first=Adam | last=Gopnik}}</ref> This criticism was echoed by Adrian Smith, emeritus professor of modern history at the [[University of Southampton]], who wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that the film was \"yet again overlooking Labour's key role at the most dangerous moment in this country's history ... in May 1940 its leaders gave Churchill the unequivocal support he needed when refusing to surrender.

This was impossible because radio broadcasts from Parliament did not start until the 1970s. Churchill did record the speech for posterity, but he did not make the recording until 1949. Nor did he, unlike some other speeches, repeat that speech on the radio shortly after giving it in Parliament.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://history.blog.gov.uk/2013/12/02/we-shall-fight-on-the-beaches-three-things-you-never-knew-about-churchills-most-famous-speech/ | publisher = [[gov.uk|Government of the United Kingdom]] | title = We shall fight on the beaches: three things you never knew about Churchill's most famous speech | date = 2 December 2013 |access-date=24 August 2018 |first=Richard |last=Toye |work=History of Government}}</ref> The 'beaches' speech was first delivered on 4 June 1940 \u2013 after the [[Dunkirk evacuation]]s, not on 28 May 1940 as suggested by the film.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nElizabeth Layton did not start working as Churchill's private secretary until May 1941, a year after the events depicted in the film. Similarly the death of her brother during the retreat to Dunkirk, as alluded to in the film, is entirely fictional.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nChamberlain is referred to as 'Chairman' of the Conservative Party, but even after leaving Number 10 and becoming Lord President of the council, he retained the more important post of [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nChurchill refers to Halifax as \"the fourth son of an earl\" and says that \"fourth sons turn nothing down\". In reality, Halifax was the third son of [[Charles Lindley Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax]], and both of his elder brothers died while he was still a child, so he spent most of his youth and young adulthood as heir to his father's viscountcy (which he had already inherited by the time of the events depicted in the film).\n\n==Awards and honours==\n{{main|List of accolades received by Darkest Hour (film)}}\n\n==Sequel==\nGary Oldman stated, in February 2018, that there was talk of a sequel to ''Darkest Hour'' that could also include Roosevelt (who had been voiced by David Strathairn in ''Darkest Hour'') and take place during the [[Yalta Conference]] in 1945.<ref name=Sequel>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gary-oldman-eyes-a-post-darkest-hour-return-churchill-1088094|title=Gary Oldman Eyes A Post-'Darkest Hour' Return to Churchill|first=Stephen|last=Galloway|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=26 February 2018|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Churchill (film)|''Churchill'']] \u2013 Also released in 2017, starring [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Churchill\n* [[Dunkirk (2017 film)|''Dunkirk'']] \u2013 Released in 2017, focusing on [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]]\n* [[The Gathering Storm (1974 film)|''The Gathering Storm'']] \u2013 1974 similar film starring Richard Burton\n* [[The Gathering Storm (2002 film)|''The Gathering Storm'']] - 2002 film starring Albert Finney\n* [[Into the Storm (2009 film)|''Into the Storm'']] \u2013 2009 film starring Brendan Gleeson\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* [http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/darkest-hour/ ''Darkest Hour''] at ''[[History vs. Hollywood]]''\n\n{{Joe Wright}}\n\n[[Category:2017 films]]\n[[Category:2017 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2017 drama films]]\n[[Category:2017 war drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Franklin D.
