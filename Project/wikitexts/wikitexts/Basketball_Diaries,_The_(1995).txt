Outside of basketball, he shows an artistic interest in writing, keeping his work in his journal, expressing his thoughts and creating poetry. Jim's best friend, Bobby, is dying of [[leukemia]]; Jim frequently visits him in the hospital. Later, after a trip to a strip show cut short by an annoyed Bobby, Bobby dies, and Jim and his friends attend his funeral. Following the funeral, Jim and his friends go to the basketball court and reminisce about Bobby's life. Depressed over Bobby's death, Jim begins to use [[heroin]].\n\nAt basketball practice, Jim's coach Swifty sees Jim in the bathroom showers when he takes a short break to get high, where he then gropes him, and offers to pay him for sex. Jim refuses and pushes Swifty headfirst into a wall. As Jim's frustrations with school and life grow over time, he imagines shooting his classmates. The next day, before a game, Jim, Pedro, and Mickey take pills from Pedro's hat, hoping they are uppers. Neutron refuses the pills and confronts Jim about his growing habit. The pills are downers, and they cause the boys to perform disastrously during the game. A teacher who notices the boys engaging in drug use tells Jim and Mickey that they are [[Suspension (punishment)|suspended]] for a week, and Swifty tells Jim that he is now banned from playing basketball for his school again. Jim and Mickey, in response, resign from the team and drop out of school, while Neutron stays.\n\nJim's mother exiles him from the house after exposing his stash of drugs. Jim, Mickey, and Pedro from then on only live for their next score as homeless addicts; one later excursion has them break into a candy shop for money. Mickey finds a gun in the cash register and takes it. Hearing sirens, Jim and Mickey escape, but Pedro, too high and hungover to realize the situation, is left behind and arrested. Jim continues a desperate life of shady dealings and getting high with Mickey, and by the coming winter, passes out in the snow high on heroin. Jim's friend Reggie, who sympathizes with Jim over his predicament having been in a similar situation, finds him, takes him to his apartment, and forces him to detox, but Jim relapses.\n\nBack on the street, Jim is desperate for drugs and resorts to prostituting himself at a public restroom. Later, Jim and Mickey buy heroin, but discover that the dealer [[Ripoff|ripped them off]]. Enraged, Mickey corners the dealer on the roof of an apartment building. He accidentally pushes him off the roof to his death. Mickey tries to escape, but is beaten by a gang and then arrested; he is later tried as an adult and convicted. After escaping, with nowhere else to go, Jim goes to his mother's apartment and she reports him to the police. Jim is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to six months' incarceration at [[Rikers Island]] for [[assault]], [[robbery]], [[resisting arrest]], and [[Drug paraphernalia|possession of narcotics]] and spends the time in jail getting clean.\n\nJim approaches a stage door to give a poetry reading. He encounters Pedro, who has been released from [[reform school]]. Pedro offers him a bag of drugs, which Jim refuses. Jim recites his work before an audience and receives applause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Jim Carroll]]\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Mrs. Carroll\n* [[Marilyn Sokol]] as Chanting Woman\n* [[James Madio]] as Pedro\n* [[Patrick McGaw]] as Neutron\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Mickey\n* Roy Cooper as Father McNulty\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Swifty\n* [[Alexander Chaplin]] as Bobo\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Diane Moody\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Bobby\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Skinhead\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Reggie\n* Manny Alfaro as Manny\n* [[Cynthia Daniel]] as Winkie\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Blinkie\n* [[Jim Carroll]] as Frankie Pinewater\n* Ben Jorgensen as Tommy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 43 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10. The websites critical consensus states \"In spite of its young leading man's heroic efforts to hold it all together, a muddled message prevents ''The Basketball Diaries'' from compelling as a cautionary tale.\"<ref name=tomatoes/> [[Metacritic]] gave the movie a score of 46 based in 19 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-basketball-diaries| title=The Basketball Diaries Reviews| website=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars out of four. Ebert remarked: \"At the end, Jim is seen going in through a 'stage door' and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery. We can't tell if this is supposed to be genuine testimony or a performance. That's the problem with the whole movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\n==Lawsuits==\nThe film became controversial in the aftermath of the 1997 [[Heath High School shooting]] and the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Critics noted similarities between those shooting attacks and a dream sequence in the film in which the protagonist ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) wears a black trenchcoat and shoots six students in his school classroom. The film has been named in lawsuits brought by the relatives of murder victims.<ref>{{cite news| last=Carter| first=Nick| date=May 6, 1999| url=http://www.catholicboy.com/jc_columbine.php| title=Linking of 'Basketball Diaries,' Columbine Shootings Upsets Author| newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| via=CatholicBoy.com| access-date=June 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediaknowall.com/violence/moralpanicnotes.html \"Moral Panics and Violence in the Media\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118035348/http://www.mediaknowall.com/violence/moralpanicnotes.html |date=2010-11-18 }}.
