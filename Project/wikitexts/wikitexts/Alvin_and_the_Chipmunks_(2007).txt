Struggling songwriter and composer [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|David Seville]] has his latest demo rejected by their chief executive, Ian Hawke, his college roommate, who suggests that Dave give up writing songs. The Chipmunks hop into a [[basket]] of [[muffins]] that Dave stole from one of Ian's coworkers and follow Dave home.\n\nOnce there, Dave discovers the Chipmunks and kicks them out of the house, only to hear them sing \"[[Only You (And You Alone)]]\" and \"[[Funkytown]].\" Dave then makes a deal with the Chipmunks to sing songs he writes in exchange for shelter. Later, when Dave tries to present the Chipmunks to Ian, they fail to sing because of [[stage fright]]. The day worsens as Dave is [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from his advertising job due to the Chipmunks having unknowingly ruined his presentation boards by drawing and writing on them. While hosting dinner with former girlfriend Claire, Dave struggles to hide the Chipmunks after Alvin attempts to create a romantic atmosphere, making Claire uncomfortable and causing her to leave. To make it up to him, the Chipmunks go to Ian's lavish mansion, where they sing Dave's song to him, prompting Ian to sign a record deal.\n\nThe Chipmunks quickly become internationally successful. When Dave, concerned for their well-being, insists that the Chipmunks are too young to handle fame, Ian convinces them that Dave is holding them back. After a misunderstanding, the Chipmunks choose to live with Ian, whose only interest is profiting off the Chipmunks\u2019 success as they set off on a nationwide coast-to-coast tour where Ian exploits their [[Naivety|na\u00efvet\u00e9]] by overworking them constantly. When Ian's plan is revealed on the news, Dave decides to infiltrate their concert at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theatre]] to take them back.\n\nBefore their tour can begin, a veterinarian explains to Ian that the Chipmunks' voices have been worn out due to exhaustion and suggests that they take a long rest, but Ian, unwilling to issue refunds, advises the Chipmunks to [[lip-sync]]. With Claire's help, Dave is allowed into the concert by using her press badge; the Chipmunks hear Dave calling and decide to sabotage the show by causing chaos onstage. Dave is stopped by security, and Ian steps on the Chipmunks' tails, locks them in a cage, and prepares to take them on their world tour, escaping in his limousine with Dave in pursuit, though the Chipmunks have already escaped into Dave's car. As Dave and the Chipmunks reconcile, Ian uncovers the escape, which costs him both his career and his fortune.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[David Seville|David \"Dave\" Seville]], a struggling songwriter and father figure to Alvin, Simon and Theodore \n* [[David Cross]] as Ian Hawke, the CEO of JETT Records\n* [[Cameron Richardson]] as Claire Wilson, a photographer and Dave's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Gail, an advertising executive and Dave's former boss\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Justin Long]] as Alvin\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Simon\n* [[Jesse McCartney]] as Theodore\nAdditionally, [[Kevin Symons]] appears as Ted, Frank Maharajh appears as Barry, and Veronica Alicino appears as Amy, Dave\u2019s three former coworkers.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Ross Bagdasarian Jr.]], the son of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] creator [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]] who revived the franchise after his father's death, dreamed of making a live-action ''Alvin'' film since 1997, \"and the dream has had many nightmare moments.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|title=A Chipmunk Interview \u2013 part 1|date=December 27, 2007|work=Channel 24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103210050/https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/Features/A-Chipmunk-Interview-part-1-20081201|archive-date=3 January 2020|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref> On September 17, 2004, [[Fox 2000 Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox Animation]] and Bagdasarian Productions announced they would collaborate to create a live-action computer-generated film starring [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].<ref name=\"Variety2\">{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=September 14, 2004|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/alvin-to-squeak-again-1117910455/|title='Alvin' to squeak again|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On April 17, 2005, [[Jon Vitti]] was revealed to be writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brodesser|first=Claude|date=April 17, 2005|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/fox-animation-ups-cohen-1117921226/|title=Fox Animation ups Cohen|work=Variety|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> On January 24, 2007, it was announced [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was in talks with Fox to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=LaPorte|first=Nicole|date=January 24, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/hill-to-direct-chipmunks-1117958050/|title=Hill to direct 'Chipmunks'|work=Variety|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Chevy Chase]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tim Allen]], [[John Travolta]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Bill Murray]] were originally considered for the role of David Seville.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Bradford |title=The Lost Roles of Chevy Chase |url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-chevy-chase.html |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Bradford |title=The Lost Roles of Tim Allen |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/10/the-lost-roles-of-tim-allen.html |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=26 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Bradford |title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray, Part Two |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray-part-two.html |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=16 February 2012}}</ref> On March 7, 2007, [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] joined the project to play David Seville,<ref>{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=March 7, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/news/chipmunks-befriend-earl-star-1117960746/?jwsource=cl|title='Chipmunks' befriend 'Earl' star|work=Variety|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> and [[Cameron Richardson]] signed on March 21.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodd|first=Stacy|date=March 21, 2007|url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/cameron-richardson-2-1117961581/|title=Cameron Richardson|work=Variety|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref> David was a more clean-cut character for Lee than his past roles, which he appreciated.<ref name = \"LAtimespro\"/> [[Patton Oswalt]] and [[Brian Posehn]] were approached to play Ian Hawke but both of whom declined.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/12/the-lost-roles-of-patton-oswalt.html|title=The Lost Roles of Patton Oswalt|date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBagdasarian and his wife, [[Janice Karman]], had always voiced the chipmunks since they revived the franchise;
