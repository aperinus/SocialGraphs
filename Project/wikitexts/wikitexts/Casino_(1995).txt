It is based on the 1995 nonfiction book ''[[Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas]]''<ref>{{cite book |author=Pileggi, Nicholas |title=Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas |isbn=0-684-80832-3 |date=1995 |publisher=Simon & Schuster|url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/casinolovehonori00pile|access-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820061350/https://archive.org/details/casinolovehonori00pile|archive-date=August 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> by [[Nicholas Pileggi]], who also co-wrote the screenplay along with Scorsese. It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Kevin Pollak]] and [[James Woods]]. The film was the eighth [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|collaboration between director Scorsese and De Niro]].\n\n''Casino'' follows Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein (De Niro), a [[Jewish American]] gambling expert [[Handicapping|handicapper]] who is asked by the [[Chicago Outfit]] to oversee the day-to-day casino and hotel operations at the [[Tangiers Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Other major characters include Nicky Santoro (Pesci), a \"[[made man]]\" and friend of Sam, and Ginger McKenna (Stone), a streetwise chip hustler who Sam marries and has a daughter with. The film details Sam's operation of the [[casino]], the difficulties he confronts in his job, the Mafia's involvement with the casino, and the gradual breakdown of his relationships and standing, as Las Vegas changes over the years.\n\nThe primary characters are based on real people: Sam is inspired by the life of [[Frank Rosenthal]], also known as \"Lefty,\" who ran the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust]], [[Fremont (resort)|Fremont]], [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|Marina]], and [[Hacienda (resort)|Hacienda]] casinos in Las Vegas for the Chicago Outfit from 1968 until 1981. Nicky and Ginger are based on mob enforcer [[Anthony Spilotro]] and former dancer and socialite [[Geri McGee]], respectively.\n\n''Casino'' was released on November 22, 1995, by Universal Pictures, to a mostly positive critical reception, and was a worldwide box office success. Stone's performance was singled out for acclaim, earning her a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. As of 2017, ''Casino'' holds the record for the most dialogue in a film, with 67,618 spoken words in its [[screenplay]] (7-times the amount of the average movie).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-07-01 |title=Actors and Movies with the Most Dialogue |url=https://www.kaylinpavlik.com/long-winded-actors-and-movies-with-the-most-dialogue/ |access-date=2022-08-21 |website=Kaylin Pavlik}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1962, sports [[Handicapping|handicapper]] and [[American Mafia|Mafia]] associate Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein is sent by the [[Chicago Mafia]] to [[Las Vegas]] to run the Tangiers Casino. Front man Philip Green serves as the casino and hotel CEO, but Sam unofficially runs everything. Sam quickly doubles the casino's profits, with cash skimmed directly from the count room and delivered to the Midwest Mafia bosses. Chicago boss Remo Gaggi sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicky Santoro to protect Sam and the casino. Nicky makes sure everyone is kept in line, but his own criminal activities start drawing too much media and law enforcement attention. He recruits his younger brother Dominick and childhood friend Frankie Marino to gather a crew that specializes in [[extortion|shakedowns]], burglaries and jewelry heists. Nicky is eventually placed in the Nevada [[Black Book (gambling)|Black Book]], banning him from every casino in Nevada.\n\nSam meets and falls in love with beautiful [[Hustling|hustler]] and former prostitute Ginger McKenna. In 1969 they have a daughter, Amy, and marry, but their marriage is quickly thrown into turmoil due to Ginger's relationship with her longtime boyfriend, [[Confidence trick|con artist]] Lester Diamond. Sam has Nicky's crew beat Lester when they catch him accepting $25,000 from her. In the mid-1970s, Ginger's problems intensify as she turns to drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn 1976, Sam fires slot manager Don Ward for incompetence. When Ward's brother-in-law, [[Clark County Commission]] chairman Pat Webb, fails to convince Sam to rehire Don, Webb arranges for Sam's gaming license to be denied, jeopardizing his position. Sam starts hosting a local television talk show from inside the casino, irritating both Nicky and the bosses back home for making himself such a public figure and bringing unneeded attention. Sam blames Nicky's recklessness for ongoing police and Nevada Gaming Board pressure, and the two argue furiously in the [[Mojave Desert]] after Sam tries to tell Nicky to leave Las Vegas.\n\nWhen the Midwest bosses discover that people on the inside are stealing from their skim, they install incompetent [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City]] [[underboss]] Artie Piscano to oversee the operation. Piscano ends up keeping detailed written records of the operation. Additionally, an FBI bug placed in Piscano's store for a separate crime catches him talking in detail about the skim, prompting a full investigation into the Tangiers Casino.\n\nIn 1980 Sam seeks to divorce Ginger, who kidnaps their daughter, planning to flee to [[Europe]] with her and Lester. Sam convinces Ginger to return with Amy, then overhears her planning on the phone to kill him. Sam kicks her out of their home but later relents and lets her back in. Ginger approaches Nicky to get her valuables from Sam's safe deposit box, and the two start an affair. Sam soon discovers the affair and confronts and disowns Ginger, and ends his friendship with Nicky. Nicky throws Ginger out when she demands that he kill Sam. Drunk and furious, Ginger crashes her car into Sam's in the driveway the next day and retrieves the key to their deposit box. She takes the contents of the box, but is arrested by the FBI as a witness.\n\nIn 1982, the FBI closes the casino and Green agrees to cooperate. Piscano dies of a heart attack when FBI agents discover his notebook. The FBI approaches Sam for help by showing him photos of Nicky and Ginger together, but he turns them down. The bosses are arrested and get ready for trial, and start arranging the murders of anyone who might testify against them. In 1983, Ginger dies of a drug overdose, and Sam barely escapes death by a [[car bomb]], suspecting Nicky to be the culprit. \n\nIn 1986, the bosses, finally fed up with Nicky's recklessness, order Frankie and his crew to kill Nicky and Dominick. Under the impression that they are attending a meetup in an [[Illinois]] cornfield, they are brutally beaten with baseball bats, covered in [[quicklime]], and buried alive in a shallow grave.\n\nWith the mafia now out of the casino industry, Sam laments the new impersonal, corporate-run resorts of Las Vegas. He is last seen working as a sports handicapper in [[San Diego]], ending up in his own words, \"right back where I started\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.
