Avery meets her fianc\u00e9, Ethan, the day after she and Noah met. Three years later, Noah remains distraught at not having been able to win her over.\n\nWhen he becomes intoxicated at Ethan and Avery's engagement party, Noah winds up in the [[photo booth]] he used with her on their first meeting and drunkenly operates it before falling asleep. Awakening in bed, Noah discovers the photo booth brought him back to the day they met and he resolves to change the events of the day to ensure he and Avery end up together.\n\nNoah uses his pre-existing knowledge of Avery to his advantage in his first attempt to win her over, but Avery and her roommate Carrie Grey suspect him of being a stalker, and he returns to a new version of 2017 where he and Avery do not know each other. For his second attempt traveling back to 2014, Noah follows his friend Max's advice of being a rude alpha male and successfully beds Avery, but he develops a self-absorbed personality and when he returns to the present, his relationship with Avery is purely sexual.\n\nRecognizing that Avery and Ethan are still attracted to each other, Noah has a conversation with Carrie and deduces that Avery is attracted to stable and dependable men. Noah gets a job at Max's company and presents himself in a more mature manner to Avery for his third attempt. When he returns to 2017, he and Avery live in a big house and are engaged.\n\nHowever, his friendship with Max has soured because he took the senior vice president position that Max was working towards, his job commitments prevent him from spending time with Avery, and Ethan is now distraught over Avery marrying someone else. Following another conversation with Carrie, Noah recognizes that Avery does not love him and she is meant to be with Ethan. He also realizes that, having bonded with Carrie during his time travel adventures, he is meant to be with her.\n\nTraveling back to 2014 for a fourth time, Noah arranges for Avery and Ethan to meet at the Halloween party while he pursues Carrie, whom he discovers he has more in common with than Avery. His actions restore Ethan and Avery's engagement and his friendship with Max, but Noah learns that he did not win Carrie's love and she resumed dating her ex-boyfriend, Phil. Noah finally realizes that he needed to first become friends with Avery in order to meet Carrie, and he travels back one last time to meet Avery the way he did originally. With the present fully restored, Noah initiates a conversation with Carrie at the engagement party and the two begin their own relationship.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Noah Ashby<ref name=\"May2016D\" />\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Avery Martin<ref name=\"May2016D\" />\n* [[Shelley Hennig]] as Carrie Grey<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/08/when-we-first-met-adds-shelley-hennig-three-christs-adds-stephen-root-1201797504/|title=Shelley Hennig Joins 'When We First Met'; Stephen Root Cast In 'Three Christs'|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|date=2016-08-04|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* [[Andrew Bachelor]] as Max<ref name=\"ew.com\"/>\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Ethan<ref name=\"Jul2016V\" />\n* Dean J.
