The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his [[Romance (love)|love interest]] Lois Lane has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme to kill Superman and reshape North America.\n\nAfter a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect ''Superman'' on screen following the critical and [[Box-office bomb|financial failure]] of ''The Quest for Peace'', [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop ''Superman Returns'' in July 2004. The majority of [[principal photography]] took place at [[Fox Studios Australia]], Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], [[Rhythm & Hues]], [[Framestore]], [[Rising Sun Pictures]], and [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=498&Itemid=68|title=Superman Returns \u2013 Side Effects Software Inc.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130616003140/http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=498&Itemid=68|archive-date=2013-06-16}}</ref> filming began in March 2005 and ended in November.\n\nUpon release, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its visual effects, story, and Singer's direction. However, it received criticism focusing on its runtime and lack of action sequences. Even though it was the ninth [[2006 in film|highest-grossing film of 2006]], Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return of the film, cancelling a sequel planned for 2009 as a result. The ''Superman'' film series was completely rebooted in 2013 with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', directed by [[Zack Snyder]], starring [[Henry Cavill]] as Superman, and launching the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Routh later reprised his role as Superman in the 2019 [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nSuperman has been missing for five years, since traveling to the location where astronomers believed they had discovered the remains of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. During his absence, Superman's nemesis [[Lex Luthor (1978 film series character)|Lex Luthor]] was released from prison and married a rich widow to obtain her fortune upon her death. Superman, having failed in his quest to find surviving Kryptonians, returns to Earth and, as Clark Kent, resumes his job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He subsequently learns that [[Lois Lane]] has won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her article \"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\" Meanwhile, Luthor travels to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] and steals Kryptonian crystals, which he uses for an experiment that causes a power outage on the East Coast. The power loss interferes with the flight test of a [[Space Shuttle]] to be [[Air-launch-to-orbit|launched into space from its piggy-back mounting on an airliner]], occupied by Lois Lane, who is covering the shuttle story. Clark flies into action as Superman and stops the plane from crashing onto a baseball stadium.\n\nThe world rejoices at Superman's return, but he has difficulty coping with Lois' fianc\u00e9, Richard White, nephew of ''Daily Planet'' editor-in-chief [[Perry White]], and their 5-year-old son, Jason. With Superman distracted by an out-of-control vehicle (a diversion involving Luthor's henchwoman, Kitty Kowalski), Luthor steals [[Kryptonite]] from the Metropolis Museum of Natural History. Perry then assigns Lois to interview Superman while Clark investigates the blackout. Lois and Jason inadvertently board Luthor's yacht and are captured after Lois decides to hold interest in the blackout story, which she connects to Luthor's experiment. He reveals to them his grand scheme of using one of the stolen Kryptonian crystals, which he has combined with the Kryptonite, to grow a new continental landmass in the Northern Atlantic Ocean that will supplant the continental United States and kill millions of innocent people.\n\nSeeing Jason seemingly have a slight reaction to Kryptonite, Luthor asks who Jason's father really is; Lois asserts that the father is Richard. The crystal begins to create Luthor's new landmass, while Lois attempts to escape but is attacked by a henchman. Jason throws a piano at the henchman, killing him and showing that he is actually Superman's son. Meanwhile, Superman is attempting to minimize the destruction in Metropolis caused by the new landmass' growth when Richard arrives in a sea plane to rescue Lois and Jason. Superman soon arrives to help and then flies off to find Luthor.\n\nMeeting Luthor, Superman discovers the landmass is filled with Kryptonite, which weakens him to the point that Luthor and his henchmen are able to brutalize and torture him. Superman is stabbed by Luthor with a shard of Kryptonite before he falls into the ocean and is left to drown. Lois makes Richard turn back to rescue Superman, whereupon she removes the Kryptonite from his back. Superman, after regaining his strength from the sun, lifts the landmass after putting layers of earth between him and the Kryptonite. Luthor and Kitty escape in their helicopter; Kitty, unwilling to let millions of people die, tosses away the crystals that Lex stole from the Fortress of Solitude. She and Luthor are stranded on a desert island when their helicopter runs out of fuel. Superman pushes the landmass into space with the crystals trapped on the landmass, but is weakened by the Kryptonite and crashes back to Earth. Doctors remove more Kryptonite from Superman's wound, but after it is removed they cannot penetrate his skin with their surgical tools. While Superman remains in a coma, Lois and Jason visit him at the hospital where Lois whispers a secret into Superman's ear <!-- Do not speculate --> and then kisses him. Superman later awakens and flies to visit Jason, reciting his father Jor-El's last speech to Jason as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled \"Why the World Needs Superman\". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off to low orbit, where he gazes down at the world once again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Brandon Routh]] as [[Superman (1978 film series character)#Superman Returns|Clark Kent / Superman]]: The Kryptonian superhero whose alter-ego is a mild-mannered farmer-turned-journalist.\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as [[Lois Lane (1978 film series character)#Superman Returns|Lois Lane]]: A reporter who works with Clark Kent at the ''Daily Planet'', and former lover of Superman.\n* [[James Marsden]] as Richard White: The nephew of the ''Daily Planet'' editor-in-chief Perry White and fianc\u00e9 to Lois Lane.

He is also similar to another iteration, [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] (remained working as a newspaper's editor-in-chief instead of went into seclusion after what happened), making this Superman an amalgam of the two, as well as being a facsimile to Ray Palmer. He is later recruited by heroes from across the multiverse to avert a Crisis caused by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. During the event, Superman also references his son Jason (implying that he had discovered his true paternity), as well as the events from ''[[Superman III]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/crisis-infinite-earths-superman-movies-reeve-routh-arrowverse-canon/|title=Crisis On Infinite Earths: Original Superman Movies ARE Arrowverse Canon|website=Screenrant|date=10 December 2019|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114062534/https://screenrant.com/crisis-infinite-earths-superman-movies-reeve-routh-arrowverse-canon/|url-status=live}}</ref>  After the Crisis was averted and the multiverse was rebooted, Superman of Earth-96 is seen wearing a yellow s-shield and belt.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Superman in film]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Anchor|Notes}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Anchor|Bibliography|Books}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | author1 = [[Jimmy Palmiotti]]| author2 =  Justin Gray| author3 =  [[Marc Andreyko]] | title = Superman Returns: The Prequels | date = October 2006 | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | others = Comic book prequel to the film | isbn = 1-4012-1146-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/supermanreturnsp0000sing }}\n* {{cite book | author = Daniel Wallace | title = The Art of Superman Returns | date = 6 July 2006| publisher = [[Chronicle Books]] | isbn = 0-8118-5344-6}}\n* {{cite book | author = Daniel Wallace | title = Superman Returns: The Visual Guide | year = 2006 | publisher = DK Children | isbn = 978-0-7566-2066-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/supermanreturns00dani }}\n* {{cite book | author = [[Marv Wolfman]] | title = [[Superman Returns, the Novelization]] | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Hachette Book Group USA]] | isbn = 0-446-60652-9}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{commons}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/superman-returns/}}\n* [https://www.dccomics.com/movies/superman-returns-2006 Official DC Comics website]\n* {{IMDb title|0348150}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|superman_returns}}\n* {{Allmovie title|316298}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Mojo title|superman06}}\n* [http://www.superherohype.com/news/supermannews.php?id=2726 Pictures of filming in Tamworth, Australia]\n\n{{Superman in other media}}\n{{DC Comics films}}\n{{Bryan Singer}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film 1991\u20132010}}\n{{Authority control}}\n<!--[[WP:FILMCAT]]-->\n<!--Year categories-->\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 3D films]]\n[[Category:2000s action films]]\n[[Category:2006 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:2000s superhero films]]\n[[Category:Alternative sequel films]]\n[[Category:American 3D films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Ottman]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bryan Singer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jon Peters]]\n[[Category:Films set on fictional islands]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Sydney]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Legendary Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Dougherty]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dan Harris (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:Superman films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Bad Hat Harry Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bryan Singer]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Bryan Singer]]\n[[Category:Superhero drama films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Superman (1978 film series)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kansas]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gilbert Adler]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
