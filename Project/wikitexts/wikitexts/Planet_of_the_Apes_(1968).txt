Schaffner]] and loosely based on the 1963 French novel ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|La Plan\u00e8te des Singes]]'' by [[Pierre Boulle]]. Written by [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] and [[Rod Serling]], it stars [[Charlton Heston]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Kim Hunter]], [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], [[James Whitmore]], [[James Daly (actor)|James Daly]] and [[Linda Harrison]]. In the film, an astronaut crew [[Emergency landing|crash-lands]] on a strange planet in the distant future. Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant species]] and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.\n\nThe outline ''Planet of the Apes'' script, originally written by Serling, underwent many rewrites before filming eventually began.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rodserling.com/pota.htm |title=30 Years Later: Rod Serling's Settling the Debate over Who Wrote What, and When |last=Webb |first=Gordon C. |date=July 1998 |publisher=www.rodserling.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202034740/http://www.rodserling.com/pota.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2018 |url-status=dead |access-date=August 4, 2007}}</ref> Directors [[J.

Stewart, the lone female crew member, is dead due to a sleep chamber malfunction caused by an air leak. Their spacecraft crashes into a lake on an unknown planet; Taylor's estimate places them in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]'s [[Bellatrix]] System, 300 light-years from their home [[Solar System]]. Before they abandon their sinking vessel, the three survivors read the ship's chronometer as November 25, 3978 \u2013 two thousand and six years after their departure in 1972. However, due to [[time dilation]], the astronauts themselves have aged slightly less than one year.\n\nThe men travel through desolate wasteland, coming across eerie scarecrow-like figures and a freshwater lake with lush vegetation. While swimming, the men's clothes are stolen and shredded by primitive mute humans. Soon after, armed gorillas raid a cornfield where the humans are gathering food. Taylor is shot in the throat as he and the others are captured. Dodge is killed and Landon rendered unconscious in the chaos. Taylor is taken to Ape City. Two chimpanzees, animal psychologist Zira and surgeon Galen, save Taylor's life, though his throat injury renders him temporarily mute.\n\nTaylor is placed with a captive female, whom he later names Nova. He observes an advanced society of talking apes with a strict caste system: [[gorilla]]s are the military force and laborers; [[orangutan]]s oversee government and religion; and intellectual [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are mostly scientists and doctors. The ape society is a [[theocracy]], while the apes consider the primitive humans as vermin to be hunted and either killed outright, enslaved, or used in scientific experiments. Taylor convinces Zira and her fianc\u00e9, Cornelius, that he is as intelligent as they are; one way by making a paper airplane. Dr. Zaius, their orangutan superior, arranges for Taylor to be castrated against Zira's protests. Taylor escapes and finds Dodge's stuffed corpse on display in a museum. He is soon recaptured, in the process revealing that he can speak, which alarms the apes.\n\n[[File:Cornelius Zira Taylor.jpg|thumb|left|Cornelius (McDowall), Zira (Hunter), and Taylor (Heston)]]\nA hearing to determine Taylor's origins is convened. Taylor mentions his two comrades, learning that Landon was [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] and rendered catatonic. Believing Taylor is from an unknown human tribe beyond their borders, Zaius privately threatens to castrate and lobotomize Taylor for refusing to reveal his origins. With help from Zira's nephew Lucius, Zira and Cornelius free Taylor and Nova and take them to the Forbidden Zone, a taboo region outside Ape City where Taylor's ship crashed. Ape law has ruled the area out of bounds for centuries. Cornelius and Zira are intent to gather proof of an earlier non-simian civilization \u2013 which Cornelius discovered a year earlier \u2013 to be cleared of heresy; Taylor focuses on proving he comes from a different planet.\n\nWhen the group arrives at the cave, Cornelius is intercepted by Zaius and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off by threatening to shoot Zaius, who agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories. Inside, Cornelius displays remnants of a technologically advanced human society pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve...and, to the apes' astonishment, a talking human doll. Zaius admits he has always known about the ancient human civilization. Taylor wants to search for answers. Zaius warns Taylor against finding an answer which he does not like, adding that the now-desolate Forbidden Zone was once a lush paradise. After Taylor and Nova are allowed to leave, Zaius has the cave sealed off to destroy the evidence, while charging Zira, Cornelius, and Lucius with heresy.\n\n[[File:Potaending.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor, Nova (Harrison), and the Statue of Liberty]]\nTaylor and Nova follow the shoreline on horseback. Eventually, they discover the remnants of the [[Statue of Liberty]], revealing that this supposedly alien planet is actually Earth, long after an apocalyptic [[nuclear war]]. Understanding Zaius' earlier warning while Nova looks on in shock, Taylor falls to his knees in despair, condemning humanity for destroying the world.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Billed actors as credited in film -->\n<!-- Billed pre-title-->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as George Taylor\n<!-- Billed post-title-->\n<!-- co-starring -->\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Dr. Cornelius\n* [[Kim Hunter]] as Dr. Zira\n* [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] as Dr. Zaius\n* [[James Whitmore]] as President of the Assembly\n* [[James Daly (actor)|James Daly]] as Dr. Honorius\n<!-- Introducing .. as ..-->\n* [[Linda Harrison]] as Nova\n<!-- With -->\n<!-- together on one screen -->\n* Robert Gunner as Landon\n* [[Lou Wagner]] as Lucius\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Dr. Maximus\n* Jeff Burton as Dodge\n* [[Buck Kartalian]] as Julius\n* [[Norman Burton]] as Hunt Leader\n* [[Wright King]] as Dr. Galen\n* [[Paul Lambert (actor)|Paul Lambert]] as Minister\n* Dianne Stanley as Stewart\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Origins===\nProducer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] bought the rights for the [[Pierre Boulle]] novel before its publication in 1963. Jacobs pitched the production to many studios, but was passed over. After Jacobs made a successful debut as a producer doing ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964) for [[20th Century Fox]] and begun pre-production of another movie for the studio, ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', he managed to convince Fox vice-president [[Richard D. Zanuck]] to greenlight ''Planet of the Apes''.<ref name=\"btpota\">{{cite video |title=Behind the Planet of the Apes |year=1998 |author=American Movie Classics |author-link=American Movie Classics |location=''Planet of the Apes'' Blu-Ray |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nOne script that came close to being made was written by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' creator [[Rod Serling]], though it was finally rejected for a number of reasons. A prime concern was cost, as the technologically advanced ape society portrayed by Serling's script would have involved expensive [[set construction|sets]], [[theatrical property|props]], and [[special effects]]. The previously [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] screenwriter [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] was brought in to rewrite Serling's script and, as suggested by director [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], the ape society was made more primitive as a way of reducing costs. Serling's stylized twist ending was retained, and became one of the most famous movie endings of all time. The exact location and state of decay of the Statue of Liberty changed over several [[storyboards]]. One version depicted the statue buried up to its nose in the middle of a jungle while another depicted the statue in pieces.<ref name=\"btpota\"/>\n\nTo convince the Fox Studio that a ''Planet of the Apes'' film could be made, the producers shot a brief test scene from a Rod Serling draft of the script, using early versions of the ape makeup, on March 8, 1966. Charlton Heston appeared as an early version of Taylor (named Thomas, as he was in the Serling-penned drafts), [[Edward G. Robinson]] appeared as Zaius, while two then-unknown Fox contract actors, [[James Brolin]] and [[Linda Harrison]], played Cornelius and Zira. Harrison, who was at the time the girlfriend of studio chief [[Richard D. Zanuck]], went on to be cast as Nova. Jacobs had at first considered [[Ursula Andress]], then screen tested [[Angelique Pettyjohn]], and even considered doing an international talent search for the role before Harrison's casting.<ref>{{cite book|page=8|title=Planet Of The Apes: An Unofficial Companion|author=Hofstede, David|publisher=ECW Press|year= 2001|isbn= 1550224468}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pulver |first=Andrew |title=Monkey business |date=June 24, 2005 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/25/adaptationoftheweek.books |access-date=May 13, 2015 |archive-date=May 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092144/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jun/25/adaptationoftheweek.books |url-status=live }}</ref> Robinson wound up not joining the cast due to his decaying health.\n\nMichael Wilson's rewrite kept the basic structure of Serling's screenplay but rewrote all the dialogue and set the script in a more primitive society. According to associate producer [[Mort Abrahams]] an additional uncredited writer (his only recollection was that the writer's last name was Kelly) polished the script, rewrote some of the dialogue and included some of the more heavy-handed tongue-in-cheek dialogue (\"I never met an ape I didn't like\") which wasn't in either Serling or Wilson's drafts. According to Abrahams, some scenes, such as the one where the judges imitate the \"[[Three wise monkeys|see no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil]]\" monkeys, were improvised on the set by director Franklin J. Schaffner and kept in the final film because of the audience reaction during test screenings prior to release.<ref name=\"revisited\">{{cite book |last1=Russo |first1=Joe |last2=Landsman |first2=Larry |last3=Gross |first3=Edward |title=Planet of the Apes Revisited: The Behind-The Scenes Story of the Classic Science Fiction Saga |date=2001 |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0312252390 |edition=1st |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312252397}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2016}} During filming [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]], who designed prosthetic make-up in the film,<ref name=guardian01>{{cite news |title=Obituary: John Chambers: Make-up master responsible for Hollywood's finest space-age creatures |author=Brian Pendreigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/07/guardianobituaries.filmnews |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 7, 2001 |access-date=February 27, 2013 |archive-date=February 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228155815/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/07/guardianobituaries.filmnews |url-status=live }}</ref> held training sessions at 20th Century-Fox studios, where he mentored other make-up artists of the film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sci-Fi Swarm and Horror Horde: Interviews with 62 Filmmakers |author=Tom Weaver |publisher=McFarland |year=2010 |isbn=978-0786458318 |page=314 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50AbUfJS6OkC&q=John+Chambers+makeup+artist&pg=PA314 |access-date=November 2, 2020 |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605020319/https://books.google.com/books?id=50AbUfJS6OkC&q=John+Chambers+makeup+artist&pg=PA314 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Glen Canyon 305947975.jpg|thumb|right|The astronauts' journey from their downed ship was filmed along the [[Colorado River]] in [[Glen Canyon]].]]\nFilming began on May 21, 1967, and wrapped on August 10.
