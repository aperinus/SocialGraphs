Marlowe]], and starring [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Kim Dickens]], [[Greg Grunberg]], [[Joey Slotnick]], Mary Randle, and [[William Devane]]. Inspired by [[H.G. Wells]]' 1897 novel ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and its [[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|1933 film adaptation]], it tells the story of Sebastian Caine, a scientist who volunteers to be the first human test subject for a serum that renders the user [[invisible]]. When his fellow scientists are unable to restore him back to normal, he becomes violently insane and goes on a killing spree. The film received negative reviews but was a financial success, grossing $190 million worldwide. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] in 2001, losing to ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.\n\nA [[direct-to-video]] [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|stand-alone sequel]] called ''[[Hollow Man 2]]'', starring [[Christian Slater]] and [[Peter Facinelli]], was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nArrogant scientist Sebastian Caine has developed a serum for the military that can make a subject invisible. His team includes ex-girlfriend Linda McKay, Matt Kensington, Sarah, Janice, Carter, and Frank. The team succeeds in reversing the procedure, returning an invisible [[gorilla]] to visibility. Sebastian becomes infatuated with Linda again, but, unbeknownst to him, she has become involved with Matt.\n\nInstead of reporting his success to the military, Sebastian lies to an oversight committee, which includes his mentor Howard Kramer, telling them he is close but needs more time. He convinces part of the team to go into [[human testing]] without military authorization, keeping the rest in the dark. The procedure is successful, and Sebastian turns completely invisible. He enjoys sneaking around the lab in order to scare and play pranks on his fellow co-workers, one of which involves molesting Sarah. The team becomes concerned that Sebastian is taking it too far. The procedure to return him to visibility fails, and he is almost killed.\n\nSebastian is [[quarantined]] in the laboratory due to his condition, and the other researchers construct a latex mask for him to wear around the lab. With the constant testing done to him and unable to cope with the isolation, he defies instructions and leaves the building. After he drives to his apartment to retrieve some items, he notices a female neighbor undressing and rapes her inside her apartment. Linda warns Sebastian that if he leaves again, she and Matt will tell the committee about the experiment. Ignoring their threat, Sebastian assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters. He leaves the lab again and spies on Linda and Matt, becoming enraged when he sees them about to have sex. Becoming increasingly unstable, Sebastian later kills a dog being used as a [[lab animal]] in a fit of rage.\n\nThe team discovers they have been watching a recording, and Sebastian has been leaving the lab without their knowledge. Linda and Matt go to Kramer's house and confess their experiments. After they leave, Kramer attempts to alert the Army. Having followed Linda and Matt to the house, Sebastian cuts off his phone connection, then drowns him in his swimming pool. The next day, Sebastian waits until the whole team is inside the lab before he disables the phones and elevator codes except for his own. The rest of the team congregates and decides to hunt Sebastian down and subdue him. At the same time, he begins to murder team members one by one, with Janice being his first victim after falling behind the others.\n\nLinda and the others hide in the lab, while Matt and Carter take [[tranquilizer gun]]s to hunt for Sebastian using [[Thermography]] goggles. Sebastian mortally wounds Carter before getting into a fight with Matt. Linda saves Matt. Sebastian then kills Sarah and Frank, and locks an injured Matt and Linda in the freezer, leaving them to die. Linda constructs an [[electromagnet]] using a [[defibrillator]] to open the door, then gathers materials to assemble a flamethrower. Meanwhile, Sebastian builds a makeshift bomb that will destroy the facility after he leaves using explosive chemicals and a centrifuge; he destroys the keyboard so that nobody can stop the machine.\n\nJust as Sebastian enters the elevator, Linda fires the flamethrower at him. Sebastian escapes and the two fight. Before Sebastian can kill Linda, Matt strikes him with a crowbar. Sebastian recovers and approaches Matt and Linda from behind with the crowbar, but Matt deflects the blow, throwing Sebastian into a nearby circuit box, shocking him and rendering him partially visible. Linda and Matt find the bomb, but cannot stop it. They attempt to climb a ladder in the elevator shaft to escape as the bomb explodes. Despite his injuries, Sebastian grabs Linda's ankle. He pulls her off the ladder and onto the top of the elevator. Linda disconnects the elevator cables, causing the partially-visible Sebastian to fall to his death down the shaft. Linda and Matt emerge from the burning lab and emergency personnel take them away in an ambulance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Linda McKay, Sebastian's ex-girlfriend and co-worker who now has a relationship with Matt.
