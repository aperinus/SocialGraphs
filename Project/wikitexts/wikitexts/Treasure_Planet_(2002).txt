Twelve years later, Jim has grown into an aloof troublemaker after his father abandoned him. He reluctantly helps his mother Sarah run the Benbow Inn, and is caught by police after recklessly [[skysurfing]] with a rocket-powered sailboard. A spaceship crashes near the inn, and the dying pilot, [[Billy Bones]], gives Jim a sphere and warns him to \"beware the [[cyborg]]\". Pirates attack, burning down the inn, and Jim flees with his mother and their dog-like friend, Dr. Delbert Doppler. Jim discovers that the sphere contains a holographic star map, leading to the location of Treasure Planet, and decides to seek out the legendary fortune.\n\nDoppler commissions the ship RLS ''Legacy'', commanded by feline Captain Amelia and stone-skinned [[Chief Mate|first mate]] Mr. Arrow. The motley crew is secretly led by half-robot cook [[Long John Silver|John Silver]], whom Jim suspects is the cyborg he was warned about. Sent to work in the galley, Jim is supervised by Silver and his shape-shifting pet, Morph, and they form a tenuous father-son relationship. When the ship encounters a [[supernova]], Jim secures the crew's lifelines. As a [[black hole]] forms, ruthless insectoid crew member Scroop cuts Mr. Arrow's lifeline, sending him to his death. The ship rides the shock waves to safety, and Jim is framed for neglecting Arrow's lifeline, but is comforted by Silver.\n\nReaching Treasure Planet, Jim discovers the crew are indeed pirates led by Silver, and a [[mutiny]] erupts. Doppler, Amelia, and Morph abandon ship, and Jim retrieves the map, while Silver cannot bring himself to shoot Jim, allowing him to escape with the others. The group are shot down, injuring Amelia, and discover that the map is Morph in disguise, with the real map still on the ship. The group meet [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)#Other media|B.E.N.]], an abandoned navigational robot with knowledge of Flint and his treasure, but missing much of his memory. Cornered by the pirates, Jim, Morph, and B.E.N. hijack a longboat and return to the ''Legacy'' to retrieve the map. Scroop attacks them, and the artificial gravity is disabled; Scroop attempts to cut Jim loose, but Jim kicks him overboard into deep space. Returning, they are caught by Silver and his crew, who have already captured Doppler and Amelia.\n\nSilver forces Jim to use the map, directing them to a portal that opens to any location in the universe, allowing Flint to conduct his raids. They open the portal to the core of Treasure Planet, which is actually an ancient machine Flint commandeered to stow his treasure, but trip a hidden sensor. As the pirates collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet collapses, Silver attempts to escape with a boatload of treasure, but abandons it to save Jim. The survivors board the ''Legacy'', which becomes damaged and unable to escape the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift sailboard and rides ahead, setting the portal to Montressor Spaceport as he and the others clear the planet's explosion.\n\nJim finds Silver below decks and allows him to escape, and Silver gives him Morph and a handful of treasure, to pay for rebuilding the inn, believing Jim will \"rattle the stars\". Sometime later, a party is hosted at the rebuilt Benbow Inn; Doppler and Amelia are married with children; B.E.N. has become a waiter at the inn; and Jim, matured under Silver's mentorship, has become an interstellar cadet, and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], an adolescent pining for adventure.

Wyeth]]), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the \"classic storybook illustration,\" having a [[painterly]] feel to it, and being composed of a warm color [[Palette (painting)|palette]].<ref>{{cite video |people=Ron Clements, Dan Cooper, Roy Disney, Andy Gaskill, Ian Gooding, John Musker |title=Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The Brandywine School |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThere were around forty animators on the crew, and were further divided into teams; for example, sixteen animators were assigned to Jim Hawkins because he appeared on the screen the most, and twelve were assigned to John Silver. To ensure \"solidity\" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, citing Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" />\n\nWhen asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to \"clear his mind of stereotypes\", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he \"loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth.\" For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because \"there was a whole attitude, a posture\" wherein \"you felt the pain and the youthful innocence\", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because \"there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes.\"<ref name=\"p9keaneandripa\">{{cite web |title=TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA |publisher=Phase 9 Entertainment |year=2005 |url=http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-glenkeane&johnripa1.shtml |access-date=December 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113020003/http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq%26a-glenkeane%26johnripa1.shtml |archive-date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAnimators also used [[maquette]]s, small statues of the characters in the film, as references throughout the animation process. Character sculptor Kent Melton mentioned that the first Disney film to use maquettes was ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and that this paved the way to the formation of an entire department devoted to character sculpting. Keane noted that maquettes are not just supposed to be \"like a mannequin in a store\", but rather has to be \"something that tells you [the character's] personality\" and that maquettes also helped inspire the way actors would portray their roles.<ref name=\"maquettes\">{{cite video |people=Kent Melton, Glen Keane |title=Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Maquettes |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), and came up with a process they called \"Virtual Sets,\" wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name=\"scenefilm\" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a \"painted image with depth perception\" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name=\"techtreasure\" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953) and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video |people=Glen Keane |title=Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The \"Hook\" Test |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] |date=2003}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation === <!--Some SPER by [[Special:Contributions/Lizley|Lizley]]-->\nOne of the film's goals was to blend different mediums of animation into one film to have such a seamless finish to the point you could not tell the difference between what was two-dimensional hand drawing or computer-generated 3D animations and environments. For the animation of the ''Treasure Planet'', there are three main elements that were essential to the production of this film.

Sound designer [[Dane Davis]] mentioned that he and his team \"scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms\" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to \"avoid sounding slick or sci-fi\". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried \"affected his comedy\", and \"the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances\".<ref name=\"sound\">{{cite web |last=Droney |first=Maureen |title=Avast and Away! |work=Mix Magazine |date=January 1, 2003 |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |access-date=November 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043304/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ |archive-date=March 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe music from the film is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles (\"[[I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)|I'm Still Here]]\" and \"Always Know Where You Are\") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]].
