It also makes a point about Skeffington's status as a Jew in 1914 high society and later in relation to Nazi Germany. Supporting actors include [[Walter Abel]], [[George Coulouris]] and [[Richard Waring]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1914, spoiled Fanny Trellis is a renowned beauty with many suitors. She loves her brother Trippy and would do anything to help him. Fanny learns that Trippy has [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] money from his employer Job Skeffington. To save her brother from prosecution, Fanny pursues and marries the lovestruck Skeffington. Disgusted by the arrangement, in part because of his prejudice against Skeffington being Jewish, Trippy leaves home to fight in the [[Lafayette Escadrille]] in World War I.\n\nJob loves Fanny, but she is merely fond of him and largely ignores him. She becomes pregnant with his child, but when Trippy dies in France, she states she is \"stuck\" with Job, and the marriage then becomes wholly loveless, continuing only for the child's sake. Job and George Trellis, Fanny's cousin, also enlist but are stationed near home.\n\nFanny enjoys playing the wealthy socialite, stringing along a persistent quartet of suitors who are unfazed by her marriage as well as much younger lovers. Lonely, Job finds solace with his secretaries. When Fanny finds out, she divorces him, conveniently ignoring her own behavior.\n\nFanny neglects her young daughter (also named Fanny), who understandably prefers her loving father and begs him to take her with him to Europe. Although Job fears for his child and tries unsuccessfully to explain to her the nature of prejudice she will encounter as a Jew abroad, he finally, tearfully and joyfully, says yes. Fanny is relieved to be free of the encumbrance of a child. Fanny has a series of affairs, living well on the extremely generous settlement Job has left her - half his fortune - and hardly giving a thought to her daughter, whom she does not see for many years.\n\nShe retains her beauty as she grows older (much to the envy of her women acquaintances), but when she catches [[diphtheria]], it ravages her appearance. In denial, she invites her old lovers (and their wives) to a party. The men are shocked (and the women relieved) by how much Fanny has changed, leaving her distraught. Her latest young suitor, Johnny Mitchell, falls in love with her daughter, who has returned from Europe because of the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. They marry after only a few months and leave for [[Seattle]]. Fanny's daughter explains that, while she wishes her mother well, she feels no real love for her, and pities her for discarding the one man who truly loves her. Shortly before her daughter's departure, Fanny suffers the ultimate humiliation when one of her old beaus makes what she at first believes to be a sincere marriage proposal, only to withdraw it when he begins to suspect, incorrectly, that she is no longer wealthy. Fanny is left alone with her maid, Manby.\n\nFanny's cousin George brings Job back to Fanny's home unannounced. The Nazis have left Job penniless and worse, George tells Fanny, and he calls on her to be generous. Fanny's vanity nearly prevents her from venturing down her home's grand staircase to see Job.\n\nWhen she does finally enter the parlor, Job moves to her, stumbles and falls: He is blind (due to torture in a [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]]). Fanny rushes to cradle him in her arms. As she takes his arm and guides him up the staircase, she tells the maid that \"Mr. Skeffington has come home.\" Job had once, long ago, told Fanny that, \"A woman is beautiful only when she is loved.\" George tells Fanny that, at that moment, \"she has never been more beautiful\". At long last, she realizes the truth of it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Frances Beatrice 'Fanny' Trellis Skeffington\n* [[Claude Rains]] as Job Skeffington\n* [[Walter Abel]] as George Trellis, Fanny's cousin\n* [[Richard Waring]] as Trippy Trellis, Fanny's brother\n* [[Marjorie Riordan]] as Fanny Rachel Trellis, Fanny and Job's daughter as an adult\n* [[Robert Shayne]] as MacMahon, a local gangster\n* [[John Alexander (actor)|John Alexander]] as Jim Conderley, one of Fanny's four persistent suitors\n* [[Jerome Cowan]] as Edward Morrison, one of Fanny's four persistent suitors\n* [[Peter Whitney]] as Chester Forbish, one of Fanny's four persistent suitors\n* [[Bill Kennedy (actor)|Bill Kennedy]] as Bill Thatcher, one of Fanny's four persistent suitors\n* Johnny Mitchell as Johnny Mitchell, a younger suitor of Fanny's who later marries her daughter.

Apparently, while Davis was away from her dressing room, the eyewash she always used after filming the day's scenes had been poisoned, causing Davis to scream out in pain. Director Vincent Sherman, with whom Davis had once been romantically involved, admitted to the detectives investigating the incident, \"If you asked everyone on the set who would have committed such a thing, everyone would raise their hand!\" Even Bette Davis is quoted as saying \"Only a mother could have loved me at this point in my life.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n==Box office==\nAccording to the Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,456,000 domestically and $1,365,000 foreign.<ref name=\"warners\"/>\n\n==Awards==\nBette Davis was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and Claude Rains was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Amg movie|33696}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=2372}}\n* {{IMDb title|0037094}}\n* {{AFI film|id=24077|title=Mr. Skeffington}}\n* [https://archive.org/download/Lux_Fills_and_Upgrades/Lux-451001-lowvol51m04s-496-MrsSkeffington-BDavisPaulHenreid.mp3 ''Mr. Skeffington''] on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: October 1, 1945\n\n{{Vincent Sherman}}\n\n[[Category:1944 films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Franz Waxman]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vincent Sherman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1910s]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Julius J.
