An homage to ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' by [[Jane Austen]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jasna.org/film/na.html |title=Northanger Abbey |publisher=Jane Austen Society of North America |date=January 10, 2010}}</ref> the film is a character study about a young woman who escapes her small town in Tennessee for a new life in coastal Florida. The film marks Judd\u2019s first starring role.\n\nThe film won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Feature at the [[Sundance Film Festival|1993 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was also nominated for six [[9th Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Awards]], with Judd winning for Best Female Lead.\n\n==Plot==\nRuby is a young woman in her early 20s and the narrator of the film. She leaves her small town in Tennessee after her mother dies, ultimately landing in [[Panama City, Florida]], a summer resort town she visited as a child. She arrives in Panama City (nicknamed \"Redneck Riviera\") in the fall, the beginning of the off-season when [[tourism]] is slow. Despite this, Ruby manages to get a job at Chambers Beach Emporium, a souvenir store run by Mildred Chambers. Mildred rejects Ruby\u2019s application initially, but Ruby wins her over by telling her, \"I've done retail before, and I work real cheap.\"\n\nOver the course of a year Ruby keeps a journal where she contemplates her career ups and downs, her love life, her past, and her future. Ruby's introspective narration is interspersed with routine scenes at the souvenir store, and conversations with her friend Rochelle or the men she dates, Ricky and Mike.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Ruby Lee Gissing\n* [[Todd Field]] as Mike McCaslin\n* [[Bentley Mitchum]] as Ricky Chambers\n* Allison Dean as Rochelle Bridges\n* [[Dorothy Lyman]] as Mildred Chambers\n* Betsy Douds as Debrah Ann\n* Felicia Hern\u00e1ndez as Persefina\n\n== Production ==\nWhen Victor Nu\u00f1ez originally pitched the film to distributors, he was met with disinterest. \"I was told flat outright -- and these were very reputable distributors of independent films -- 'no one is interested in a film about a female shop clerk in Panama City.'
