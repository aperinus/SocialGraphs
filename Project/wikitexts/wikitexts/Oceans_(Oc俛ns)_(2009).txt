The film begins on a beach and there are boys and one of them wonders what the ocean is. The scene cuts to the Galapagos where a clan of [[marine iguana]]s and [[horseshoe crab]]s wander. Then at night a rocket takes off and surprises the two clans. Meanwhile, the rocket takes off to outer space. Then goes to the trench where the larvae of [[sea urchin]] and the crustacean egg lie. Then comes to a swarm of moon [[jellyfish]]. Then at day a different type of jellyfish float along the current. \n\nLater at the coast of South Africa, a hungry mob of common [[dolphin]]s, [[gannet]]s, [[bronze whaler shark]]s, and [[brydes whale]]s hunt [[sardine]]s. After the feast, [[manta ray]]s gobble down a few sardines. moments later a [[blanket octopus]] swims quietly along the current. Meanwhile, the sardines start making odd shapes. At a beach, [[sea lion]]s rest in the sun. In deeper water, a [[humpback whale]] and her calf start to flipper slap, spyhop, and breach. Meanwhile, the sea lions start hunting. the others on the beach watch sally lightfoot [[crab]]s crawl on the sand. The hunting sea lions are returning home, but some are eaten by a [[great white shark]] and a [[killer whale]]. In the deeper waters, a [[blue whale]] feasts on some [[krill]]. At twilight, birds are flying back to their nests. At night carnivores are out to hunt on the reef including the [[mantis shrimp]] who kills a crab. In Australia, a [[Spanish dancer]] comes out of its home. At day, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s are leaping on the waves. Meanwhile, a [[dugong]] and green [[sea turtle]] are feasting on [[sea grass]]. On the beach, baby sea turtles have to make it to the ocean without being eaten by [[frigatebird]]s, which only one baby turtle survives. In the sea, [[sailfish]] are feasting on fish.\n\nAt a [[coral reef]], creatures are minding their own business. Beyond the reef a [[cuttlefish]] is eating crabs. After that, [[garden eel]]s and [[Centriscidae|razorfish]] act really smooth. After that, [[spider crabs]] start war. Meanwhile, [[humpback whales]], blue whales, [[Molidae|sunfish]], [[blue shark]]s, [[sperm whale]]s and [[whale shark]]s migrate. Then a bunch of [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[yellowfin tuna]], and [[manta ray]]s swim for a long time. Far away, an [[Asian sheepshead wrasse]] is mating. Miles away, a [[sea otter]] is smashing [[clam]]s. In Alaska, the humpback whales have made it to the feeding grounds. The scene cuts to netted sea animals including tuna, whale sharks, sailfish, sea turtles, and sunfish. Along the way, a fishing boat has a hard time fighting the waves. Then a satellite shows the trash in the ocean. Underwater tons of trash is destroying a [[fur seal]]'s home. The scene cuts to the 2 polar regions Arctic and Antarctica. Then, divers are discovering the ocean, and one of them swims with a great white shark. At the end, the narrator says we shouldn't ask what exactly is the ocean, we should ask what exactly are we.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Filming ===\nThe documentary was produced in collaboration with scientists from the [[Census of Marine Life]] and employed technologies including stabilized cameras for rough seas, an electric mini-helicopter to approach and film marine animals without noise, and submerged cameras both towed and on poles over the side of vessels, resulting in film of over 200 species at more than 50 global locations.<ref>Snelgrove, Paul V.
