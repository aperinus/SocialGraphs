While based in [[West Germany]] for now, Mac is angling to become head of Western European Coca-Cola Operations, based in London. After working on an arrangement to introduce Coke into the [[Soviet Union]], Mac receives a call from his boss, W.P. Hazeltine, at [[Coca-Cola headquarters]] in [[Atlanta]]. Scarlett Hazeltine, the boss's hot-blooded but slightly dim 17-year-old socialite daughter, is coming to West Berlin. Mac is assigned the unenviable task of taking care of this young whirlwind.\n\nAn expected two-week stay develops into two months, and Mac discovers just why Scarlett is so enamored of West Berlin: she surprises him by announcing that she's married to Otto Piffl, a young [[East Germany|East German]] Communist with ardent anti-capitalistic views. When the Southern belle is confronted about her foolishness in the matter of helping him blow up anti-American \"Yankee Go Home\" balloons (how the couple met) she simply replies with, \"Why, that ain't [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]], it's anti-Yankee... And where I come from, everybody's against the [[Yankee]]s ...\"\n\nMac tries to come to terms with the fact that he let his boss's daughter marry a Communist and learns the horrible truth: the couple are bound for [[Moscow]] to make a new life for themselves (\"They've assigned us a magnificent apartment, just a short walk from the bathroom!\"). Since Hazeltine and his wife are coming to Berlin to collect their daughter the very next day, this is obviously a disaster of monumental proportions, and Mac deals with it as any good capitalist would &mdash; by framing the young Communist firebrand and having him picked up by the [[Volkspolizei|East German police]], using all his wiles, as well as his sexy secretary Fr\u00e4ulein Ingeborg, to get his way. After Otto is forced to listen endlessly to a cover of the song \"[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]\" during interrogation, which was intentionally badly distorted during playback, he cracks and signs a confession that he is an American spy.\n\nUnder pressure from his stern and disapproving wife Phyllis (who wants to take her family back to live in the US), and with the revelation that Scarlett is pregnant, Mac sets out to bring Otto back with the help of his new Soviet business associates. With the boss on the way, he finds that his only chance is to turn Otto into a son-in-law in good standing &mdash; which means, among other things, making him a capitalist with an aristocratic pedigree (albeit contrived by adoption).\n\nMac arranges to have Otto adopted by an impoverished count, who now works as a washroom attendant and includes a photo of the family castle with the price of adoption (destroyed in the 17th Century by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]). Scarlett is dubious that her father will be fooled by the ruse, but is reassured that her baby will now be part of a long line of bleeders, which will please her snobbish mother. In a frenetic race against time and the arrival of the Hazeltines' plane, Mac outfits Otto in complete paraphernalia befitting his new aristocratic status, while Otto rails against being forced to join the detested [[bourgeoisie]] (his Communist Party membership is paid up through the year). Meanwhile Scarlett and Mac coach Otto on how to speak to her conservative [[Southern United States|Southern]] father (\"The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was a draw...\").\n\nIn the end, the Hazeltines approve of their new son-in-law, upon which Mac learns from Hazeltine that Otto will be named the new head of Western European Operations, with Mac getting a promotion to VP of Procurement back in Atlanta. Mac reconciles with his family at the airport, and to celebrate his promotion, buys them Cokes. After handing out the bottles, he discovers that the Coke machine actually has been stocked with [[Pepsi-Cola]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Cagney]] as C.R. \"Mac\" MacNamara\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Otto Ludwig Piffl\n* [[Pamela Tiffin]] as Scarlett Hazeltine\n* [[Arlene Francis]] as Phyllis MacNamara\n* [[Liselotte Pulver]] as Fr\u00e4ulein Ingeborg (Mac's secretary)\n* [[Hanns Lothar]] as Schlemmer (Mac's assistant and henchman)\n* [[Howard St. John]] as Wendell P.

In response to Crawford's protests over the use of the Coca-Cola brand in the film, Wilder scattered some references to Pepsi, including the final scene.<ref>{{cite book| title=Joan Crawford, A Biography| year=1978 | first= Bob |last= Thomas| author-link= Bob Thomas (reporter) | page=212| publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]}}</ref> Some scenes were shot at [[Bavaria Film Studios]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nThe theatrical release poster for the film, with a woman holding three balloons, was designed by [[Saul Bass]]. The Bass designed poster that Wilder originally intended for the film's release featured a United States style flag sticking out of a Coca-Cola-style bottle.

He has seldom worked so hard in any picture or had such a browbeating ball. His fellow is a free-wheeling rascal. His wife (Arlene Francis) hates his guts. He knows all the ways of beating the rackets and has no compunctions about their use. He is brutishly bold and brassy, wildly ingenious and glib. Mr. Cagney makes you mistrust him\u2014but he sure makes you laugh with him.  And that's about the nature of the picture. It is one with which you can laugh&mdash;with its own impudence toward foreign crises&mdash;while laughing at its rowdy spinning jokes.<ref name=\"nytbosley\"/></blockquote>\n\n''Time'' magazine called it a \"yell-mell, hard-sell, [[Mack Sennett|Sennett]]-with-a-sound-track satire of [[Iron Curtain|iron curtains]] and [[Color line (civil rights issue)|color lines]], of people's demockeracy, [[Cocacolonization|Coca-Colonization]], peaceful {{sic|noexistence}}, and the Deep Southern concept that all facilities are created separate but equal.\"<ref name=\"time61\"/>  ''Time'' notes Wilder \"purposely neglects the high precision of hilarity that made ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' a screwball classic and ''[[The Apartment]]'' a peerless comedy of officemanship. But in the rapid, brutal, whambam style of a man swatting flies with a pile driver, he has produced a sometimes {{sic|beWildered|nolink=y}}, often wonderfully funny exercise in nonstop nuttiness.\" The film won kudos from the staff at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]].'' They wrote, \"Billy Wilder's ''One, Two, Three'' is a fast-paced, high-pitched, hard-hitting, lighthearted farce crammed with topical gags and spiced with satirical overtones. Story is so furiously quick-witted that some of its wit gets snarled and smothered in overlap. But total experience packs a considerable wallop.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793729.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety'']. Film review, 1961.
