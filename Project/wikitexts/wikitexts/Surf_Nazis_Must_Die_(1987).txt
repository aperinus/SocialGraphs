A group of [[neo-Nazis]] led by Adolf (Brenner), the self-proclaimed \"[[F\u00fchrer]] of the new beach\", takes advantage of the resulting chaos by fighting off several rival [[surfer]] gangs to seize control of the beaches. Meanwhile, an [[African American]] [[oil well]] worker named Leroy (Harden) is killed by the surf Nazis while jogging on the beach. Leroy's mother, \"Mama\" Washington (Neely), devastated by the loss of her son, vows revenge. After arming herself with a [[handgun]] and [[grenades]], she breaks out of her [[retirement home]] and exacts vengeance on the Surf Nazis.\n\n==Cast==\n* Gail Neely as Eleanor \"Mama\" Washington\n* Robert Harden as Leroy\n* Barry Brenner as Adolf\n* Dawn Wildsmith as Eva\n* [[Michael Sonye]] as Mengele\n* Joel Hile as Hook\n* Gene Mitchell as Brutus\n* Tom Shell as Smeg\n* Bobbie Bresee as Smeg's Mom\n* Tom Demenkoff as Ariel\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Surf Nazis Must Die\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Jon McCallum\n| cover        = \n| released     = 2014\n| recorded     = 1987\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Electronic music|Electronic]], [[film score]]\n| length       = \n| label        = \n| producer     = \n}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Surf Nazis Must Die'' was scored by Jon McCallum and features heavy use of synthesizers.
