The [[ensemble cast]] features [[Chris Cooper]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] and deals with a sheriff's investigation into the murder of one of his predecessors. Filmed on location along the [[Rio Grande]] in southern and southwestern Texas, the film received critical acclaim, with critics regarding it as a high point of 1990s independent cinema as well as one of Sayles' best films. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing]], and also appeared on the ballot for the [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] in the western category. The film was a box office success, grossing $13 million against its $3\u20135 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nSam Deeds is the sheriff of Rio County in Frontera, Texas. A native of Frontera, Sam returned two years ago and was elected sheriff. Sam's late father had been the legendary Sheriff Buddy Deeds, who is beloved by the town, remembered as a unique individual with a great sense of fairness and justice. As a teenager Sam had problems with his father and the pair routinely argued and fought.\n\nSam is particularly disapproving of efforts by local business leader Mercedes Cruz and Buddy's former chief deputy, Mayor Hollis Pogue, to enlarge and rename the local courthouse in Buddy's honor; he considers it an unneeded waste of taxpayers' money. As a teenager, Sam had been in love with Mercedes's daughter Pilar, but the courtship was strongly opposed by Buddy and Mercedes. After a chance meeting, Sam and the widowed Pilar, now a local teacher, slowly resume their relationship.\n\nColonel Delmore Payne has recently arrived in town as the commander of the local U.S. Army base. Delmore is the son of Otis \"Big O\" Payne, a local nightclub owner and leading figure in the African-American community. The two are estranged because of Otis's serial womanizing and abandonment of Delmore's mother when Delmore was a child. Two off-duty sergeants from the base discover a human skeleton on an old shooting range on the base along with a Masonic ring, a Rio County sheriff's badge, and later, an expended pistol bullet, very unusual on a rifle range. Sam brings in Texas Ranger Ben Wetzel to help with the case. Wetzel tells Sam that forensics identify the skeleton as that of Charlie Wade, the infamously corrupt and cruel sheriff who preceded Buddy. Wade mysteriously disappeared in 1957, taking $10,000 in county funds, after which Buddy became sheriff.\n\nSam investigates the events leading up to Wade's murder. He learns that Wade terrorized the local African-American and Mexican communities, including extorting money from local business owners on a monthly basis and numerous murders where he asks his innocent victims to show him any weapon they might have, to then justify shooting them for \"resisting arrest\". Wade used this method to murder, in front of Deputy Hollis, Mercedes' husband, Eladio, having discovered he was running an illegal smuggling operation in Rio County without bribing Wade.\n\nSam also uncovers secrets about his father's nearly 30-year term as sheriff that reveal Buddy's own corruption. He visits Wesley Birdsong, a Native American and a roadside tourist stand owner, who reveals that Buddy was a wild young adult after his service in the Korean War but settled down after becoming a deputy sheriff and marrying Sam's mother; but he reveals that Buddy did have a mistress, whose name Wesley claims to have forgotten. Sam travels to [[San Antonio]], where he visits his marginally mentally ill ex-wife Bunny and searches through his father's things, where he discovers love letters from Buddy's mistress. Otis tells Sam that Buddy's focus was on the county political machine while Wade's focus was on money. The janitor at the sheriff's office reveals to Sam that he worked on Buddy's home while incarcerated in the local jail. A local reporter uncovers that Buddy forcibly evicted residents of a small community to make a lake that made Frontera a popular tourist destination with Buddy and Hollis receiving lakefront property.\n\nSam confronts Hollis and Otis about Wade's murder. Wade discovered Otis was running an illegal gambling operation at the nightclub, after he had previously warned Otis against running numbers in the club. A furious Wade violently attacked Otis, ordered him to hand over the monthly extortion money, and then was about to use his \"resisting arrest\" setup to kill Otis. Buddy arrived just as Hollis shot Wade to prevent Otis's murder. The three buried the body and took the $10,000 from the county and gave it to Mercedes\u2014who was destitute after Eladio's recent death\u2014to buy her restaurant. Hollis reveals that Buddy and Mercedes did not take up until some time later. Sam decides to drop the issue, saying it will remain an unsolved mystery. Hollis voices concern that, when the skeleton is revealed to be Wade, people will assume Buddy killed him to take his job, to which Sam states that Buddy's legend can handle it.\n\nPilar meets Sam at an old drive-in theater where Sam shows her an old photo of Buddy and Mercedes and tells her Eladio died 18 months, rather than \"a couple months\", before she was born, revealing Buddy is Pilar's father. Both are hurt over the deception but decide that, since she cannot have any more children, they will continue their romantic relationship, despite the knowledge that they are [[incest|half-siblings]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Charlie Wade\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Buddy Deeds\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Sam Deeds\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Pilar Cruz\n* [[M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n]] as Mercedes Cruz\n* [[Clifton James]] as Hollis Pogue\n** Jeff Monahan as young Hollis Pogue\n* [[Ron Canada]] as Otis Payne\n* [[Carmen de Lavallade]] as Carolyn Payne\n** [[Gabriel Casseus]] as young Otis Payne\n* [[Joe Morton]] as Delmore Payne\n* Eddie Robinson as Chet Payne \n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Bunny\n* Stephen Mendillo as Sgt.
