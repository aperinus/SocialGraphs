The script was written by [[John Guare]] and based on the play of the [[Marvin's Room (play)|same name]] by [[Scott McPherson (playwright)|Scott McPherson]], who died in 1992. McPherson had completed a screenplay for a film version before he died; however Guare was hired to update it when the film eventually started production years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two Wrenching Dramas Find Unexpected New Lives|first=Peter|last=Marks|date=December 8, 1996|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E5D9113CF93BA35751C1A960958260|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/fmarvinsroom.htm A Door Left Opened] accessed 11/23/2016</ref>\n\nIt stars [[Meryl Streep]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Hume Cronyn]], [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Hal Scardino]] and [[Dan Hedaya]]. Original music for the film was composed by [[Rachel Portman]]. [[Carly Simon]] wrote and performed the theme song \"Two Little Sisters\", with Meryl Streep adding background vocals.\n\n==Plot==\nMarvin, a man who had a stroke 20 years ago, is left incapacitated and bed-ridden. He has been cared for by his daughter Bessie in their [[Florida]] home, and ignored by his other daughter, Lee, who moved to Ohio with her husband 20 years ago and has never contacted her family.\n\nNow, however, Bessie's doctor has informed her that she has [[leukemia]] (the same disease her and Lee's mother died from in their youth) and needs a [[bone marrow transplant]] and she turns to her sister for help.  Lee, in turn, turns to her 10-year-old son Charlie and 17-year-old teenage son Hank, the latter of whom has been committed to a [[mental institution]] for setting fire to his mother's house. However, the rebellious Hank says he won't submit himself to be tested for a match.\n\nNevertheless, they all travel down to stay with Bessie. When Lee finds that she may have to take over her father's care, she at first begins shopping around for [[nursing home]]s, fearing that she'll have to uproot her life. Eventually, however, the estranged family grows close and Hank agrees to get tested.\n\nAs Bessie progressively seems to get worse, and testing shows the boys are not a match as bone marrow donors, Lee comes to terms that it is now her turn to take care of her family. The film closes on Lee familiarizing herself with her father's medication, as she walks into his room with his lunch, overlooking Bessie flashing sunlight off the mirror that makes Marvin smile.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Lee, Hank and Charlie's mother\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Hank, Lee's 17-year-old son\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Bessie, Lee's sister\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Dr. Wally\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Marvin, father of Lee and Bessie\n* [[Gwen Verdon]] as Ruth, Marvin's sister\n* [[Hal Scardino]] as Charlie, Lee's 10-year-old son\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Bob, Wally's brother\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as the Retirement Home Director\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Dr. Charlotte\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds an 84% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 50 reviews and an average rating of 6.7/10.
