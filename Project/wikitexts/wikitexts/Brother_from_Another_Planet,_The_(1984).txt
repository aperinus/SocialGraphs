The low-budget film stars [[Joe Morton]] as an extraterrestrial trapped on Earth.\n\n==Plot==\nA mute space alien crash-lands his ship on [[Ellis Island]]. Other than his three-toed feet which he keeps covered, he resembles a black human man. He manages to blend in with the people he encounters and engages in one-sided conversations with various denizens of New York City. He secures housing through a new acquaintance at a Harlem bar. Able to heal wounds and fix machines by holding his hand over them, he repairs an [[arcade cabinet]] there, leading to him gaining a job as a technician. Two [[men in black]], keen on the mute alien's whereabouts, begin to track him and interrogate the people he has encountered. They seek to return him to the planet from which he escaped.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Joe Morton]] as The Brother\n* [[Rosanna Carter]] as West Indian Woman\n* Ray Ramirez as Hispanic Man\n* Yves Rene as Haitian Man\n* Peter Richardson as Islamic Man\n* Ginny Yang as Korean Shopkeeper\n* Daryl Edwards as Fly\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Odell\n* [[Leonard Jackson (actor)|Leonard Jackson]] as Smokey\n* [[Ishmael Houston-Jones]] as Dancer\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Randy Sue Carter\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Walter\n* [[Maggie Renzi]] as Noreen\n* [[Olga Merediz]] as Noreen's Client\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Sam\n* [[Minnie Gentry]] as Mrs. Brown\n* [[Ren Woods]] as Bernice\n* [[Reggie Rock Bythewood]] as Rickey\n* [[John Sayles]] and [[David Strathairn]] as Men In Black\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Card Trickster\n* [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] as Malverne Davis\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Man Being Arrested (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\nDirector John Sayles has described ''The Brother from Another Planet'' as being about the immigrant experience of assimilation.<ref name=\"dvdtalk\">{{cite web | url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/john_sayles.html | last=Jawetz | first=Gil | title=The Return of ''The Brother from Another Planet'': The John Sayles Interview | date=June 6, 2002 | publisher=DVDtalk.com | accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> Extras from the film described it as \"The Black E.T. movie.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/25/movies/john-sayles-is-secure-at-last.html|title = John Sayles is Secure at Last|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 25 October 1983|last1 = Harmetz|first1 = Aljean}}</ref>\n\nSayles spent part of his [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellows]] \"genius\" grant on the film, which cost $350,000 to produce.<ref name=\"timemagblues\">{{cite web | url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954425,00.html | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120912043507/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954425,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= September 12, 2012 | title=Blues for Black Actors | author=Richard Corliss | author-link=Richard Corliss | date= October 1, 1984| publisher= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate= 2010-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called ''The Brother from Another Planet'' a \"vastly amusing but progressively erratic\" film structured as a \"series of behavioral vignettes, [many of which] are genuinely delightful and inventive\"; as it continues, the film \"takes a rather unpleasant and, ultimately, confusing turn.\"<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web | url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789571.html | title=The Brother From Another Planet | author=Variety Staff | date= December 31, 1983| publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate= 2010-08-13}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] called it a \"nice, unsurprising [[shaggy dog story|shaggy-dog story]] that goes on far too long\" but singled out \"Joe Morton's sweet, wise, unaggressive performance.\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DEEDA143AF937A2575AC0A962948260 | title=Sayles's ''Brother'' | date= September 14, 1984| author= Vincent Canby| author-link= Vincent Canby| work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate= 2010-08-13}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"the movie finds countless opportunities for humorous scenes, most of them with a quiet little bite, a way of causing us to look at our society\", noting that \"by using a central character who cannot talk, [Sayles] is sometimes able to explore the kinds of scenes that haven't been possible since the death of [[silent film]].\"<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-brother-from-another-planet-1984 | title=The Brother From Another Planet | author=Roger Ebert | author-link=Roger Ebert | date= January 1, 1984| publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | accessdate= 2010-08-13}}</ref>\n\n[[The A.V.

And all his movies are hampered by an almost shocking ignorance of filmmaking fundamentals -- he just doesn't know where to put his camera. The movie would have benefited from more attention to the bounty hunters, whose difficulties with Harlem culture would have balanced the Brother's strange ease of assimilation. Instead, the plot takes a centrifugal turn as the Brother roots out a scag baron whose drugs are poisoning the community.\"<ref>Attanasio, P. (1984, November 16) Listen to 'Brother'.
