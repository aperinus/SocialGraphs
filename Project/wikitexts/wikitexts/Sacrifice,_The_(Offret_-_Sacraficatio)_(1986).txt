Starring [[Erland Josephson]], the film was produced by the [[Swedish Film Institute]]. Many of the crew were alumni of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s films.\n\n''The Sacrifice'' centers on a middle-aged intellectual who attempts to bargain with God to stop an impending nuclear holocaust. The film combines [[Paganism|pagan]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] religious themes; Tarkovsky called it a \"parable\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Sculpting in Time: Reflections on the Cinema |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1989 |isbn=9780292776241 |location=Austin, TX |pages=218 |language=English |translator-last=Hunter-Blair |translator-first=Kitty}}</ref>\n\n''The Sacrifice'' was Tarkovsky's third film as a Soviet expatriate, after ''[[Nostalghia]]'' and the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'', and he died shortly after its completion. He was diagnosed with cancer after making of the film, and by 1986 was unable to attend its presentation at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] due to his illness. Like 1972's ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on the birthday of Alexander ([[Erland Josephson]]), an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide ([[Susan Fleetwood]]), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franz\u00e9n), and young son, \"Little Man\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a [[birthday card]] to him. When Otto asks, Alexander says his relationship with God is \"nonexistent\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car, but Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, he first recounts how he and Adelaide found their house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with it and its surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\"; in fact, he has \"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\".<ref name=sculpting>{{cite book|last1=Tarkovsky|first1=Andrei|title=Sculpting in Time|date=1989|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-77624-1|page=222}}</ref>\n\nThe family, Victor, and Otto gather at Alexander's house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria's odd behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of \"inexplicable but true incidents.\" Just when dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be all-out war, and possibly [[nuclear holocaust]]. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown. In despair, Alexander vows to [[God]] to renounce all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone. Otto advises him to slip away and lie with Maria, who Otto tells him is a [[witch]] \"in the best possible sense\".\n\nAlexander takes a pistol from Victor's medical bag, leaves a note in his room, escapes the house, and rides Otto's bike to Maria's house. He tells her the story of when he fixed up and brought order to his mother's garden, only to find that it lost all its beauty when he did so. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but when he puts the gun to his temple (\"Don't kill us, Maria\"), at which point the jet fighters' rumblings return, she soothes him and they make love while floating above her bed, though Alexander's reaction is ambiguous.\n\nWhen he wakes the next morning, in his own bed, everything seems normal. Nevertheless, Alexander sets forth to give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk, and sets fire to their house while they are away. As the group rushes back, alarmed by the fire, Alexander confesses that he set it, and runs around wildly. Maria, who until then was not seen that morning, appears; Alexander tries to approach her, but is restrained by others. Without explanation, an ambulance appears, and two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, and drive off with him. Maria begins to bicycle away, but stops to observe Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted the day before.{{#tag:ref|'In the opening shot, before Otto meets them, Alexander tells Little Man the legend of Ioann Kolov, pupil of an Orthodox monk named Pamve, who was ordered by his master to climb a mountain every day, to water a dead tree he had planted, until the tree came back to life, which, after three years, it did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Peter|title=Tarkovsky's Poetic Cinema|url=http://www.andreitarkovski.org/vita/green.html|website=andreitarkovski.org|access-date=13 September 2014}}</ref> |group=\"n\"}} As Maria leaves, the \"mute\" Little Man, lying at the foot of the tree, speaks his only line, which quotes the opening of the [[Gospel of John]]: \"In the beginning was the Word.{{bibleref2c|Jn|1:1|NKJV}} Why is that, Papa?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Alexander\n* [[Susan Fleetwood]] as Adelaide\n* [[Allan Edwall]] as Otto\n* Gu\u00f0r\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir as Maria\n* [[Sven Wollter]] as Victor\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Mairesse]] as Julia\n* Filippa Franz\u00e9n as Marta\n* Tommy Kjellqvist as Gossen (Little Man)\n* Per K\u00e4llman, Tommy Nordahl as ambulance drivers\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n''The Sacrifice'' originated as a screenplay called ''The Witch'', which preserved the element of a middle-aged protagonist spending the night with a reputed witch.
