It stars [[Dakota Johnson]], [[Rebel Wilson]], [[Damon Wayans Jr.]], [[Anders Holm]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Nicholas Braun]], [[Jake Lacy]], [[Jason Mantzoukas]], and [[Leslie Mann]], and follows a group of women in [[New York City]] who have different approaches on how to be single. The film was theatrically released in the United States on February 12, 2016, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It grossed $112 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAlice temporarily dumps her college boyfriend Josh, moving to New York City to be a paralegal and live with her sister, Meg, an [[OB/GYN]] who has no interest in having a baby or relationship. Alice befriends wild Australian co-worker Robin, who enjoys partying and one-night stands, and local bartender Tom, who embraces the bachelor lifestyle and hooks up with several women, including Alice. Tom meets Lucy at his bar when she uses his Internet for free; she explains she is looking for \"the one\" using various dating sites.\n\nAlice meets with Josh, ready to reconcile. He explains he is seeing someone else, which distresses her. Meg has a change of heart while watching over a baby, deciding to have a child of her own via a [[sperm donor]].\n\nShortly after she becomes pregnant, Meg unexpectedly hooks up with a younger man, Ken, after meeting him at Alice's office [[Christmas]] party. He, the law office receptionist, is smitten with her. She tries to break it off, but he continues to pursue her cutely. Thinking Ken is too young for her to have a future with, Meg hides the pregnancy from him.\n\nBack at Tom's bar, Lucy has a string of horrible dates, at which point he realizes he has feelings for her. In an attempt to put herself out there, Alice attends a networking event, where she hits it off with a man named David.\n\nLucy has been in a relationship for three weeks with Paul, who reveals he has been seeing other people, thinking she was doing the same, and breaks up with her. Lucy breaks down at her volunteer job reading to children at a bookstore. George, who works there, soothes her, and they begin a relationship.\n\nAlice and Robin attend Josh's holiday party; Alice finds she cannot watch Josh with his new girlfriend. She runs into David, who shows her a private view of the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]], dazzling her, and they begin a relationship. Three months later, as she is singing with David's daughter Phoebe, David becomes upset with her, reminding her that she is not Phoebe's mother. His wife died two years ago and he believes it is too soon for Phoebe to have a [[stepmother]]. They break up as a result.\n\nTom becomes upset with Lucy's relationship with George, and invites Alice to get drunk. They talk about their frustrations with their feelings for Josh and Lucy and sleep together to distract themselves. Ken discovers Meg is pregnant but is eager to help raise her child. She, fearing that he is not truly committed, ends the relationship.\n\nAt Alice's birthday party, Robin invites Tom, David, and Josh without Alice's knowledge, as she thought it would be funny. Shaken by the presence of all three men, Alice confronts Robin. Tom confesses his feelings to Lucy, but she announces she is engaged to George. Josh approaches Alice, and they make out but stop when he reveals to a horrified Alice that he is now engaged and was merely looking for closure with her.\n\nInvigorated by a desire to find herself, Alice leaves to go home. Her cab hits Robin, who was trying to stop the cab for Meg, who is in labor. They rush to the hospital, where Meg gives birth to a baby girl. Ken convinces her to resume their relationship, while Alice rekindles her friendship with Robin.\n \nThe film closes with Alice reflecting on her time living alone and being single. Meg and Ken are together, while Robin continues her old habits. Tom opens up to the possibilities of non-casual relationships. Lucy marries George, and David talks to his daughter about her mom. Finally, Alice is seen exploring the [[Grand Canyon]] by herself to witness the sunrise on New Year's Day: a dream she'd always had.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Alice Kepley, Meg's sister and Robin's friend and co-worker\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Robin, Alice's friend and co-worker\n* [[Damon Wayans Jr.]] as David Stone, Alice's love interest\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Tom, a bartender.\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Lucy, she has online dating down to a science hoping to find her soul mate.\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Josh, Alice's love interest\n* [[Jake Lacy]] as Ken, Meg's love interest\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as George, works at the bookstore where Lucy volunteers to read at children.\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Meg Kepley, Alice's sister\n* [[Colin Jost]] as Paul\n* [[Brent Morin]] as Lucy's date\n\n==Production==\nThe film rights for the [[Liz Tuccillo]] novel were purchased in 2008, the same year as the book's publication.<ref name=\"DitterDirect\" /> [[Drew Barrymore]] was initially attached to direct <ref name=BarrymoreDirect>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Drew Barrymore to Direct 'How to Be Single' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/drew-barrymore-direct-how-be-167910|access-date=May 2, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 15, 2011}}</ref> however she was replaced in 2013 with Christian Ditter.<ref name=DitterDirect>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|last2=Kroll|first2=Justin|title=Drew Barrymore's 'How to Be Single' Attracts Director (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/drew-barrymores-how-to-be-single-christian-ditter-1200970414/|access-date=May 2, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Lily Collins]] was in early talks on February 24, 2014, to join the cast of the film.<ref name=CollinsCast>{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Lily Collins Wants to Show New Line 'How to Be Single' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/lily-collins-new-line-how-to-be-single-1201074364/|access-date=May 1, 2015|work=Variety|date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> [[Alison Brie]] was in talks to join the film on June 19, 2014.<ref name=BrieCast>{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Alison Brie in Talks to Star in New Line's 'How to Be Single' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/alison-brie-new-lines-how-to-be-single-1201223813/|access-date=May 1, 2015|work=Variety|date=June 19, 2014}}</ref> [[Dakota Johnson]], [[Rebel Wilson]], and [[Leslie Mann]] were all cast in the film on January 29, 2015.<ref name=FourCast>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|last2=Kit|first2=Borys|title=Dakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson Joining 'How to Be Single' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dakota-johnson-rebel-wilson-dan-768417|access-date=May 1, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 29, 2015}}</ref> [[Damon Wayans Jr.]] was added to the cast on March 6, 2015.<ref name=WayansCast>{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Damon Wayans Jr. Joins New Line's 'How to Be Single'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/damon-wayans-jr-joins-new-lines-how-to-be-single-1201448085/|access-date=May 1, 2015|work=Variety|date=March 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Jason Mantzoukas]] and [[Nicholas Braun]] were also cast, on April 14, 2015; Braun played the love interest of Johnson's character, while Mantzoukas played the love interest of Brie's.
