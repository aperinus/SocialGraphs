The plot follows a group of high school graduates who create their own fake college after being rejected from the colleges to which they applied.  The story takes place in [[Wickliffe, Ohio|Wickliffe]] and a fictitious [[college town]] called Harmon in [[Ohio]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary is currently 668 words long, which is within the permitted length.

His gifts do not extend to grades, however, and he receives rejection letters from all the colleges to which he applies, including those with high acceptance rates.\n\nTo gain approval from his demanding father ([[Mark Derwin]]), Bartleby creates a fake college, the South Harmon Institute of Technology (SHIT). His best friend, Sherman Schrader III ([[Jonah Hill]]), who has been accepted into his father's ([[Jim O'Heir]]) prestigious alma mater, [[Hiram College|Harmon College]], aids Bartleby and fellow reject Rory Thayer ([[Maria Thayer]]), who only applied to [[Yale University]] and was rejected due to [[legacy preferences]]; Darryl \"Hands\" Holloway ([[Columbus Short]]), who lost his athletic scholarship after an injury; and Glen (Adam Herschman), who has a low GPA and failed his [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]]  due to [[stupidity]]. To make the \"college\" seem legitimate, Bartleby convinces Sherman to create a functional website for the school.\n\nWhen his father insists on meeting the dean, Bartleby hires Sherman's peculiar uncle, Dr. Ben Lewis ([[Lewis Black]]), a former philosophy professor at Harmon College, to play that role, and he leases an abandoned [[psychiatric hospital]] adjacent to Harmon College and renovates it to look like a college campus. Their plan backfires when the website, which automatically accepts any applicant, enrolls hundreds of other rejected students.\n\nBartleby realizes that these people have nowhere else to go, so he lets them believe that the school is real, a place where they will finally feel accepted, despite objections from his friends. After a visit to Harmon disenchants him with traditional college life, he decides to let the students create their own curriculum; this ranges from the culinary arts, sculpting, meditation, to unusual courses such as [[psychokinesis]], a subject one eccentric kid ([[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]) wishes to study.\n\nBartleby creates a school newspaper (the ''SHIT Rag'') and invents a mascot (the SHIT Sandwiches), while Lewis gives lectures about life; the students primarily spend their time partying. Meanwhile, the [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and corrupt dean of Harmon College, Richard Van Horne ([[Anthony Heald]]), makes plans to construct the Van Horne Gateway, a park-like walkway similar to [[Yale]] and [[Harvard]]'s, hoping to make Harmon look more prestigious and increase their number of rejected students. He dispatches Harmon's student body president Hoyt Ambrose ([[Travis Van Winkle]]) to free up the nearby properties, but when Bartleby refuses to relinquish the lease for the South Harmon property, Hoyt tries to reveal the college as a fake. The dispute turns personal, as Bartleby has been vying for the affections of Hoyt's ex-girlfriend, Monica Moreland ([[Blake Lively]]).\n\nHoyt exposes South Harmon as a fake institution through Sherman, who is attempting to join Hoyt's [[fraternity]] as a legacy but is constantly humiliated and abused by them. After debasing Sherman once more, the fraternity coerces him to hand over all the files he has created for South Harmon.\n\nHoyt contacts all the students' parents, and with Van Horne, reveals the school is a sham. Soon after, the school is forced to close, and Bartleby is at risk of prison time for fraud. However, Sherman, who has already discovered much of Harmon College's corruption, files for accreditation for South Harmon, giving Bartleby a chance to make his college legitimate. At the subsequent State of Ohio [[educational accreditation]] hearing, Bartleby makes an impassioned speech about the failures of conventional education and the importance of following one's own passions, convincing the board to grant his school a one-year probationary accreditation to test his new system and make the school adequate, thus foiling Van Horne's schemes.\n\nThe college reopens, renovated and with more students enrolling, including Sherman and Monica. In addition, Bartleby finally earns the approval of his father, who is proud his son now owns a college. As the film closes, Van Horne walks to his car in the parking lot, only to watch it suddenly explode. Bartleby watches in astonishment (or perhaps fear) as the eccentric student from earlier makes his interest in psychokinetic explosion a reality.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Justin Long]] as Bartleby \"B\" Gaines\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Sherman Schrader III\n* Adam Herschman as Glen\n* [[Columbus Short]] as Darryl \"Hands\" Holloway\n* [[Maria Thayer]] as Rory Thayer\n* [[Lewis Black]] as Dr. Ben Lewis\n* [[Blake Lively]] as Monica Moreland\n* [[Mark Derwin]] as Jack Gaines\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Diane Gaines\n* [[Hannah Marks]] as Lizzie Gaines\n* [[Robin Lord Taylor]] as Abernathy Darwin Dunlap\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Kiki\n* [[Joe Hursley]] as Maurice / [[The Ringers]]\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as Freaky Student\n* [[Anthony Heald]] as Dean Richard Van Horne\n* [[Travis Van Winkle]] as Hoyt Ambrose\n* [[Kaitlin Doubleday]] as Gwynn\n* [[Ross Patterson]] as Mike McNaughton\n* Artie Baxter as Mike Chambers\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Dwayne\n* Brendan Miller as Wayne\n* [[Ray Santiago]] as Princeton boy\n* [[Greg Sestero]] as a frat boy (uncredited)\n* [[Ned Schmidtke]] as Dr. J.
