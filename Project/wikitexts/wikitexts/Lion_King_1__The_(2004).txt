The third and final installment released in the original [[The Lion King (franchise)|''Lion King'' trilogy]], it is based on ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and serves as an [[origin story]] for the meerkat/warthog duo [[Timon and Pumbaa]] while the film is also set within the events of ''[[The Lion King]]''. A majority of the original voice cast from [[The Lion King|the first film]] returns to reprise their roles, including [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Ernie Sabella]] as the voices of Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. The plot of the movie seems to be inspired by [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', a tragicomedy that tells the story of ''[[Hamlet]]'' from the point of view of 2 minor characters.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]] is a social outcast in his [[meerkat]] colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Ma|mother]], Timon dreams of a better life than his colony's bleak existence continuously hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry in an attempt by his mother to get him accepted, but his daydreaming leads to the near death of his [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Uncle Max|Uncle Max]] by the hyenas [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi, Banzai and Ed]]. Now completely shunned and convinced that he will never fit in with the other meerkats, Timon decides to leave to find a better life. He meets the mandrill [[Rafiki (The Lion King)|Rafiki]], who teaches him about \"[[Hakuna Matata]]\" and advises him to \"look beyond what you see\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]] the [[warthog]] on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon.\n\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of [[Simba]] to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas due to his [[agoraphobia|fear of crowds]], causing an elephant to trumpet in fear and nearby animals to faint, but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \"[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\", Mufasa's fight with the hyenas, and [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Scar|Scar]]'s conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa, and are thrown off a waterfall in their attempt to escape. Exhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle he tried to tell Timon about earlier. They finally settle there with the philosophy of Hakuna Matata.\n\nEventually, Timon and Pumbaa encounter Simba in a nearby desert, nearly dead. They rescue him and decide to raise him under their philosophy. Years later, [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Nala|Nala]] appears and reunites with Simba after chasing and mistaking Pumbaa for food. Believing Hakuna Matata to be in jeopardy, Timon and Pumbaa attempt to sabotage their dates, but fail every time. After they witness Simba and Nala's argument, Simba disappears. Nala explains that he had run off to challenge Scar and reclaim Pride Rock, so that they need their help. Upset that Simba left them, Timon unsuccessfully tries to persuade Pumbaa to stay, but Pumbaa, annoyed that Timon would callously abandon Simba when he needs him, follows Simba and Nala. Timon indulges in the jungle's luxuries by himself, but loneliness starts to overwhelm him. Rafiki appears again and indirectly helps Timon realize that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves (not just the place he sought for), prompting Timon to take off after Pumbaa, Simba and Nala.\n\nTimon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa, before they journey onward to Pride Rock. After helping Simba and Nala distract the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max, who came looking for Timon after Ma got angry at Rafiki for apparently leading Timon on a wild goose chase. Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of Scar and the hyenas. While Simba battles Scar, Ma and Uncle Max are directed to construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas, as at the same time, Timon and Pumbaa use various tactics to distract them (With Timon attempting to propose to Shenzi, but only makes her disgusted) while the tunnel is being made. When the tunnels are finished, Max knocks down the support beams, breaking the ground under the hyenas. However, the last few get jammed, prompting Timon to dive underground and break them himself. The cave-in commences, and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels in time to confront Scar and kill him. Simba accepts his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands, thanking Timon and Pumbaa for their help. Timon takes Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max, and the meerkat colony to live in the predator-free jungle to complete his Hakuna Matata, and he is praised as their hero.\n\nOnce the story finishes, Ma, Uncle Max, Simba, Rafiki, and eventually many other Disney characters (such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]], [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] and the [[Seven Dwarfs]], [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] and [[Jasmine (Aladdin)|Jasmine]] with the [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Stitch]], [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], [[Dumbo]] etc.) join Timon and Pumbaa to rewatch the film in the theater in which Pumbaa tells Timon (as the screen fades to black) that he 'still doesn't do so well in crowds'.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa#Timon|Timon]], a [[meerkat]] who is Pumbaa's best friend.

Bob Baxter served as the supervising animator for Pumbaa.\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Ma|Ma]], Timon's caring mother.

He initially doubts Timon's ability, but warms up to him at the film's climax. \n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Simba]], Mufasa and Sarabi's son, Scar's nephew, Nala's husband and the current King of the Pride Lands.\n**Matt Weinberg voices Simba as a cub, replacing [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]].\n* [[Moira Kelly]] as [[List of The Lion King (franchise) characters#Nala|Nala]], Simba's childhood friend and eventual wife.
