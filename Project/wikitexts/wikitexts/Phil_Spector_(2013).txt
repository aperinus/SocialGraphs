It focuses primarily on the relationship between Spector and Linda Kenney Baden, his defense attorney in 2007 during the first of his two murder trials for the 2003 death of [[Lana Clarkson]] in his California mansion, and is billed as \"an exploration of the client\u2013attorney relationship\" between Spector and Kenney Baden.<ref name=brown20130629>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Mick|author-link=Mick Brown (journalist)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10148042/David-Mamet-on-Phil-Spector-I-dont-give-a-damn-about-the-facts.html|title=David Mamet on Phil Spector: 'I don't give a damn about the facts'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=June 29, 2013|access-date=June 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625162314/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10148042/David-Mamet-on-Phil-Spector-I-dont-give-a-damn-about-the-facts.html|archive-date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was controversial for fictionalizing aspects of the case and for neglecting significant evidence presented by the real life prosecution, leading to accusations that the movie was created as an advocacy piece in Spector's favor. Spector was not involved with the film and disputed its historical accuracy. Although it is based on real people and an actual event, it opens with an unusually worded disclaimer that states, \"This is a work of fiction. It's not 'based on a true story.' ...

In a 2013 interview, he described the resulting film as \"not a documentary...It's basically a fable. It's the fable of the Minotaur, or the fable of [[Beauty and the Beast|beauty and the beast]].

In Brown's view, the movie selectively included evidence supporting Spector's defense and glossed over or ignored prosecution evidence.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Specific examples of inaccuracies that Brown cites are:\n\n* The fictional Bruce Cutler's assertion at the beginning of the movie that a magazine article \u2013 a real-life article based on an interview Brown had with Spector in December 2002 \u2013 that appeared in the ''Telegraph'' magazine had been faxed to Spector on the day of the shooting and had \"set him off\" is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  The article was not published until after Clarkson's death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n* The fictional Cutler's assertion in the film that Spector had been \"cold sober\" for ten years prior to Clarkson's death is incorrect.<ref name=brown20130629/>  Spector began drinking again two months before her death.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n* The fictional Linda Kenney Baden declares in the film that she will not \"attack the girl,\" i.e., Clarkson, in court to defend Spector.<ref name=brown20130629/>  In fact, Kenney Baden's defense of Spector did include attacking Clarkson in court,<ref name=brown20130629/> and the real Kenney Baden showed a video of Clarkson in [[blackface]] imitating [[Little Richard]] during the trial, unlike the fictional Kenney Baden, who rejects it.<ref name=brown20130629/> \n* The film emphasizes the defense's real-life argument about how Spector pulling the trigger in Clarkson's mouth would have created a massive blood spatter on his clothes and that no such blood stain occurred, and this was a major part of Kenney Baden's defense. However, the movie ignores the prosecution's ballistics evidence that Spector pulling the trigger at arm's length would instead have resulted in a misting pattern of blood stains that was found on both Spector's and Clarkson's clothes, consistent with Spector pulling the trigger.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n* In real life, the defense countered the prosecution's evidence that Spector told his chauffeur that he had just killed somebody by arguing that the chauffeur simply misheard Spector. In the movie, the Nick Stavros character introduces a fictitious theory that corrupt detectives were coercing the chauffeur into his testimony about Spector's statement, but in real life the chauffeur never wavered in his statements about what Spector said.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n* Brown claims that the film's depiction of Spector's arrival at his trial in an outlandish wig is a \"distortion,\" but he declines to give a reason for this opinion.<ref name=brown20130629/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] has given the film a score of 60 out of 100, signifying \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/phil-spector |title=Phil Spector - Season 1 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date=2013-03-24 |access-date=2017-05-12}}</ref>\n\nIn his June 2013 article in ''The Telegraph'', Mick Brown wrote that \"''Phil Spector'' is a masterfully executed piece of drama. The dialogue crackles in vintage Mamet fashion, and the performances are uniformly excellent. In his jittery, trembling demeanour, and his flights of self-aggrandising, wounded rhetoric...Pacino seems to be channelling Spector, albeit a Spector possessed of Mamet's considerable erudition and articulacy.\"<ref name=brown20130629/> Reviewing ''Phil Spector'' for TimeOut, Ben Keningsberg wrote that the film makes \"an essentially [[Socratic method|Socratic argument]] about the legal system's potential to try someone on perception,\" and that the real pleasure in watching the movie came from seeing Pacino and Mirren deliver Mamet's dialogue, which he described as including many \"treasurable retorts.\"<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/chicago/tv/phil-spector-movie-review Keningsberg, Ben, \"Helen Mirren and Al Pacino spar in David Mamet's HBO legal drama,\" timeout.com, March 19, 2013.

I'm just making stuff up, using names and a few bits of court testimony that are in the public record.\"<ref name=bianculli20130320/>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Times]]'', Alessandra Stanley had a more negative impression, saying that in the film \"there isn't much to provide dramatic tension\" between Pacino and Mirren, although it is a credit to them that \"they can sustain a story with so little traction,\" adding that the scenes between Pacino and Mirren seem \"a lot like a revisionist re-enactment and maybe even absolution\" for Spector, with \"the facts of the case and characters...molded to allow viewers to doubt Mr. Spector's guilt,\" although \"there is not much anyone can do to make the audience care.\"<ref name=stanley20130321/> Stanley describes Pacino as playing Spector as \"[[Palsy|palsied]], choleric, and [[monomania]]cal, but not entirely repellent,\" with \"an occasional flash of self-awareness in his eyes and a glint of humored reason in his grandiose diatribes,\" and that Mirren's portrayal of Linda Kenney Baden, while \"refined and regal,\" is nothing like the real-life Kenney Baden, who Stanley described as a \"bleached-blonde scrapper.\"<ref name=stanley20130321/> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' television critic Robert Lloyd found the film's opening disclaimer that it is not based on a true story \"disingenuous, if not absurd, given the movie's title, its sprinkling of true facts, and a cast dressed and coiffed to look like the characters whose names they bear,\" and declared the film \"a vexing piece of work\" that is \"well-crafted, with interesting Big Talent attached,\" and \"better than most films of its kind, even as it remains unsatisfying as historical re-creation, philosophical meditation, or pure drama.\"<ref name=lloyd20130323>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/23/entertainment/la-et-st-0322-phil-spector-20130323 Lloyd, Robert, \"Review: 'Phil Spector' a vexing re-invention of case,\" latimes.com, March 23, 2013.

And see, the point of the legal system is that nobody has any idea. That's why the opposite of a guilty verdict is not 'innocent,' it's 'not guilty.' In the wisdom of the American jurisprudence system, the onus is on the state. And if the state cannot prove its case, you've got to let the guy go free, whether or not, in the back of all our minds, we think that he actually did it.\"<ref name=pond20130322/> Addressing his own view of the Spector case more specifically, Mamet told ''[[The Financial Times]]'' in 2011, \"Whether he did it or not, we'll never know, but if he'd just been a regular citizen, they never would have indicted him.\"<ref name=stanley20130321>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/arts/television/phil-spector-on-hbo-with-al-pacino-and-helen-mirren.html Stanley, Alessandra, \"Gone Gone Gone (Woah Oh Oh),\" nytimes.com, March 23, 2013.

But that's very different from saying he was railroaded.\"<ref name=brown20130629/> When Brown asked him why he had given so little attention to the prosecution's case in his script, Mamet replied, \"Well...I'm not making a film about the prosecution.\"<ref name=brown20130629/> Mamet also dismissed Brown's concern that the film would mislead many viewers, who would assume it was an accurate depiction of history and would never bother to look up the facts of the case, saying, \"I'm entitled under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to write whatever the hell I want, and if someone's fool enough to put it on television that's their problem. But the right is moot if there's going to be some overriding authority that at some point says, 'Aha! But what about x, y and z?'
