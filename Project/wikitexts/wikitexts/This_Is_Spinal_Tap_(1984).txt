Additionally, it is claimed that police described one of the deaths as a mystery \"best left unsolved\".\n\n===Real history===\nThe band Spinal Tap first appeared in a video aired as part of a 1979 [[sketch comedy]] special called ''The T.V. Show'', a project spearheaded by Rob Reiner and Michael McKean. The video was for the song \"Rock 'N' Roll Nightmare\", in a sequence that was intended as a spoof of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/rock_n_roll_nightmare_the_origin_of_spinal_tap|title='Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare': The origin of Spinal Tap|last=Schneider|first=Martin|date=November 7, 2013|work=DangerousMinds|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> Participating in the video (and playing the music) were Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Loudon Wainwright III, and [[Russ Kunkel]]; the segment was introduced by Reiner in character as [[Wolfman Jack]]. The Spinal Tap band members were at this point unnamed. McKean and Shearer had previously been members of [[the Credibility Gap]], a comedy troupe that did both spoken word and musical comedy, and had released a mini rock opera and at least one musical 7-inch single.\n\nAlso in 1979, Guest and McKean were members of [[Lenny and the Squigtones]], a band that was fronted by characters from the hit television series ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]''. Guest, on guitar and clarinet, was credited as \"Nigel Tufnel\", the name he would eventually use as a member of Spinal Tap.\n\nThe appearance on ''The T.V. Show'' eventually led to the creation of a film, tracing a disastrous tour undertaken by the aging British metal band Spinal Tap. Reiner hosted the film in the character of filmmaker \"Marty DiBergi\", while Guest, McKean and Shearer took on character names for the project, and further developed their Spinal Tap personas. (Respectively, Guest was guitarist \"Nigel Tufnel\"; McKean was vocalist \"David St. Hubbins\"; and Shearer was bassist \"Derek Smalls\".) Also added to the group were David Kaff (as keyboard player \"Viv Savage\") and R.J. Parnell (as drummer \"Mick Shrimpton\"). Parnell had previously been in the band [[Atomic Rooster]], while Kaff had been a member of [[Rare Bird]]. The quintet played their own instruments throughout the film.\n\nThe band Spinal Tap became a [[going concern]], with the group (in character) playing gigs and appearing on a 1984 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' to promote the film. The character of Mick Shrimpton having died in the film, Parnell played his \"twin brother\" drummer Ric Shrimpton for these and later appearances.\n\n====Reunion and recent history====\n{{Update section|date=November 2019}}\nThe group reformed on January 18, 1991, for a performance at the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] that included new material.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|date=5 March 1991|title=Stories|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=11}}</ref> This featured on the 1992 release, ''[[Break Like the Wind]]'', an album produced in part by [[T-Bone Burnett]]. The album was accompanied by a <!-- perhaps multiple? --> promotional audition for a new drummer attended by [[Stephen Perkins]] of [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Gina Schock]] of [[The Go-Go's]], and [[Mick Fleetwood]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], who auditioned in a fireproof suit. Despite the auditions, Parnell was retained as \"Ric Shrimpton\" and remained the band's drummer. Kaff did not return, and consequently the \"reunited\" band now consisted of Guest, McKean, Shearer and Parnell (all in character) and new keyboardist [[C. J. Vanston]] (under his own name). A promotional concert tour followed, which included an appearance at [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], where they performed \"The Majesty of Rock\", a song they dedicated to Mercury.\n\nThe band also released the single \"Bitch School\", which became a genuine chart single in the UK, as did follow-up single \"The Majesty of Rock\".\n\nThe band also appeared on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode \u201c[[The Otto Show]]\u201d, which aired in the United States on April 23, 1992.  The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. [[Harry Shearer]], who is a regular Simpsons cast member, reprised his role as [[Derek Smalls]].\n\nOn July 1, 1992, Tap crossed five time zones for three performances in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St.&nbsp;John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]; [[Barrie]], Ontario; and [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, for [[MuchMusic]] and Molson's Great Canadian Party. For each performance of \"Stonehenge\", the miniature monument prop was delivered on stage in a courier envelope.\n\nParnell dropped out of the group in the 1990s, leaving Spinal Tap to use session drummers.\n\nIn 2000, the band launched a web site named \"Tapster\", where their song \"Back from the Dead\" was made available for download. Tapster was a parody of [[Napster]], a [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macobserver.com/article/2000/08/01.8.shtml |title=Make Your MP3 Player Go To 11, Spinal Tap Launches Tapster & Releases MP3 |publisher=The Mac Observer |date=August 1, 2000 |access-date=August 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tapster.com/ |title=Tapster |date=October 18, 2000 |access-date=August 13, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20001018130327/http://www.tapster.com/ |archive-date = October 18, 2000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the band \"reunited\" for the nine-city \"Back from the Dead Tour\" that began on June 1, 2001, at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. The tour included a show at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City and ended in [[Montreal]] in mid-July at the [[Just for Laughs]] festival. The opening act for some of these shows were the Folksmen, the folk trio seen in the film ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', and also performed by Guest, McKean, and Shearer.\n\nIn 2007, Tap reunited again, this time to help combat [[global warming]]. \"They're not that environmentally conscious, but they've heard of global warming,\" said Marty DeBergi (portrayed by Reiner). \"Nigel thought it was just because he was wearing too much clothing&nbsp;\u2013 that if he just took his jacket off it would be cooler.\" This reunion also included the release of a new song called \"Warmer Than Hell\". The band played on the [[Live Earth concert, London|London leg]] of the [[Save Our Selves|SOS]]/[[Live Earth]] concert series, and [[Rob Reiner]] has directed a short film (entitled ''Spinal Tap'') which was released on the Live Earth website on April 27.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/this-is-climate-change/2007/04/26/1177459821738.html |title=Spinal Tap reform \u2013 Film \u2013 Entertainment |work=The Age |date=April 26, 2007 |access-date=July 26, 2014}}</ref> The film reveals that Nigel Tufnel is now working as a [[Farmworker|farmhand]] looking after miniature horses.

[[Barry Bostwick]] was the host. At this time, producer [[Dick Ebersol]] approached Shearer, Guest and McKean to join the cast. Shearer and Guest accepted (McKean would not join until ten years later, by which time original producer [[Lorne Michaels]] was back at the show's helm). Shearer's stint on ''SNL'' the following season\u2014his second, the first having been the 1979\u201380 season\u2014was to be short-lived, following creative disputes with the show's management.\n\nIn 1985, at the invitation of [[Ronnie James Dio]], Michael McKean and Harry Shearer took part in the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] benefit project [[Hear 'n Aid]], to raise money for famine victims in Ethiopia. McKean and Shearer attended the event in character as David St. Hubbins and Derek Smalls, appearing in the behind-the-scenes videos and interacting in character with many real-life metal stars, many of whom were huge fans of Spinal Tap. \"David St. Hubbins\" and \"Derek Smalls\" are part of the vocal chorus heard on the record (and seen in the video), and are credited under those names on the Hear 'n Aid single's front cover (alongside many real-life heavy metal stars).  The [[ad hoc]] supergroup's single \"Stars\" rose to No. 26 on the UK charts in May 1986.\n\nAs part of the promotion surrounding ''Break Like the Wind'', Spinal Tap was portrayed in \"[[The Otto Show]]\" episode of the animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', for which Shearer is a principal voice actor. ''The Simpsons'' follows the approach of the original film by presenting the group as if they were a real group. During the disastrous performance, a massive devil balloon on the stage does not inflate properly, and Nigel is temporarily blinded by lasers. Later in the episode, their tour bus is accidentally pushed off a cliff due to [[Otto Mann|Otto]]'s reckless driving. In a 2016 interview Shearer said this was the only time Spinal Tap had worked to a script, all other movie, television and live appearances being improvised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKBHUSv3TIk|title=Harry Shearer And Judith Owens Talk Spinal Tap, Marriage & The Simpsons|publisher=4KQ Brisbane|date=June 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 1992, as part of MuchMusic's Canada Day \"Great Canadian Party\" festival, Spinal Tap completed an unprecedented tour of Canada in less than 24 hours. Jetting across five time-zones, the band played St. John's, Newfoundland, Barrie, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia. That evening, during a performance of \"Stonehenge\", Tap received their signature, triptych set-piece via [[Canada Post]] in a small, bubble-wrap envelope that Derek Smalls signed for onstage. Bemused, Smalls tore open the packaging, and revealed to the cheering crowd the prop which looked to be half the size of the original 18&nbsp;inch Stonehenge rock from the film.\n\nIn 1993, Nigel Tufnel appeared in the [[rockumentary]] ''[[Joe Satriani]]: The Satch Tapes''.\n\nIn 1994, ''The Return of Spinal Tap'' was released on video; most of this was live material from a 1992 performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] where the Stonehenge set was shown to the audience on video as being too big to fit through the stage doors, but it also included some interviews and follow-up on the band members.\n\nIn 2000, while promoting Tapster.com, Spinal Tap appeared and performed on the short-lived series VH1 ''The List'' (with [[Mick Fleetwood]] on drums) and appeared on the ''Late Show''.\n\nIn 2006, Nigel Tufnel appeared in a [[Volkswagen]] TV commercial highlighting their offer of a free, exclusive [[First Act]] guitar with the purchase of qualifying automobiles. The guitar features knobs and inlays with the [[Volkswagen]] logo and pre-amps that allow it to be played through the car's stereo system. Also in 2006, the song \"Gimme Some Money\" was used in a TV commercial {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} for Open from [[American Express]], \"Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight\" appeared in [[Harmonix]]'s video game ''[[Guitar Hero 2]]'' and \"Christmas with the Devil\" appeared in [[BBC One]] promo spots for the network's Christmas program.\n\nIn 2007, while accepting an award from the [[BBC Two]] program ''[[The Culture Show]]'', Christopher Guest broke into Nigel Tufnel, and considered what his wife and kids would make of the [[Mark Kermode]]-shaped award.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nOn July 7, 2007, Spinal Tap played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London<ref>{{Cite news |last=Glaister |first=Dan |date=July 6, 2007 |title=Rock'n'roll to the rescue |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2120288,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref> along with many major bands and groups as part of [[Live Earth]], a [[Climate Change]] awareness concert. Their set included a new song written for the occasion, \"Warmer Than Hell\". During their final number, the song \"Big Bottom\", St. Hubbins and Tufnel both picked up basses. Spinal Tap was also joined by \"every bass player in the known universe\", including [[Nate Mendel]] (of the [[Foo Fighters]]); [[Robert Trujillo]], [[Kirk Hammett]], and [[James Hetfield]] ([[Metallica]]); [[Gordon Moakes]] ([[Bloc Party]]); and [[Adam Yauch]] (a.k.a. MCA), of [[Beastie Boys]]. They were also joined on back-up vocals by [[Annette O'Toole]], Michael McKean's wife.\n\nIn May 2008, Nigel Tufnel appeared in the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] show ''Stonehenge Decoded'', expounding his nonsensical theories about Stonehenge and who was responsible for building it. His claims to have invented \"decoder\" experiments capable of unveiling the true purpose of the monument are, as yet, unproven.\n\nMcKean, Guest and Shearer have made several appearances as their alter egos the Folksmen, including the television shows ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Mad TV]]'' and the film ''The Return of Spinal Tap''.\n\nOn March 2, 2009, Guest, McKean and Shearer held a press conference at the House of Blues in Los Angeles to announce their forthcoming album of new and old Spinal Tap songs, plus a 2009 \"Unwigged & Unplugged\" tour to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the film, ''This Is Spinal Tap''.
