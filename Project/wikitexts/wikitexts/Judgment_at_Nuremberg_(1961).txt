Judge Dan Haywood ([[Spencer Tracy]]) is the chief judge of a three-judge panel of Allied jurists who will hear and decide the case against the defendants. Haywood is particularly interested in trying to learn how the defendant Ernst Janning ([[Burt Lancaster]]) could have committed the atrocities of which he is accused, including the sentencing of innocent people to death. Ernst Janning's character is based loosely on the life of Franz Schlegelberger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://famous-trials.com/nuremberg/2329-a-commentary-on-the-justice-trial|title=A Commentary on the Justice Trial }}</ref> Janning, it is revealed, is a well-educated and internationally respected jurist and legal scholar. Haywood seeks to understand how the [[German people]] could have turned blind eyes and deaf ears to the crimes of the Nazi regime. In doing so, he befriends the widow ([[Marlene Dietrich]]) of a German general who had been executed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He talks with a number of Germans who have different perspectives on the war. Other characters the judge meets are [[United States Army|US Army]] Captain Harrison Byers ([[William Shatner]]), who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann ([[Judy Garland]]), who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution's case against the judges.\n\nGerman defense attorney Hans Rolfe ([[Maximilian Schell]]) argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid, or at least turn blind eyes to, the Nazi regime. He also suggests that the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than those the Nazis perpetrated. He raises several points in these arguments, such as [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]]'s support for the first [[eugenics]] practices (''see'' ''[[Buck v. Bell]]''); the German-[[Holy See|Vatican]] ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; [[Joseph Stalin]]'s part in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet Pact]] of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany's [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation]] of western [[Poland]], initiating [[World War II]]; and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in the final stage of the war in August 1945.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288385|0/Pop-Culture-101-Judgment-at-Nuremberg.html Nixon, Rob. \"Pop Culture 101: ''Judgment at Nuremberg''.\" TCM.com. 2012.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715094348/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288385%7C0/Pop-Culture-101-Judgment-at-Nuremberg.html |date=2018-07-15 }} Accessed 2012-11-02; Mann, Abby.

During his testimony, he explains that well-meaning people like himself went along with [[Adolf Hitler | Adolf Hitler's]] [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], [[racism|racist]] policies out of a sense of patriotism, even though they knew it was wrong, because of the effects of the post-[[World War I]] [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nHaywood must weigh considerations of [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] expediency and ideals of justice. The trial takes place against the background of the [[Berlin Blockade]], and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly so as to gain German support in the growing [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/JudgmentAtNuremberg.html|title=Judgment at Nuremberg|access-date=2008-09-27|last=Bradley|first=Sean|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|quote=He argues that the love of country led to an attitude of \"my country right or wrong.\" Obedience or disobedience to the Fuehrer would have been a choice between [[patriotism]] or [[treason]] for the judges.

All four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nHaywood visits Janning in his cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that, \"By all that is right in this world, your verdict was a just one,\" but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, \"I never knew that it would come to that.\" Judge Haywood replies, \"Herr Janning, it came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.\" Haywood departs; a [[title card]] informs the audience that, of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone]], none were still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.<ref name=imdbfaq>{{cite web|title=Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) FAQ|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055031/faq|access-date=2018-07-01|archive-date=2017-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108063114/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055031/faq|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|This does not refer to the 1946 [[Nuremberg trials]] of the leadership of [[Nazi Germany]], which was in front of an international panel of judges, not solely American ones.

The plot development and thematic treatment question the legitimacy of the social, political, and alleged legal foundations of these actions.\n\nThe real [[Judges' Trial]] focused on 16 judges and prosecutors who served before and during the Nazi regime in Germany, and who embraced and enforced laws&mdash;passively, actively, or both&mdash;that led to judicial acts of [[Compulsory sterilization|compulsory sexual sterilization]] and to the imprisonment and execution of people for their religions, racial or ethnic identities, political beliefs, and physical handicaps or disabilities.\n\nA key thread in the film's plot involves a \"[[Rassenschande|race defilement]]\" trial known as the ''Feldenstein'' case. In this fictionalized case, based on the real life [[Katzenberger Trial]], an elderly [[Jewish]] man had been tried for having a \"relationship\" (sexual acts) with an [[Aryan]] (German) 16-year-old girl, an act that had been legally defined as a crime under the [[Nuremberg Laws]], which had been enacted by the German [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]]. Under these laws, the man was found guilty and was [[capital punishment|put to death]] in 1942. Using this and other examples, the movie explores individual conscience, [[collective guilt]], and behavior during a time of widespread societal immorality.\n\nThe film is notable for its use of [[courtroom drama]] to illuminate individual perfidy and moral compromise in times of violent political upheaval; it was the first mainstream drama film to not shy from showing actual footage filmed by American and British soldiers after the liberation of the [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Shown in court by [[prosecuting attorney]] Colonel Tad Lawson ([[Richard Widmark]]), the scenes of huge piles of naked corpses laid out in rows and bulldozed into large pits were considered exceptionally graphic for a mainstream film of the time.\n\nAccording to numerous sources, Tracy's climactic monologue was filmed in one take using multiple cameras. Clift had problems remembering his lines, so Kramer told him to do the best he could, correctly figuring that Clift's nervousness would be central to his character's mental state. (Clift was so eager to do the film that he worked just for expenses.) Lancaster speaks only three lines (none in the courtroom) until his lengthy outburst roughly 135 minutes into the film. Meanwhile, Garland was so happy to be working in a motion picture again after seven years away that it took her a while to get into the proper frame of mind to break down and cry.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"[[Lili Marleen]]\"\n** Music by [[Norbert Schultze]] (1938)\n** Lyrics by [[Hans Leip]] (1915)\n* \"Liebeslied\"\n** Music by [[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]]\n** Lyrics by [[Alfred Perry]]\n* \"Wenn wir marschieren\"\n** German folk song (ca. 1910)\n* \"Care for Me\"\n** By Ernest Gold\n* \"Notre amour ne peur\"\n** By Ernest Gold\n* \"[[Du, du liegst mir im Herzen]]\"\n** German folk song, arrangement by Ernest Gold\n* \"[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13]]\"\n** By [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[world premiere]] was held on December 14, 1961, at the {{lang|de|[[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Kongresshalle]]}} in [[West Berlin]], Germany.<ref name=\"la times dec 14\" /> 300 journalists from 22 countries were in attendance,<ref name=\"la times dec 24\">{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=John L. |date=December 24, 1961 |title=Berlin 'Judgment' Draws Jas, Neins |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=Calendar, p. 4 }}</ref> and earphones offering the soundtrack dubbed in German, Spanish, Italian, and French were made available.<ref name=\"la times dec 14\" /> The reaction from the audience was reportedly subdued, with some applauding at the finish, but most of the Germans in attendance leaving in silence.<ref name=\"la times dec 24\" />\n\nKramer's film received positive reviews from critics and was lauded as a straight reconstruction of the famous trials of Nazi war criminals.
