He looks for his destiny in seemingly random occurrences. Finding inspiration in the film ''[[Signs (2002 film)|Signs]]'' reinforces his belief in this.\n\nOne day, he answers the telephone; the wrong number is for somebody called \"Kevin\", and Jeff contemplates its meaning, deciding it is a sign. Getting a call from his irritated mother asking him to buy [[wood glue]] to fix a door shutter or find a new place to live, Jeff boards a bus. There, he sees a kid wearing a sports jersey bearing the name Kevin. He follows him (Ross) to a [[basketball court]], where he joins a pick-up game, and they bond. Jeff agrees to smoke weed with Kevin, but is tricked, beaten, and mugged.\n\nComing upon a [[Hooters]] restaurant, Jeff comes across his older brother Pat (Helms), a successful [[yuppie]] struggling with his marriage. Pat's wife Linda (Greer) is spotted across the street with another man. Jeff and Pat spend several hours following them, first to a restaurant and later to a hotel, with Pat's new [[Porsche]] being ticketed, crashed, and eventually towed away at various points on the journey. The brothers also visit their father's gravesite and fight over their conflicting life philosophies.\n\nSeeing a truck reading \"Kevin Kandy\", Jeff runs off to hitch a ride, ending up at the same hotel where Pat has found Linda in a room with [[adultery|another man]]. Jeff offers to break down the door. The man is her co-worker, Steve (Zissis). Linda quickly ushers Steve out and then confronts Pat about his role in their problems. Frustrated, she leaves, saying she is going to live with her mother. Jeff and Pat reconcile; Jeff explains how he is struggling to find his destiny, while Pat admits he wants him and Linda to fall in love again. Jeff encourages him to tell her, and they hail a taxi to pursue her.\n\nInterspersed within the main story is the story of Sharon, who is at work, frustrated with her unfulfilled life, and dissatisfied with her sons. The doldrum is interrupted when a paper airplane with a drawing of a flower lands in her cubicle, followed by an anonymous co-worker claiming in an instant message to be a secret admirer. Sharon spends the day trying to deduce their identity. Confiding her frustrations to colleague and friend Carol ([[Rae Dawn Chong|Chong]]), she reveals that she has not dated since her husband's death.\n\nCarol encourages her to warm up to the attention she is receiving. Sharon is surprised and confused when the admirer turns out to be Carol herself, and though neither believe themselves to be attracted to their own gender, Carol appeals to Sharon's desire to become close with someone who truly understands her. At that moment, a fire alarm goes off and ceiling sprinklers activate; this is an enlightening moment for Sharon who sets off with Carol on an impulsive trip to [[New Orleans]].\n\nJeff, Pat, Linda, Sharon, and Carol converge on a bridge, getting stuck in standstill traffic. Pat exits the taxi and runs through the cars to tell Linda how he feels, passing Carol's car; Sharon sees and runs after him, followed by Carol. As Jeff muses to the cab driver about how seeking his destiny is not very exciting, he sees a helicopter flying overhead. He jumps out of the taxi and also runs through the cars, passing Pat, who was sharing his feelings with Linda when Sharon and Carol arrive.\n\nJeff continues running, seeing the cause of the traffic is an accident in which a car plummeted over the side of the bridge. He dives into the water, rescuing two children and their father; when Jeff then fails to resurface Pat dives in and rescues him. The group reconciles after the ordeal, we see Sharon celebrating her birthday and Pat and Linda appear to be faring better in their marriage. Jeff sees a news report about his heroics, and learns that the father of the kids he rescued was also named Kevin; now with a sense of purpose, he grabs some wood glue and fixes the shutter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Jeff Thompkins\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Pat Thompkins\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sharon Thompkins\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Linda Thompkins\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Carol\n* Steve Zissis as Steve\n* [[Evan Ross]] as Kevin\n\n==Release==\nThe film grossed $840,000 in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\">{{cite web | url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jeffwholivesathome.htm | title=Jeff, Who Lives at Home (2012) | publisher=Box Office Mojo.
