Chris is  a rebellious, troubled teen, resulting in frequent contact with police.\n\nJohn's brother Deel ([[Josh Lucas]]) visits the family. The two boys are surprised; they did not even know of his existence. Deel wants a hoard of gold coins from John that their father left them. Deel eventually finds them. John refuses to give them to Deel. In the ensuing struggle, Deel murders him. He tries to kill Chris and Tim as well, but they escape and run away from home with the coins.\n\nOn the run, the boys meet an assortment of fairytale-like characters. Deel pursues them, eventually succeeding. Wading into a river, Chris throws away the gold coins into the water. Enraged by the loss, Deel struggles with Chris, attempting to drown him. However, Deel is fatally stabbed in the chest.\n \nChris appears to wake up in hospital. There, he is reunited with Tim and their grandparents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Chris Munn \n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as John Munn \n* Devon Alan as Tim Munn \n* [[Shiri Appleby]] as Violet\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Deel Munn \n* Terry Loughlin as Officer Clayton \n* Robert Longstreet as Bern \n* Eddie Rouse as Wadsworth Pela \n* Patrice Johnson as Amica Pela \n* Charles \"Jester\" Poston as Hard Hat Dandy\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Lila\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from film critics.
