Tilly remembers nothing of Stewart's death, and her mentally ill mother Molly ([[Judy Davis]]), living in squalor, does not even remember her.\n\nAt the local [[Australian football|football]] final game, Tilly\u2019s red [[Haute Couture|couture]] gown distracts the Dungatar players. Teddy McSwiney ([[Liam Hemsworth]]) points this out, and she changes into an equally alluring black outfit before the last quarter. When the teams swap ends of the field, the men from Winyerp are the distracted ones, and Dungatar wins. Tilly agrees to make a dress for Gertrude Pratt ([[Sarah Snook]]) for the upcoming footballers dance, in exchange for the truth. Gertrude reveals that she told Stewart where Tilly was hiding that day.\n\nAt the dance, a transformed Gertrude captures the attention of William Beaumont ([[James Mackay (actor)|James Mackay]]), and they later become engaged. Impressed, the town's women commission extravagant dresses from Tilly, and Teddy pursues a romantic relationship with her.\n\nSergeant Farrat confesses to Tilly that Stewart's father, Evan ([[Shane Bourne]]), a town councillor, blackmailed him for secretly being a [[cross-dresser]]. Tilly and Farrat bond over their shared passion for designer clothing. Evan recruits incompetent Una Pleasance ([[Sacha Horler]]) to start a rival dressmaking service, but when Gertrude hires Tilly to create her wedding dress, the townspeople return to Tilly.\n\nBribed with a [[feather boa]], Farrat lets Tilly read the witness statement given by her former schoolteacher, Beulah Harridiene ([[Kerry Fox]]). She confronts Beulah, who admits that she was not even there. Tilly tells Farrat this at Gertrude's wedding reception, but he remains reluctantly convinced that Tilly killed Stewart. Everyone else had an alibi. He also reveals that Evan is Tilly's father. Tilly runs away, and Teddy follows after soothing his developmentally disabled brother, Barney ([[Gyton Grantley]]), who screams hysterically that Tilly \"moved\" when Stewart died.\n\nAt the schoolhouse, Teddy helps her to remember how Stewart died. He threatened to murder her mother if she did not stand against a wall. He charged head-down at her, but she moved aside and Stewart broke his neck. Barney witnessed this from the town silo, but was afraid people would think he was lying. Tilly and Teddy make love in his caravan and plan to marry. They sit atop the silo, and Teddy shows that he does not believe in her curse by jumping inside. He [[Grain entrapment|sinks into the grain]] and asphyxiates.\n\nMolly tells the townswomen that Teddy died trying to prove that his love was stronger than their hate. Molly tends to the grieving Tilly, and tells her that Evan had Tilly sent away to hurt Molly. She encourages Tilly to use her art against the townspeople. Molly suffers a stroke and dies. While Tilly and Farrat hold a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], Beulah snoops around the house. Tilly drunkenly objects to the music, and injures Beulah when she throws the record player off the verandah. Sergeant Farrat sends Beulah to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Melbourne]].\n\nPercival Almanac ([[Barry Otto]]), the sadistic town chemist, drowns in a pond behind his house. His wife, Irma ([[Julia Blake]]), is under the influence of extra-strong [[hash brownies]] Molly baked to ease her arthritis pain. Sergeant Farrat takes the blame for the hashish and transvestism and is arrested.\n\nTilly reveals the truth about Evan to his wife, Marigold. When he threatens to commit her, she cuts his [[Achilles tendon]]s and leaves him to bleed to death. Meanwhile, at a competitive [[Eisteddfod]] in Winyerp, the townspeople discover that Tilly created Winyerp's charming Mikado costumes. Their own disordered production of Macbeth is doomed by the loss of Evan and Marigold.\n\nDeclaring that she is no longer cursed, Tilly sets fire to her house and sends a paraffin-soaked bolt of red fabric rolling down the hill into town. The townspeople return to find Dungatar a ruin. Tilly is on the train, headed to Paris, via Melbourne.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|The Dressmaker (Ham novel)#Characters|l1=List of The Dressmaker characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Myrtle \"Tilly\" Dunnage\n** [[Darcey Wilson]] as Young Myrtle\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Molly Dunnage\n** Lucy Moir as Young Molly\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as Teddy McSwiney\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Sergeant Horatio Farrat\n* [[Sarah Snook]] as Gertrude \"Trudy\" Pratt\n** Olivia Sprague as Young Gertrude\n* [[Sacha Horler]] as Una Pleasance\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Elsbeth Beaumont\n* [[James Mackay (actor)|James Mackay]] as William Beaumont\n* [[Rebecca Gibney]] as Muriel Pratt\n* [[Shane Bourne]] as Evan Pettyman\n* [[Alison Whyte]] as Marigold Pettyman\n* [[Barry Otto]] as Percival Almanac\n* [[Julia Blake]] as Irma Almanac\n* [[Kerry Fox]] as Beulah Harridiene\n* [[Gyton Grantley]] as Barney McSwiney\n** Alex de Vos as Young Barney\n* [[Genevieve Lemon]] as Mae McSwiney\n* [[Shane Jacobson]] as Alvin Pratt\n* [[Tracy Harvey]] as Lois Pickett\n* [[Terry Norris (actor)|Terry Norris]] as Septimus Crescent\n* Amanda Woodhams as Nancy Pickett\n** Grace Rosebirch as Young Nancy\n* Stan Leman as Edward McSwiney\n* Rory Potter as Stewart Pettyman\n* Hayley Magnus as Prudence Harridiene\n* [[Mark Leonard Winter]] as Reginald Blood\n* Simon Maiden as Photographer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Rosalie Ham]] sold the rights of the novel for film in mid 2000s.
