It stars [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Joseph Fiennes]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Judi Dench]].\n\nThe film depicts a fictional love affair involving playwright [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Joseph Fiennes]]) and Viola de Lesseps ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) while Shakespeare was writing ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Several characters are based on historical figures, and many of the characters, lines, and plot devices allude to [[Shakespeare's plays]]. \n\n''Shakespeare in Love'' received acclaim from critics and was a box office success, grossing $289.3 million worldwide and was the [[1998 in film|ninth highest-grossing film of 1998]]. The film received numerous accolades, including seven [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[71st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Gwyneth Paltrow), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Judi Dench]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] and playwright for [[Philip Henslowe]], owner of [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose Theatre]]. Suffering from [[writer's block]] with a new comedy, ''Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'', Shakespeare attempts to seduce Rosaline, mistress of [[Richard Burbage]], owner of the rival [[Curtain Theatre]], and to convince Burbage to buy the play from Henslowe. Shakespeare receives advice from rival playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]], but is despondent to learn Rosaline is sleeping with [[Master of the Revels]] [[Edmund Tylney|Edmund Tilney]]. The desperate Henslowe, in debt to ruthless moneylender Fennyman, begins auditions anyway.\n\nViola de Lesseps, daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare's plays at court, disguises herself as a man named Thomas Kent to audition. Kent gains Shakespeare's interest with a speech from ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'', but runs away when Shakespeare questions her. He pursues Kent to Viola's house and leaves a note with her nurse, asking Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose.\n\nShakespeare sneaks into a ball at the house, where Viola's parents arrange her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an aristocrat in need of money. Dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless. Confronted by Wessex, Shakespeare introduces himself as Christopher Marlowe. Wessex ejects \"Marlowe\" and threatens to kill him. Shakespeare finds Viola on her balcony, where they confess their mutual attraction before he is discovered by her nurse and flees.\n\nInspired by Viola, Shakespeare quickly transforms the play into what will become ''Romeo and Juliet''. Rehearsals begin, with Thomas Kent as Romeo, the leading tragedian [[Edward Alleyn|Ned Alleyn]] as Mercutio, and the stagestruck Fennyman in a small role. Shakespeare discovers Viola's true identity, and they begin a secret affair.\n\nViola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Wessex. Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her nurse's female cousin, and anonymously persuades Wessex in public to wager \u00a350 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]] declares that she will judge the matter.\n\nBurbage learns Shakespeare has seduced Rosaline and cheated him out of payment for the play, and starts a brawl at the Rose with his company. The Rose players repel Burbage and his men and celebrate at the pub, where a drunken Henslowe lets slip to Viola that Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife. News arrives that Marlowe has been murdered. A guilt-ridden Shakespeare assumes Wessex had Marlowe killed, believing him to be Viola's lover, while Viola believes Shakespeare to be the victim. Shakespeare appears at her church, allaying Viola's fears and terrifying Wessex, who believes he is a ghost. Viola confesses her love for Shakespeare, but both recognize she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex.\n\n[[John Webster]], an unpleasant boy who hangs around the theatre, spies on Shakespeare and Viola making love and informs Tilney, who closes the Rose for breaking the ban on women actors. Viola's identity is exposed, leaving Shakespeare without a stage or a lead actor, until Burbage offers his theatre and the heartbroken Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo. Following her wedding, Viola learns the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain. She overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, [[Voice change|his voice having broken]], and Henslowe asks her to replace him. She plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo to an enthralled audience.\n\nJust after the play has concluded, Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola's presence, but the Queen reveals herself in attendance and restrains him, pretending that Kent is a man with a \"remarkable resemblance\" to a woman. Powerless to end a lawful marriage, she orders Viola to sail with Wessex to [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. The Queen also tells Wessex, who followed Viola to the theatre, that ''Romeo and Juliet'' has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his \u00a350 with instructions to write something \"a little more cheerful next time, for [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]\".\n\nViola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalize her, as he imagines the beginning of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Viola (Twelfth Night)|in character]] as a [[castaway]] disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as [[William Shakespeare]]\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Viola de Lesseps\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Philip Henslowe]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Lord Wessex\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Edward Alleyn|Ned Alleyn]]\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]\n* [[Simon Callow]] as [[Edmund Tylney|Edmund Tilney]]\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Ralph Bashford\n* [[Martin Clunes]] as [[Richard Burbage]]\n* [[Antony Sher]] as Dr. Moth\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Nurse\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Hugh Fennyman\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Wabash\n* [[Daniel Brocklebank]] as Sam Gosse\n* [[Nicholas Le Prevost]] as Sir Robert de Lesseps\n* [[Jill Baker]] as Lady de Lesseps\n* [[Patrick Barlow]] as [[William Kempe|Will Kempe]]\n* Joe Roberts as [[John Webster]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[Christopher Marlowe|Christopher \"Kit\" Marlowe]]\n* [[John Inman]] as Lady Capulet in play\n* Sandra Reinton as [[Rosaline]]\n* Paul Bigley as Peter\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe original idea for ''Shakespeare in Love'' was suggested to screenwriter [[Marc Norman]] in the late 1980s by his son Zachary.<ref>Avon Calling, Chicago Tribune http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-12-23/features/9812230314_1_romeo-and-ethel-shakespeare-marc-norman</ref> Norman wrote a draft screenplay which he presented to director [[Edward Zwick]], which attracted [[Julia Roberts]], who agreed to play Viola. However, Zwick disliked Norman's screenplay and hired the playwright [[Tom Stoppard]] to improve it (Stoppard's first major success had been with the Shakespeare-themed play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'').<ref name=\"Biskind\">Peter Biskind, \"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film\" (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), p. 327.</ref>\n\nThe film went into production in 1991 at [[Universal Studios|Universal]], with Zwick as director, but although sets and costumes were in construction, Shakespeare had not yet been cast, because Roberts insisted that only [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] could play the role. Day-Lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to persuade him, she withdrew from the film, six weeks before shooting was due to begin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mell|first1=Eila|title=Casting might-have-beens : a film by film directory of actors considered for roles given to others|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=978-0-7864-2017-9|page=216}}</ref> The production went into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], and Zwick was unable to persuade other studios to take up the screenplay.<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\nEventually, Zwick got [[Miramax Films|Miramax]] interested in the screenplay, but Miramax chose [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] as director. Miramax boss [[Harvey Weinstein]] acted as producer, and persuaded [[Ben Affleck]] to take a small role as [[Ned Alleyn]].<ref>Peter Biskind, \"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film\" (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), pp. 328\u201330.</ref> [[Kate Winslet]] was offered the role of Viola after the success of [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']], but she rejected it to pursue independent films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2006/09/29/kate-winslet-one-woman-hollywood-cant-ignore/|title=Kate Winslet: One woman Hollywood can't ignore|date=29 September 2006|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Winona Ryder, Diane Lane and Robin Wright were also considered for the lead role.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 2, 1998, and ended on June 10, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/332144/Shakespeare-in-Love/misc-notes.html|title=Shakespeare in Love (1998) \u2013 Misc Notes |website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film was considerably reworked after the first test screenings. The scene with Shakespeare and Viola in the punt was re-shot, to make it more emotional, and some lines were re-recorded to clarify the reasons why Viola had to marry Wessex. The ending was re-shot several times, until Stoppard eventually came up with the idea of Viola suggesting to Shakespeare that their parting could inspire his next play.<ref>Peter Biskind, \"Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film\" (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004), pp. 330\u201331.</ref>\n\nAmong the locations used in the production were [[Hatfield House]], Hertfordshire (for the fireworks scene), [[Broughton Castle]], Oxfordshire (which played the role of the de Lesseps home), the beach at [[Holkham]] in Norfolk, the chapel at [[Eton College]], Berkshire, and the Great Hall of [[Middle Temple]], London.<ref>movie-locations.com</ref>\n\n== References to Elizabethan literature ==\nMuch of the action of the film echoes that of ''Romeo and Juliet''. Will and Viola play out the famous balcony and bedroom scenes; like Juliet, Viola has a witty nurse, and is separated from Will by a gulf of duty (although not the family enmity of the play: the \"two households\" of ''Romeo and Juliet'' are supposedly inspired by the two rival playhouses). In addition, the two lovers are equally \"star-crossed\"{{snd}}they are not ultimately destined to be together (since Viola is of rich and socially ambitious merchant stock and is promised to marry [[Earl of Wessex#Fiction|Lord Wessex]], while Shakespeare himself is poor and already married). Rosaline, with whom Will is in love at the beginning of the film, is a namesake of Romeo's love-interest at the beginning of the play. There are references to earlier cinematic versions of Shakespeare, such as the balcony scene pastiching the [[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Zeffirelli ''Romeo and Juliet'']].<ref>French, Emma, ''Selling Shakespeare to Hollywood: Marketing of Filmed Shakespeare Adaptations from 1989 Into the New Millennium'', University of Hertfordshire Press, 2006, p. 153.</ref>\n\nMany other plot devices used in the film are common in Shakespearean comedies and other plays of the Elizabethan era: the Queen disguised as a commoner, the [[cross-dressing]] disguises, mistaken identities, the sword fight, the suspicion of adultery, the appearance of a ghost (cf. ''[[Macbeth]]''), and the \"[[play within a play]]\". According to Douglas Brode, the film deftly portrays many of these devices as though the events depicted were the inspiration for Shakespeare's own use of them in his plays.<ref>Douglas Brode, ''Shakespeare in the movies: from the silent era to today'', Berkley Boulevard Books, 2001, p. 240.</ref>\n\nChristopher Marlowe is presented in the film as the master playwright whom the characters consider the greatest English dramatist of that time \u2013 this is historically accurate, yet also humorous, since the film's audience knows what will eventually happen to Shakespeare's reputation. Marlowe gives Shakespeare a plot for his next play, \"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\" (\"Romeo is Italian...always in and out of love...until he meets...Ethel. The daughter of his enemy! His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is [[Mercutio]].\")<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Marlowe's ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' is quoted repeatedly: \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/ And burned the topless towers of Ilium?\" A reference is also made to Marlowe's final, unfinished play ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' in a scene wherein Marlowe ([[Rupert Everett]]) seeks payment for the final act of the play from Richard Burbage ([[Martin Clunes]]). Burbage promises the payment the next day, so Marlowe refuses to part with the pages and departs for Deptford, where he is killed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Roger Ebert's four-star reviews, 1967\u20132007|date=2007|publisher=Andrews McMeel|author-link=Roger Ebert|location=Kansas City, MO|isbn=978-0740771798|page=698}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bevington|first1=David|editor1-last=Logan|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Deats|editor2-first=Sara Munson|title=Placing the Plays of Christopher Marlowe: Fresh Cultural Contexts|date=2008|location=Aldershot, England|isbn=978-0-7546-6204-4|page=209|chapter=Christopher Marlowe: the late years}}</ref> The only surviving text of ''The Massacre at Paris'' is an undated octavo that is probably too short to represent the complete original play.

In a foreword to a subsequent edition of ''No Bed for Bacon'' (which traded on the association by declaring itself \"A Story of Shakespeare and Lady Viola in Love\") [[Ned Sherrin]], ''Private Eye'' insider and former writing partner of Brahms', confirmed that he had lent a copy of the novel to Stoppard after he joined the writing team,<ref>{{cite news|title=Closed government|date=6 February 1999|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]}}<!--Note that the relevant issue isn't online per 16 September 2016, but should appear at \"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/6th-february-1999\" eventually.
