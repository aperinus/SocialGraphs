Flying worn-out [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] aircraft and chafing at their ground attack missions, the Tuskegee Airmen recognize that they may never fight the [[Luftwaffe]]. The tight-knit group of Captain Martin \"Easy\" Julian, 1st Lt. Joe \"Lightning\" Little, 2nd Lt. Ray \"Ray Gun\" Gannon, 2nd Lt. Andrew \"Smokey\" Salem, and 2nd Lt. Samuel \"Joker\" George under the guidance of Major Emanuel Stance and Col. A.J. Bullard, face a white military bureaucracy still resistant to accepting black flyers as equals.{{#tag:ref|An \"[[aviator call sign]]\" or \"[[call sign|callsign]]\" is a [[nickname]] given to a military pilot or other flight officer.

After returning to base, Lightning becomes infatuated with Sofia, an Italian woman, and starts a relationship. When Lightning punches a white man who uses a racial slur at a \"whites only\" officer's club, he is sent to the brig and reprimanded by Colonel Bullard.\n\nMeanwhile, Bullard secures a chance to \"light up the board\" when the Tuskegee Airmen are chosen to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landings at [[Anzio]], Italy known as [[Operation Shingle]]. There, they battle [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters led by a German ace pilot they nickname \"Pretty Boy\" and manage to raze the base that Pretty Boy retreats back to. Pretty Boy is stunned to see the pilots who damaged his plane and razed his base were African-Americans. During their first victory, Ray Gun is injured by anti-aircraft fire and suffers impaired vision in one eye. Easy reluctantly allows Ray Gun to continue flying.\n\nImpressed with the Tuskegee Airmen's performance, the USAAF Bomber Command ask Bullard to use his fighters as escorts for [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers because of unacceptably high casualties among bomber crews. Bullard accepts on the condition his unit be supplied with the new [[North American P-51 Mustang]].{{#tag:ref|The Tuskegee Airmen initially were equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks fighter-bomber aircraft, briefly with [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s (March 1944), later with [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s (June\u2013July 1944), and finally the fighter group acquired the fighter aircraft with which they became most commonly associated, the North American P-51 Mustang (July 1944).<ref name=\"Rice\"/>|group=N}} The tails of the aircraft are painted bright red and become the unofficial name of the outfit. Noting the reckless aggression of previous escort fights, Bullard orders his pilots to stay with the bombers at all costs. Their first escort mission is a success, and the 332nd downs multiple Luftwaffe aircraft without the loss of a single bomber. Lightning even takes his chances to attack a [[Kriegsmarine]] destroyer before returning to base. However, Ray Gun is shot down and captured by a [[Wehrmacht]] patrol, while Deke crash-lands and nearly dies, but is rescued from his burning Mustang before the fuel tank explodes.\n\nAs a result of his injuries, Deke is [[Military discharge|discharged]]. Ray Gun is taken to [[Stalag]] 18, a German POW camp. A group of POWs recruit him, as they believe that he cannot be a German spy. Easy blames himself for Ray Gun's apparent departure, and spirals deeper into alcoholism. Worried, Lightning makes a deal with Easy: he will fly less recklessly as long as Easy remains sober. Meanwhile, attitudes against the Tuskegee Airmen begin to change as they earn the bomber crews' respect. Lightning proposes to Sofia, who accepts as long as he stays in Italy. Ray Gun and his group of POWs escape, but German guards spot several POWs; Ray Gun draws the Germans' attention while the others escape. One of the POWs reaches the 332nd's base and, assuming Ray Gun to be dead, informs them about his sacrifice.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen are tasked with escorting the first American bombers to attack Berlin, though for propaganda reasons they are only asked to escort the bombers on the first leg of their journey. When the fighter squadron meant to relieve them never arrives, Easy stays with bombers. They are attacked by Pretty Boy, now leading a flight of the revolutionary new [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighters. Despite being outclassed, the Tuskegee Airmen shoot down several enemies, and escort a wounded B-17 back to Allied airspace. Pretty Boy nearly shoots down Easy, but at the last moment, Lightning attacks and kills Pretty Boy in a head-on attack. Although victorious, Lightning is mortally wounded and dies, and his Mustang crashes. Easy then has to inform Sofia about Lightning's death, and consequently overcomes his alcoholism. At Lightning's funeral, Ray Gun returns, having survived his escape from German captivity, invoking Lightning's memory.\n\nUltimately, the Tuskegee Airmen are awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] in honor of their achievements.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:African-americans-wwii-058.jpg|thumb|right|Tuskegee Airmen: Capt.

Beginning with statements to support the film made by surviving Tuskegee Airmen who had seen the film in previews, and spurred by the comments made by Lucas in a candid interview on ''The Daily Show'' where the producer openly discussed the difficulties of trying to get ''Red Tails'' made over the past 23 years, a [[Facebook]] campaign was started. In the [[Oakland, California]] premiere, two sold-out screenings were a testament to the success of the campaign. Effie Tesfahun, one of the organizers, explained, \"When [Lucas] said Hollywood does not want to touch black films, it really hit me ... I thought we should get together and all go and support [this film]. Regardless of what Hollywood thinks, we all want to see positive messages of black people in the movies ...
