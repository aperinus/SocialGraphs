The film was directed by [[John A. Davis]] and written by Davis and producer [[Steve Oedekerk]]. Its voice cast includes [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Martin Short]], [[Rob Paulsen]], and [[Jeffrey Garcia]]. The film follows the [[Jimmy Neutron|title character]], a schoolboy with super-genius intelligence, who must save all of the parents of his hometown from a race of egg-like aliens known as the Yolkians.\n\nThe idea for ''Jimmy Neutron'' was first created by Davis in the 1980s, in which he wrote a script for a short film titled ''Runaway Rocketboy'' and starring a prototype character for Jimmy named Johnny Quasar. After coming across the abandoned script several years later, Davis decided that it would be a good idea to revisit it and retool it as a computer-animated short and potential TV series. A 40-second demo was animated using [[LightWave 3D]] and gained popularity at the 1995 [[SIGGRAPH]] convention where it was shown off, grabbing the attention of Oedekerk and leading DNA Productions to develop an extended TV pilot. After a successful pitch to [[Nickelodeon]], a 13-minute-long TV episode was developed, and Nickelodeon, impressed with both the character and the 3D technology, raised the possibility of making both a TV series and a full-length feature film. Davis, in turn, suggested that the film be made first, so that the development team could create the assets at theatrical quality and reuse them in the TV series. Production officially began in early 2000 and was completed in roughly 24 months, with the studio considerably raising its staff count and expanding its studio space. Animation was done entirely using commercial software, including LightWave and [[Messiah (software)|project:messiah]].\n\n''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius'' was released on December 21, 2001.<ref name=RTrelease/> Backed by a strong pre-release campaign, the film was a box office success, grossing $103 million worldwide against a $30 million budget. It earned generally positive reviews for its characters, humor, vocal performances, and sense of charm, fun, and wit. It was nominated for the inaugural [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] in 2001, ultimately losing to ''[[Shrek]]''. It was the only animated Nickelodeon film to be nominated in that category for nearly a decade until ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]'' (2011) was nominated and won.\n\nDue to its success, the film was continued into an animated television series called ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius]]'', which premiered on July 20, 2002, and ended on November 25, 2006. Four years later, a spin-off series called ''[[Planet Sheen]]'' was produced, focusing on Jimmy's friend Sheen Estevez. This series premiered on October 2, 2010 (alongside ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]''), and ended on February 15, 2013.\n\nA [[simulator ride]] based on the film called ''[[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]]'' was set to take place after the events of the film and featured guest appearances by other [[Nicktoons]] characters. It opened at [[Universal Studios Florida]] on April 11, 2003, and closed on August 18, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nEleven-year-old boy genius Jimmy Neutron lives in Retroville with his parents, Judy and Hugh, and his robot dog, Goddard. Jimmy's friends are overweight Carl Wheezer and hyperactive Sheen Estevez, and his long-standing rival, intelligent classmate Cindy Vortex, teases him for his small stature. After Jimmy launches a communications satellite into space, hoping to contact alien life, he crashes his makeshift rocket into his house's roof, upsetting his mother. When Jimmy, Carl and Sheen learn of the opening of Retroland, an amusement park, popular kid Nick Dean convinces the boys to sneak out and attend. Judy refuses to let him attend the park that night. After his jetpack accidentally starts a fire in the house, she grounds him. Taking Nick's advice, Jimmy uses his shrink ray invention to sneak out and meets Carl and Sheen at Retroland for a night of fun.\n\nMeanwhile, Jimmy's satellite is intercepted by the Yolkians, a race of egg-like aliens from the planet Yolkus. Their leader, King Goobot, views Jimmy's message and notices a picture featuring his parents, declaring his search complete. The Yolkians arrive on Earth and abduct all the adults in Retroville, except Jimmy's teacher Miss Fowl (due to being shrunken down to a small size by Jimmy's shrink ray). As their ships return to space, Jimmy, Carl and Sheen mistake their departure for a shooting star, prompting Jimmy to wish their parents were gone. The next morning, all the children notice the parents are missing and party recklessly. At first, having no parents was fun for the children. But then, the following day, they are miserable and realize they need their parents. Jimmy learns that his satellite has been found and deduces the parents have been abducted. He enlists the children to create rocket ships out of Retroland's rides and they blast off into space after their families.\n\nAfter braving a meteor shower and camping on an asteroid, Jimmy and company eventually reach Yolkus and find the parents with mind control devices attached to their heads. When Jimmy tries to get the mind-control helmet off of Hugh, Goobot captures them and reveals that Jimmy had led the Yolkians directly to Earth to take their parents, whom they intend to sacrifice to their god Poultra. Jimmy is separated from Goddard by Goobot's bumbling assistant, Ooblar, and is locked in a dungeon with the other children, who blame Jimmy for their predicament. Taking pity on Jimmy, Cindy confesses she and the other children need him and encourages Jimmy to fix things by helping them escape. Using a cellphone owned by Cindy's friend, Libby Folfax, Jimmy contacts Goddard, who escapes from Ooblar and frees the children.\n\nJimmy and company reach the Yolkians' Colosseum where a giant egg is hatched, releasing Poultra, a gigantic three-eyed alien chicken. As Goobot arranges the parents to be eaten using a mind control remote, Jimmy rallies the children to storm the colosseum and battle the guards while Sheen retrieves an escape vessel, which knocks Poultra on the head upon his return. Jimmy steals the remote from Goobot and the children escape Yolkus with the parents. Goobot arranges a fleet to pursue them, which is all destroyed when the children fly their ship around the surface of the Sun, save for Goobot's vessel. When Goobot and Ooblar mock Jimmy's short size, Jimmy charges at Goobot's ship with Goddard in a flying bike form and uses his shrink ray to enlarge himself into the size of a planet. He then blows Goobot's vessel away into an asteroid, destroying it. Goobot survives and vows revenge. On the return trip to Earth, Jimmy reconciles with his parents, admitting that despite his intelligence, he still depends on them. The next day, Jimmy and Carl have eggs in an egg cup for breakfast, when Jimmy's parents drink one of his scientific experiments, which causes significant belching, thinking it is a real soda can. They all laugh while Goddard is seen outside flying to chase a bird.\n\nIn the [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], the still-shrunken Miss Fowl is seen riding on an apple worm, named Mr. Wiggles, on her way to the cafeteria in the elementary school hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Jimmy Neutron characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Debi Derryberry]] as [[Jimmy Neutron]]\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#King Goobot V|King Goobot V]]\n* [[Martin Short]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Ooblar|Ooblar]]\n* [[Carolyn Lawrence]] as [[Cindy Vortex]]\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as [[Carl Wheezer]], [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Mr. and Mrs. Wheezer|Mr. and Mrs. Wheezer]] (credited as Carl's Mom and Dad), Kid in Classroom\n* [[Jeffrey Garcia]] as [[Sheen Estevez]]\n* Crystal Scales as [[Libby Folfax]] and Courtney Tyler\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Goddard (Jimmy Neutron character)|Goddard]] (uncredited), [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Poultra|Poultra]], Worm, Demon, Girl-Eating Plant, Oyster\n* [[Candi Milo]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Nick Dean|Nick Dean]], [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Britney Tenelli|Britney]], PJ\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as [[Judy Neutron]] (credited as Mom), [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#VOX|VOX]], [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Cindy Vortex|Mrs. Vortex]] (credited as Cindy's Mom)\n* [[Mark DeCarlo]] as [[Hugh Neutron]] (credited as Dad), Pilot, Arena Guard, [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Cindy Vortex|Mr. Vortex]] (credited as Cindy's Dad)\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Mr. Estevez|Mr. Estevez]] (credited as Sheen's Dad)\n* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Zachery, Reporter, Angie\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Miss Winfred Fowl|Ms. Winfred Fowl]] (Credited as Ms. Fowl)\n* [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] as Bobby's Twin Brother, Butch, Old Man Johnson, Robobarber, Yolkian Officer, Jailbreak Cop, Anchor Boy, Flurp Announcer\n* [[Bob Goen]] and [[Mary Hart]] as Yolkian newscasters\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as NORAD Officer\n* [[Greg Eagles]] as [[List of Jimmy Neutron characters#Mr. Folfax|Mr. Folfax]] (uncredited)\n* [[David Lander|David L.

Davis, who scripted and storyboarded a short narrative titled ''Runaway Rocketboy'', centering around a character named Johnny Quasar (inspired by a facetious nickname that his summer co-workers had coined for him in his youth)<ref name=\"NAP\">{{cite podcast|url=https://soundcloud.com/nickanimation/episode-17-john-davis-nickelodeon-animation-podcast |title= Nick Animation Podcast: John Davis|work=soundcloud.com|publisher=[[Nick Animation]]|host=[[Hector Navarro]]|date=September 1, 2016|access-date=November 10, 2018}}</ref> who builds a rocket ship and runs away from his parents.<ref name=\"awn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/rise-jimmy-neutron|title=The Rise of Jimmy Neutron|work=Awn.com|access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref> Davis stated in an episode of the [[Nickelodeon Animation Podcast]] that he initially wrote the concept with the intention of creating it as a live-action film with special effects and matte shots, even going so far as to apply for a grant to fund the project, but found that getting such an investment was difficult since the film was not educational or informative.<ref name=\"NAP\"/> The idea laid dormant for several years until Davis came across the abandoned script while in the process of moving.<ref name=\"NAP\"/> Around the same time, Davis' [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]-based studio, DNA Productions, had just begun experimenting with the use of computer animation after obtaining copies of [[LightWave 3D]]. In turn, Davis realized that the film would be fitting as a CGI film, since all of the science fiction set pieces could be entirely modeled in 3-D.<ref name=\"NAP\"/>\n\nDavis, alongside studio co-founder Keith Alcorn, created a 40-second proof-of-concept demo film which depicted Johnny and his robot dog, Goddard, flying through an asteroid belt and greeting the viewers. Simultaneously, Davis and Alcorn worked to create a story bible outlining a potential television series. The demo short was shown off in 1995 at the [[SIGGRAPH]] CGI convention, where it was entered into a competition for LightWave films. The demo quickly garnered notability in the computer animation industry, receiving frequent press coverage in magazines and winning two \"Wavey\" awards- one for Best Character Animation and another for Best in Show. Among people who caught wind of the film was [[Steve Oedekerk]], the founder of [[O Entertainment]], who saw a still shot of Johnny and Goddard in a CGI magazine. Oedekerk, a strong backer of computer animation, was impressed by the characters' designs \u2013 he stated in an interview that the image particularly stood out to him because it \"seemed fun\" compared to the mostly-photorealistic work being done with computer animation at the time.<ref name=\"CGW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2002/Volume-25-Issue-1-January-2002-/Neu-Kid-on-the-Block.aspx |title=Neu Kid on the Block|work=Cgw.com|date=January 1, 2002|access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref> He cold-called Davis requesting to see a tape of the full short. After watching the demo, as well as seeing the show bible which Davis and Alcorn had developed, Oedekerk expressed interest in helping to pitch their concept to different networks.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"la\">{{cite news |last=Mallory |first=Michael |title=A Boy and His Franchise |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-nov-11-ca-2777-story.html |access-date=March 18, 2022 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 11, 2001}}</ref>\n\nAfter teaming up with O Entertainment, the company began working on developing a full-length episode for a TV series, titled ''The Adventures of Johnny Quasar'', writing an expanded version of the original ''Runaway Rocket'' story and tweaking aspects of Johnny's design to make him look more like a child. In Fall 1995, the idea was pitched to [[Nickelodeon]], who expressed immediate interest in the idea. [[Albie Hecht]], the then-president of Nick, was particularly impressed- coining him to be \"half [[Bart Simpson]] and half [[Albert Einstein]],\" he strongly praised Johnny's blended personality as an adventurous and intelligent character and one grounded in the reality of childhood, which, according to him, made him \"the perfect Nick kid.\"<ref name=\"CGW\"/> Following positive reception, Nickelodeon commissioned for a 13-minute pilot episode to be created.<ref name=\"awn\"/> After several years of going through the review process, the episode began production in late 1997, and was completed in 1998. The name \"Johnny Quasar\" was changed at the request of Nickelodeon, who did not want the character to be confused with similarly named ones such as [[Jonny Quest]] and [[Captain Quazar]], so Davis brainstormed other character names while walking his dog around the neighborhood block, eventually coming up with the final name, \"Jimmy Neutron\".<ref name=\"NAP\"/>\n\nAfter the pilot was completed, Nickelodeon executives, who were impressed by the pilot and still enthusiastic about the show's potential, raised the prospect of creating a theatrical film to accompany the TV series, much to the surprise of Davis and his team at the studio. During the initial pitch to Nickelodeon, Oedekerk had highlighted the idea that using computer animation would allow the same models and assets to be reused between both a film and a TV show, an idea which Nick held strong faith in.<ref name=\"awn\"/> Davis further suggested that the feature film be created first, since the characters being modeled could be created at a higher quality than they would have with a TV budget. Although Nick was worried that it would be more difficult to attract a movie-going audience without the TV show to build an install base for the series, these concerns were answered with a series of short TV interstitials which would begin airing in order to build up hype for the upcoming film.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"la\"/>\n\nWith a budget of roughly $30 million, production of ''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius'' was greenlit in Fall 1999, and work began on a script for the film. Production officially started in February 2000 under the direction of Davis. In order to speed up the pace of work for a feature film, the company's staff count was considerably increased from 30 to around 150 employees, and the studio's workspace was also reformed in order to fit such a team of filmmakers.<ref name=\"CGW\"/> The film was completed in 24 months- roughly half that in which most other CGI films were completed.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"la\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nThe screenplay for ''Jimmy Neutron'' was written by Davis and Oedekerk, as well as ''[[Rugrats]]'' staff writers [[David N. Weiss]] and J. David Stem.<ref name=\"la\"/> In creating the many ideas in ''Jimmy Neutron'', Davis and Oedekerk thought back to their childhoods, trying to think about \"what a kid would create if he had the ability to create any kind of gadget.\"<ref name=\"awn\"/> The film was largely inspired by Davis' own love of science fiction which he had since childhood, drawing influence from various sources including ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop motion work. Oedekerk's 6-year-old daughter, Zoe, came up with the idea for \"burp soda\", which ultimately appeared in the movie as one of Jimmy's many inventions.<ref name=\"awn\"/> According to Davis, the Ultralord-obsessed Sheen Estevez was inspired by Davis' own love of collecting.<ref name=\"NAP\"/> Sheen was initially intended to be Japanese, as he was named after the nickname of a Japanese employee who had worked for Davis, but the filmmakers had trouble finding a suitable voice actor of Japanese descent. Incidentally, they changed the character's nationality to Mexican after opening the role to a broader category and eventually settling on Mexican stand-up comic [[Jeffrey Garcia|Jeff Garcia]].<ref name=\"NAP\"/><ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|author=Stacey Grant|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2962083/jimmy-neutron-john-a-davis-interview/|title=How Jimmy Neutron Went From A Childhood Nickname To A Major Franchise|publisher=MTV|date=December 21, 2016|access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\n''Jimmy Neutron'' was the first computer animated film to be created entirely using commercial animation programs rather than proprietary software, with most animation done using both Lightwave and [[Messiah (software)|project:messiah]].<ref name=\"awn\"/> Characters were first modeled in Lightwave, after which they were rigged and animated in Messiah. Texture painting was done via [[Adobe Photoshop]], while compositing work was completed in [[Autodesk Maya|Maya Fusion]].<ref name=\"CGW\"/> In addition to serving as executive producer, Alcorn was the film's lead character designer, and created actively simplistic and cartoonish designs in order to avoid overcomplicating production. To animate crowd scenes, methods of simplification were used to make animation less time-consuming: characters that were farther from the camera had less articulation, and animators would duplicate the same characters, offset them to different areas, and change their body parts to differentiate them. One particular scene shows a crowd of 6000 Yolkians, each of which uses one of 30 distinct animation loops.<ref name=\"CGW\"/>\n\nAccording to Davis, the character models were intentionally given a \"sculpted, graphic look,\" both to avoid making them look overly realistic and to circumvent the prospect of having to deal with simulating cloth or hair.<ref name=\"CGW\"/> The over-the-top character designs, in turn, influenced the film world's aesthetic (e.g. cars were modeled to be able to fit the characters' stylistically large heads).<ref name=\"CGW\"/> Off-the-shelf shaders were favored over ones which created more photorealistic lighting in order to maintain a cartoonish appearance throughout.<ref name=\"CGW\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Pamela Adlon]] and [[E. G. Daily]]  were all considered for the role of Jimmy Neutron before [[Debi Derryberry]] was cast for the film and subsequent series. The film was Derryberry's biggest acting role at the time, as previously she had mostly provided minor roles in films and TV shows.<ref name=\"Derryberry\">{{cite news|url=https://poststar.com/lifestyles/surprise-jimmy-neutron-is-a-woman/article_baf46f3e-7261-57bf-ae8a-d055936d3e7c.html|title=Surprise!
