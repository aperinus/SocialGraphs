The screenplay is by [[George Axelrod]], based on the 1959 [[Richard Condon]] novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]''.

Shaw is [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by communists after his Army platoon is captured. He returns to civilian life in the United States, where he becomes an unwitting assassin in an international [[communist]] conspiracy. The group, which includes representatives of the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], plans to assassinate the presidential nominee of an American political party leading to the overthrow of the U.S. government.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 24, 1962, at the height of [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations#Cold War (1945\u201391)|U.S.\u2013Soviet hostility]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. It was widely acclaimed by Western critics and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Angela Lansbury) and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. It was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite news|date=November 15, 1994|title=25 Films Added to National Registry (Published 1994)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|access-date=December 11, 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308143851/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing }} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=December 11, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSoviet and Chinese soldiers capture a U.S. Army platoon during the [[Korean War]], taking them to [[Chinese People's Republic|communist China]]. Three days later, Sergeant Raymond Shaw and Captain Bennett Marco return to UN lines. Upon Marco's recommendation, Shaw is awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for saving his soldiers' lives in combat, though two men were killed in action. Shaw returns to the U.S., where his heroism is exploited by his mother, Eleanor Iselin, to further the career of her husband, Senator John Iselin. When asked to describe Shaw, the other soldiers in his unit respond, \"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.\" In contrast to this description, Shaw is a cold, sad, unsympathetic loner.\n\nAfter Marco is promoted to major and assigned to [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]], he has a recurring nightmare: a hypnotized Shaw blithely murders the two soldiers from his own platoon before an assembly of communist military leaders to demonstrate their revolutionary brainwashing technique. Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon, Allen Melvin, has the same nightmare. When Melvin and he separately identify photos of the same two men\u2014leading figures in communist governments\u2014from their dreams, Army Intelligence agrees to help Marco investigate.\n\n[[File:Sinatra and Harvey in Manchurian Candidate NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Shaw with Major Marco after jumping into a lake in [[Central Park]] when his programming was accidentally triggered]]\nDuring captivity, Shaw was programmed as a sleeper agent, who obeys orders to kill without any memory of his crimes. His battle heroism is a false memory implanted during the brainwashing. Agents trigger Shaw by suggesting he play [[solitaire]]; the [[queen of diamonds]] activates him. Eleanor masterminds the ascent of John, a demagogue who makes baseless claims that communists work at the Defense Department. Shaw repudiates his mother and stepfather by taking a job at a newspaper published by their critic, Holborn Gaines. Communist agents have Shaw murder Gaines to confirm that his brainwashing still works.\n\nChunjin, a Korean agent who posed as a guide for Shaw's platoon, comes to Shaw's apartment asking him for work. The unsuspecting Shaw hires him as a valet and cook. Marco recognizes Chunjin when he visits Shaw's apartment; he violently attacks him and demands to know what happened during the platoon's captivity. After Marco is arrested for assault, Eugenie Cheyney, a woman he met on a train, posts his bail and breaks her engagement to date him.\n\nShaw rekindles a romance with Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan, the Iselins' chief political foe. Eleanor arranges their reunion to garner Senator Jordan's support for John's vice-presidential bid. Unswayed, Jordan insists he will block Iselin's attempts to seek the party's nomination. After Jocelyn inadvertently triggers Shaw's programming by wearing a queen of diamonds costume at a party for her thrown by the Iselins, they elope. Furious at Senator Jordan's rebuff, Eleanor\u2014who is Shaw's American handler\u2014sends him to kill Jordan at his home. Shaw also kills Jocelyn when she stumbles upon the murder scene. Afterward, he has no memory of the killing and is grief-stricken upon learning they are dead.\n\nAfter discovering the card's role in Shaw's conditioning, Marco uses a forced deck to deprogram him, hoping he will reveal his next assignment. Eleanor primes Shaw to assassinate their party's presidential nominee at the height of its convention so that Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the nominee by default. In the uproar, he will seek emergency powers to establish a strict authoritarian regime. Eleanor tells Shaw that she requested a programmed assassin, never knowing it would be her own son. She vows that when she takes power, she will exact revenge upon her superiors for selecting him.\n\nShaw enters [[Madison Square Garden]] disguised as a priest, taking up a sniper's position in an empty spotlight booth high above. Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt, race to the convention to stop him. At the last moment, Shaw aims away from the presidential nominee and instead kills Senator Iselin and Eleanor. When Marco arrives inside the lighting booth, Shaw tells him that not even the Army could have stopped them, so he had to. Then Shaw, wearing the Medal of Honor around his neck, commits suicide. That evening, Marco, speaking to Eugenie privately, mourns Shaw's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Maj.

Although Lansbury played Raymond Shaw's mother, she was, in fact, only three years older than Laurence Harvey, who played Shaw. An early scene in which Shaw, recently decorated with the Medal of Honor, argues with his parents was filmed in Sinatra's own private plane.<ref name=FrankenDVD/>\n\nJanet Leigh plays Marco's love interest. In a short biography of Leigh broadcast on [[Turner Classic Movies]], actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] reveals her mother had been served divorce papers on behalf of her father, actor [[Tony Curtis]], the morning that the scene where Marco and her character first meet on a train was filmed.\n\nIn the scene where Marco attempts to deprogram Shaw in a hotel room opposite the convention, Sinatra is at times slightly out of focus. It was a first take, and Sinatra failed to be as effective in subsequent retakes, a common factor in his film performances.<ref name=\"first take\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/vpage/manchurian-revolt-1117471298/|title='Manchurian' revolt: Frankenheimer offers Sinatra revelations on DVD|last=Lovell|first=Glen|date=May 28, 1998|website=Variety.com|access-date=April 17, 2021|archive-date=April 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417051316/https://variety.com/1998/scene/vpage/manchurian-revolt-1117471298/|url-status=live}}</ref> In the end, Frankenheimer elected to use the out-of-focus take.

Before the dramatic climax, she uses her son's brainwashing to have sex with him.

Michael Schlesinger, who was responsible for the film's 1988 reissue by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA]], has helped debunk the rumour. According to him, the film was not removed, but public interest in it was small immediately before the assassination. {{r|schlesinger20080127}} The autumn 1962 release had run its course. Box-office successes in the U.S. immediately before the shootings in Dallas were comedies, notably ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', and movie distributors avoided reviving a thriller with a bleak ending that millions of people had seen barely a year earlier.{{r|schlesinger20080127}} Newspaper display ads indicate that after the assassination, ''The Manchurian Candidate'' was not rereleased as frequently or as widely as other 1962 movies, but it was indeed revived and never banned.
