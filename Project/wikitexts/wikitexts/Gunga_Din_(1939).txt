The film is about three British sergeants and Gunga Din, their native [[Bhishti|''bhisti'']] (water bearer), who fight the [[Thuggee]], an Indian murder cult, in colonial [[British Raj|British India]].\n\nThe supporting cast features [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Eduardo Ciannelli]], and in the title role, [[Sam Jaffe]].  The [[epic film]] was written by [[Joel Sayre]] and [[Fred Guiol]] from a storyline by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]], with uncredited contributions by Lester Cohen, [[John Colton (screenwriter)|John Colton]], [[William Faulkner]], Vincent Lawrence, [[Dudley Nichols]], and [[Anthony Veiller]].\n\nIn 1999, ''Gunga Din'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Preserving the Silver Screen (December 1999) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9912/nfb.html|access-date=2020-10-13|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|Northwest Frontier]] of [[British Raj|India]], ''circa'' 1880, contact has been lost with a British outpost at Tantrapur in the midst of a [[telegraph]] message. Colonel Weed dispatches a detachment of 25 [[British Indian Army]] troops to investigate, led by three sergeants of the [[Royal Engineers]]: MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, long-time friends and veteran campaigners. Although they are a disciplinary headache for their colonel, they are the right men to send on a dangerous mission. Accompanying the detail are six Indian camp workers, including regimental ''bhisti'' (water carrier) Gunga Din, who longs to throw off his lowly status and become a [[British Tommy|soldier of the Queen]].\n\nThey find Tantrapur apparently deserted and set about repairing the telegraph. However, they are soon surrounded by hostile locals. The troops fight their way out, taking heavy losses. Colonel Weed and Major Mitchell identify an enemy weapon brought back by the survivors as belonging to the Thuggee, a murder cult that had been suppressed 50 years previously. Weed intends to send MacChesney and Cutter back with a larger force, in order to retake the town and complete the telegraph repairs. Ballantine, however, is due to muster out of the army in a few days; Weed orders Sgt. Higginbotham, disliked by both MacChesney and Cutter, to join the expedition as Ballantine's replacement.\n\nOnce he is discharged, Ballantine plans to wed Emmy Stebbins and go into the tea business, a combined calamity that MacChesney and Cutter consider worse than death. MacChesney and Cutter are invited to the engagement party; intending to cause mischief, they spike the punch, which is subsequently drunk by Higginbotham. Higginbotham is so sick the following morning that he is unable to march out with the expedition, so a reluctant Ballantine is ordered to replace him.\n\nAt Tantrapur, Ballantine is eager to complete as much of the repairs as possible before his enlistment ends, while Cutter and MacChesney are frustrated and bored by the lack of action. Both suspect that if he could see some combat, Ballantine would change his mind about leaving the army. Ballantine's enlistment ends while the detachment is still at Tantrapur, and a relief column led by Higginbotham, with Emmy riding along to surprise Ballantine, arrives. Meanwhile, Gunga Din tells Cutter of a temple he has found, one made of gold. Cutter is determined to make his fortune, but MacChesney will have none of it and has Cutter put in the stockade to prevent his desertion. That night, Cutter escapes with Din's help and goes to the temple, which they discover belongs to the Thugs when the cultists return for a ceremony. Cutter creates a distraction and allows himself to be captured so that Din can slip away and sound the warning.\n\nWhen Din gives MacChesney the news, he decides to go to the rescue, while Higginbotham sends word to headquarters to call out the entire regiment. Ballantine wants to go, too, but MacChesney points out that he cannot, as he is now a civilian. Ballantine reluctantly agrees to re-enlist, on the understanding that the enlistment paper will be torn up after the rescue. Emmy tries to dissuade him from going, but he refuses to desert his friends. MacChesney's eagerness leads him to head to the temple without questioning Din in detail. As a result, MacChesney, Ballantine, and Din foolishly enter the temple by themselves and are easily captured. They are thrown into a cell with Cutter, where they discover he has been tortured since his capture; the guru demands that they reveal the details of their regiment's location. MacChesney tricks the Thuggee guru into thinking he is prepared to betray his friends and the British army, and the soldiers use the opportunity to take the guru hostage. A standoff ensues, and the soldiers take the guru to the roof of the temple, where they discover the true size of the Thuggee forces.\n\n[[File:Gunga Din (1939) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|242px|Still from ''Gunga Din'' trailer showing [[Victor McLaglen]] and [[Cary Grant]] ]]\n[[File:Gungadinjaffe.jpg|thumb|right|242px|[[Sam Jaffe]] as Gunga Din]]\nAs the regiment marches toward the temple, the guru boasts that they are falling into the trap he has set. He orders his men, still clustered around the temple, to take their positions, but they refuse to abandon him. When he sees that they are unwilling to leave him in enemy hands, he commits suicide to remove that obstacle; the Thuggee force moves into position, while other cultists swarm up the temple in order to kill the sergeants. Thugs shoot and [[bayonet]] Cutter. Gunga Din is also bayoneted, but manages with the last of his strength to climb to the top of the gold dome of the temple and sound the alarm with a bugle taken from a dead Thug. He is then shot dead, but the British force is alerted and defeats the Thuggee forces. At Din's funeral pyre, the colonel formally inducts Gunga Din as a British corporal\u2014then  he asks visiting journalist [[Rudyard Kipling]] to hand him the draft of the [[Gunga Din|poem]] Kipling has just completed, so that he might read the final words himself over Din's body. Ballantine announces his intention to remain in the army, and instead of tearing up his re-enlistment papers, gives them to the colonel, much to the approval of MacChesney and Cutter. The film ends with a final image of Gunga Din's spirit, standing proudly and saluting at attention, now in British uniform.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Sgt.

RKO took the rights as part of a production deal with Small when he moved to the company. [[William Faulkner]] did some preliminary script work then the project was assigned to [[Howard Hawks]]. He got Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur to write the screenplay and the film was set to start in 1937 but was delayed to find suitable cast. Hawks was fired from the project following the commercial failure of ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' and George Stevens was assigned to direct.<ref>Richard B.

A few interiors were made on sets at [[RKO Radio Pictures]] [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] [[sound stage]]s, and one exterior scene filmed on the [[RKO]] Encino [[movie ranch]].  The original script was composed largely of interiors and detailed life in the barracks. The decision was made to make the story a much larger adventure tale, but the re-write process dragged on into principal shooting. Some of the incidental scenes that flesh out the story were filmed while hundreds of extras were in the background being marshaled for larger takes.\n\nThe movie includes a sequence at the end in which a fictionalized [[Rudyard Kipling]], played by [[Reginald Sheffield]], witnesses the events and is inspired to write his poem (the scene in which the poem is first read out carefully quotes only those parts of the poem that tally with the events of the movie). Following objections from Kipling's family, the character was excised from some prints of the movie, but has since been restored.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $1,888,000 in the United States and Canada and $919,000 elsewhere, but because of its high production cost, it recorded a loss of $193,000.<ref name=\"rko\"/>  The film was the sixth highest grossing film nationally in 1939; however, in the ten states of Indiana, Ohio, Nebraska, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina, it was the third highest grossing film, coming only behind ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (which came in first place nationally, as well as in each of these states individually) and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (which came in fifth place nationally and second place in the aforementioned ten states).<ref>Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p57.</ref>\n\n===Critical===\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' gave ''Gunga Din'' a positive review.
