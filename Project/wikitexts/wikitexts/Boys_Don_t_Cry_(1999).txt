The film is a dramatization of the real-life story of [[Brandon Teena]] (played in the film by actress [[Hilary Swank]]), an American [[trans man]] who attempts to find himself and love in [[Nebraska]] but falls victim to a brutal [[hate crime]] perpetrated by two male acquaintances. The film co-stars [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Teena's girlfriend, [[Lana Tisdel]].\n\nAfter reading about the case while in college, Peirce conducted extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses on the relationship between Brandon and Lana. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary ''[[The Brandon Teena Story]]''.<ref>[http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/fall1999/boys.php Kimberly Peirce profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922094632/http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/fall1999/boys.php |date=September 22, 2015 }}</ref> Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Brandon's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were [[composite character|composites]].\n\nFilming occurred during October and November 1998 in the [[Dallas, Texas]] area. The producers initially wanted to film in [[Falls City, Nebraska]], where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that [[principal photography]] had to occur in Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced by a variety of styles, including [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]], while the soundtrack consisted primarily of [[country music|country]], [[blues music|blues]], and [[rock music|rock]] music. The film's themes include the nature of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] and [[Platonic love|platonic]] relationships, the causes of [[violence against LGBT people]], especially [[transgender]] people, and the relationship among [[social class]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], and [[gender]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on October 8, 1999, before appearing at various other film festivals. Distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film received a [[limited release]] in the United States on October 22, 1999, and it performed well at the North American box office, gaining three times its production budget by May 2000. The film was acclaimed by critics, with many ranking it as one of the best films of the year; praise focused on the lead performances by Swank and Sevigny as well as the film's depiction of its subject matter. However, some people who had been involved with Brandon in real life criticized the film for not portraying the events accurately.\n\n''Boys Don't Cry'' was nominated for multiple awards; at the [[72nd Academy Awards]] in 2000, Swank was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and Sevigny was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. The pair were also nominated at the [[57th Golden Globe Awards]], with Swank winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress \u2013 Drama]] award.

Soon after, he is involved in a [[street fighting|bar fight]] and is evicted from his cousin's trailer. Brandon moves to [[Falls City, Nebraska]], where he befriends ex-convicts John Lotter and Tom Nissen, <!-- EDITORS NOTE: Nissen is the correct spelling of this name; see sources for confirmation. --> and their friends Candace and [[Lana Tisdel]]. Brandon becomes romantically involved with Lana, who is initially unaware both of his anatomy and his troubled past. The two make plans to move to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where Brandon will manage Lana's karaoke singing career. Eventually, they kiss during a date night which ends with them having sex.\n\nThe police detain Brandon on charges that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he was placed in a women's prison. Brandon attempts to lie to her, saying he was born a [[hermaphrodite]] and will soon receive genital reconstruction surgery, but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react to this news with shock and disgust. They enter Brandon's room, search among Brandon's things, and discover some transgender literature that confirms their suspicions. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him.\n\nAfterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana persuades him to do so. However, the police chief proves to be less concerned with the crime than with Brandon's \"sexual identity crisis.\"\n\nLater, John and Tom get drunk and drive to Candace's house. Lana attempts to stop them, but they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under the chin, killing him instantly. While Candace is crying out to them to spare her baby, Tom shoots her in the head and kills her as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body and the baby toddles through the open door to the outside, crying. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes her away from the scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Brandon Teena]]\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as [[Lana Tisdel]]\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as John Lotter\n* [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Marvin \"Tom\" Nissen\n* [[Lecy Goranson]] as Candace\n* [[Jeannetta Arnette]] as Linda Tisdel, Lana's Mother\n* [[Matt McGrath (actor)|Matt McGrath]] as Lonny, Brandon's Cousin\n* [[Alison Folland]] as Kate Lotter, John's Sister and Lana's Best Friend\n* [[Lou Perryman]] as Sheriff Charles B.

[[Diane Keaton]]'s production company, Blue Relief, showed interest in the screenplay in the mid-1990s. Initially, the film was to be largely based on [[Aphrodite Jones]]' 1996 [[true crime]] book ''All She Wanted'', which told the story of Brandon's final few weeks.<ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter\" />  Earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring Brandon's family background, including his sister Tammy and mother Joann, as well as some of Teena's ex-girlfriends. However, Peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between Brandon and his 19-year-old girlfriend Lana Tisdel, which Peirce termed a \"great love story\",<ref name=DVDcommentary /><ref name=Seiler /> in contrast to ''All She Wanted'', which did not place an emphasis on the relationship.<ref name=\"The Hollywood Reporter\" />\n\nTo fund the writing and development of the project, Peirce worked as a [[paralegal]] on a midnight shift and as a [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] projectionist; she also received a grant from the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]].<ref name=Hart /> The project attracted the attention of producer [[Christine Vachon]], who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case.<ref name=Meyer /> [[IFC Films]], Hart Sharp Entertainment, and [[Killer Films]], Vachon and [[Eva Kolodner]]'s production company, provided financing for the project.

The small budget dictated some of the filming decisions, including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing. Timing constraints and Peirce's visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative.<ref name=DVDcommentary /><ref name=Lumenick /> For example, the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person, Phillip DeVine\u2014a black disabled man\u2014was also killed at the scene. At the time, he had been dating Lana Tisdel's sister, Leslie, who was omitted from the story.<ref name=Ramsland2 /><ref name=Ramsland5 /> ''Boys Don't Cry'' was primarily filmed in [[Greenville, Texas]], a small town about {{Convert|45|miles|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Dallas]]. Most of the incidents in the case took place in [[Falls City, Nebraska]],<ref name=\"Milwaukee Journal\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes\" /> but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in Texas.<ref name=DVDcommentary />\n\nPeirce initially wanted to shoot in Falls City, but Vachon told her that filming there would not be possible.<ref name=\"MovieMaker\" /> Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], but Peirce felt that \"none of [the places] looked right.\"<ref name=\"MovieMaker\" /> In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas.<ref name=\"MovieMaker\" />  One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, \"The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human\".<ref name=DVDcommentary /><ref name=allen />\n\nSome scenes in ''Boys Don't Cry'' required emotional and physical intensity; these were allocated extended periods of filming. The scene in which Brandon, at the wishes of his friends, bumper-skis on the back of a pickup truck, was delayed when a police officer, just arriving at a shift change, required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other. The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise, resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background.<ref name=DVDcommentary /> There were some technical complications: some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud, and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production. Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck. Teena's rape scene was given an extended filming time; Sexton, who portrayed one of the attackers, walked away in tears afterward.<ref name=DVDcommentary /> Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to \"keep a distance\" from the reality of the actual event. When scenes became difficult, Swank requested the company of her husband on set.<ref name=Loos /> At times, Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work, but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours.<ref name=\"MovieMaker\" />\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[File:Boys Don't Cry passage to manhood.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A screenshot of one of the opening scenes of the film, in which Brandon passes through a dimly lit set into a roller rink.|Brandon's \"passage to manhood\". Peirce had intended the [[roller skate]] scene to be a metaphor for Brandon's formal entrance into masculinity. This image illustrates the dim lighting used throughout the film, giving a particular emphasis on artificial light stemming from the film's focus on confined interiors.]]\nPeirce, who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking, applied techniques she had learned into the film.<ref name=\"Index Magazine\" /> She described the film's mood as \"artificial night\".<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\" /> Director of Photography Jim Denault showed her the work of photographer [[Jan Staller]], whose long-exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using \"moonlight\" effects for most of the film. As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night, John Pirozzi, who had been experimenting with [[time-lapse photography]] using a non-motion-controlled moving camera, was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\" />\n\nThe film's visual style depicts the [[Midwestern United States]] in a \"withdrawn\",<ref name=Tatara /> dark and understated light to give a \"surreal\" effect.<ref name=\"Herald Journal\" /> Denault shot ''Boys Don't Cry'' in flat, spherical format on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] using [[List of motion picture film stocks|Kodak Vision]] film stock. The film was shot with a [[Moviecam Compact]] camera fitted with [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]] super speed lenses. For the scene in which Brandon is stripped, a hand-held camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy.\n\nThe use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which Brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman. For this scene, Peirce used a three-shot method similar to that used in a scene in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) in which Dorothy leaves her house and enters Oz.<ref name=DVDcommentary /> The scene consists of a three-shot sequence meant to symbolize Brandon's metaphorical \"entrance to manhood\", or Brandon's social transition from a woman to a man. Some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination. An example is the sequence in which Brandon and Lana first have sex, followed by a shot of her, Brandon, Candace, and Kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop.<ref name=\"DVDcommentary\" /> The scene in which John and Tom strip Brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints, even though Peirce wanted six cameras to film it. The scene took an hour and a half to film in total.<ref name=\"MovieMaker\" />\n\nPeirce drew inspiration from the filming style of [[John Cassavetes]] and the early work of [[Martin Scorsese]], and she incorporated [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realist]] techniques into the film.<ref name=\"AV Club\"/> She was also influenced by a second style of work\u2014the \"magical\" films of [[Michael Powell]] and [[Kenji Mizoguchi]].<ref name=\"AV Club\" /> The former style is used when Brandon joins the social circle of John, Tom, Lana and her mother, while the latter is used when Brandon and Lana begin to depart from that life.<ref name=\"Sragow\" /> The film was also influenced by ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967).<ref name=\"AV Club\" /> Peirce incorporated influences from ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980) by opening the film with a shot of Brandon traveling along a highway, as seen from the character's imaginative or dream perspective, similar to the beginning of ''Raging Bull''.<ref name=DVDcommentary /> When a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion, Peirce cuts to an \"eerily lit\" dream landscape.<ref name=Zacharek /> ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' (1964) inspired the cinematography and editing of Brandon's rape scene, particularly in its use of [[fast cutting]].<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/kimberly-peirce-13626 |title=Kimberly Peirce: Interview |work=[[The A.V.

She opined that Brandon wanted to create close relationships, but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with Lana. \"Although Brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with Lana, he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world. He consistently faces a sense of fear related to the power-over dynamics that he and others who are transsexual face\u2026Brandon experiences the central relational paradox, in which he yearns for connection; however, due to the real threat he faces, he is unable to make that connection.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aguilar|first=Jinnelle Veronique|title=''Boys Don't Cry'', a Movie Review: Implications for Counseling Persons Who are Transgendered|journal=Journal of Creativity in Mental Health|volume=5|issue=4|pages=440\u2013446|year=2010|doi=10.1080/15401383.2010.527819|s2cid=145329257}}</ref>\n\nMyra Hird, in the ''[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]]'', argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity, and that Brandon's version is preferred by the film's female characters, comparing them to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Jimmy Stewart]], respectively. \"Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity.

She said, \"She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her\".<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly1 /><ref name=PhiladelphiaInquirer1 /> Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'', defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, \"Swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2014/02/27/lgbt-focused-oscar-acceptance-speeches |title=4 LGBT-Focused Oscar Acceptance Speeches |work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]] |last=Okeefe |first=Kevin |date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=May 1, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614010641/http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2014/02/27/lgbt-focused-oscar-acceptance-speeches |archive-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Rating and home media===\n''Boys Don't Cry'' garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene.<ref name=Advocate /> The film was initially assigned an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA); the content was [[Film censorship in the United States|toned down]] for the U.S. release, where it was [[MPAA rating system#Ratings|rated R]]. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', which discussed the film's problems with the MPAA, particularly the [[Censorship|censoring]] of the sex scenes.<ref name=DickFilm /> The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA and had to be trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating.<ref name=MPAA /> Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene.<ref name=DickFilm /> She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was \"too long\", and rhetorically asked if anyone had ever been hurt by an orgasm that was too long. The film is rated [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] by the British Board of Film Classification.<ref>https://www.bbfc.co.uk/release/boys-dont-cry-q29sbgvjdglvbjpwwc00mdu4mtq</ref>\n\n''Boys Don't Cry'' was first released on [[home video]] by [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox
