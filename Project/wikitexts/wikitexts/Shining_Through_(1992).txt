It is based on the [[Shining Through (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Susan Isaacs]]. The original music score was composed by [[Michael Kamen]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present (1992), elderly Linda Voss ([[Melanie Griffith]]) is interviewed by a BBC documentary team about her experiences before and during [[World War II]]. She explains that, growing up in [[New York City]] as a young woman of [[Irish people|Irish]]/[[German Jews|German Jewish]] parentage, she always dreamed of visiting Berlin and finding her family members there. In 1940, Linda applies for a job as a secretary with a major law firm, but is rejected because she did not graduate from a prestigious women's college. As she leaves, however, Linda impresses the supervisor by demonstrating that she speaks fluent [[German language|German]], and she is hired as a translator for Ed Leland ([[Michael Douglas]]), a humorless attorney. She soon becomes suspicious of his strange behavior and mysterious whereabouts, and begins to suspect that he is actually a spy, and they eventually become lovers. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], when America joins the war with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], Ed emerges as a colonel in the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]. Linda accompanies him to [[Washington D.C.]], but he is suddenly posted away, leaving her alone and devastated. Assigned to work in the [[War Department (US)|War Department]], she hears nothing of Ed until one evening in a night club, when he reappears with an attractive female officer. Reluctant to resume their affair, he does re-employ her. Ed and his colleagues need to replace a murdered agent in [[Berlin]] on very short notice. Despite knowing little about intelligence work, Linda volunteers and Ed is persuaded by her fluent German and passion to contribute to the war effort. Her mission is to bring back data on the [[V-1 flying bomb]].\n\nEd and Linda travel to [[Switzerland]], where he hands her over to master spy Konrad Friedrichs ([[John Gielgud]]), who takes her by train across the border into Germany, to Berlin, where he hides her in his house and introduces her to his niece, Margrete von Eberstein ([[Joely Richardson]]), a socialite also working as an Allied agent. Linda assumes the identity of Lina Albrecht, and is planted as a cook in the household of Horst Drescher, a social-climbing [[Nazi]] officer, before an important party he is throwing, but she arrives too late to prepare the food properly, causing the dinner to be a disaster, and Drescher angrily fires her. Walking dejectedly on the dark street, alone, after curfew, Linda chances to encounter a guest from the dinner, officer Franze-Otto Dietrich ([[Liam Neeson]]), who is charmed by her and mistakenly assumes she must already have had a security check. Dietrich is a widower and takes Linda/\"Lina\" on as a nanny to his two children. Between her duties as a servant, she searches Dietrich's house for confidential papers on the V1, which he is also working on. She intends to photograph them, but can find nothing. Meanwhile, Ed, sick with worry about Linda since her disappearance from Drescher's party, suddenly chances to see her in a newsreel of Hitler in a parade in Berlin. Ed's agents identify Dietrich as the man standing next to Linda in the film, and Ed heads to Germany to rescue her. Because he does not speak German, he assumes the identity of a wounded high-ranking German officer, who has had his throat injured and cannot speak. He tracks down Linda and tells her she must leave with him immediately, but Linda reveals that she has located her Jewish cousins, excitedly telling Ed and Margrete how nearby they are. She demands Ed give her another day to visit them and give them hope. The next day, with the children in her care, Linda tracks down her relatives' hiding place in the city, but she finds it empty and ransacked, they have just been captured. When an allied air raid suddenly hits, Linda has to run for cover with the children and protect them, and when they get back to the house, the frightened boy inadvertently reveals the existence of a hidden room in Dietrich's basement. Linda sneaks down there that night and finds and surreptitiously photographs Dietrich's top secret V-1 rocket blueprints. Dietrich has fallen in love with Linda, and invites her to the opera. While there, Linda's cover is blown when Margrete's mother recognizes her, believing Linda to be a friend of her daughter's from college. Dietrich is heartbroken and, once back at his house, Linda sees him loading his gun.\n\nFearing for her life, Linda flees across the city, still in her ballgown, and finds sanctuary with Margrete. When Margrete thinks Linda is not looking, she uses the phone to report in to her superiors, but Linda catches her. Margrete reveals that she is a [[double agent]], who betrayed the agent Linda replaced, causing his death, and that she gave away the location of Linda's Jewish cousins to the Gestapo. Margrete shoots Linda, wounding her, but they struggle and Linda overpowers Margrete and kills her. Linda hides in the laundry chute, escaping the German forces who raid Margrete's apartment. Badly wounded, Linda is found by Ed and Friedrichs, who take her to the railway station. Ed and Linda travel to the [[Swiss-German border]]. Linda is unconscious from blood loss, barely alive, and Ed's travel papers have expired. Ed's mute act fails to sway the border guards, forcing him to shoot his way out. Carrying Linda, he struggles towards the border. The German [[sniper]] guarding it shoots and wounds him twice, but he gets himself and Linda across before collapsing. Back in the present, Linda reveals that while she and Ed recovered from their injuries in a Swiss hospital, the [[microform|microfilm]] of the secret German documents was retrieved from a hiding place inside her glove, and the Allies [[Operation Crossbow|successfully bombed the V1 installation]]. Ed then walks out to join the interview, and they reveal they have been happily married ever since.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Ed Leland\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Linda Voss\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as General Franze-Otto Dietrich\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Margrete von Eberstein\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Konrad Friedrichs {{aka}} Sunflower\n* [[Francis Guinan]] as Andrew Berringer\n* Anthony Walters as Dietrich's son\n* [[Victoria Shalet]] as Dietrich's daughter\n* [[Sheila Allen (English actress)|Sheila Allen]] as Olga Leiner, Margrete's mother\n* Stanley Beard as Linda's father\n* [[Sylvia Syms]] as Linda's mother\n* {{interlanguage link|Ronald Nitschke|de}} as Horst Drescher\n* [[Hansi Jochmann]] as Hedda Drescher\n* [[Mathieu Carri\u00e8re]] as Capt.

It was to be written and directed by Seltzer, produced at [[Columbia Pictures]] and would likely star [[Debra Winger]].<ref>{{cite news| title=At The Movies: Seltzer's Next Project| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/30/movies/at-the-movies.html| last=Gelder| first=Lawrence| date=September 30, 1988| newspaper=The New York Times| access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref> By late 1989, just after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Seltzer and producer Rosenman were reported to be scouting potential locations in [[East Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Krakow]], and [[Budapest]], and [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] were reported to be top contenders for the lead role.<ref>{{cite news| title=Ryan, Pfeiffer Take Shine to 'Shining'| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/467017048/| last=Beck| first=Marilyn| newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]| date=December 18, 1989| page=33}}</ref> The production moved soon after to Twentieth Century Fox, and in February 1990, it was announced that Melanie Griffith had been cast.<ref>{{cite news| title='Working Girl' Has Career Change; She's a Spy| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/175492138/| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=February 22, 1990}}</ref>  After permission was secured to shoot the film on location in East Germany, the majority of it was shot in [[Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]] starting in October 1990, just as Germany was being reunified. Studio work was done at the [[Babelsberg Studios|DEFA Studios]], the state film studios of East Germany.\n\nBecause all of Berlin's great train stations were destroyed in World War II, the production traveled over 100 miles to Leipzig at the end of October to shoot scenes in the [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]] terminus, built in 1915 and the largest in Europe. This was prior to the building's modernization by the [[Deutsche Bahn]].<ref>{{cite journal| title=Das M\u00e4rchen von der Gewaltspirale in Leipzig| url=https://www.inventati.org/leipzig/?p=4123| trans-title=The fairytale of the spiral of violence in Leipzig| language=de| date=January 26, 2016| journal=Antifa in Leipzig}}</ref>\n\nThe finale, set at a border crossing and involving a period train, was shot in Maria Elend, [[Carinthia]], [[Austria]] in November, 1990.<ref>{{cite news| title=Vor 20 Jahren: Ende der Drehrbeiten f\u00fcr \"Shinning Through\"| trans-title=20 years ago: End of filming for \"Shinning Through\"| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/kinomuseum/5184959803/| date=November 15, 2010| publisher=Klagenfurt Cinema Museum| language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] scenes at the beginning of the film were shot in and around [[London]] and at nearby [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref>{{cite news| title=Griffith 'Goes Average' With A Vengeance| url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1990-09-28-2751027-story.html| last=Longsdorf| first=Amy| date=September 28, 1990| newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]| location=Allentown, Penn}}</ref> Locations included the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in Greenwich, [[Hammersmith]], and [[St Pancras Station]], which doubled for Zurich Station for a brief sequence set in Switzerland.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was neither a commercial nor a critical success.
