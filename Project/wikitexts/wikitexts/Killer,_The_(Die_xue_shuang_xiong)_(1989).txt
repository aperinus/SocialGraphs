The film stars [[Chow Yun-fat]], [[Danny Lee (actor)|Danny Lee]] and [[Sally Yeh]]. Chow plays the assassin Ah Jong, who accidentally damages the eyes of the singer Jennie (Sally Yeh) during a shootout. He later discovers that if Jennie does not undergo an expensive operation, she will go blind. To get the money for Jennie, Ah Jong decides to perform one last hit.\n\nAfter the financial backing from [[Tsui Hark]] became problematic following the release of Woo's film ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'', Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun-fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming ''The Killer'' with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films ''[[Le Samoura\u00ef]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elder |first1=Robert |title=The Best Film You've Never Seen: 35 Directors Champion the Forgotten or Critically Savaged Movies They Love |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1569768382 |pages=160\u2013163}}</ref> ''[[Mean Streets]]'', and ''Narazumono''. Woo wanted to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to ''The Killer'' as a tribute to directors [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].\n\n''The Killer'' was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world with reviewers praising the [[Action film|action]] scenes and its over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to making Hollywood films and has been a strong influence on many directors, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Johnnie To]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAh Jong, a  hitman, decides to retire after one final job. During a shootout with gangsters, he accidentally blinds a young [[nightclub singer]] named Jennie when his [[muzzle flash|gun fires too close to her eyes]]. Over the next six months, he quietly watches over her, attending all of her performances. One night, he intervenes to save her from being mugged and raped; Jennie then invites him into her apartment. They grow close and start a romantic relationship. However, Jennie then learns from her doctor that if she does not undergo a [[cornea]]l transplant, she will lose what remains of her sight.\n\nAh Jong agrees to kill a high-ranking [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] boss to pay for the operation. Meanwhile, police detective Li Ying performs a botched undercover sting and is scolded by his superior for unintentionally causing the fatal heart attack of a hostage. Li later spots Ah Jong in the middle of the hit on the Triad boss, but eventually loses him. Ah Jong's client, Hay Wong Hoi, betrays him by sending hitmen to kill Ah Jong at the location of his getaway car. Ah Jong guns down the hitmen, but a child is badly injured in the crossfire. Ah Jong rushes the child to a nearby hospital while being followed by Li and his partner, Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Ah Jong holds Yeh at gunpoint until the girl regains consciousness, then escapes from the police.\n\nLi becomes obsessed with Ah Jong's act of good will. He and Tsang learn about Jennie; when Ah Jong visits her, he manages to outwit and elude the two cops once again. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his  manager, Fung Sei, and demands the money he was promised for his last job. Sei betrays him by giving him a briefcase of blank notes and send hitmen on Ah Jong in his own home. Ah Jong kills his attackers, but spares Sei out of loyalty. The next day, Ah Jong attempts to kill Wong Hoi in a drive-by shooting but fails. Wong Hoi hires hitman Frank Chen, to  kill Ah Jong. Jennie is persuaded to help the police set a trap for Ah Jong at the airport, but Sei distracts them while Ah Jong flees with Jennie.\n\nTsang follows Sei to his house, where Ah Jong and Jennie are hiding, but gets fatally wounded by Chen's gang and dies in the hospital moments after sharing his discovery with Li. Li goes to arrest Ah Jong, but winds up helping him, and Jennie fight their way out of an ambush. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong makes Li promise that should anything happen to him, he will make sure that Jennie has her operation. Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie take refuge in a church while Sei goes to get Ah Jong's money from Hoi. He is badly beaten after trying to shoot Hoi and sustains several mortal gunshot wounds, but manages to get the money to the church.\n\nAh Jong shoots Sei to end his suffering, and he and Li arm themselves before engaging in a bloody shootout with dozens of gangsters. Both Li and Ah Jong are wounded, and eventually find themselves in a [[Mexican standoff]] between Ah Jong, Li, and Hoi. Hoi holds a gun to Jennie's head and shoots Chen dead when Li takes him hostage. Ah Jong has his eyes shot out, and bleeds to death as Jennie, now completely blind, crawls around helplessly trying to find him. As the police arrive, Hoi immediately surrenders, but an enraged Li kills him. Li is immediately subdued by the police, and collapsing to the ground in tears at the loss of his friend.\n\nThe end credits roll over a flashback sequence of Ah Jong playing the harmonica.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Ah Jong (\u963f\u838a \u0100 Zhu\u0101ng, aa3 zong1), an assassin who accidentally blinds singer Jennie when he is on a mission for the [[Triad (underground society)|triads]].

The first cut of ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' was too long for the studio<ref name=\"Hall20\">Hall, 2009. p.20</ref> so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer [[Tsui Hark]] and Woo.<ref>Heard, 1999. p.55</ref> According to producer [[Terence Chang]], Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio.

John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.<ref>Elder, 2005. p.80</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nTsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film. For the opening scene, Woo wanted the singer to perform a [[jazz music|jazz]] song and have the killer playing a saxophone. Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz. Woo stated that he \"had to change it to a Chinese song, the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies.\"<ref name=\"Heard78\">Heard, 1999. p.78</ref><ref name=\"Heard79\" /> Actress [[Sally Yeh]] who performed the [[Cantopop]] songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film. The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for ''The Killer''.<ref name=\"Hall20\" /><ref name=\"yehinterview\" />\n\nThe [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Lowell Lo]] and edited by David Wu.<ref name=\"Hall209\">Hall, 1999. p.209</ref> A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting [[vibraphone]] theme which is first heard over the opening credits.<ref name=\"Hall74\">Hall, 1999. p.74</ref> The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of [[Ennio Morricone]], specifically the soundtrack to ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in [[Sergio Leone]]'s western films was a strong influence on his work.<ref name=\"Hall209\" /> During the final action scene when the statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] is destroyed, the action music transitions to \"Overture\" from ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]]. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.<ref name=\"Hall76\">Hall, 1999. p.76</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n<!-- Provide information on the film's release, expanding upon the information in the infobox where necessary.
