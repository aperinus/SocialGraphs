Independently, each perceives that the turtles are unnaturally confined, and they hatch a plan with the assistance of zookeeper George Fairbairn ([[Michael Gambon]]) to smuggle them out and release them into the sea.\n\nTheir release of the turtles is a metaphor for their escape from their inhibitions.\n\n==Main cast==\n*[[Glenda Jackson]] as Neaera Duncan, a \"Popular children's author \u2026 fearing her creative talents have evaporated, [who] escapes into the dreamy world of sea turtles seeking inspiration in their beauty and grace.\"<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E19QOG|title=Turtle Diary (1985)(VHS): Editorial reviews: Product Description|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|access-date=2009-04-06|quote=Critically hailed as a mini-masterpiece, TURTLE DIARY is the enchanting film of people rediscovering the joys of life and love. \u2026 Outside of their chance meetings at the aquarium, they have little in common, but an inspiration to free the captive turtles starts a bond that gives their lives a new outlook.

They milk every nuance, point up every missed beat and relish each irony and repetition in the script. \u2026 ''Turtle Diary'' is a fine film that charts movingly the unnoticed despair of everyday lives, the sufferings of those who endure loneliness in silence.\"<ref name=Castell/>\n\nThe film grossed $2.2 million on its American theatrical release.\n\n==Home video ==\n\nThe film was released on videocassette in 1986 by Vestron Video.
