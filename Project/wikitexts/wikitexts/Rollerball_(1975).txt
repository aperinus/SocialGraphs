Mr. Bartholomew, chairman of the Energy Corporation and team sponsor, offers Jonathan a lavish retirement package if Jonathan will announce his retirement during an upcoming television special detailing his career. Jonathan refuses, and requests to see his former wife Ella, who had been taken from him some years earlier by a corporate executive who wanted her for himself.\n\nJonathan goes to a library, where he finds that all books have been digitized and edited to suit the corporations, and are now stored on [[supercomputer]]s at large protected corporate locations. Jonathan's friend and former coach Cletus, now an Energy executive, warns him that the Executive Committee is afraid of him, though he cannot find out why.\n\nRollerball soon degrades into senseless violence as the rules are changed just to force Jonathan out. The Semi-final match of Houston vs. Tokyo is played with limited penalties and limited substitutions in the hope Jonathan will be injured and forced out before the championship game. The brutality of the match kills several players and leaves Jonathan's best friend and teammate Moonpie in a [[coma]].\n\nIn a [[teleconference]], the Executive Committee decides that the next game will be played with no penalties, no substitutions, and no time limit in the hope that Jonathan will be killed during the game. Jonathan's popularity and longevity as a player threaten the underlying agenda of Rollerball: to demonstrate the futility of individualism.\n\nJonathan makes his way to Geneva to access the world's repository of all human knowledge, a central supercomputer known as \"Zero,\" only to find its memory corrupted. Afterwards, Jonathan receives a visit from his former wife Ella, who has been sent to convince him to retire and to make it clear that the coming game will be \"to the death.\" Jonathan realizes his wife's visit was set up by the Executives, and erases a long-cherished movie of the two of them, stating, \"I just wanted you on my side.\" Jonathan decides that despite the dangers, he ''will'' play in the Houston versus New York championship game.\n\nThe final match devolves into a gladiatorial fight. Jonathan is soon the only player left on the track for Houston, while a skater and a biker remain from New York. After a violent struggle in front of Mr. Bartholomew's box, Jonathan kills the skater and takes the ball. The biker charges, and Jonathan knocks him off the bike and pins the biker down. He raises the ball over his head, then pauses. Refusing to kill his fallen opponent, Jonathan gets to his feet and makes his way to the goal, slamming the ball home and scoring the game's only point. After a bloody match which sees all of his teammates killed or injured, Jonathan takes a [[victory lap]] as the crowd chants his name, first softly, then louder, and finally as a roar while Mr. Bartholomew hastily exits the stands.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Caan]] as Jonathan E.\n* [[John Houseman]] as Mr. Bartholomew\n* [[Maud Adams]] as Ella\n* [[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]] as 'Moonpie'\n* [[Moses Gunn]] as Cletus\n* [[Pamela Hensley]] as Mackie\n* [[Barbara Trentham]] as Daphne\n* [[John Normington]] as Ballard, Team Executive\n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Rusty, Houston Team Executive & Head Coach\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as Japanese Doctor\n* Nancy Bleier as Girl In Library\n* [[Richard LeParmentier]] as Bartholomew's Aide\n* [[Robert Ito]] as Connor, Strategy Coach For Houston Team\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as The Librarian\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n''Rollerball''{{'}}s arena sequences were shot at the [[Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle]] in [[Munich]], Germany.

At the time of the film's release, [[Howard Cosell]] interviewed Norman Jewison and James Caan on ''[[ABC's Wide World of Sports]]'', showing clips from the film and with the two of them explaining the rules of the game. Audiences who saw the film so loved the action of the game that Jewison was contacted multiple times by promoters, requesting that the \"rights to the game\" be sold so that real Rollerball leagues might be formed. Jewison was outraged, as the entire point of the movie was to show the \"sickness and insanity of contact sports and their allure.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/254103323|title=Jewison is Outraged by Reaction to 'Rollerball'|last=Sloan|first=Robin Adams|date=1975-10-20|work=Muncie Evening Press|access-date=2018-05-08 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nEnglish pro wrestler [[Mark Rocco]] was a stuntman for the film.
