It stars [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Valeria Golino]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Kristy Swanson]], and [[Bill Irwin]].<ref name=\"Hot Shots!\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78455/Hot-Shots-/|title=Hot Shots!|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref>  The film is primarily a [[parody]] of ''[[Top Gun]]'', with some scenes spoofing other popular films, including ''[[9\u00bd Weeks]]'', ''[[The Fabulous Baker Boys]]'', ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'', ''[[Rocky]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]'', was released in 1993, with Sheen, Golino, and Bridges reprising their roles.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins at Flemner Air Base 20 years in the past. A pilot named Leland \"Buzz\" Harley loses control of his plane and ejects, leaving his co-pilot Dominic \"Mailman\" Farnham to crash. Although Mailman survives, he is mistaken for a deer owing to the branches stuck to his helmet and is shot by a hunter.\n\nTopper Harley wakes up from a [[nightmare]] he is having about the event when Lt. Commander Block asks him to return to active duty as a pilot in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], to help on a new top secret mission: Operation Sleepy Weasel, commanded by the senile and accident-prone [[Admiral]] Benson. Harley experiences intense [[Depersonalization-derealization disorder|psychological problems]], especially when his father is mentioned. His [[Psychotherapy|therapist]], Ramada, tries to stop Topper from flying, but she relents, and also starts to fall in love with him. Meanwhile, Topper gets into a feud with another fighter pilot, Kent Gregory, Mailman's son and a former boyfriend of Ramada, who blames Buzz Harley for his father's death and believes Topper is dangerous.\n\nBlock starts privately meeting with an airplane tycoon, Mr. Wilson, who has recently built a new \"Super Fighter\" that will make the American pilots superior. Block reveals that he brought back Topper for the reason of making Sleepy Weasel fail. Block would then report that it was the Navy's planes that were the real reason for the mission failure and that they need to be replaced with Wilson's planes. During one of the last training missions, an accident between Pete \"Dead Meat\" Thompson and Jim \"Wash-Out\" Pfaffenbach leaves Dead Meat killed and Wash Out demoted to radar operator. Block believes this is enough to convince the Navy to buy new fighters, but Wilson calls it a \"minor incident\", saying the planes need to fail in combat.\n\nTopper develops a strong emotional attachment to Ramada, but she is haunted by her past with Gregory. On the [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] S.S. ''Essess'', Benson reveals the mission to be an attack of an [[Iraq]]i [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear plant]] and Block assigns Topper to lead the mission, much to Gregory's protest. Wilson, who is also on board, instructs a crew member to sabotage the planes, putting the pilots' lives at risk. In the midst of the mission, Block mentions Buzz Harley to Topper, who has a [[panic attack]] and is unable to lead. Block just starts to call out for the mission to be aborted when Iraqi fighters attack the squadron. All the planes' weapons fail, and Block, realizing what has happened, tells Topper that he saw what really happened with Buzz and Mailman: That Buzz tried to do everything possible to save Mailman, but ended up falling out of the plane, failing in his attempts.\n\nWith his self-confidence restored, Topper single-handedly beats the Iraqi fighters and bombs the nuclear plant, dropping a bomb directly on Saddam Hussein. Back aboard ship, Wilson's plan is revealed, and his standing with the military is lost. Back in port, Gregory hails Topper as a great pilot and gives his blessing to Ramada to be with Topper. The end credits show Dead Meat and Mailman in [[Angel|spirit]] with Dead Meat saluting, Mailman giving a thumbs up and [[Elvis Presley]] (who was mentioned earlier in the film).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as LT Sean \"Topper\" Harley\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as LT Kent Gregory\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Ramada Thompson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as RADM Thomas \"Tug\" Benson\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as LCDR James Block\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as LT Jim \"Wash Out\" Pfaffenbach\n* [[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]] as LT Pete \"Dead Meat\" Thompson\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Kowalski\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] as Wilson\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Leland \"Buzz\" Harley\n* [[Ryan Stiles]] as Dominic \"Mailman\" Farnham\n* [[Heidi Swedberg]] as Mary Thompson\n* [[Rino Thunder]] as Owatonna 'The Old One'\n* [[Charles Barkley]] as himself\n* [[Don Lake]] as Roy\n* [[Cylk Cozart]] as Drill Sergeant\n* [[Bill Laimbeer]] as himself\n* [[Jerry Haleva]] as [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Gene Greytak]] as [[Pope John Paul II]]\n* Mark Arnott as Rosener\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Critical reception==\nThe film debuted at number one in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : List-Toppers Are Listless|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1991-08-27|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-27/entertainment/ca-1886_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2011-01-13|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Terminator 2' Surrenders Top Spot |work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1991-08-06|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-06/entertainment/ca-693_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2011-01-02|first=Daniel|last=Cerone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= In the Wake of 'Terminator 2,' a Slow Season : Box office: With three weeks to go in the summer, it appears there will be no records set.
