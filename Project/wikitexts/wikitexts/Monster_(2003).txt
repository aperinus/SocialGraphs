On February 8, 2004, it premiered at the [[54th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Golden Bear]], while Theron won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]].

Theron's acting has received critical acclaim; film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called Theron's role \"one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema\".<ref name= \"ebert\" /> The film was chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards 2003#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2003]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, after moving from [[Michigan]] to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], and on the verge of committing suicide, [[Street prostitution|street prostitute]] [[Aileen Wuornos]] meets Selby Wall in a [[gay bar]]. Although she is initially hostile and declares that she is not [[Homosexuality|gay]], Aileen talks to Selby while drinking beer. Selby takes to Aileen almost immediately, as she likes that she is very protective of her. Selby invites Aileen to spend the night with her. The two women return to the house where Selby is staying (temporarily exiled by her parents following the accusation from another girl that Selby tried to kiss her). They later agree to meet at a [[roller skating]] rink, and they kiss for the first time. Aileen and Selby fall in love, but they have nowhere to go, so Selby goes back to her aunt's home.\n\nAfter being brutally [[rape]]d and beaten by a client, Vincent Corey, Aileen kills him in [[self-defense]] and decides to quit prostitution. She confesses her actions to Selby, who has been angry with her for her failure to support both of them. Aileen decides to find legitimate work, but because of her lack of qualifications and criminal history, prospective employers reject her and are openly hostile. Desperate for money, Aileen returns to prostitution. She robs and kills her [[Client (prostitution)|johns]], each killed in a more brutal way than the last, as she is convinced that they are all trying to rape her. She spares one man out of pity when he admits he has never had sex with a prostitute. She also shows a predisposition to spare another man who, instead of exploiting her, offers help, but finds herself forced to shoot him after he spots her gun. Aileen uses the money she stole from her victims to support herself and Selby.\n\nHowever, Selby reads in the newspapers about the string of murders, and she begins to suspect that Aileen may have committed them. She confronts Aileen, who justifies her actions by claiming she had only been protecting herself. Selby returns to [[Ohio]] on a charter bus. The night of her arrest, Aileen is approached at the [[biker bar]] she frequents by two strangers, who unbeknownst to her are [[bounty hunter]]s. Thomas, whom Aileen always referred to as the only friend she had, infers the men's intentions and offers to drive her off. Aileen declines, no longer trusting herself with the well-being of anyone dear to her. The two men eventually lure Aileen out of the bar and she is promptly arrested by the police. Aileen speaks to Selby one last time while in jail. Selby reveals some incriminating information over the telephone and Aileen realizes that the police are listening in. To protect Selby, Aileen admits that she committed the murders alone. During Aileen's trial, Selby testifies against her, with Aileen's loving consent. Aileen is convicted of the murders and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On October 9, 2002, Aileen is executed by [[lethal injection]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast and order per closing credits-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Aileen Wuornos|Aileen \"Lee\" Wuornos]]\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Selby Wall (based on Tyria Moore)\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Thomas, Aileen's friend\n* [[Lee Tergesen]] as Vincent Corey (based on Richard Mallory)\n* [[Annie Corley]] as Donna, Selby's aunt\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Gene/Stuttering \"[[Client (prostitution)|john]]\"\n* [[Marco St. John]] as Evan/Undercover \"john\"\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Will/Daddy \"john\"\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Horton/Last victim\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 81% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 190 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
