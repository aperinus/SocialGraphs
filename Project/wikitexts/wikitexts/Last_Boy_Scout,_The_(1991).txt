The film stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Damon Wayans]], [[Chelsea Field]], [[Noble Willingham]], [[Taylor Negron]] and [[Danielle Harris]]. The film was released in the United States on December 13, 1991.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring [[halftime]] at a televised football game, L A. Stallions [[running back]] Billy Cole receives a phone call from a mysterious man named Milo, who warns him to win the game or he will be assassinated. Cole ingests [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] and in a drug-induced rage, brings a gun onto the field, shooting three opposing players to reach the end zone before shooting himself in the head. Meanwhile, [[private investigator]] Joseph Hallenbeck, a disgraced former [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent, discovers that his wife Sarah is having an affair with his friend and business partner, Mike Matthews. Mike gives Joe an assignment to act as bodyguard for a stripper named Cory. Mike is then killed by a car bomb outside Joe's house.\n\nJoe is approached by Cory's boyfriend, former Stallions [[quarterback]] Jimmy Dix, who was banned from the league on gambling charges and alleged drug abuse. After an argument between Joe and Jimmy, an annoyed Jimmy takes Cory from the stage while she is performing. Joe plans to wait outside, where he is knocked out by a team of hitmen. Jimmy and Cory leave the bar in separate cars while Joe is left to dispatch one of the hitmen. When Cory is struck from behind and stops to confront the other driver, she is killed by the hitmen. Jimmy is fired upon and pinned down, but is saved by Joe.\n\nAt Cory's house, Jimmy and Joe find a taped phone conversation between Senator Calvin Baynard, who is leading a congressional investigation into gambling in sports, and Stallions owner Sheldon Marcone. When the tape is ruined in Joe's faulty car stereo, Jimmy realizes that Cory tried using the tape against Marcone to put Jimmy back on the team, prompting Marcone to send the hitmen. Joe saves Jimmy from another car bomb, and tricks two hitmen into blowing themselves up. However, the explosion destroys the remaining evidence.\n\nJoe reveals to Jimmy that when he was in the Secret Service, he witnessed Baynard torturing a woman in a hotel room and assaulted the senator to stop the attack. Baynard retaliated by having Joe fired from the Secret Service for refusing to cover up the incident. At Joe's house, Jimmy meets Joe's abrasive daughter Darian. When Joe catches Jimmy attempting to use illegal painkillers in the bathroom, Joe kicks him out. As Jimmy leaves, Darian asks him to sign a football trading card, stating that Joe was a fan of Jimmy's and never watched another game after he was banned from the league. He leaves her with the signed card, \"To the daughter of the last Boy Scout.\"\n\nLearning of Mike's affair with Sarah, the police assume Joe killed him and move to make an arrest. Milo, Marcone's top henchman, captures Joe first and shoots a detective using Joe's gun. Marcone explains to Joe that he has been buying Senate votes to legalize sports gambling, but that Baynard tried to [[blackmail]] Marcone for $6 million. Being aware of Joe's history with Baynard, Marcone explains it would be cheaper to kill the senator and frame Joe for the murder. Joe is forced to hand a briefcase full of money to Baynard's bodyguards, who switched it with a wired briefcase. Joe is rescued by Jimmy and Darian, and acquires both briefcases after running the bodyguards and Milo off the road. However, Milo survives and while Darian is left to wait for the police, she is abducted by Milo.\n\nHeading to the stadium to rescue Darian, Joe and Jimmy are captured and escorted to Marcone's office. Jimmy creates a diversion, allowing them to fight their way free. Realizing Milo will attempt to shoot Baynard, Joe goes after Milo while sending Jimmy to warn the senator. Grabbing the game ball, Jimmy throws it at Baynard, knocking him down just as Milo starts shooting. Joe knocks Milo to the edge of the stadium light platform, where [[SWAT]] officers shoot him before he falls into the moving rotor blades of a helicopter. The suitcase of money is recovered and the fleeing Marcone, having escaped with the rigged briefcase, is killed when he opens it at his house. The next day, Joe and Sarah reconcile, and Joe and Jimmy decide to become partners.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Joseph Cornelius \"Joe\" Hallenbeck\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as James \"Jimmy\" Dix\n* [[Chelsea Field]] as Sarah Hallenbeck \n* [[Noble Willingham]] as Sheldon \"Shelly\" Marcone\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Milo\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Darian Hallenbeck\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Cory \n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Mike Matthews\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Chet \n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Senator Calvin Baynard \n* [[Joe Santos]] as Lieutenant Ben Bessalo \n* [[Clarence Felder]] as Detective Mick McCaskey \n* [[Frank Collison]] as Pablo\n* [[Billy Blanks]] as Billy Cole\n* [[Sara Suzanne Brown]] as Dancer\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Club DJ\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Scrabble Man\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Marcone's Henchman (Uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\nThe film was based on an original script by [[Shane Black]]. He wrote the script after having taken a two-year break from writing, triggered in part by the end of a relationship. [[The Geffen Film Company]] outbid other companies, paying a record $1.75 million for the script, with over a $1 million guaranteed up front.<ref name=bid/> Black later recalled:\n<blockquote>I was busy mourning my life and, in many ways, the loss of my first real love. I didn\u2019t feel much like doing anything except smoking cigarettes and reading paperbacks. All things come around. Time passed and eventually I sat down and transformed some of that bitterness into a character, the central focus of a private eye story which became ''The Last Boy Scout''. Writing that script was a very cathartic experience, one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had. I spent so much time alone working on that. Days which I wouldn\u2019t speak. Three, four days where I maybe said a couple words. It was a wonderfully intense time where my focus was better than it\u2019s ever been. And I was rewarded so handsomely ($1.75 million) for that script, it felt like a vindication and like I was back on track.<ref>{{cite web|website=Creative Screenwriting|url=https://creativescreenwriting.com/i-like-violence/|first=Erik|last=Bauer|date=1 December 2014|title=\"I Like Violence\" \u2013 Shane Black}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], commenting on the script, said \"The original screenplay for ''The Last Boy Scout'' set a record for its purchase price; that was probably because of the humor of the locker-room dialogue, since the plot itself could have been rewritten out of the ''Lethal Weapon'' movies by any film school grad.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\n[[Joel Silver]] was guaranteed $1 million to produce.<ref name=bid>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 25, 1990|page=7|title=Geffen Co. comes prepared, pays record $1.75-mil for 'Last Boy Scout' script|last=Eller|first=Claudia}}</ref> Silver said in a Q&A for ''[[The Nice Guys]]'' (2016) that Shane Black's original title was ''Die Hard''.

Conflict and arguments flared between Joel Silver, Bruce Willis and Tony Scott. Although they partner up in the film, Willis and [[Damon Wayans]] hated working with each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://monkeysfightingrobots.co/the-last-boy-scout-shane-black-and-tony-scotts-la-miracle/|title='The Last Boy Scout', Shane Black and Tony Scott's LA Miracle|first=Larry|last=Taylor|date=17 May 2016|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Silver was described as \"insane, with long, horrible fits of sanity,\u201d and was compared to a fighter pilot riding as a passenger. \u201cAs soon as you hit a little bit of turbulence, he\u2019s right away going to throw the guy out of the window and take over the steering.\u201d Taylor Negron, who played Milo, described Silver as extremely hands-on in every aspect of the production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/3212/a-talk-with-taylor-negron|title=A Talk With Taylor Negron - Retro Junk Article|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAssistant director [[James Skotchdopole]] attributed the tension on-set to an \u201coverabundance of alpha males on that project. Bruce was at the height of his stardom, so was Joel, so was Tony and so was Shane. There were a lot of people who had a lot of opinions about what to do. There were some heated, early-Nineties, testosterone charged personalities on the line. It was a \u2018charged environment,\u2019 shall we say.\u201d Writer [[Shane Black]] had to wrestle with the script. \u201cI was forced to do more rewriting on that movie than on anything else I\u2019ve done. There was tremendous pressure from the studio to get Bruce Willis and have this be a follow-up to ''Die Hard''. He was reluctant, and rightly so: \u2018This whole movie is about me saving my wife. I just did that in ''Die Hard''.\u2019 So they said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s minimize the wife and, and while we\u2019re at it, add a big finale.' There was a general pressure to somehow make it bigger.\u201d<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/31/who-killed-the-last-boy-scout-bruce-willis-shane-black-and-the-m/|title=Who killed The Last Boy Scout?

Editor [[Mark Helfrich (film editor)|Mark Helfrich]] described sorting through \"mountains of raw material\" to edit the first cut: \"There was more footage shot for ''The Last Boy Scout'' than on any film I had ever worked on.\" He recalled with incredulity that the work of previous editors appeared to have been rejected, taken apart and put back into the daily reels: \"There were still splices all over the place.\" Expert action movie editor [[Mark Goldblatt]], who also worked on the film, recalls it as one of the most painful and frustrating experiences of his entire career, and refuses to discuss it in interviews, although he did mention in a podcast interview that several other editors were hired and then fired before him, and that Warner Bros. began testing the movie before it was completely finished. Studio executives fretted about the expanding budget, while less-than-enthusiastic reactions from a test screening audience, as well as the unlikeable character played by Willis, did little to allay these concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2018/09/12/no-heroes-left-revisiting-the-last-boy-scout|title=No Heroes Left: Revisiting THE LAST BOY SCOUT|first=Priscilla|last=Page|date=September 12, 2018|website=Birth.Movies.Death.}}</ref>\n\nWhen editor Stuart Baird was hired, the film finally took a positive turn. Baird had been brought in to help re-edit other troubled productions, including ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989) and ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993). Some later cuts were done with the film's graphic scenes after it was originally rated NC-17, which explains quick-cut edits in some of the death scenes in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/31/who-killed-the-last-boy-scout-bruce-willis-shane-black-and-the-m/|title=Who killed The Last Boy Scout?
