Principal photography\u00a0began on November 2, 2009, with location filming taking place in\u00a0Louisiana.\n\n''I Spit on Your Grave'' had its premiere on [[Texas Frightmare Weekend]] on May 1, 2010, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 8, 2010, by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]]. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $572,809 on a $2 million budget.\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, ''[[I Spit on Your Grave 2]]'' (2013) and ''[[I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (2015).\n\n==Plot==\nNovelist Jennifer Hills travels from [[New York City]] to [[Louisiana]] to work on her next book in privacy. The [[gas station attendant]], Johnny Stillman, gives her directions to her rented cabin when she gets lost. He embarrasses himself by trying to flirt with her. When the cabin's plumbing becomes clogged, it is fixed by Matthew Duncan, a [[stuttering]] plumber with an [[intellectual disability]]. She rewards him with an abrupt kiss of gratitude. Matthew tells Johnny and his friends Andy Chirensky and Stanley Woods about what happened with Jennifer. Johnny, whose ego was bruised after the gas station incident, decides that Jennifer is snobbish and needs to be \"taught a lesson\".\n\nThat night, the four men sneak into the cabin and taunt and assault her, although Matthew refuses to participate. She escapes into the woods and bumps into the local [[Sheriff]] named Sheriff Storch and Earl, the owner of the cabin. Storch takes Jennifer back to the cabin, but when he finds her drugs and alcohol, he casts doubts on her story. After Johnny, Matthew, Andy, and Stanley return, all five men [[gang rape]] her, including an initially reluctant Matthew. Stanley records everything with his [[video camera]]. Afterward, just as Storch is about to shoot her, Jennifer falls into the river to escape.\n\nJennifer begins to stalk her rapists in order to learn details of their lives. Stanley tells Andy and Johnny that his camera has been stolen, along with the videotape of their assault. Storch intercepts a videotape sent to his wife and confronts the men to find out who sent it. Johnny and Andy suspect Matthew. When they go hunting, Storch kills Earl, saying that he is taking care of \"loose ends\".\n\nMatthew returns to the cabin and meets Jennifer. He attempts to apologize to her, but she does not accept his apology and strangles him. She captures Stanley in a [[Bear-trap|bear trap]], ties him to a tree, smears fish guts on his face and then leaves his camera to record crows pecking out his eyes, which she pinned open with [[fish hook]]s. She then drowns Andy and burns his face off in a [[lye]] bathtub. Next, she ties Johnny to the rafters of an abandoned house and uses pliers to pull out his teeth and a pair of [[garden shears]] to [[emasculate]] him, leaving him to bleed to death. While torturing them, she repeats the taunts all of the men had used on her.\n\nJennifer visits Storch's wife, posing as their daughter Chastity's new teacher. She takes the daughter to the park and, when Storch tracks her there, she knocks him unconscious. When he wakes up, Jennifer stuffs his [[shotgun]] into his [[anus]] and reminds him that she was just as innocent as his own daughter. She attaches one end of a string to the trigger and the other end to the wrist of the unconscious Matthew, who is seated in front of Storch. When Matthew wakes up, he sees the bound sheriff and tries to move, triggering the shotgun, which fires a round through Storch's anus and mouth before hitting Matthew in the chest, killing both men. Sitting outside, Jennifer hears the gunshot and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Butler (actress)|Sarah Butler]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20842|title=FanTasia '10: Say What?

If I rape you, I have committed a crime. If you kill me, you have committed another one. The ideal outcome would be two people unharmed in the first place.\" While he allowed that the movie was made \"professionally,\" as opposed to the original version that was devoid of skill and artistry, he considered this largely in the service of the truly offensive material, the rape scenes. He summarized, \"this [version] is more offensive, because it lingers lovingly and at greater length on realistic verbal, psychological and physical violence against the woman, and then reduces her 'revenge' to cartoonish horror-flick impossibilities.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-spit-on-your-grave-2010 |title=I Spit on Your Grave |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date= 2010-10-06|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Roger|last=Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/the-your-movie-sucks-files|title=the Your Movie Sucks\u2122 files|publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=February 17, 2011|access-date=February 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624124437/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/your-movie-sucks.html |archive-date=2011-06-24 }}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, \"In addition to all the obvious things that are disgusting about this movie, ''I Spit on Your Grave'' is trying to get us to hate each other.
