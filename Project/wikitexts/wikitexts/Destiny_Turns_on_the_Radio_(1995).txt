The film starred [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Nancy Travis]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[James LeGros]] and [[James Belushi]]. It marked the film debut role of [[David Cross]],<ref name=\"maslin\" /> and was the first film produced by [[Rysher Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn incarcerated bank robber, Julian Goddard, escapes from prison. He is rescued in the desert by Johnny Destiny, a bizarre, possibly supernatural character. Destiny takes Julian to Las Vegas and the Marilyn Motel, owned by Harry Thoreau, who was Julian's partner in crime. Julian searches for his girlfriend, Lucille, and the proceeds of the heist.\n\nHowever, Destiny has taken the money and Lucille is pregnant and shacking up with Tuerto, a mob kingpin. Her agent has convinced a record label to send a talent scout to hear her lounge singing act, but Julian's arrival upsets her plans. As they are hunted by both the police and Tuerto's henchmen, Destiny toys with their fate.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dylan McDermott]] as Julian Goddard\n*[[Nancy Travis]] as Lucille\n*[[James LeGros]] as Harry Thoreau\n*[[Quentin Tarantino]] as Johnny Destiny\n*[[James Belushi]] as Tuerto\n*[[Janet Carroll]] as Escabel\n*[[David Cross]] as Ralph Dellaposa\n*[[Richard Edson]] as Gage\n*[[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Mr. Smith\n*[[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Dravec\n*[[Lisa Jane Persky]] as Katrina\n*Sarah Trigger as Francine\n*[[Tracey Walter]] as Pappy\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as Vinnie Vidivici\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 1 star out of 4 and wrote that it \"moves at a lugubrious pace, is neither funny nor satirical, does not create any interest in its characters and takes seriously just those parts it should be laughing at - the Tarantino character, for example, or the business of how Lucille got pregnant in a dream. It's one of those movies where everybody must have spent a lot of time convincing themselves that the material would work if you looked at it in the right way, but nobody ever knew exactly what the right way was.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/destiny-turns-on-the-radio-1995 |title=Destiny Turns on the Radio |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=April 28, 1995 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=August 18, 2019 }}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, \"Thoroughly upstaged by the Las Vegas setting and by a studiously garish production design, the actors play out a satirically dark story laced with broad, dopey humor.
