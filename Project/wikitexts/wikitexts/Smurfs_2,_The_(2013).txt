It is the second film in the [[The Smurfs (film series)|''Smurfs'' film series]] and a [[sequel]] to the 2011 film ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'', produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Animation]], [[Kerner Entertainment Company]], and Hemisphere Media Capital, and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film is directed by [[Raja Gosnell]], who helmed the first, with all the main cast returning. New cast members include [[Christina Ricci]] and [[J. B. Smoove]] as members of the Naughties, and [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Patrick Winslow's stepfather.\n\n''The Smurfs 2'' was released on July 31, 2013 to generally negative reviews from critics for poor attempts at humor, characters, plot, screenplay and perceived lack of fidelity to its source material, despite some audiences considering the film as a slight improvement over its predecessor while most critics considered it as its predecessor all over again. The film is dedicated to [[Jonathan Winters]], who voiced [[Papa Smurf]] and died on April 11, 2013.<ref name=LATReview>{{cite news|last=Olsen|first=Mark|title=Review: 'The Smurfs 2' lives up to predecessor's mediocre standards|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/30/entertainment/la-et-smurfs2-review-20130731|access-date=October 31, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 30, 2013|quote=Even though the \"Smurfs\" films never quite took full advantage of Winters' antic comedic gifts in the role as the softly wizened Papa Smurf, the end credits feature a dedication to the late comedy legend for \"making the world a smurfier place.\"}}</ref> A fully animated reboot titled ''[[Smurfs: The Lost Village]]'' was released on April 7, 2017, directed by [[Kelly Asbury]] with Sony and Kerner returning to produce the film while having an all new cast (with the exception of [[Frank Welker]] as Azrael).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn preparation for her birthday celebration, the Smurfs read the story of [[Smurfette]], how she was created by [[Gargamel]] to destroy them, only for [[Papa Smurf]] to rescue her and turn her fully into a Smurf. Meanwhile, she is having nightmares about reverting to her original form and betraying her fellow Smurfs by turning them over to Gargamel. The Smurfs are preparing a surprise party, but as Smurfette tries to find out what her fellow Smurfs are planning, none of them are saying a word. She takes this to mean that everyone has forgotten her birthday.\n\nIn [[Paris]], Gargamel and Azrael are now celebrities, amazing people with Gargamel's sorcery, but he is running low on the Smurf essence that gives him his magic powers. With his new creations, evil Smurf-like creatures called the Naughties, named Vexy and Hackus, Gargamel creates a portal to Smurf Village by using the [[Eiffel Tower]] as a conduit so that he can kidnap Smurfette as revenge on The Smurfs for [[The Smurfs (film)|previously defeating him]] and, through her, obtain Papa's secret formula for creating Smurfs. However, Gargamel is too large to go through the portal, so he sends Vexy through it to kidnap Smurfette.\n\nThe Smurfs witness the abduction of Smurfette and inform Papa, who uses his magic to create [[crystals]] that allow several of his Smurfs to travel directly to the residence of their human allies, Patrick and Grace Winslow, in [[New York City]] in order to seek his help to rescue Smurfette. Papa originally intends for Brainy, Hefty and Gutsy to use the crystals, but through an accident, Clumsy, Grouchy and Vanity use them instead. The Smurfs arrive in Patrick and Grace's apartment right after the celebration of their son Blue's fourth birthday where they meet Patrick's stepfather, Victor Doyle, who is a constant embarrassment to Patrick. The Smurfs soon discover Gargamel is in Paris and set off with the Winslows and Victor to find him.\n\nUpon arrival in Paris, Patrick and Grace work with Victor to distract Gargamel during one of his performances, while the Smurfs sneak backstage in Gargamel's [[dressing room]] to look for Smurfette, only to discover what Gargamel is planning. At the same time, Smurfette escapes from her prison, and Vexy and Hackus chase after her. Vexy encourages her to become one of them, claiming that naughty is fun. Upon her return to Gargamel's hotel suite with the Naughties, Gargamel presents her with a tiny dragon wand as a feigned act of kindness. Smurfette still refuses to give Gargamel the formula until she sees the Naughties are dying due to a lack of Smurf essence. Faced without an alternative to save them, Smurfette writes the formula down and Gargamel uses it to turn the Naughties into real Smurfs. Immediately after they become Smurfs, Gargamel puts them into his Smurfalator so he can carry out the rest of his plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick, Victor and the Smurfs work together to rescue Smurfette. The Smurfs are soon captured and put into the Smurfalator, powering Gargamel's large-sized dragon wand. Patrick and Victor arrive just in time to destroy the Smurfalator together, causing an explosion of Smurf essence that destroys the written formula and frees the Smurfs from their cages. Everyone is blasted out of Gargamel's lair through a sewer hole where Patrick and Victor reunite with Grace and Blue. Gargamel reappears out of the sewer hole only to be blasted away by Smurfette with her new wand. He then falls onto the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], where he accidentally brings a stone [[gargoyle]] to life, which then throws him to the top of the Eiffel Tower where fireworks are then set off, sending him into the air. The Smurfs bid farewell to the Winslows, then return home with Vexy and Hackus to celebrate Smurfette's birthday.\n\nIn two post-credit sequences, Gargamel and Azrael are pulled into the portal, sending them back to their castle, and they later have a fight.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Live-action actors===\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as [[Gargamel]], an evil wizard\n* Mr. Krinkle as [[List of The Smurfs characters#Antagonists|Azrael]], Gargamel's cat\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Patrick \"Pat\" Winslow, Victor's step-son\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Victor Doyle, Patrick's step-father, Grace's step-father-in-law and Blue's step-grandfather<ref name=ComingSoon />\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as Gracie \"Grace\" Winslow, Patrick's wife, Blue's mother and Victor's step-daughter-in-law<ref name=ComingSoon />\n* [[Jacob Tremblay]] as Blue Winslow, Patrick and Grace's son and Victor's step-grandson\n* [[Nancy O'Dell]] as herself, a television interviewer<ref>{{cite news|title=Nancy Plays Herself in 'Smurfs 2' Set Visit|url=http://www.etonline.com/movies/126076_Nancy_O_Dell_Plays_Herself_in_Smurfs_2_Set_Visit/index.html|access-date=November 5, 2012|newspaper=ETonline|date=October 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022203750/http://www.etonline.com/movies/126076_Nancy_O_Dell_Plays_Herself_in_Smurfs_2_Set_Visit/index.html|archive-date=October 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Voice actors===\n* [[Katy Perry]] as [[Smurfette]]<ref name=ComingSoon />\n* [[Jonathan Winters]] as [[Papa Smurf]]<ref name=ComingSoon />\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Clumsy Smurf<ref name=ComingSoon /> \n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Vexy, a smart and mischievous Smurf-like creature called a \"Naughty\" created by Gargamel and Grouchy Smurf's love interest<ref name=ComingSoon /><ref name=\"EW\">{{cite news|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=FIRST LOOK: Gray gloom for the villainous little Naughties from 'Smurfs 2' -- EXCLUSIVE|url=http://family-room.ew.com/2012/09/19/first-look-naughties-smurfs-2-exclusive/|access-date=September 20, 2012|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 19, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[J.
