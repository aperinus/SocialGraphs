Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy capitalizes on the headline by auditioning as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from studio boss Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry. With a little guidance from Valentin, who draws a [[beauty spot]] on her after finding her in his dressing room, Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\n\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, ''Tears of Love'', financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film ''Beauty Spot'' and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately, audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, while only a few people (including Peppy herself) attend Valentin's. With Valentin ruined, his wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\n\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] quickly blazes out of control, he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued, Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to remind Valentin of his changing luck.\n\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that Peppy had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a [[Musical film#The classical sound era|musical]] together.\n\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a [[French accent]].<ref name=\"themarysue\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/cinema-scope-a-short-history-of-the-end-of-silent-film/|title=Cinema Scope: A Short History of the End of Silent Film|access-date=13 March 2013|publisher=[[Dan Abrams#The Mary Sue|The Mary Sue]]}}</ref> The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jean Dujardin]] as George Valentin\n*[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]] as Peppy Miller\n*[[Uggie]] as the dog, Jack\n*[[John Goodman]] as Al Zimmer\n*[[James Cromwell]] as Clifton\n*[[Missi Pyle]] as Constance\n*[[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Doris Valentin\n*[[Malcolm McDowell]] as The Butler\n*[[Elizabeth Tulloch|Bitsie Tulloch]] as Norma\n*[[Beth Grant]] as Peppy's maid\n*[[Ed Lauter]] as Peppy's first chauffeur\n*[[Jen Lilley]] as Onlooker\n*[[Nina Siemaszko]] as Admiring woman\n*[[Jewel Shepard]] as Flapper starlet\n*[[Basil Hoffman]] as Auctioneer\n*[[Ben Kurland]] as Casting assistant\n*[[Ken Davitian]] as Pawnbroker\n*[[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Policeman\n*[[Adria Tennor]] as Zimmer's Assistant<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmdaily.co/indie-film/adria-tennor-interview/|title=From \u2018The Artist\u2019 to \u2018Mad Men\u2019: Get to know actress Adria Tennor|website=filmdaily.co|access-date=2021-06-06}}</ref>\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:\u00c9quipe The Artist Cannes 2011.jpg|thumb|400px|Some of the cast and crew at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]: (left to right), score composer [[Ludovic Bource]], director [[Michel Hazanavicius]], stars [[Missi Pyle]], [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], and [[Jean Dujardin]], director of photography [[Guillaume Schiffman]] and producer [[Thomas Langmann]].]]\nDirector [[Michel Hazanavicius]] had been fantasizing about making a [[silent film]] for many years, both because many filmmakers he admires emerged in the silent era, and because of the image-driven nature of the form. According to Hazanavicius, his wish to make a silent film was at first not taken seriously, but after the financial success of his spy-film pastiches ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'' and ''[[OSS 117: Lost in Rio]]'', producers started to express interest. The forming of the film's narrative started with Hazanavicius' desire to work again with actors [[Jean Dujardin]] and [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], who had both starred in ''OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies''. Hazanavicius chose the form of a [[melodrama]], mostly because he thought many of the films from the silent era that have aged best are of that genre. He did extensive research about 1920s Hollywood, and studied silent films to find the right techniques to make the story comprehensible without having to use too many [[intertitle]]s. The screenplay took four months to write and was principally inspired by the 1928 silent comedy, ''[[Show People]]''.<ref name=presskitmh>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |title=Interview with Michel Hazanavicius |work=English press kit The Artist |publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] |access-date=10 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914011421/http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |archive-date=14 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue19/pdf/NYU19.pdf|title=The Clothes Make the Man|last=Alfuso|first=Renee|date=Fall 2012|work=NYU Alumni Magazine|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nChief among the influences shaping the screenplay's protagonist was [[Douglas Fairbanks]].
