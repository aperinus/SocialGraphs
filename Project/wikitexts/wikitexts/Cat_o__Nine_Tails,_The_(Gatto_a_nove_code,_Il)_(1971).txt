However, it was acclaimed in the United States. Argento admitted in the book ''Broken Mirrors, Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'' that he was less than pleased with the film, and has repeatedly cited it as his least favorite of all of his films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/dario-argentos-the-cat-o-nine-tails-coming-to-blu-ray |title=Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails coming to Blu-ray - Horror Movie News <nowiki>|</nowiki> Arrow in the Head |last=DiVincenzo |first=Alex |date=27 January 2011 |work=joblo.com |access-date=6 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAn unknown individual breaks into the Terzi Medical Institute but supposedly takes nothing. One of the Institute doctors, Calabresi, confides to his fianc\u00e9e, Bianca Merusi, that he knows who broke into the Institute and why. He attempts to [[blackmail]] the individual, but the thief pushes him in front of an arriving train, killing him. A [[paparazzi]] photographer captures Calabresi's fall, but not the killer.\n\nReporter Carlo Giordani has been covering the break-in investigation and writes an article about Calabresi's death, including the photo.  Franco \"Cookie\" Arn\u00f2, a middle-aged [[blindness|blind]] man who was once an ace reporter, and his niece Lori visit Carlo after reading the article. Franco has a hunch that someone cropped the newspaper photo, and a call to the photographer confirms this. However, after they ask the photographer to print the entire picture, someone strangles him to death. The killer takes the photo and all the negatives before Carlo, Franco, and Lori arrive.\n\nCarlo, impressed with  Franco, lets him assist his investigation. Discussing the case, they observe nine leads: the five remaining Institute scientists (Mombelli, Esson, Casoni, Braun, and director Terzi), Terzi's daughter Anna, Bianca (Calabresi's fianc\u00e9e), the original break-in, and the missing photographs. They joke that the case is like a [[Cat o' nine tails]] and resolve to follow each lead.\n\nCarlo interviews Anna, who reveals that the institute has been researching \"[[XYY syndrome]].\" Their study suggests that people with the XYY chromosome have a \"criminal tendency.\" Meanwhile, Franco and Lori meet with Bianca, who provides no additional information, but Lori remarks to Franco that Bianca was nervously fingering a [[locket]] as she spoke.\n\nThat night, Bianca searches Calabresi's car and finds a note detailing the thief/killer's identity. She hides the note in her locket. Bianca returns to her apartment, where the killer strangles her. The killer searches her but cannot find the note, which is hidden in the locket.\n\nDespite receiving a threatening note from the killer, Carlo and Franco continue investigating. Carlo speaks with other Institute doctors. Dr. Mombelli  reveals that everyone at the Institute submitted blood samples to be tested for the XYY research. At the same time, Dr. Casoni speculates that testing for XYY may become a method for crime prevention. That night, Carlo and Franco both avoid separate attempts to kill them.\n\nFranco tells Carlo that Bianca must have died because the killer suspected she had evidence, and, remembering Lori mentioning Bianca's locket, he speculates the proof may be in the locket. They discover that Bianca got buried with the locket, so they go to her family crypt and search her [[coffin]]. Inside the locket, they find the folded note, but before they can read it, the killer shuts the crypt door, locking Carlo inside and attacking Franco outside. The killer takes the note, but Franco stabs him with his [[Swordstick|sword cane]], causing the killer to flee. The killer calls Franco and Carlo, revealing that he has kidnapped Lori and will kill her unless they stop investigating. Knowing that the killer will kill Lori regardless, they call the police.\n\nFranco, Carlo, and the police rush to the Terzi Institute to search for Lori, but they cannot find her. Carlo follows a trail of blood to the roof and finds Casoni, the killer, still bleeding from Franco's attack. Casoni prepares to stab a bound and gagged Lori, but Carlo leaps in front of her and gets stabbed in the shoulder. The police arrive on the roof and chase Casoni. Franco stops him with his cane blade; Casoni confesses that he initially broke in to replace the records that showed he tested positive for the XYY chromosome. When Franco asks about Lori, Casoni lies to Franco that he killed her. Enraged, Franco knocks him through a [[skylight]] and down an elevator shaft to his death as a now-free Lori calls out for Franco.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[James Franciscus]] as Carlo Giordani\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Franco \"Cookie\" Arn\u00f2\n* [[Catherine Spaak]] as Anna Terzi\n* [[Pier Paolo Capponi]] as Police Supt.
