The film had a cast including [[Kirk Douglas]] in a dual role as the brothers Harrison (a character who appeared frequently in Paterson's poems) and Spur, [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as [[Clancy of the Overflow|Clancy]], [[Tom Burlinson]] as Jim Craig, [[Sigrid Thornton]] as Harrison's daughter Jessica, [[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]] as Jim's father Henry Craig, and [[Chris Haywood]] as Curly. Both Burlinson and Thornton later reprised their roles in the 1988 sequel, ''[[The Man from Snowy River II]]'' (the film's original Australian title).  The 1988 sequel film was later released in the United States by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] under the title '''''Return to Snowy River''''' and in the United Kingdom under the title '''''The Untamed'''''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nWhen Jim Craig and his father Henry are discussing their finances, a herd of wild horses called the [[Brumby]] mob passes by, and Henry wants to shoot the black stallion leader, but Jim convinces his father to capture and sell them.\nJim and Henry are making a yard to trap the mob when they reappear and trample through the area. In the mayhem, the Craig's horse runs off with the mob and Henry is accidentally killed.\nBefore Jim can inherit the [[station (Australian agriculture)|station]], a group of mountain men tell him that he must first earn the right \u2013 and to do so he must go to the lowlands and work. Jim and his father's old friend, Spur, a one-legged miner, gives Jim a horse. Jim then gets a job on a station owned by Harrison, Spur's brother, on a recommendation by Harrison's friend, Andrew Patterson (a character based on the poet [[Banjo Patterson|A. B. (Banjo) Patterson)]]. Meanwhile, [[Clancy of the Overflow|Clancy]] appears at Spur's mine and the two discuss their pasts and futures. Clancy goes to Harrison's station to lead a cattle muster. At dinner, Harrison tells Clancy that \"he has no brother\" when referring to Spur.\n\nHarrison organises a round-up of his cattle, but Jim is not allowed to go. While the others are gone, Harrison's daughter Jessica asks Jim to help her break in a prize colt. The mob appears again, and Jim unsuccessfully gives chase to the valuable horse. When Harrison returns, he sends Jim to bring back 20 strays. Later, Harrison learns of Jim's actions and tells Jessica that Jim will be fired and that she will be sent to a women's college. Impulsively, she rides off into the mountains where she is caught in a storm.\n\nSpur, meanwhile, finally strikes a large [[gold]] deposit. Jim finds Jessica's horse and rescues her. She tells him that he's going to be fired, but he still leaves to return the cattle. Jessica is surprised at meeting Spur, her uncle, whom she had never been told about. She is also confused when Spur mistakes her for her dead mother and refuses to tell her anything about his past. After returning, Jessica learns that Spur and Harrison both fell in love with her mother, Matilda. Matilda declared that the first to make his fortune would be her husband. Spur went looking for gold, while Harrison bet his life savings on a horse race. Harrison became rich overnight when the horse he bet on won. Having made his fortune, Harrison wed Matilda, but she died while delivering Jessica. Harrison is grateful to Jim for returning his daughter, but he becomes angry when Jim says he loves her. As Jim leaves, a prized colt is let loose by a farmhand named Curly in the hope that Jim will be blamed.\n\nLater, while camping out, Spur tells Jim that he will inherit his father's share of the mine. Clancy joins them and informs them of the colt, but Jim refuses to retrieve the animal. Meanwhile, Harrison offers a reward of \u00a3100, attracting riders and fortune-hunters from every station in the area. Clancy does eventually show, accompanied by Jim, whom Harrison finally allows to join the hunt. Several riders have accidents in pursuit and even Clancy is unable to contain the Brumby mob. The riders give up when the mob descends a seemingly impassable grade. However, Jim goes forward and returns the horses to Harrison's farm. Harrison offers him the reward but he refuses. Having cleared his name, Jim would like to return some day for the horses and, looking at Jessica, \"anything else that's mine.\" He rides back up to the mountain country, knowing that he has earned his right to live there.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tom Burlinson]] as Jim Craig\n* [[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]] as Henry Craig\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Harrison / Spur\n* [[Tommy Dysart]] as Mountain Man\n* Bruce Kerr as Man in Street\n* David Bradshaw as [[Banjo Paterson]]\n* [[Sigrid Thornton]] as Jessica Harrison\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Clancy\n* [[Tony Bonner]] as Kane\n* [[June Jago]] as Mrs. Bailey\n* [[Chris Haywood]] as Curly\n* Kristopher Steele as Moss\n* [[Gus Mercurio]] as Frew\n* Howard Eynon as Shorry\n* [[Lorraine Bayly]] as Rosemary Hume\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Craig's Hut, 2007 (03).JPG|thumb|Craig's Hut undergoing reconstruction in 2007|alt=Craig's Hut undergoing reconstruction in 2007]]\nAccording to Geoff Burrowes, the idea to make the film came at a dinner party when someone suggested the poem would make a good movie. Burrowes developed a treatment with George Miller then hired John Dixon to write a screenplay. All three men had worked together in television; another former TV colleague, [[Simon Wincer]], became involved as executive producer with [[Michael Edgley]] and succeeded in raising the budget.<ref name=\"stratton2\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46456368 |title=Young actors tipped for plum roles |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |date=19 November 1980 |access-date=24 December 2015 |page=32 Supplement: TV Magazine |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213734281 |title=Ride the High Country |newspaper=[[Filmnews]] |location=Sydney |date=1 September 1982 |access-date=24 December 2015 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay contains numerous references to [[Banjo Paterson]], aside from using his poem \"[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]\" as the source material and his inclusion as a character in the film. For example, the numerous references to the late Matilda are likely a reference to the song \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", which was written by Paterson. In addition, the melody for \"Waltzing Matilda\" can be heard near the end of the film. A Bible passage from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:27, which talks about cattle, goats, and sheep is read aloud in a scene in the middle of the film.\n\nThe film was not shot in the actual [[Snowy Mountains]] but in the [[Victorian High Country]] near [[Mansfield, Victoria]], where Burrowes' wife's family had lived for several generations, which was logistically easier.<ref name=\"stratton2\" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46442295 |title=On the Set of ''The Man from Snowy River''|newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|date=6 May 1981|access-date=27 January 2020|page=16|via=[[Trove]]}}</ref> [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Robert Mitchum]] were considered for the dual role of Harrison and Spur before [[Kirk Douglas]] was cast in the roles.\n\n[[Tom Burlinson]] had ridden a horse only a few times before being cast in the film. He was taught to ride by mountain cattleman Charlie Lovick, who owned the buckskin horse Burlinson rode in the film. Gerald Egan doubled for Burlinson for several riding shots in the film, including the jump into the \"terrible descent\". Other moments in the film such as when Jim is thrown over the fence into the path of the brumbies were performed by professional stunt men. Nevertheless, Burlinson did much more of the action riding in the film than an actor normally would, including all the profile shots of the downhill ride.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|The Man from Snowy River (soundtrack)}}\n\n[[Bruce Rowland]] composed the music for both the film and the sequel. Clancy's theme is a derivative of the convict ballad [[Moreton Bay (song)|Moreton Bay]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film \"was released to a fair degree of critical acclaim\" and \"moviegoers found it to be a likable and highly entertaining piece of filmmaking that made no effort to hide its Australian roots, despite the presence of American star Kirk Douglas in one of the principal roles.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/manfromsnowyriver.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - the Man from Snowy River |access-date=2009-06-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103084339/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/manfromsnowyriver.php |archive-date=3 January 2009}}</ref> The film has a rating of 85% on film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Citation|title=The Man from Snowy River|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_from_snowy_river/|language=en|access-date=2017-09-29|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129081204/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_from_snowy_river/|archive-date=29 November 2017}}</ref> One reviewer commented: \"The Australian film industry has been responsible for many decent films for decades (and some utter crap, of course), but the percentage with international appeal is quite small.

Magnified by the wide screen, their every pant and whinny dignified by [[Dolby Stereo|Dolby Sound]],   the horses deliver the goods.
