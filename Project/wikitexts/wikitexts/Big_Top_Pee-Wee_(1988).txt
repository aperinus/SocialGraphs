A [[stand-alone sequel]] to ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), the film stars [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]] with [[Susan Tyrrell]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]], and [[Valeria Golino]] in supporting roles. The original [[Film score|music score]] is composed by [[Danny Elfman]] (although he also scored ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'', he could not use any themes from that film due to contractual restrictions). It was released on July 22, 1988, and grossed $15 million against a $20 million dollar budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Pee-wee Herman]] dreams of being a famous singer. He awakens and goes to work on his farm with Vance the pig. Later, he has lunch with his fianc\u00e9e, school teacher Winnie Johnson. Next, he races Vance to a general store owned by Mr. Ryan to order a sandwich. There, the local [[Sheriff]] warns everyone of a large storm approaching town.\n\nAfter the storm ends, Pee-wee emerges from his storm shelter to discover that an entire traveling circus has been blown into his backyard. Befriended by Cabrini Circus ringmaster Mace Montana, Pee-wee hopes to impress Gina Piccolapupula, a trapeze artist and the circus' star attraction, thereby incurring the jealousy of his relationship with Winnie until she meets Gina's older brothers, the Piccolapupula Brothers. Gina leaves Pee-wee when she finds out about Winnie, but later returns to him when she realizes that Pee-wee actually loves her after calling off his engagement with Winnie.\n\nPee-wee wants to join the circus, but his attempts fail. Gina then tells Pee-wee about her deceased father Papa Piccolapupula who was a famous aerialist who suffered a fall performing the Spiral of Death. Gina states that Pee-wee should try walking the tightrope in his honor. Mace comes up with a brilliant idea: to stage a three-ring spectacular saluting the American Farm. However, most of the town's residents are elderly people who have been demanding the circus leave town.\n\nThe Sheriff and Mr. Ryan lead the elderly townspeople as the Sheriff attempts to arrest Pee-wee. The Sheriff promises to dismiss the charges if the circus leaves town. While the circus is packing, Mace tells Pee-wee they will do the circus elsewhere to prevent Pee-wee from being charged. Pee-wee saves the day when he sneaks modified cocktail weenies from his hot dog tree to the townspeople, causing them to become children once again.\n\nWithout any memories of what happened, the children attend Mace's circus and watch Pee-wee perform.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]]\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Mace Montana\n* [[Susan Tyrrell]] as Midge Montana\n* [[Valeria Golino]] as Gina Piccolapupula\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Winnie Johnson\n* [[Wayne White (artist)|Wayne White]] as the voice of Vance\n* [[Albert Henderson (actor)|Albert Henderson]] as Mr. Ryan\n** Kevin B.
