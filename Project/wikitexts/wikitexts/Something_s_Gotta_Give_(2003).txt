It stars [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Diane Keaton]] as a successful 60-something and 50-something, who find love for each other in later life, despite being complete opposites. [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Amanda Peet]] co-star, with [[Frances McDormand]], [[Paul Michael Glaser]], [[Jon Favreau]], and [[KaDee Strickland]] playing key supporting roles.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, and was a box office hit, grossing $266 million worldwide. For her performance Keaton received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]], while Nicholson received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHarry Sanborn is a wealthy [[New York City|New York]] [[record company]] owner who only dates women under 30, including his latest girlfriend, Marin Klein. The two drive to her mother's [[Hamptons]] beach house expecting to be alone. However, her mother, a [[playwright]] named Erica Barry, and Erica's sister Zoe, unexpectedly arrive.\n\nAfter an awkward dinner, the night turns disastrous when\u2014during [[foreplay]] with Marin\u2014Harry has a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and is rushed to a hospital. The attending doctor, Julian Mercer, tells Harry to stay nearby for a few days, so Harry reluctantly stays with Erica. Their personalities clash and create awkward living arrangements at first, but they soon find charming qualities in each other and begin to form a connection. Harry's relationship with her daughter and Erica's budding relationship with Julian become obstacles to their growing attraction. Marin tells her mother that she will break up with Harry, but he ends things first. Harry and Erica spend more time together and eventually have sex. Julian tells Harry he has improved enough to return to the city. He and Erica share an awkward goodbye, as despite their strong feelings, Harry is clearly hesitant to enter into a serious relationship.\n\nMarin receives news that her father and Erica's ex-husband, Dave Klein, is getting remarried to a doctor who is only two years older than her. Though Erica is unaffected by the news, Marin is devastated and pressures her mother into accompanying her to a dinner. At dinner, Erica sees Harry at another table with another, much younger woman. An argument follows and Erica admits that she is in love with Harry, but he does not reciprocate, so she ends things between them and leaves. Harry suffers from what he believes is another heart attack but in the emergency room he is told it was a [[panic attack]].\n\nDevastated, Erica returns home where she cries almost nonstop for several weeks, pouring her heartbreak into a new play about a woman who falls in love with her daughter's boyfriend, titling it \"A Woman to Love,\" a phrase Harry had used to describe Erica. Harry hears about the play and rushes to the theater where it is being rehearsed. Despite her denials, it is obvious that she has used the most personal details of their affair in the play. When he tells her he still cares about her, Erica rebuffs him. After learning his character dies in the play, he suffers another panic attack. At the hospital, he is told he needs to de-stress and he relocates temporarily to the [[Bahamas]].\n\nSix months later, Erica's play is a huge success. Harry pays Marin a visit to apologize for any past disrespect and discovers he never did and that she is now happily married and pregnant. Marin informs Harry that Erica is in [[Paris]] celebrating her birthday. Harry flies to Paris and surprises Erica at her favorite restaurant. He tells Erica that he has been reaching out to all the young women he had affairs with in an attempt to atone for his heartless behavior. Julian, whom Erica is now dating, appears.\n\nHarry, Erica and Julian have dinner together, and part amicably outside the restaurant. While Harry gazes in heartache over the river [[Seine]], Erica arrives. She tells him that Julian realized she still loves Harry and decided to step aside to let them be together. Harry tells her that at age 63, he's in love for the first time in his life, and they embrace.\n\nA year later at a restaurant, Erica and Harry, now married, are out with Marin, her husband Danny and their new baby daughter, celebrating life as a loving family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Harry Sanborn, a 63-year-old, self-satisfied [[wikt:playboy|playboy]] and [[socialite]] who owns ten companies, including a [[magazine]] and the second-largest [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] label in the world.

The site's critics consensus reads: \"Though it occasionally stumbles into sitcom territory, ''Something's Gotta Give'' is mostly a smart, funny romantic comedy, with sharp performances from Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, and Keanu Reeves.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/somethings_gotta_give|title=Something's Gotta Give (2003)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Something's Gotta Give Reviews|url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/somethings-gotta-give |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"A\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]], writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', felt the performances of the film's stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, were among their best, and that Nicholson's acting, as his role covered a wider range of emotions, was the more complex.<ref name=\"sfchronicle\" /> The reviewer praised the film for being a romantic comedy for adults:\n{{blockquote|The adult romance is a dying genre in our era, but movies as wise and fun as ''Something's Gotta Give'' have always been rare.

Although noting that [[Keanu Reeves]]'s role \"seems like nothing more than a walking plot complication\", he praises the performances of Keaton and Nicholson: \"A movie like this depends crucially on its stars. To complain that Nicholson is playing \"himself\" \u2013 or that Keaton is also playing a character very much like her public persona \u2013 is missing the point. Part of the appeal depends on the movie's teasing confusion of reality and fiction.\"<ref name=rogerebert>{{cite web |date= December 12, 2003 |first= Roger |last= Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert|title= Something's Gotta Give |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/somethings-gotta-give-2003 |publisher= RogerEbert.com |access-date=November 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+ style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Awards\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipients\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n|-\n| [[76th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]\n| [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Art Directors Guild]]\n| [[Art Directors Guild|Excellence in Production Design: Feature Film \u2013 Contemporary Film]]\n| Jon Hutman (production designer), John Warnke (art director), Steven Graham (art director), Ashley Burnham (assistant art director), Hinju Kim (assistant art director)<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Something's Gotta Give - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/awards|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Casting Society of America|Artios Awards]]\n| [[Casting Society of America|Best Casting for Feature Film, Comedy]]\n| [[Jane Jenkins]]<br />[[Janet Hirshenson]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]]\n| [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[61st Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]]\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]\n| [[Jack Nicholson]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]\n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Award]]s\n| [[Golden Reel Award (Motion Picture Sound Editors)|Best Sound Editing in a Feature: Music, Feature Film]]\n| Andrew Silver (music editor/scoring editor), Kenneth Karman (music editor), Lee Scott (music editor)<ref name=\":0\" />\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Awards]]\n| [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards\n| Best Actress\n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Satellite Awards]]\n| [[Satellite Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture]]  \n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[10th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Awards]]\n| [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]]  \n| [[Diane Keaton]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Washington D.C.
