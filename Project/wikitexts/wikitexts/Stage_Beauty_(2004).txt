The screenplay by [[Jeffrey Hatcher]] is based on his play ''Compleat Female Stage Beauty'', which was inspired by references to 17th-century actor [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] made in the detailed private diary kept by [[Samuel Pepys]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Ned Kynaston]] ([[Billy Crudup]]) is one of the leading actors of his day, particularly famous for his portrayal of female characters, predominantly [[Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]''. His [[Dresser (theatre)|dresser]], Maria ([[Claire Danes]]), aspires to perform in the legitimate theatre but is forbidden because of a law, at that  time in effect, forbidding theatres to employ actresses. This law was enacted by the [[Puritan]]s prior to the restoration of the [[House of Stuart]]. Instead, she appears in productions at a local tavern under the pseudonym [[Margaret Hughes]]. Her popularity is aided by the novelty of a woman acting in public, which attracts the attention of Sir [[Charles Sedley]] ([[Richard Griffiths]]), who offers his patronage. Eventually, she is presented to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ([[Rupert Everett]]).\n\n[[Nell Gwynn]] ([[Zo\u00eb Tapper]]), an aspiring actress and Charles II's mistress, comes upon Kynaston ranting about women on stage and seduces Charles II into banning men from playing female roles.<ref>In actuality, it was not that men were banned but that women were allowed on stage. \"Women as actresses\" (PDF). Notes and Queries. ''The New York Times''. 18 October 1885. Archived from the original on 27 April 2009. Retrieved 2009-03-14. \"There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage. Charles II must have brought the usage from the Continent, where women had long been employed instead of boys or youths in the representation of female characters.\"</ref> Kynaston, having gone through a long and strenuous training to play female roles, finds himself without a guise by which to keep the attention of his lover, [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]] ([[Ben Chaplin]]), the [[Duke of Buckingham]], as the latter never had intentions to lead a homosexual life and Kynaston has lost the acceptance of London society which had started to circulate rumors about their association. He is reduced to performing bawdy songs in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] in music halls, while Maria's career thrives, although her ability to emulate Kynaston falls short because, as she says, Kynaston never fights as a woman would do.\n\nCalled upon for a royal performance, Maria panics and her friends implore Kynaston for coaching, during which she coaches him to develop his ability to regain a theatrical career in male roles. He agrees, with the proviso that he replace the company head Thomas Betterton in the role of [[Othello (character)|Othello]]. Maria becomes a theatrical star.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Ned Kynaston]]\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Maria / [[Margaret Hughes]]\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[Thomas Betterton]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]\n* [[Zo\u00eb Tapper]] as [[Nell Gwynn]]\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as [[Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet|Sir Charles Sedley]]\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as [[Samuel Pepys]]\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Sir [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Miss Frayne\n* [[Stephen Marcus]] as Thomas Cockerell\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Sir [[Peter Lely]]\n\n==Production==\nWhile the film is rooted in historical fact \u2013 the first English theatre actress, although her name is unknown, is believed to have performed the role of Desdemona<ref>\"English Renaissance and Restoration Theatre\" by Peter Thomson, ''The Oxford Illustrated Guide to Theatre'', edited by John Rusell Brown, Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> \u2013 some liberties with the truth were taken. Nell Gwynne is represented as a mistress of the King who subsequently becomes an actress, but in reality she already was a noted theatre personality when Charles II met her. The sequence in which Maria and Kynaston discover [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic acting]] is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], as naturalism was not developed until the 19th century.\n\nInteriors were filmed at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]] and [[Shepperton Studios]] in Surrey. According to commentary by [[production designer]] Jim Clay on the DVD release of the film, because so little [[English Restoration]] architecture remains in London, and documentation of the period is minimal, he was required to use his imagination in creating buildings and back alleys on [[sound stage]]s.\n\nIn the [[audio commentary|DVD commentary]], several cast members recall the film was shot during the hottest UK summer on record (2003), and the temperature under the lights usually hovered at 46&nbsp;\u00b0C (115&nbsp;\u00b0F), making performing in the heavy, layered costumes a grueling experience.\n\nThe Costumes were designed by [[Tim Hatley]]. Twelve costume houses were involved in the production, including [[The Royal Shakespeare Company]], The National Theater, and Angels & Bermans, as well as the Italian houses Sartoria Farani, [[Tirelli Costumi|Tirelli]], [[Costumi d'Arte]], E. Rancati, G.P. 11, and [[L.C.P. di Pompei|Pompei]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in May 2004 prior to its general release in the UK. It was shown at the [[Deauville Film Festival]], the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France before opening in New York City.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\nOn review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 128 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Uneven but enjoyable, ''Stage Beauty'' uses historical events as the springboard for a well-acted romance with a charming Shakespearean spin.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stage_beauty |title=Stage Beauty (2019)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 8, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/stage-beauty |title=Stage Beauty Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott]] said, \"At times, the movie feels like a fancy-dress version of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''&nbsp;... Mr. Crudup's fine features, which flicker between masculine and feminine as the lighting changes and the mood shifts, are well suited for the role, though his sinewy, birdlike frame suggests Hollywood [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] more than Restoration curviness&nbsp; ... ''Stage Beauty'' is both timorous and ungainly, words that might also describe Ms. Danes's performance. Trapped in an English accent and in a character who must appear conniving and warmhearted in turn, she veers from teariness to brisk indignation like an [[Emma Thompson]] doll with a jammed switch. The British actors in smaller roles handle the material better&nbsp;... George Fenton's Sunday-brunch score, on the other hand, is an indigestible dose of good taste ladled heavily over even the film's witty and delicate moments.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2004/10/08/movies/08STAG.html|title=Upstaged by the King, an Actor in Drag Straightens Out|date=8 October 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Scott|first=A.

In a delicately measured performance that favors graceful subtlety over campy mannerism, Crudup conveys a nuanced sense of a man struggling to know himself&nbsp;... Put in the unenviable position of playing second fiddle to her male co-star in terms of feminine allure, Danes is lovely nonetheless&nbsp;... George Fenton's rich orchestral score enlivens the action with an occasional rousing [[Celtic music|Celtic]] flavor.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117923780.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|title=Stage Beauty|date=9 May 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Rooney|first=David}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] rated the film three out of a possible four stars and called it \"bawdy fun&nbsp;... the gender role-playing puts spine in this period piece that is vital to the here and now.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6139158/review/6552268/stage_beauty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709020810/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6139158/review/6552268/stage_beauty|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 July 2007|title=Stage Beauty|date=6 October 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|last=Travers|first=Peter}}</ref>\n\nCarla Meyer of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said, \"The film rarely matches Crudup's performance, appearing confused itself about whether it's farce or drama.

''Stage Beauty'' might be called the spawn of ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', and, unfortunately, this is a ''Shakespeare'' that lacks the graceful spirit and breathless narrative drive of its [[progenitor]].\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/?041011crci_cinema|title=Playing Parts|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|last=Denby|first=David}}</ref>\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the film C+ and described it as \"an odd amalgam of high spirits, lively ambition, and botched execution.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,710529,00.html|title=Stage Beauty (2004)|date=6 October 2004|accessdate=6 August 2009|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film won the [[Cambridge Film Festival]] Audience Award for Best Film, was cited by the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]] for Excellence in Filmmaking, and was named the Overlooked Film of the Year by the Phoenix Film Critics Society.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0368658|Stage Beauty}}\n* {{mojo title|stagebeauty|Stage Beauty}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|stage_beauty|Stage Beauty}}\n\n{{Richard Eyre}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical films]]\n[[Category:2004 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:BBC Film films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about actors]]\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related films]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Fenton]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert De Niro]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Eyre]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1660s]]\n[[Category:German romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:German films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Qwerty Films films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Charles II of England]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Nell Gwyn]]\n[[Category:German LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:German biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
