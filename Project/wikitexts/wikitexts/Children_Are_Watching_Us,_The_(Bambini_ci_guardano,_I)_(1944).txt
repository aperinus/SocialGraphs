His mother, Nina, takes him to a local park where he enjoys his time out while watching a puppet show, but is also concerned with a handsome lover named Roberto (with whom Nina has shared a past romance) courting his mother while he is assumed to not be paying attention.  As the boy returns home, the family has dinner while Pric\u00f2 reflects on his day in the park.  Later that night, after his mother puts him to bed, she runs off with the stranger, leaving Pric\u00f2's father distressed at the idea of having to raise his son himself.  While their neighbors share a number of rumors concerning the disappearance of Nina, it is quickly agreed that she ran off with another man.  While concerned with her disappearance, Nina quickly returns to the home after a few days for the sake of their son.  While the father, Andrea, is not entirely pleased with this arrangement, he relents so that his son may grow up in the same house as his mother.\n\nTo distance herself from Roberto, Nina and Andrea agree to go on vacation with their son to a nearby beach hotel.  The vacation occupies their time, seemingly happy with the prospect of a reunion.  After Andrea says that he must go back home to his job, he suggests that Nina stay with Pric\u00f2 a few extra days that they may enjoy their time.  After leaving, Nina is again pursued by Roberto who shows up unexpectedly at a hotel dance, at first successfully keeping him away.  But after yielding to him once again, Pric\u00f2 is dismayed by her lack of faith.  After Pric\u00f2 runs away, he is eventually brought back by the police officers while the hotel residents quickly start their own rumors as to the cause of his departing.\n\nAfter Pric\u00f2 and his mother return to their home town, Nina tells him outside their home to go on up and that she'll be up after going on an errand.  When Pric\u00f2 goes to see his father upstairs, he and his father realize the truth of why Nina is not there.  Again distressed at the elopement of his wife, Andrea enrolls Pric\u00f2 in a boarding school.  While his son is away, Andrea kills himself in despair.  When Pric\u00f2 is told of the death at the school, both his mother and faithful maid are there to comfort him.  Though very young, Pric\u00f2 understands the nature of his mother, refusing to go to her for comfort in favor of his maid.  The film ends with Pric\u00f2 walking off, refusing to acknowledge his mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emilio Cigoli]] - Andrea - il padre\n* [[Giovanna Cigoli]] - Agnese - la governante\n* [[Olinto Cristina]] - Il rettore - The Chancellor\n* [[Luciano De Ambrosis]] - Pric\u00f2\n* [[Jone Frigerio]] - La nonna (as Ione Frigerio)\n* [[Mario Gallina]] - Il medico\n* [[Maria Gardena]] - La signora Uberti\n* [[Zaira La Fratta]] - Paolina\n* [[Armando Migliari]] - Il commendatore\n* [[Guido Morisi]] - Gigi Sbarlani\n* [[Nicoletta Parodi]] - Giuliana\n* [[Dina Perbellini]] - Zia Berelli\n* [[Isa Pola]] - Nina - la madre\n* [[Adriano Rimoldi]] - Roberto - l'amante di Nina\n* [[Tecla Scarano]] - La signora Resta (Mrs. Resta)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0034493}}\n* {{Amg movie|9253|The Children Are Watching Us}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/575-the-children-are-watching-us-a-movement-is-born ''The Children Are Watching Us: A Movement Is Born''] an essay by [[Peter Brunette]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Vittorio De Sica}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Children Are Watching Us, The}}\n[[Category:1943 films]]\n[[Category:1943 drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1940s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about suicide]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Vittorio De Sica]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Cesare Zavattini]]\n[[Category:Italian drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Renzo Rossellini]]\n[[Category:1940s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
