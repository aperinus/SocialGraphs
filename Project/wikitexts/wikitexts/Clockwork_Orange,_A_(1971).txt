Please do not add sub-genres without discussion there.--> adapted, produced, and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on [[Anthony Burgess]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|1962 novel of the same name]]. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on [[psychiatry]], [[juvenile delinquency]], youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.\n\n[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent <!-- See section below #Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel for discussion about last name -->whose interests include [[classical music]] (especially [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), committing rape, theft, and ultra-violence. He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete ([[Michael Tarn]]), Georgie ([[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]]), and Dim ([[Warren Clarke]]), whom he calls his ''droogs'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, which is \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior ([[Anthony Sharp]]). Alex narrates most of the film in [[Nadsat]], a fractured adolescent slang composed of [[Slavic languages]] (especially Russian), English, and [[Rhyming slang|Cockney rhyming slang]].\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on 19 December 1971 and was released in the United Kingdom on 13 January 1972. The film was met with polarised reviews from critics and was controversial due to its depictions of graphic violence. After it was cited as having inspired copycat acts of violence, the film was withdrawn from British cinemas at Kubrick's behest, and it was also banned in several other countries. In the years following, the film underwent a critical re-evaluation and gained a [[cult following]]. It received several awards and nominations, including four nominations at the [[44th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nIn 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per Film project guidelines, please keep this plot section between 400 and 700 words long. -->\n[[File:Stanley Kubrick The Exhibition - LACMA - A Clockwork Orange - Korova Milk Bar (8998526527).jpg|thumb|right|[[Human furniture]] from the Korova milk bar, where the \"milk-plus\" was served]]\nIn a futuristic Britain, [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex DeLarge]] is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer Frank Alexander and trick his wife into letting them inside. They beat Alexander to the point of crippling him, and Alex violently rapes Alexander's wife while singing \"[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]\". The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer, PR Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning Alex and leaving him to be arrested. Deltoid brings word that the woman has died of her injuries, and Alex is convicted of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new [[Ludovico technique]], an experimental [[aversion therapy]] for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is released from prison, only to find that [[Civil recovery|the police have sold his possessions to provide compensation to his victims]] and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who is now using a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted his wife and him. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.\n\nAlex survives the attempt and wakes up in hospital with multiple injuries. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of goodwill, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malcolm McDowell Clockwork Orange.png|thumb|Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge.]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex DeLarge]]\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as Frank Alexander\n* [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Chief Guard Barnes\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Dim\n* [[John Clive]] as Stage Actor\n* [[Adrienne Corri]] as Mary Alexander\n* [[Carl Duering]] as Dr Brodsky\n* [[Paul Farrell]] as Tramp\n* [[Clive Francis]] as Joe the Lodger\n* [[Michael Gover]] as Prison Governor\n* [[Miriam Karlin]] as \"Catlady\" Weathers\n* [[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]] as Georgie\n* [[Aubrey Morris]] as P.

It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.\"\n\nAfter aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, though not through choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange\u2014organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. After Alex has undergone the Ludovico technique, the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false, arguing that true goodness ''must'' come from within. This leads to the theme of abusing liberties\u2014personal, governmental, civil\u2014by Alex, with two conflicting political forces, the Government and the Dissidents, both manipulating Alex purely for their own political ends.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Books of The Times |date=19 March 1963 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202042027/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The story portrays the \"conservative\" and \"leftist\" parties as equally worthy of criticism. The writer Frank Alexander, a victim of Alex and his gang, wants revenge against Alex and sees him as a means of definitively turning the populace against the incumbent government and its new regime. He fears the new government and in a telephone conversation, he says: \"Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of [[totalitarianism]].\"\n\nOn the other side, the Minister of the Interior (the Government) jails Mr Alexander (the Dissident Intellectual) on the excuse of his endangering Alex (the People), rather than the government's totalitarian regime (described by Mr Alexander). It is unclear whether or not he has been harmed; however, the Minister tells Alex that the writer has been denied the ability to write and produce \"subversive\" material that is critical of the incumbent government and meant to provoke political unrest.\n\n===Psychology===\n[[File:LudovicoMalcolmMcDowellAClockworkOrangetrailer.png|thumb|Ludovico technique apparatus]]\nThe film critiques the [[behaviourism]] or \"behavioural psychology\" propounded by psychologists [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' (1971) \"one of the most dangerous books ever written\". Although behaviourism's limitations were conceded by its principal founder, Watson, Skinner argued that [[behaviour modification]]\u2014specifically, [[operant conditioning]] (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the [[Classical conditioning|\"classical\" Watsonian conditioning]]\u2014is the key to an ideal society. The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived as a parody of [[aversion therapy]], which is a form of classical conditioning.<ref>{{cite web |author=Theodore Dalrymple |title=A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | work=City Journal |date=1 January 2006 |access-date=13 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170544/http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | archive-date=1 February 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Paul Duncan said: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images. The implication is that all of the images, both real and imagined, are part of Alex's fantasies.\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=142}}\n\nPsychiatrist Aaron Stern, the former head of the MPAA rating board, believed that Alex represents man in his natural state, the unconscious mind. Alex becomes \"civilised\" after receiving his Ludovico \"cure\" and the sickness in the aftermath Stern considered to be the \"neurosis imposed by society\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=128}}\n\nKubrick told film critics Philip Strick and [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]]: \"Alex makes no attempt to deceive himself or the audience as to his total corruption or wickedness. He is the very personification of evil. On the other hand, he has winning qualities: his total candour, his wit, his intelligence, and his energy; these are attractive qualities and ones, I might add, which he shares with [[Richard III (play)#Richard as anti-hero|Richard III]].\"{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=129}}\n\n=== Society ===\nThe society depicted in the film was perceived by some as Communist (as [[Michel Ciment]] pointed out in an interview with Kubrick) due to its slight ties to Russian culture. The teenage slang has a heavily Russian influence, as in the novel; Burgess explains the slang as being, in part, intended to draw a reader into the world of the book's characters and to prevent the book from becoming outdated. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one or perhaps a society evolving from a failed socialism into an authoritarian society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and the film shows a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed municipal architecture and the name \"Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North\" alludes to socialist-style housing.<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork\">[[A Clockwork Orange (film)#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417145347/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html|date=17 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Sprach\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |last1=Zicari |first1=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to what kind of society it is. Kubrick asserted that the film held comparisons between both  ends of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated: \"The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left... They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.\"<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork\"/>\n\n==Production==\nAnthony Burgess sold the film rights of his novel for {{US$|500|1962|round=-2}}, shortly after its publication in 1962.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54041|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog - A Clockwork Orange|work=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=27 November 2020|archive-date=27 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027031942/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54041|url-status=live}}</ref> Originally, the film was projected to star the rock band [[The Rolling Stones]], with the band's lead singer [[Mick Jagger]] expressing interest in playing the lead role of Alex, and British filmmaker [[Ken Russell]] attached to direct.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> However, this never came to fruition due to problems with the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC), and the rights ultimately fell to Kubrick.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\nMcDowell was chosen for the role of Alex after Kubrick saw him in the film ''[[if....]]'' (1968).

Kubrick's wife, in an interview, said she had given Kubrick the novel after having read it. Kubrick said: \"I was excited by everything about it: the plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level.\" Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying: \"I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The ACO Controversy in the UK |website=Visual-memory.co.uk |access-date=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910035527/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |archive-date=10 September 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which omitted the final chapter.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\n===Direction===\n[[File:Thamesmead Housing Estate 01.jpg|thumb|Thamesmead South Housing Estate where Alex knocks his rebellious droogs into the lake]]\nKubrick was a perfectionist who researched meticulously, with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations, and many scene takes.

He praised it as so \"brilliant\" that it might be dangerous. He was concerned that it lacked the novel's [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter in the US|redemptive final chapter]], an absence he blamed upon his American publisher and not Kubrick. All US editions of the novel prior to 1986 omit the final chapter. Kubrick called the missing chapter \"an extra chapter\" and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never seriously considered using it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ciment |first=Michel |year=1981 |title=Kubrick on ''A Clockwork Orange'' |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224095523/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |archive-date=24 December 2012 |access-date=14 April 2016 |website=The Kubrick Site}}</ref> In Kubrick's opinion \u2013 as in the opinion of other readers, including the original American editor \u2013 the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web |last1=Zicari |first1=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |archive-date=15 June 2018 |access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nBurgess reports in his autobiography ''You've Had Your Time''&nbsp;(1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's novel ''[[Napoleon Symphony]]'' (1974) was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A [[lapsed Catholic]], Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organisations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf. He was in no way involved in the production of the film. The only profit he made directly from the film was the initial $500 that had been given to him for the rights to the adaptation.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nBurgess's own stage adaptation of the novel, ''A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music'' (1984), contains a direct reference to Kubrick. In the final moment of the play Alex joins in a song with the other characters. In the script's stage directions it states that while this happens: \"A man bearded like Stanley Kubrick comes on playing, in exquisite counterpoint, '[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin\u2019 in the Rain]]' on the trumpet.

relatively faithful to the Burgess novel, omitting only the final, positive chapter, in which Alex matures and outgrows sociopathy. While the film ends with Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with Alex's positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay on the novel's American edition, in which the final chapter had been deleted on the insistence of its American publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 | website=Visual-memory.co.uk| access-date=1 May 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21| archive-date=18 August 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> He claimed not to have read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of ''A Clockwork Orange'' says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.\n* Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a shambolic state of desperation, whereas the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed |first=Randy |last=Rasmussen |page=112}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2021}}</ref><br />One example of this would be differences in the portrayal of P. R. Deltoid, Alex's \"post-corrective advisor\". In the novel, P. R. Deltoid appears to have some [[moral authority]] (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime, despite his protests). In the film, Deltoid is slightly sadistic and seems to have a sexual interest in Alex, interviewing him in his parents' bedroom and smacking him in the crotch.\n* In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick |first=John |last=Baxter |page=255}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2021}}</ref>\n* In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through several careless references to the previous attack (such as his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too \"stiff\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick |first=Vincent |last=LoBrutto |pages=365\u2013366}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2021}} and {{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick, director |author1=Alexander Walker |author2=Sybil Taylor |author3=Ulrich Ruchti |page=204}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn the US the film has been widely available on home video since 1980 and was re-released several times on [[VHS]].
