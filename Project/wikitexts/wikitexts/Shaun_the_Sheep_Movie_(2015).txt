''Shaun the Sheep Movie'' was nominated at the [[88th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] but lost to [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''. It was nominated in The [[73rd Golden Globe Awards]], [[BAFTA Awards]] and won in the [[Toronto Film Critics Awards]] for [[Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]]. It earned five nominations at the [[Annie Awards]] including Best Animated Feature. A stand-alone sequel entitled ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]'' was released on 18 October 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the section must from 400 to 700 words only. Shorten if beyond limit, and please keep this message for new editors. -->\nShaun, a mischievous sheep living with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, is bored with the routine of life on the farm. He concocts a plan to have a day off by tricking the farmer into going back to sleep by counting his sheep repeatedly. However, the [[Caravan (trailer)|caravan]] in which they put the farmer to bed accidentally rolls away, taking him into the city. Bitzer, the farmer's dog, chases after him. The farmer receives a blow to the head and is taken to a hospital, where he is diagnosed with [[amnesia]] before leaving. He wanders into a [[hair salon]] and, acting on a vague recollection of shearing his sheep, cuts a celebrity's hair. The celebrity loves the result and the farmer gains popularity as a hair stylist called \"Mr. X\".\n\nMeanwhile, the sheep find life impossible without the farmer, so Shaun sneaks onto a [[bus]] to the city; to his surprise, the rest of the flock follow him on another bus. They disguise themselves as people and begin looking for the farmer, but Shaun is captured by Trumper, an overzealous [[animal control service|animal control]] worker. Shaun is reunited with Bitzer in the animal lock-up, and with the help of a homeless dog named Slip, they manage to escape while imprisoning Trumper. They find the farmer, but he does not recognise them, much to their dismay.\n\nShaun, Bitzer, and the flock take refuge in a dark alleyway when they find evidence of the farmer's [[memory loss]], lifting their spirits. They devise a plan which involves putting the farmer to sleep again, returning him to the trailer on a [[pantomime]] horse (really the flock of sheep in an elaborate disguise), and hooking the trailer up to a bus returning to Mossy Bottom. The plan is initially successful, but they are pursued by Trumper (having escaped the lock-up), who is now intent on killing them outright.\n\nAt the farm, the group hides in a [[shed]]. The insane Trumper, using the farmer's [[tractor]], tries to push the shed into a nearby [[rock (geology)|rock]] [[quarry]]. The farmer wakes up, regains his memory, and Trumper is defeated through teamwork. Slip leaves, but is adopted by a bus driver who finds her on the road. The farmer and the animals have a renewed appreciation for each other, and the next day the farmer cancels the day's routine activities for an official day off. Epilogues show that the animal-control service is turned into an [[animal shelter|animal protection]] centre, and Trumper finds work wearing a chicken suit to promote a restaurant.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credit scene]], the Farmer sees a news report detailing some of the mayhem he slept through during his rescue from the city, much to his and the animals' shock.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the rooster who had been holding the sign at the beginning of the film carries a sign that says \"The End\" and then turns it and it says \u201cGo home.\u201d The rooster then leaves the room. One of the flock then enters the room with a vacuum cleaner, and begins to clean.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Omid Djalili 2010 Tribeca TFF Shankbone.jpg\n | width1= 1679 | height1 = 2176\n | alt1 = Omid Djalili\n | image2 =\n | width2= 2384 | height2 = 1982\n | alt2 = Trumper\n | footer = [[Omid Djalili]] voiced Trumper.\n}}\nSource of character names unless otherwise noted:<ref name=BFIShaunMovie />\n*[[Justin Fletcher]] as Shaun, a sheep who acts as leader of the flock\n**Fletcher also voices Timmy, a lamb who admires Shaun\n*[[John Sparkes]] as The Farmer\n**Sparkes also voices Bitzer, a dog who assists the Farmer\n*[[Omid Djalili]] as Trumper, an Animal Containment worker\n*[[Kate Harbour]] as Timmy's Mum\n**Harbour also voices Merly, a worker at the hairdressers shop\n*Richard Webber as Shirley, a big sheep\n*Tim Hands as Slip, a homeless [[dog]] \n*[[Simon Greenall]] as the twins, two sheep\n*[[Emma Tate (actress)|Emma Tate]] as Hazel, a member of the flock\n*Henry Burton as a junior doctor\n**Burton also voices an Animal containment visitor\n*Dhimant Vyas as a hospital consultant\n*Sophie Laughton as an Animal containment visitor\n*Nia Medi James as an operatic sheep\n*Sean Connolly as Stylists\n**Connolly also plays the Maitre D, Golfer, Angry Panto Horse and Hospital Characters\n*[[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]] as Bus Station Announcer and Hospital Announcer\n*[[Andy Nyman]] as Nuts,<ref name=BFIShaunMovie /> a sheep with strange eyes\n*Jack Paulson as a celebrity with hair trouble\n*[[Nick Park]] as himself (cameo)\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Mark Burton and Richard Starzak, Shaun the Sheep Movie, SFFS 2015-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]] and [[Richard Starzak]], directors and writers of the film, at the [[San Francisco Film Society]]]]\nThe film was in development by January 2011, with a plan to release the film in 2013/2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12299286|title=Aardman Animations plan new Shaun the Sheep film|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 January 2011|access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> Directors Burton and Starzak said they wanted to \"take the sheep out of their comfort zone,\" which resulted in having the story set in a city.<ref name=fmyth>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Luke|title=Interview: Mark Burton and Richard Starzack talk Shaun the Sheep Movie|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/02/interview-mark-burton-and-richard-starzack-talk-shaun-the-sheep-movie/|website=Flickering Myth|date=6 February 2015|access-date=13 November 2017}}</ref> In adapting the television shorts to feature length, the directors sought to give the characters \"an emotional life,\" with Burton noting, \"If you get that right, the audience is going to root for those characters [and] laugh more.\"<ref name=fmyth />\n\nThe film, in keeping with the TV shorts, is largely silent.
