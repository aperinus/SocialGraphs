It is the sequel to 1980's ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', and the second installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|franchise]]. [[Adrienne King]], [[Betsy Palmer]] and [[Walt Gorney]] reprise their respective roles from the first film as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]], [[Pamela Voorhees]], and [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Crazy Ralph|Crazy Ralph]]. [[Amy Steel]] and [[John Furey]] also star. Taking place five years after the first film, ''Part 2'' follows a similar premise, with an unknown stalker killing a group of camp counselors at a training camp near Crystal Lake. The film marks the debut of [[Jason Voorhees]] as the series' main antagonist.\n\nOriginally, ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' was intended to be an [[anthology film]] based on the [[Friday the 13th|Friday the 13th superstition]]. However, after the popularity of the original film's surprise ending, the filmmakers opted to continue the story and mythology surrounding Camp Crystal Lake, a trend which would be repeated in every film in the franchise.\n\nLike the original film, ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' faced opposition from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], who noted its \"accumulative violence\" as problematic, resulting in numerous cuts being made to allow an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R]] rating. The film opened theatrically on May 1 in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco on May 1, 1981.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|title=Two movies to open|date=April 27, 1981|\npage=E6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/76934096/the-san-francisco-examiner/|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56617-FRIDAY-THE13THPART2?sid=30fbfce2-f014-492b-a1f0-f142679b7105&sr=3.0390518&cp=1&pos=0|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Friday the 13th Part 2|accessdate=May 3, 2021}}</ref> ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' received generally negative reviews, and was less financially successful than the first film, grossing $21.7 million in the U.S. on a budget of $1.25 million. A direct sequel, ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'', was released one year later.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo months after [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|the murders at Camp Crystal Lake]], sole survivor [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of [[Pamela Voorhees]] and is murdered with an ice pick to her temple by an unknown assailant.\n\nFive years later, Paul Holt opens a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra, her boyfriend Jeff, Scott, Terry, Mark, Vickie, Ted, and Paul's assistant [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny]], as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors the legend of [[Jason Voorhees]], a boy who drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957, sending his vengeful mother on two killing sprees in 1958 and 1979, until she herself was eventually killed by Alice Hardy in self-defense. According to the legend, Jason survived and is now living in the woods near Crystal Lake; enraged at his mother's death, he will kill anyone he comes across. As Paul finishes the story, a man with a spear scares everyone, but it's revealed to be Ted wearing a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off-limits.\n\nThat night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is [[garrote]]d from behind a tree by an unseen killer. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a dog carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returned to the camp. Later, Winslow spots a man wearing a [[burlap sack]] mask running across the road. Winslow chases him into the woods and finds a shack.  The man kills Winslow with a hammer claw.\n\nBack at camp, Paul offers the others one last night on the town before the training begins. Six stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an [[urban legend]]. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding Scott's dead body. Mark has a machete slammed into his face and he falls down a flight of stairs as he dies. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, then stabs Vickie to death with a kitchen knife.\n\nTed stays behind at the bar while Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' severed head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to psychologically convince Jason that she is his mother. The ruse briefly works, until Jason sees his mother's head on the altar and awakens from the trance. Paul suddenly returns and tries to save Ginny, but Jason incapacitates him. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up a machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him.\n\nPaul and Ginny return to the cabin and hear someone outside. Thinking that Jason has followed them, they open the door, only to find Terry's dog, Muffin. Just as they sigh in relief, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny. She then awakens to being loaded into an ambulance, and calls out for Paul, who is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate ambiguous. Back in the shack, Pamela's head remains on the altar, but Jason is nowhere to be found.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{Anchor|Warrington Gillette}}<!-- until an article is created for him -->\n* [[Amy Steel]] as [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]]\n* [[John Furey]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Paul Holt|Paul Holt]]\n* [[Adrienne King]] as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]]\n* [[Steve Daskewisz]] as [[Jason Voorhees]]\n* Warrington Gillette as Jason Voorhees (unmasked)\n* [[Stuart Charno|Stu Charno]] as Ted Bowen\n* [[Lauren-Marie Taylor]] as Vickie Perry\n* Marta Kober as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Sandra Dier|Sandra Dier]]\n* [[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]] as Mark Jarvis\n* [[Bill Randolph]] as Jeff Dunsberry\n* Kirsten Baker as Terry McCarthy\n* [[Russell Todd]] as Scott Cheney\n* [[Walt Gorney]] as [[Crazy Ralph]]\n* [[Betsy Palmer]] as [[Pamela Voorhees]]\n* Jack Marks as Deputy Winslow\n* Cliff Cudney as Max\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nFollowing the success of ''Friday the 13th'' in 1980, [[Paramount Pictures]] began plans to make a sequel. First acquiring the worldwide distribution rights, Frank Mancuso, Sr. stated, \"We wanted it to be an event, where teenagers would flock to the theaters on that Friday night to see the latest episode.\" The initial ideas for a sequel involved the \"Friday the 13th\" title being used for a series of films, released once a year, that would not have direct continuity with one another but be a separate \"scary movie\" in their own right. Phil Scuderi\u2014one of three owners of Esquire Theaters, along with Steve Minasian and Bob Barsamian, who produced the original film\u2014insisted that the sequel have Jason Voorhees, Pamela's son, even though his appearance in the original film was only meant to be a joke. [[Steve Miner]], associate producer on the first film, believed in the idea and would go on to direct the first two sequels, after Cunningham opted not to return to the director's chair. Miner would use many of the same crew members from the first film while working on the sequels.{{Sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=50\u201352}} Cunningham had mixed feelings about the entire \"Friday the 13th\" enterprise that he outlined for film critic and author [[Stephen Hunter]] in an interview for a book Hunter wrote on violent films. Hunter stated that Cunningham \"wasn't particularly proud\" of his work on these films, and Cunningham bluntly said that the only thing that seemed to reach a teenaged audience at that time involved high levels of gore and graphic violence.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Adrienne King]] was pursued by an obsessed fan after the success of the original ''Friday the 13th'' and purportedly wished her role to be small as possible,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/how-friday-the-13th-star-adrienne-king-uses-her-terrifying-stalker-tale-to-help-her-fans/|title=Friday The 13th' Star Adrienne King Uses Her Terrifying Stalker Tale To Help Her Fans|publisher=Uproxx|author=Burns, Ashley|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref> though in the documentary ''[[Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th]]'', it was stated that King's agent had asked for a higher salary, which the studio could not afford.<ref name=bd/>\n\nThe film's heroine, Ginny, is played by Amy Steel, who won the part through an audition. \"At the time of [making the film], it was before the genre really picked up so I didn\u2019t give it a lot of credit or take it seriously. For me, it was just another audition because I had no idea what it would end up meaning after all this time. When I played Ginny, I was really young and different from a lot of the people working at the time so that came out in my character. I was naturally suspicious of cocky guys at that age, and you see a lot of that when I\u2019m on screen with Paul (John Furey). I tried to put so much behind the actual words in the script just so she felt almost unreachable, to Paul and to audiences. I wanted her to have some power.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/16108/dread-central-s-final-girls-amy-steel/|work=Dread Central|author=Wixson, Heather|date=March 5, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018012501/https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/16108/dread-central-s-final-girls-amy-steel/|archive-date=October 18, 2018|title=Dread Central's Final Girls: Amy Steel|access-date=November 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nActor Warrington Gillette played Jason unmasked at the end of the film.

Savini was then replaced by [[Stan Winston]]. Winston, however, had a scheduling conflict and had to drop out of the project.<ref name=bd/> The make-up effects were ultimately handled by Carl Fullerton. Fullerton designed the \"look\" for the adult Jason Voorhees and went with long red hair and a beard while following the facial deformities established in the original film in the make-up designed by Tom Savini for Jason as a child. Fullerton's look for the adult Jason was abandoned in the sequel, ''Friday the 13th Part 3'', despite the fact that the film took place the following day and was helmed by the same director, Steve Miner. Some fans have theorized that the sequence showing Jason with a beard and long hair reflects a \"dream\" rather than a reality because the following sequel picks up with the events showing his face having not happened, and therefore what was represented was Ginny's ''guess'' at what he looked like under the burlap sack rather than what he ''actually'' looked like, which would excuse the break in continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|title=The Continuity Issues Of Jason Voorhees' Appearance Between Part 2 And Part 3|author=Parker, Jason|date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018012138/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2015/08/the-continuity-issues-of-jason-voorhees.html|archive-date=October 18, 2018|access-date=February 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSteve Daskawisz was rushed to the emergency room during filming after Amy Steel cut his hand with a machete.<ref name=bd/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html|title=Behind the Scenes: Part 2 accident and the Hospital|work=Friday the 13th: The Franchise|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181018014208/http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2011/01/bts-wednesday-part-2-accident-and.html |archive-date=October 18, 2018|author=Parker, Jason|date=January 12, 2011}}</ref> Steel explained, \"The timing was wrong, and he didn't turn his pickaxe properly, and the machete hit his finger.\" Daskawisz received thirteen stitches on his middle finger.
