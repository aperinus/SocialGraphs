Roberts portrays Poppy Moore, a wealthy, spoiled teenager, who is admitted to a boarding school in England where she soon learns the true meaning of life and friendship. This was Richardson's final on-screen film role before her death the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nPoppy Moore, a wealthy [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] teenager, executes a wild prank to ruin all of her widowed father's girlfriend's belongings. When her father, Gerry, arrives on the scene, he announces he will be sending her to a [[boarding school]] in [[England]]. At the school, she is greeted by headmistress Mrs. Kingsley and head girl, Harriet Bentley, who berates Poppy for her attitude. Poppy shares a bedroom with four girls: Kate, Josie, Kiki and Jennifer, known as \"Drippy\". Her rude and self-centered behavior leads to trouble when she insults the Matron, who confiscates their cellphones. All five are punished with detention. When Kate learns Poppy's mother died in a car crash when Poppy was eleven, she sympathizes with her. Kate lets Poppy use her actual phone to message her friend from back home, Ruby, who is secretly being intimate with Poppy's boyfriend, Roddy.\n\nThe girls decide to help Poppy get expelled to help return home. Together, they carry out several pranks, which gradually bring them closer together. When none of their plans work, they decide to have Poppy seduce the headmistress's son, Freddie, who is strictly forbidden from fraternizing with any of the girls. The girls go on a trip and Poppy removes her blonde hair dye, revealing her natural brunette hair. She dances with Freddie at the school dance, much to Harriet's dismay, but Poppy trips and hits her head. Freddie takes her outside for air, where he asks her out on a date.\n\nThe next day, Poppy discovers her talent for [[lacrosse]] and whips the school's team into shape, getting them into the finals. She finds herself falling for Freddie and they kiss before returning to school. Entering her room, Poppy finds her roommates reading an email supposedly sent by her, expressing she thinks all of her new friends are losers. She finds Freddie has received a similar email, as a result she is ignored by them. However, she never actually sent the email. With no one else to turn to, Poppy sneaks down to the cook's room and calls Ruby, who accidentally reveals how much she dislikes Poppy and she is seeing Roddy. Feeling even more alone, Poppy starts playing with her lighter and accidentally sets a curtain on fire. Hearing footsteps, she quickly puts out the fire and runs off. A few minutes later, she looks out her window to see a fire and immediately wakes the school.\n\nWhen they find Drippy is missing, Poppy runs into the burning school to rescue her. After the fire is extinguished, Freddie finds her lighter and gives it back to her, refusing to hear any explanation. Realizing she no longer wants to leave, Poppy goes to the headmistress and takes the blame for the fire. Afterwards, she finds a portrait of her late mother in the 1976 Abbey Mount lacrosse team and begins to cry upon realizing her mother had attended the same school.\n\nWhile Poppy waits for the Honour Court to decide whether she should be expelled, Freddie finds her crying and becomes convinced the fire was an accident, and forgives her. At the hearing, Poppy gives her testimony. Meanwhile, her roommates find out Poppy did not send the emails. Harriet mentions Poppy's lighter during the hearing, and when the other girls say no lighter was ever mentioned, Harriet snaps at Poppy and confesses to restarting the fire after Poppy had put it out. Poppy is subsequently absolved and Harriet is expelled.\n\nGerry comes to the lacrosse finals game and notices Poppy's dramatic change in appearance and how much she looks like her mother. He is amazed by his daughter's role as captain of the lacrosse team.  Abbey Mount wins the lacrosse finals. Some months later, Poppy, her friends, and Freddie are relaxing in Malibu. Poppy ignores Ruby's phone calls, now fully aware Ruby was not a good friend. They prepare to jump off the cliff into the waters below.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Emma Roberts]] as Poppy Moore, a wealthy, rebel and spoiled teenager living in Malibu.\n*[[Alex Pettyfer]] as Freddie Kingsley, Mrs. Kingsley's son and Poppy's love interest.\n*[[Georgia King]] as Harriet Bentley, the \"queen bee\" of Abbey Mount.\n*[[Kimberley Nixon]] as Kate, Poppy's roommate.\n*[[Juno Temple]] as Jennifer \"Drippy\" Logan, Poppy's roommate.\n*[[Linzey Cocker]] as Josie, Poppy's roommate.\n*[[Sophie Wu]] as Kiki, Poppy's roommate.\n*[[Natasha Richardson]] as Mrs. Kingsley, Freddie's mother and the headmistress of Abbey Mount.\n*[[Shirley Henderson]] as Matron\n*[[Daisy Donovan]] as Miss Sara Rees-Withers, the sports mistress.\n*[[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]] as Mr. Roger Nellist, the French teacher.\n*[[Aidan Quinn]] as Gerry Moore, Poppy's widowed father.\n*[[Nick Frost]] as Mr. Christopher, the hairdresser.\n*Ruby Thomas as Jane, Harriet's friend/lackey.\n*Eleanor Turner-Moss as Charlotte, Harriet's friend/lackey.\n*[[Shelby Young]] as Ruby, Poppy's fake friend from Malibu.\n*[[Johnny Pacar]] as Roddy, Poppy's ex-boyfriend.\n*[[Lexi Ainsworth]] as Molly Moore, Poppy's sister.\n*[[Kelsey Sanders]] as Abbey Mount's student\n*Jessica Rizo as Abbey Mount's student\n\n==Production==\nThe interiors of the boarding school were filmed at [[Cobham Hall]] in Kent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Film |first=Kent |url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2008/02/wild-child-2013-2008/ |title=Wild Child (2008) |publisher=Kent Film Office |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref> The facade of the school was filmed at [[Balls Park]].<ref name=\"British Film Locations\">{{Cite web |title=Wild Child Filming Locations |url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/Wild-Child-2008 |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=British Film Locations |language=en-GB}}</ref> They also filmed at 82 Main Street, 84 Main Street, 117 Main Street, and at the [[Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum]] in [[Haworth]], [[Keighley]], [[City of Bradford|Bradford]].<ref name=\"British Film Locations\"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Wild Child |url=https://www.bradfordfilmheritage.com/portfolio/wild-child/ |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=Bradford Film Heritage |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Films and TV Shows Filmed In and Around Bradford |url=https://www.thestoreroom.co.uk/2022/02/23/films-and-tv-shows-filmed-in-and-around-bradford/ |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=The Store Room |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"Lights Camera Yorkshire\">{{Cite web |title=Yorkshire\u2019s Great Screen Locations by Welcome to Yorkshire - Issuu |url=https://issuu.com/welcometoyorkshire/docs/yorkshire___s_great_screen_location |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=issuu.com |page=13 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=White |first=Clive |date=13 September 2007 |title=Cameras roll on our prime location |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/1684227.cameras-roll-on-our-prime-location/ |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |language=en}}</ref> Filming also took place in [[Harrogate]], and at [[Robin Hood's Bay]] in [[North Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"Lights Camera Yorkshire\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Wild Child'' was released in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2008, taking fifth place at the box office with $2,196,366 from 359 cinemas with an average of $6,118.
