It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship ''Prometheus'' as it follows a [[star map]] discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]]. Scott and director [[James Cameron]] developed ideas for a film that would serve as a [[prequel]] to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''. In 2002, the development of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the ''Alien'' films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of ''Alien'' but is not directly connected to the original series. According to Scott, although the film shares \"strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA,\" and takes place in the same [[fictional universe|universe]], ''Prometheus'' explores its own mythology and ideas.\n\n''Prometheus'' entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. [[Principal photography]] began in March 2011, and concluded in October 2011,<ref name=\"filming date\">{{Cite web|title=Prometheus (2012) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/locations|access-date=2022-11-06}}</ref> with an estimated $120\u2013130&nbsp;million budget. The project was shot using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Scotland, Jordan and Spain. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.\n\n''Prometheus'' was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in [[North America]]. The film earned generally positive reviews, receiving praise for the designs, production values and cast performances, but was criticized for its uneven script and unresolved plot points. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide. A sequel, ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'', was released in May 2017, tying the film permanently to the ''Alien'' franchise and making it the sixth installment.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nAs a spacecraft departs a planet, a [[humanoid]] alien drinks an [[iridescent]] liquid, causing its body to dissolve. Its remains cascade into a waterfall and the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.\n\nIn 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a [[star chart|star map]] in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the \"Engineers\". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel ''Prometheus'', to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] while the [[android (robot)|android]] David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.\n\nThe ''Prometheus'' lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which the team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise that the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to ''Prometheus'', but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.\n\nInside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to ''Prometheus'', but Vickers refuses to let him aboard and, at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being previously [[Infertility|infertile]], is now in advanced [[pregnancy]]. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard ''Prometheus.'' He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as \"Father\".\n\nA monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the ''Prometheus'' and kills several crew members before he is killed. The captain of ''Prometheus'', Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and the team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4008|title=Language Log \u00bb Proto-Indo-European in Prometheus?|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> to try to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the ''Prometheus'' into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer. It thrusts an [[ovipositor]] down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains and, with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.\n\nIn the lifeboat, an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Deacon|alien creature]] bursts out of the Engineer's chest.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 175\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Idris Elba]] play Elizabeth Shaw, Meredith Vickers and Janek, respectively\n   | image1    = Noomi Rapace by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    = Charlize Theron WonderCon 2012 (Straighten Crop).jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = \n   | image3    = Idris Elba 2014.jpg\n   | alt3      = \n   | caption3  = \n}}\n\n*[[Noomi Rapace]] as Elizabeth Shaw:\n:Rapace described Shaw, an archaeologist, as a believer in God with a very strong faith, and said that, \"In the middle of the movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior.

Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?\"<ref name=\"CastFass2\"/> Fassbender said, \"David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans.

Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ.<ref name=\"Theme1\"/><ref name=\"Theme6\"/><ref name=\"Theme8\"/> However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be \"a little too on the nose.\"<ref name=\"Theme1\"/>\n\n[[Artificial intelligence]], a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in ''Prometheus'', primarily through the android David.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Barkman, Adam |editor2=Barkman, Ashley |editor3=Kang, Nancy | title = The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott | pages= 121\u2013142 | publisher=Lexington Books | year= 2013 | isbn = 978-0-7391-7872-0}}</ref> David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in \"robotic storytelling\" such as in ''Blade Runner''. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the ''Prometheus'' ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own.<ref name=\"Theme2\"/>{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David.<ref name=\"Theme2\"/> At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.<ref name=\"Theme3\"/>\n\nAnother theme is creation and the question of \"Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\"<ref name=\"Theme6\"/><ref name=\"Theme7\"/> Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of humanity, but Scott was interested in [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Aztec]] creation myths about gods who create humans in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a \"gardener in space\" to bring life to a world.<ref name=\"Theme8\"/> One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations.<ref name=\"Theme6\"/> Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.<ref name=\"Theme1\"/><ref name=\"Theme9\"/>\n\nShaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers.<ref name=\"Theme6\"/> In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that ''Prometheus'' is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.<ref name=\"Theme10\"/>\n\nBeside drawing several influences from ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Govindini Murty noted further influences, and wrote that \"[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for ''Prometheus'' reference everything from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]'' to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' and [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]''. Scott also expands on the original ''Alien'' universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' and the symbolic drawings of [[William Blake]].\"<ref name=\"GuideTheAtlantic\"/> In September 2021, a further analysis of the film was reported.<ref name=\"YN-20210901\">{{cite news |last=Nero |first=Dom |title=It's Time to Redeem 'Prometheus' |url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/time-redeem-prometheus-110000443.html |date=September 1, 2021 |work=[[Yahoo News]] |access-date=September 2, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDevelopment on a fifth film in the ''Alien'' franchise was in progress by 2002.

It was then that [[20th Century Fox]] approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.<ref name=\"Development14\"/> After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would \"kill the validity of the franchise.\"<ref name=\"vespe\"/> In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the ''Alien'' sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.<ref name=\"Development14\"/>\n\nIn May 2009, Fox said that the project was a \"reboot\"<ref name=\"prometheusblueprint\"/> of the ''Alien'' franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled prequel to ''Alien''.<ref name=\"Development3\"/><ref name=\"filmophiliascott\"/> Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former [[Television advertisement|television advertisement director]] Carl Erik Rinsch as director.

The keen fan will recognize strands of ''Alien''{{'}}s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative.\"<ref name=\"Development10\"/> In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that ''Prometheus'' takes place in the same universe as the events of the ''Alien'' series.<ref name=\"CineEurope\"/><ref name=\"pre\"/> In July 2011, Scott stated that \"by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first ''Alien'', but none of the subsequent [films].\"<ref name=\"filmophiliascott\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|quote=\"It covers a vast expanse of time, past, present and future.

The characters in this movie are preoccupied by the idea: what are our origins?\"|source=\u2014Damon Lindelof, concerning the scope of ''Prometheus''.<ref name=\"scottbeams\"/>|width=35%|align=left}}\n\nSpaihts met Scott in late 2009 and they discussed Scott's desire to pursue an ''Alien'' prequel. Spaihts offered his concept, including a \"bridge\" that would connect the story of the film's human characters to the ''Alien'' saga. Spaihts was quickly hired, which he credited to the reception of his \"bridge\" idea. Spaihts claimed he created the concept spontaneously, without preconception. Spaihts wrote a 20-page \"extremely detailed outline\"; within three and a half weeks he had completed his first draft, and he submitted it to the producers on Christmas Day, 2009. Within 12 hours, Scott returned the script with notes for changes, and Spaihts spent the Christmas holiday redrafting.<ref name=\"Writing1\"/>\n\nSpaihts was tasked with exploring unresolved mysteries from ''Alien'', such as the Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of ''Alien'' to be alien in nature, and said, \"all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and&nbsp;... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'&nbsp;... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?\" His solution was to link the alien mysteries to the past and future of humanity. He said: \"If that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story, that story changes meaning within our life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently.\"<ref name=\"Writing2\"/> Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float.<ref name=\"Writing1\"/> By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft.<ref name=\"Development3\"/> Scott said about the script, \"We are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?\"<ref name=\"Development7\"/> In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.<ref name=\"Development13\"/>\n\nHowever, Scott instead contacted Lindelof and asked him to review Spaihts's script.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it.<ref name=\"Writing20\"/> Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the ''Alien'' films, such as the ''Alien'' creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to ''Alien'', the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series,{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} Lindelof said, \"If the ending to [''Prometheus''] is just going to be the room that [[John Hurt]] walks into that's full of [alien] eggs [in ''Alien''], there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end.\"{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} \"A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world.\"<ref name=\"pre\"/>\n\n[[File:Damon Lindelof by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|Writer [[Damon Lindelof]] promoting ''Prometheus'' at [[WonderCon]] in 2012. Lindelof was hired to rewrite [[Jon Spaihts]]'s original script.]]\nLindelof said that the other parts of the script were strong enough to survive without the ''Alien'' hallmarks, such as the ''Alien'' creature, which he believed had been diluted by the exposure it had received.<ref name=\"pre\"/> He said, \"[The producers] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the ''Alien'' stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part of this movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about.\"<ref name=\"Writing21\"/> Lindelof said that the film could instead run parallel to the ''Alien'' series and that a sequel would be ''Prometheus 2'' and not ''Alien'', and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}}<ref name=\"Writing21\"/> Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's ''Alien'' prequel into an original creation.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=84}} Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the ''Alien'' symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010.<ref name=\"Writing22\"/> Inspired by ''Blade Runner'' and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an ''Alien'' story of action and horror with \"the ''Blade Runner'' thematic,\"{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}} to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said,\n\n{{blockquote|''Blade Runner'' might not have done well [financially] when it first came out, but people are still talking about it because it was infused with all these big ideas. [Scott] was also talking about very big themes in ''Prometheus''. It was being driven by people who wanted the answers to huge questions. But I thought that we could do that without ever getting too pretentious. Nobody wants to see a movie where people are floating in space talking about the meaning of life&nbsp;... That was already present in [Spaihts's] original script and [Scott] just wanted to bring it up more.{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=54}}}}\n\nScott's story concept was partially inspired by ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]'s work about the theory of [[ancient astronauts]] which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens.<ref name=\"filmophiliascott\"/><ref name=\"CineEurope\"/> Scott said, \"NASA and the Vatican agree that [it is] almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way&nbsp;... That's what we're looking at [in the film], at some of Erich von D\u00e4niken's ideas of how did we humans come about.\"<ref name=\"CineEurope\"/> Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but does not want to be anything like them, eschewing a common theme in \"robotic storytelling\" such as in ''Blade Runner''. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=60}} For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from ''Alien''{{'}}s Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.<ref name=\"Writing23\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nPre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film.<ref name=\"Development3\"/> Scott convinced Fox to invest millions of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century.<ref name=\"THRMay1612\"/> The production of ''Prometheus'' was marked by a high degree of secrecy.<ref name=\"PrePro4\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon [[practical effects]], and would use [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals.<ref name=\"PrePro6\"/> Scott said that \"you can pretty much do anything you want\" with digital technology,<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> and, \"[[Douglas Trumbull|Doug Trumbull]] once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper.\"<ref name=\"PrePro7\"/> Cinematographer [[Dariusz Wolski]] convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in [[3D film|3D]] with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company [[3ality Technica]] provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation.<ref name=\"PrePro9\"/> According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget.{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2012|p=8}} Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the ''Alien'' films was added in post-production using [[Color grading|color grading processes]], and the 3D equipment was based on post-[[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']] technology.<ref name=\"PrePro8\"/><ref name=\"ProPro8b\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Iceland Dettifoss 1972-4.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Dettifoss|Dettifoss waterfall]] in Iceland was used in the film's opening scene showing an Engineer creating life.]]\n\nWith an estimated $120\u2013130 million budget, principal photography began on March 21, 2011 and wrapped up on October 8, 2011.<ref name=\"filming date\"/><ref name=\"THRMay1612\"/><ref name=\"Filming1\"/><ref name=\"Filming10\"/> Filming began at [[Shepperton Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]] in England.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}<ref name=\"FilmingUk1\"/> Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the [[007 Stage]].<ref name=\"FilmingUk1\"/> Studio space was limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased the size of the 007 stage by over 30%.<ref name=\"Design1\"/>\n\nExterior shots of the alien world were shot in Iceland,{{Sfn|Nashawaty|2011|p=43}} where filming took two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, at the base of [[Hekla]], an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, \"If one is afraid of nature in this profession then it would be best to find a different job.\"<ref name=\"FilmingIceland2\"/> Filming also took place at [[Dettifoss]], one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe.<ref name=\"FilmingIceland1\"/> The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew.<ref name=\"FilmingIceland2\"/> Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time.<ref name=\"Filming5\"/> [[Morocco]] had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 [[Arab Spring]] protests forced the change of venue.<ref name=\"THRMay1612\"/> Alternatives including the [[Mojave Desert]] had been considered,<ref name=\"FilmingIceland3\"/> but Scott explained that [[Iceland]] was ultimately chosen because \"here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive.\"<ref name=\"FilmingIceland2\"/>\n\nIn September 2011, filming moved to the [[Ciudad de la Luz]] audiovisual complex in [[Alicante]], Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach.<ref name=\"Filming6\"/><ref name=\"Filming7\"/> The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September.<ref name=\"Filming6\"/> Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over [[Euro|\u20ac]]1 million in the local economy.<ref name=\"Filming8\"/> Filming also took place in the [[Wadi Rum]] valley in Jordan.<ref name=\"THRMay1612\"/>\n\nScott avoided using [[Chroma key|green screens]] unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so the actors would know where they should be looking in any particular scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming.{{Sfn|McCabe|Farley|Edwards|2012|p=58}} The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Epic]] 3D cameras set on [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a [[steadicam]], which was used only occasionally.<ref name=\"PrePro9\"/><ref name=\"Filming3\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nScott used the 3D footage to increase the [[stereoscopy|illusion of depth]]. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, \"You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase,\" and, \"the trick is not to overdo it.\"{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} In December 2011, Rapace undertook [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recordings]] for the film.<ref name=\"colliderrapaceinterview\"/> Additional [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the [[Isle of Skye]], Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains.<ref name=\"Skye\"/>{{Sfn|Free|Mottram|Pringle|2012|p=56}}<ref name=\"PostPro21\"/> For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.<ref name=\"PostPro20\"/>\n\nIn July 2011, Scott said that he was filming ''Prometheus'' with both adult-oriented R and more accessible PG-13 [[Film rating#United States|film ratings]] in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience.<ref name=\"PostPro1\"/> When asked about the rating, Scott said, \"The question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference&nbsp;... essentially it's kinda R&nbsp;... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful.\"{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could,{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=77}} while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating.<ref name=\"PostPro3\"/> On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made.<ref name=\"Rating1\"/><ref name=\"PostPro5\"/> According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would be the only way to gain a lower one.<ref name=\"Editing1\"/> A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role.<ref name=\"HomeMedia3\"/> Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.<ref name=\"Release6\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{see also|Prometheus (soundtrack)}}\n\n[[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for ''Prometheus''.<ref name=\"Music1\"/> It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SME\"/> Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced. He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, \"I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling sound.\"<ref name=\"SME\"/> The ''Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' album was released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] on May 15, 2012,<ref name=\"Soundtrack3\"/> and on CD on June 4, 2012.<ref name=\"Soundtrack1\"/> It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]].<ref name=\"Soundtrack4\"/> [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]{{'}}s \"[[Raindrop prelude]]\" (1838) is also featured in the film.<ref name=\"MusicChopin1\"/><ref name=\"MusicChopin2\"/>\n\n==Design==\n[[Production designer]] [[Arthur Max]] led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals of ''Alien'', and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of ''Prometheus''.<ref name=\"PrePro3\"/><ref name=\"Design2\"/> Influence was drawn from the work of ''Alien'' creature designer [[H. R. Giger]], and designers [[Ron Cobb]] and [[Chris Foss]], including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.<ref name=\"Design2\"/>\n\n===Costume design===\nFor the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in [[Steve Jobs]]' biography about building an office out of [[Gorilla Glass]]. Scott said, \"If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet.\"<ref name=\"MiscWonderCon12\"/> The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, [[Janty Yates]], used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a [[neoprene]] suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.<ref name=\"Design1\"/>\n\nAboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, \"[Theron] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible.\" Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career at the helm of a ship.<ref name=\"Design1\"/>\n\n===Sets and vehicles===\nArthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the ''Prometheus'' and the Engineer's ship.{{Sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=64}}<ref name=\"Design1\"/> Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks.<ref name=\"Design30\"/> To create the ''Prometheus'', Max researched NASA and [[European Space Agency]] spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted \"to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy.\"<ref name=\"Design1\"/>\n\nThe interior of the ''Prometheus'' was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a [[Fazioli]] piano.<ref name=\"Design1\"/> The ship's garage was built on the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size.<ref name=\"Design1\"/> One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression.<ref name=\"Design2\"/> Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.<ref name=\"filmophiliascott\" />\n\nFor the scene of the ''Prometheus''{{'}} descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor [[Richard Stammers]] and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in ''Alien''. Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in ''Alien'', but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain [[Olympus Mons]] and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work.<ref name=\"io9\"/> MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the ''Prometheus'', and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.<ref name=\"DesignVFX1\"/>\n\n===Creature effects===\n[[File:Prometheus - Trilobite Adult.jpg|left|thumb|The practical model for the Adult Trilobite, featuring multiple long tentacle-like appendages and a mouth in the centre of its body]]\n[[Neal Scanlan]] and [[Conor O'Sullivan (make-up artist)|Conor O'Sullivan]] developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures.<ref name=\"Design1\"/> Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of ''Alien''. Huante designed them to be white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] statue in South Dakota. Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to ''Alien''{{'}}s Facehugger, and a primitive ''Alien'' creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced paintings by William Blake and [[J. M. W. Turner]], and classical sculptures.<ref name=\"io9\"/> Scott wanted the Engineers to resemble [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] gods, and instructed designer [[Neville Page]] to reference the [[Statue of Liberty]], Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"Design51\"/> The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to preserve the \"godlike\" physical perfection.<ref name=\"Design50\"/> Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant \"dark angels.\"<ref name=\"Theme1\"/>\n\nThe snake-like alien dubbed the \"Hammerpede\" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated, the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head.<ref name=\"DesignVFX1\"/> During the scene in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires. Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful appearance. Early designs of the \"Trilobite,\" the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed.<ref name=\"DesignCreature1\"/> The practical creature was a remotely operated [[Animatronics|animatronic]] creation with a silicone skin.<ref name=\"Editing1\"/><ref name=\"DesignCreature1\"/>\n\nThe mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which Fifield was rendered as \"a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating a semblance of Harris's face.\"<ref name=\"Fifield1\"/> Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were rejected as being too inhuman.<ref name=\"Fifield2\"/>\n\nFor its grown form, the \"Adult Trilobite,\" Max found inspiration from an [[arthropod]]-like creature from Earth's [[Cambrian]] period, and the alien octopus in [[Jean Giraud]]'s illustrations for the comic strip ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]''. Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the \"Deacon,\" was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since \"it was born of a female before being born of a male.\" Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of [[foal]]s, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta.<ref name=\"DesignCreature1\"/> The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the [[goblin shark]].<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\n===Sound effects===\nSound effects were generated with a variety of sources including [[Pop Rocks]]\u2014a brand of popping candy\u2014and a [[parrot]]. The glistening ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the \"popping, cracking\" sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.<ref name=\"DesignSound\"/>\n\n===Visual effects===\n[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|right|The film's star map sequence was inspired by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]]'s painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]''.<ref name=\"Writing2\"/>]]\n\n''Prometheus'' contains approximately 1,300 digital effect shots.{{Sfn|Leyland|2012|p=86}} The main effects studio was [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots.<ref name=\"PostPro20\"/> Several other studios, including [[Weta Digital]],<ref name=\"THRMay1612\"/> Fuel VFX,<ref name=\"PostPro2\"/> [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Luma Pictures]], [[Lola Visual Effects]], and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.<ref name=\"PostPro10\"/>\n\nThe creation of life from the disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey the story of the Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"DesignVFX3\"/>\n\nA key scene involving a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the [[Orrery]], was inspired by the 1766 [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]] painting ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'', in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as \"circles in circles with a candle lit image.\" Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting.

The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut.<ref name=\"MarketingFull1\"/> Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive,<ref name=\"Marketing17\"/> and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release.<ref name=\"Marketing30\"/> On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the [[Vue Cinemas|Vue Cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.<ref name=\"Marketing41\"/> The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.<ref name=\"Marketing40\"/><ref name=\"Marketing41\"/><ref name=\"Marketing42\"/>\n\nOn April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on [[Channel 4]] during the first advertisement break of the TV show ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''. Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter, some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers' tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement.<ref name=\"Marketing50\"/><ref name=\"Marketing51\"/> A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to the film whenever the social platform [[Zeebox]] detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site.<ref name=\"Marketing52\"/> On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory body [[Ofcom]] for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during the advertisement with the {{nowrap|Channel 4}} logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.<ref name=\"Marketing54\"/><ref name=\"Marketing55\"/>\n\nAlthough marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Verizon FiOS]], which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]], and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company.<ref name=\"Marketing71\"/> The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page.

The advert highlights the viral website campaign and the film's marketing partnership with [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]].]]\nA viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the ''TED 2023'' video presents a futuristic vision of a [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference, an annual technology and design event held in [[Long Beach, California]]. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because \"a guy like Peter Weyland\u2014whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris\u2014that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in [[Wembley Stadium]].{{' \"}}<ref name=\"MarketingTED\"/>\n\nTED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website.<ref name=\"Marketing31\"/> The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation.<ref name=\"CastPearce1\"/><ref name=\"Marketing21\"/> On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which would reveal new ''Prometheus'' media.<ref name=\"MarketingArg1\"/>\n\nDuring the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the \"David 8\" android, narrated by Fassbender.<ref name=\"MarketingViral2\"/> An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress.<ref name=\"MarketingViral3\"/><ref name=\"MarketingViral4\"/> A full page \"David 8\" advertisement was placed in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included.<ref name=\"MarketingViral16\"/> A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the ''Prometheus'' spaceship.<ref name=\"MarketingViral16\"/> Another video, \"Quiet Eye,\" starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page.<ref name=\"Premiere\"/> In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the ''Alien'' series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life.<ref name=\"MarketingViral17\"/> In France, the [[Saint-Martin (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Saint-Martin]] [[ghost station|ghost train station]] was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters.<ref name=\"Marketing73\"/> The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book.<ref name=\"MarketingViral20\"/><ref name=\"MarketingViral21\"/> Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.<ref name=\"MarketingViralSep\"/>\n\nAt the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status as an ''Alien'' prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the ''Alien'' films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.<ref name=\"MarketingViral18\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe premiere of ''Prometheus'' took place on May 31, 2012, at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire cinema]] in Leicester Square, London.<ref name=\"Release6\"/><ref name=\"Premiere2\"/> The film was released in the United Kingdom on {{nowrap|June 1}}, 2012,<ref name=\"Rating1\"/> and in North America on {{nowrap|June 8}}, 2012.<ref name=\"Release1\"/> It was simultaneously released in [[IMAX]] theaters and in 3D,<ref name=\"Release2\"/> and it is encoded for [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] motion seats that provide physical feedback to the audience during the film.<ref name=\"ReleaseDBox\"/>\n\n===Pre-release===\nIn the United Kingdom, approximately \u00a31 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were pre-sold.<ref name=\"BOInternational1\"/> 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the [[London IMAX]], the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with \u00a3293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with \u00a3137,000 ($221,717).<ref name=\"Release3\"/> It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and \u00a3470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]'' and ''Avatar''.<ref name=\"Release4\"/>\n\nIn North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females.<ref name=\"ReleaseUSPre\"/> In the week before the film's release, predictions were conflicted on whether ''Prometheus'' or ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (the first family-oriented film of the summer),<ref name=\"chicago1\"/> which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend. On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales ''Prometheus'' was beating ''Madagascar 3''. The online tracking for ''Prometheus'' surged with each additional promotional footage.<ref name=\"boxofficecom1\"/> ''Prometheus'' was predicted to earn approximately $30 million, and ''Madagascar 3'' around $45 million.<ref name=\"THR-predict\"/> As the weekend approached, tracking suggested a $55 million debut for ''Madagascar 3'' and $50\u2013$55 million for ''Prometheus''.<ref name=\"latimes-predict\"/> ''Prometheus'' was disadvantaged by ''Madagascar'' opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.<ref name=\"BOM-forecast\"/>\n\n===Box office===\n''Prometheus'' was considered a financial success overall.

After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum.\"<ref name=\"RevTimeOutLon\"/> [[Emanuel Levy]] wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, \"is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver.\"<ref name=\"RevLevy\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a \"seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract.\" Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance \"continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in ''Alien'',\" but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the \"classic tradition of golden age sci-fi.\"<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.<ref name=\"RevEbert2\"/>\n\n''[[Total Film]]''{{'}}s Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with ''Alien''{{'}}s mythology while offering its own original ideas.<ref name=\"RevTotalFilm\"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace, and the cinematography.<ref name=\"RevEW\"/> ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''{{'}}s Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was \"somber, spectacular and ponderous,\" but that the \"portentousness and grandiosity&nbsp;... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness\" and criticized the characters for lacking common sense.
