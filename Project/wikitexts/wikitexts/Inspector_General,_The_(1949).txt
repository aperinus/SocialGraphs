It stars [[Danny Kaye]] and was directed by [[Henry Koster]]. The film also stars [[Walter Slezak]], [[Barbara Bates]], and [[Elsa Lanchester]]. Original music and lyrics are by the associate producer [[Sylvia Fine]], who was married to Danny Kaye, with [[Johnny Green]] credited for musical direction and incidental score.\n\n==Premise==\nThe film is loosely based on [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s play ''[[The Government Inspector|The Inspector General]]''. The plot is re-located from the [[Russian Empire]] into an unspecified corrupted region of a country that suddenly finds itself under the supervision of the [[First French Empire]].\n\n==Plot==\nGeorgi ([[Danny Kaye]]), an illiterate member of a wandering band of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] led by Yakov ([[Walter Slezak]]) escapes from a travelling medicine show after he innocently lets slip that the [[elixir]] they're selling is a fraud. Tired and hungry, he wanders into the small town of Brodny and whilst trying to sample the contents of a horse's [[feedbag]], he's arrested as a vagrant and sentenced to hang the next day by a corrupt police chief ([[Alan Hale (actor, born 1892)|Alan Hale]]), desperate to prove his efficiency.\n\nThe town is run by a corrupt Mayor ([[Gene Lockhart]]), whose employees and councillors are all his cousins and equally corrupt and incompetent, but they are frightened when they learn that the Inspector General is in their neighborhood, and probably in disguise. The band of officials and the mayor want to protect their town and their lives, so, acting foolishly they seal off every road to keep the inspector from entering their town. They mistake Georgi for the Inspector and ply him with food and drink whilst plotting to have him killed. Yakov wanders into the small town and convinces Georgi to stay on as an inspector general and accept the bribes the officials so willingly throw at him. Of course, Yakov wants to seize Georgi's misfortune and turn it into a new start for his own life.\n\nMeanwhile, hearing tales of his legacy and courageous efforts the mayor's wife instantly takes a liking to Georgi, hoping he will fall in love with her and whisk her away from the mayor and his lack of attention to her. However Georgi has fallen in love with a servant and wishes to marry her.\n\nNaturally, their plans go awry and Georgi, despite his innocence, discovers how corrupt they really are. And when the real Inspector arrives suddenly, he also realizes that Georgi is the most honest fellow he's met since leaving [[Budapest]]. The Inspector General names Georgi the new Mayor of Brodny and presents him the mayoral gold chain, having taken it from the old mayor saying, \"We'll put something else around your neck.\" Yakov becomes the new chief of police and Georgi gets the girl of his dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Danny Kaye]] as Georgi\n*[[Walter Slezak]] as Yakov\n*[[Barbara Bates]] as Leza\n*[[Elsa Lanchester]] as Maria\n*[[Gene Lockhart]] as The Mayor\n*[[Alan Hale (actor, born 1892)|Alan Hale]] as Kovatch\n*[[Walter Catlett]] as Colonel Castine\n*[[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Inspector General\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|+Uncredited (in order of appearance)\n|-\n|[[Buddy Roosevelt]]||Sentry\n|-\n|[[Jeff York]]||Guard\n|-\n|[[Joan Vohs]]||Peasant Girl\n|-\n|[[Fred Kelsey]]||Villager\n|-\n|[[Maudie Prickett]]||Townswoman\n|-\n|[[Ida Moore]]||Old lady in the village\n|-\n|[[Barbara Pepper]]||Buxom girl in the village\n|-\n|[[Nestor Paiva]]||Gregor\n|-\n|[[Jack Mower]]||Villager\n|-\n|[[Paul Newlan]]||Viertel the woodchopper\n|-\n|[[Herbert Heywood (actor)|Herbert Heywood]]||Goatherd\n|-\n|[[Byron Foulger]]||Burbis\n|-\n|[[George Davis (actor)|George Davis]]||Ladislaus\n|-\n|[[Benny Baker]]||Telecki\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Conlin]]||Jailer\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Score==\nJohnny Green won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Motion Picture Score]] for his work on the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/92556%7C0/The-Inspector-General.html|last=Fristoe|first=Roger|title=The Inspector General|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref> Kaye's wife [[Sylvia Fine]] wrote the original songs \"The Inspector General\" and \"Happy Times,\" both sung by Kaye in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/danny-kaye-and-sylvia-fine/sylvia-fine-the-woman-behind-the-curtain.html|title=Sylvia Fine: The Woman Behind the Curtain|work=Danny Kaye and Sylvia Fine: Two Kids from Brooklyn (Library of Congress Exhibition.)|date=February 14, 2013|access-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>  \"Happy Times\" was, in fact, the working title of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/227/The-Inspector-General/notes.html|title=The Inspector General: Notes|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:The Inspector General (1949) 2.jpg|thumb|[[Elsa Lanchester]], [[Barbara Bates]], and [[Danny Kaye]] ]]\n\n===Box Office===\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,154,000 domestically and $1,756,000 foreign.<ref name=\"warners\"/>\n\n==Copyright status==\n''The Inspector General'' is one of a number of major Hollywood productions from the 1940s and 1950s that have lapsed into the [[public domain in the United States]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Chris|title=Chris Hicks: Kaye movies are hard to find on DVD|date=18 June 2004|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/595071083/Kaye-movies-are-hard-to-find-on-DVD.html|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref>  The last copyright holder was [[United Artists Television]] (later [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and finally [[Turner Entertainment]]) and later absorbed by TimeWarner now [[WarnerMedia]] & [[Warner Bros.]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films in the public domain in the United States]]\n* [[Revizor (film)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Inspector General (1949 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0041509|title=The Inspector General}}\n* {{amg title|id=24996|title=The Inspector General}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=227}}\n* {{AFI film|id=25971|title=The Inspector General}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=the_inspector_general|name=The Inspector General}}\n\n{{The Government Inspector}}\n{{Henry Koster}}\n{{Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Inspector General, The}}\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1949 musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films based on The Government Inspector]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Henry Koster]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Johnny Green]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Harry Kurnitz]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ben Hecht]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
