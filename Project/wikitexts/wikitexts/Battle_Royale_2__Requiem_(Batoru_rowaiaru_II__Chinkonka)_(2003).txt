His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed it in his directorial debut and dedicated it to his father. Unlike the first film, ''Requiem'' is an original story. It is set three years after the events of the original film and follows [[Shuya Nanahara]], who has now become an international terrorist intending to bring down the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. As a result, another class of ninth graders is kidnapped and sent to eliminate Nanahara within a limited time period of 72 hours.\n\nThe film was released in Japanese cinemas on 5 July 2003. In stark contrast to its predecessor, it drew largely negative responses from critics.<ref name=rotten/> In 2009, an extended version entitled ''Revenge'', which runs 20 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, was released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/special.php?ID=6&Page=2|title=Number 19: Battle Royale 2 \u2013 Revenge Cut|website=Movie-Censorship.com}}</ref> It included additional action, improved effects, slow motion shots, new score in several scenes and extended storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=2107|title=Battle Royale 2|website=Movie-Censorship.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events of the [[Battle Royale (film)|first film]], the survivors of previous Battles Royale have formed a rebel group called the Wild Seven, led by [[Shuya Nanahara]]. A class of ninth graders, composed of \"a ragtag collection of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquents]] and losers\", are kidnapped by the authoritarian [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]. Many of these students are [[orphan]]s whose parents or family died in bombings by the Wild Seven. After their school bus is diverted to an army base, the students are herded into a cage, surrounded by armed guards, and confronted by their schoolteacher, [[Riki Takeuchi]], who lays down the ground rules of the new Battle Royale game.\n\nInstead of being forced to kill each other, as in the old Battle Royale, the students are sent off to war and ordered to attack the Wild Seven's island hideout ''en masse'' and kill Shuya within 72 hours. Most of the students are not interested in being forced to avenge their families, but they are coerced to fight through exploding metal collars, which their captors can detonate by [[remote control]]. Takeuchi shows them a line in the caged classroom: those who wish to participate are instructed to cross the line, while those who refuse to participate will be killed. The students are put into \"pairs\"; if one student dies, then his or her partner will be killed via collar detonation.\n\nThe students are sent via boats onto the island base of the Wild Seven. A number of them are killed when they are bombed, shot or have their collars detonated during the journey, leaving only a cluster alive. Two of the survivors are a delinquent, Takuma Aoi; and Shiori Kitano, the daughter of the \"teacher\" of a Battle Royale program who was killed by Shuya three years previously. Taken into the Wild Seven's base, the surviving students' explosive collars are removed and they are encouraged to help the Wild Seven end the Battle Royale for good. While most of the survivors agree, Takuma and Shiori remain unconvinced.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]], Shuya sends a video message to the world stating their goal to live free. In response to the video, the United States fires a missile upon the island. Under pressure from the U.S. government, the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese prime minister]] takes command of the military present at the Battle Royale headquarters and orders an attack on the Wild Seven's base, with no survivors allowed \u2013 if they fail, the U.S. will bomb the island. Takeuchi is enraged by the change of actions and is discovered to have the same type of collar on his neck as the students.\n\nThe survivors of the base (including the surviving students, except Shiori) retreat to the mainland via a mine shaft while the war between the Wild Seven and the military occurs. Hearing the gunfire outside the tunnel, Takuma and two of his friends return to help in the fight. The combat takes numerous casualties on both sides, leaving Shuya, Takuma and Shiori as the only remaining fighters. While they try to evacuate, Takeuchi appears and, after a brief personal exchange, allows the group to flee as he sacrifices himself.\n\nOutside Wild Seven's base the combat starts again and Shiori is mortally wounded by gunfire. Before she dies in Shuya's arms, she reveals herself as Kitano's daughter and seemingly forgives him for his past crimes. Shuya and Takuma run out to kill the rest of the soldiers while the U.S. bombardment begins. The program then ends on a voided status, listing the fates of Shuya and the surviving students as unknown. Three months later, Shuya and Takuma rejoin the other survivors, including Noriko Nakagawa, in [[Afghanistan]]. They have regrouped as friends, and what lies next for them remains unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Battle Royale characters}}\n* [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] as Shuya Nanahara\n* [[Ai Maeda (actress)|Ai Maeda]] as Shiori Kitano (Transfer Student)\n* [[Shugo Oshinari]] as Takuma Aoi\n* Ayana Sakai as Nao Asakura\n* [[Haruka Suenaga]] as Haruka Kuze  \n* [[Yuma Ishigaki]] as Mitsugu Sakai\n* [[Miyuki Kanbe]] as Kyoko Kakei\n* [[Masaya Kikawada]] as Shintaro Makimura\n* [[Y\u014dko Maki (actress)|Y\u014dko Maki]] as Maki Souda\n* [[Yuki Ito (actor)|Yuki Ito]] as Ryo Kurosawa\n* [[Natsuki Kat\u014d|Natsuki Kato]] as Saki Sakurai\n* [[Aki Maeda]] as Noriko Nakagawa\n* [[Riki Takeuchi]] as Riki Takeuchi\n* [[Sonny Chiba]] as Makio Mimura (Shinji's revolutionary uncle)\n* [[Ai Iwamura]] as Mai (Smiling Winner from BR1)\n* [[Mika Kikuchi]] as Ayane Yagi\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as Kitano\n* [[Yoshiko Mita]] as Takuma's mother\n* [[Nanami Ohta]] as Hitoe Takeuchi\n* [[Takeru Shibaki]] as Shugo Urabe\n* [[Toshiyuki Toyonaga]] as Shota Hikasa\n* [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] as The Prime Minister\n* [[Nana Yanagisawa]] as Mayu Hasuda\n\n==Production==\n[[Kenta Fukasaku]] said, \"We never set out to make ''[[Harry Potter]]''.\" He explains that he wanted audience members to ponder \"big issues\" and to view the world from a point of view held by a [[terrorist]]. Fukasaku added that the film, against \"the new ''[[The Matrix (series)|Matrix]]''\" and ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|Terminator III]]'', needed to \"provide something that Hollywood can't.\" Fukasaku intended to provide an alternative to what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Ilya Garger describes as \"the moral certainty of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]\" as seen in [[Cinema of the United States|U.S. films]] and [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]].<ref name=\"Garger\">Garger, Ilya. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070305133056/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C501030707-461891%2C00.html Royale Terror]\" (). ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 30 June 2003.</ref>\n\nKenta Fukasaku said that he viewed his task as finishing his deceased father's movie instead of as directing his first creation; the son credits the film as his father's. Kenta Fukasaku desired a lot of controversy and outrage for the sequel, adding that \"the more strongly people react, the better.\"<ref name=\"Garger\"/> The film was mainly shot on [[Hashima Island]] (\"Battleship Island\").\n\n==Reception==\n''Requiem'' received generally negative reviews from film critics. The film received a rating of 30% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with a classification of \"rotten\", based on ten reviews. Many of the reviewers criticized the film for being inferior to the original, having a contrived, confusing plot line, its controversial, provocative sentiments, and generally bad acting.<ref name=rotten>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battle_royale_ii/ |title=Batoru rowaiaru II: Chinkonka (Battle Royale II) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIlya Garger of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said that while the film has more \"bullets, bombs and dramatic battlefield deaths\" than its predecessor had, the sequel does not have the \"who'll-die-next-and-how suspense.\" Garger described the characters in ''Battle Royale II'' as \"a simpler breed\" who join forces to defeat the adults.<ref name=\"Garger\"/> One of the few positive reviews was from Jamie Russell of [[BBC]] who stated that the film \"scrapes by on the strength of its startlingly subversive political commentary,\" wearing \"its anti-American sentiments on its sleeve.\" Despite criticizing it for being \"torturously overlong, resoundingly clunky and full of a bloated sense of its own importance,\" it concluded that \"its decision to cast its heroes as teenage [[Al Qaeda]]-style terrorists fighting against a [[fascism|fascistic]] adult [[United States|America]] is staggeringly bold.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Jamie|title=Battle Royale II: Requiem (2004)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/05/18/battle_royale_ii_2004_review.shtml|publisher=BBC|access-date=26 March 2012|date=18 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe sequel's soundtrack has more original work by [[Masamichi Amano]] and fewer classical pieces. One of them, ''Farewell to the Piano'', is played by [[Shiori Kitano]] herself during the film.\n\nThe song from the opening credits is \"[[Dies Irae]]\", taken from the ''[[Verdi Requiem]]''.\n\nThe end title song is by Japanese punk band [[Stance Punks]]. The song \"Mayonaka Shounen Totsugeki Dan\" features on their first full-length, self-titled album.\n\n==Books==\nThe book ''The Road to BRII'' ({{ISBN|4834252124}}) is a behind-the-scenes photo collection about the production of the movie. About ten tie-in books related to the movie have been released in Japan.\n\n==Related manga==\nA manga series called ''[[Battle Royale II: Blitz Royale]]'' is partially related to ''Battle Royale II: Requiem''. The school in ''Blitz Royale'' is Shikanotoride Junior High School, and the \"teacher\" pops pills like Riki Takeuchi. There are numerous plot differences between the film and manga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleroyalefilm.net/manga/index.html |title=battleroyalefilm.com |publisher=battleroyalefilm.com |date=2003-12-21 |access-date=2012-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Japan|Film}}\n* {{IMDb title|0338763}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|battle_royale_ii}}\n* [http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=4702 Comparison of DVD releases]\n\n{{Battle Royale}}\n{{Kinji Fukasaku}}\n{{Kenta Fukasaku}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle Royale II: Requiem}}\n[[Category:Battle Royale (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Films about teenagers]]\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:Battle royale]]\n[[Category:Japanese action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Japanese Christmas films]]\n[[Category:Japanese coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s dystopian films]]\n[[Category:Films about death games]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kenta Fukasaku]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kinji Fukasaku]]\n[[Category:Films set in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Films set on islands]]\n[[Category:Toei Company films]]\n[[Category:Films about juvenile delinquency]]\n[[Category:Japanese sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Masamichi Amano]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
