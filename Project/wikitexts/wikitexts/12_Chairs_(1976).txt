Before he can begin his quest, Ippolit Matveyevich meets a young swindler named Ostap Bender who coerces him into agreeing to help in the search in exchange for a percentage of the profit. Unfortunately, the town priest Father Fyodor also learns of Claudia Ivanovna's secret as part of her confession and decides to find the chair himself. Bender dreams of using the profits to move to [[Rio de Janeiro]], which he believes to be the greatest place in the world.\n\nThe companions go on the hunt for the chairs across the whole country, encountering many unique and interesting characters, and competing against each other along the way. In the end, they find eleven out of the twelve chairs and return to Moscow without finding the treasure. Somehow, Bender manages to track down the last missing chair and informs Ippolit Matveyevich, whom he has taken to calling Kisa, about this before he goes to sleep. Because they have inspected all the other chairs and found nothing, both know that the treasure is hidden in this last chair. Kisa decides to seize the treasure for himself and kills the sleeping Ostap by cutting his throat with a straight razor. However, Vorobyaninov fails to retrieve the treasure because the Railroad Club caretaker had accidentally discovered the diamonds in the chair and \"Comrade Krasilnikov\", the club's manager, has already built a new club with the money.\n\n[[File:Russia-2001-stamp-Andrei Mironov.jpg|thumb|Russian postage stamp in 2001, depicting Mironov and his role as Ostap|right]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]] as [[Ostap Bender]]\n* [[Georgy Vitsin]] as Bezenchuk\n* [[Anatoli Papanov]] as Vorobyaninov\n*[[Rolan Bykov]] as Father Fyodor\n* [[Aleksandr Abdulov]] as engineer Schukin\n* [[Tatyana Pelttser]] as Madame Petukhova\n* [[Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina]] as Madame Gritsatsuyeva\n* [[Lyubov Polishchuk]] as dancer\n* [[Mark Zakharov]]\n* [[Vsevolod Larionov]] as Absalom Iznuryonkov\n* [[Vera Markovna Orlova|Vera Orlova]] as Yelena Stanislavovna Bour\n* [[Eduard Abalov]]\n\n==Themes and analysis==\nThe Twelve Chairs, much like its source material, is a social critique of society, opining on themes such as religion, culture, economic policy, morality and the transformation of Russia under communism. Vorobianinov represents the old guard of Russians of the Russian Empire, while Bender himself is the epitome of the new Russian people under the rule of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0075468|12 stulyev}}\n\n{{The Twelve Chairs}}\n{{Mark Zakharov}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Twelve Chairs, The (1976 film)}}\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:Soviet musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Russian musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1976 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:1970s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Russian television miniseries]]\n[[Category:1970s Soviet television series]]\n[[Category:Studio Ekran films]]\n[[Category:Ilf and Petrov]]\n[[Category:Soviet crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Russian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Zakharov]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Gennady Gladkov]]\n[[Category:1976 comedy films]]"}]}}}}
