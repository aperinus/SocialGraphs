Its plot follows a group of teenagers in [[South Florida]] who enact a murder plot against their mutual bully who has emotionally, physically, and sexually abused them for years.\n\nThe film is based on the [[murder of Bobby Kent]], and its screenplay was adapted by [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] (under the pseudonym Zachary Long) and Roger Pullis from the book ''Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge'' by Jim Schutze. Filming took place in southern Florida in the summer of 2000.\n\n''Bully'' was given a limited release in the United States on July 14, 2001, and met with mixed critical responses, though many critics noted the film's disturbing and straightforward handling of youth crime and murder.<ref name=RottenTomatoes>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bully/|title=Bully (2001)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[South Florida]] high school dropouts Ali Willis ([[Bijou Phillips]]) and Lisa Connelly ([[Rachel Miner]]) befriend [[Bobby Kent]] ([[Nick Stahl]]) and Marty Puccio ([[Brad Renfro]]), employees at a local deli. The four all go out on a double date. Later that evening, in Bobby's parked car, Ali performs [[oral sex]] on Bobby, while Lisa and Marty have sex in the back seat. Lisa later learns she is pregnant, but is afraid that the child is Bobby's instead of Marty's, since Bobby [[rape]]d her after beating Marty unconscious.\n\nBobby emotionally and physically abuses Marty, who puts up with his violent tendencies. On one occasion, Bobby rapes Ali while trying to force her to watch [[gay pornography|gay male pornography]] with him. Lisa later tells Marty that everyone suspects Bobby is attracted to him. Marty reveals to Lisa that the abuse has been going on since they were boys, starting with Marty taking drugs at an early age, which Marty thinks that Bobby has been using to take advantage of him. Marty and Bobby later go to a gay bar, where Marty is told to strip down to his underwear and dance for money, while Bobby takes pleasure in his humiliation.\n\nLisa eventually proposes that the group murder Bobby. Ali recruits her new boyfriend, the [[marijuana|pot]]-smoking and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-dropping Donny ([[Michael Pitt]]), and his troubled friend, Heather Swallers ([[Kelli Garner]]), who has recently been released from rehab; Lisa recruits her cousin, the shy and nerdy Derek Dzvirko ([[Daniel Franzese]]). They initially plan to kill Bobby with a gun stolen from Lisa's mother. Ali and Lisa take Bobby to the [[Everglades]], with the plan that Lisa will shoot him while he has sex with Ali, but Lisa finds herself unable to do it. Realizing they need help, the group hire a supposed \"hitman\", Derek Kaufman ([[Leo Fitzpatrick]]), a friend of Ali's who is in actuality a tough-talking young man several years older than them.\n\nWith Kaufman's help, they orchestrate a new plan: they all drive to a remote canal, where Ali again lures Bobby with sex. Heather haphazardly initiates a signal to begin the murder, and Donny stabs Bobby in the back of the neck. Horrified by the violence, Ali, Heather, and Dzvirko run back to Ali's car. Bobby begs for mercy, but Marty stabs him in the stomach, [[disembowelment|disemboweling]] him, before slitting his throat. Kaufman proceeds to bludgeon Bobby with a baseball bat. Lisa witnesses it all, never turning away. They dump Bobby in the swamp, and presume alligators will consume his corpse.\n\nMarty later realizes that he left the sheath to his diving knife at the canal. They go to retrieve the sheath, and check on the corpse, which is now being eaten by crabs. Lisa, Dzvirko, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong, since they did not directly participate in Bobby's actual death. Lisa decides to dispose of the knife, which is the only evidence linking them to the crime.\n\nUnable to maintain the secret, Dzvirko and Lisa reveal to their other friends what they've done, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip to the media, alerting them to Bobby's death. Lisa calls Kaufman and speaks to his younger brother, who says that Kaufman has already been arrested for the murder. Eventually, all the teenagers turn themselves in, with the exception of Marty, who is subsequently arrested. Some time later, the group appear in court, wearing prison jumpsuits, with Lisa visibly pregnant by this time. Marty and Donny begin to argue, leading the others to join in as they each respectively deny their culpability in front of an onlooking courtroom.\n\nTitle cards reveal their convictions: Derek Kaufman, Donny, and Lisa receive [[life sentence]]s, Ali receives 40 years, Derek Dzvirko receives 11 years, Heather receives 7 years, and Marty is [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as Martin \"Marty\" Puccio  \n* [[Bijou Phillips]] as Ali Willis  \n* [[Rachel Miner]] as Lisa Connelly  \n* [[Nick Stahl]] as [[Murder of Bobby Kent|Bobby Kent]]\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Donny Semenec\n* [[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Derek Kaufman \n* [[Kelli Garner]] as Heather Swallers  \n* [[Daniel Franzese]] as Derek Dzvirko  \n* [[Nathalie Paulding]] as Claudia\n* [[Olivia Burnette]] as Jennifer Stable\n* [[Jessica Sutta]] as Blonde\n* [[Ed Amatrudo|Edward Amatrudo]] as Fred Kent \n* Deborah Smith Ford as Farah Kent\n* Steven Raulerson as Mr. Willis\n* Judith Clayton as Mrs. Willis\n* Alan Lilly as Martin Joseph Puccio, Sr.\n* Irene B.

His film has all the sadness and shabbiness, all the mess and cruelty and thoughtless stupidity of the real thing...If the director doesn't have a strong personal feeling about material like this, he shouldn't be making movies about it...Clark is not some objectified, outside adult observer making an after-school special, but an artist who has made a leap into this teenage mindscape...I believe ''Bully'' is a masterpiece on its own terms, a frightening indictment of a society that offers absolutely nothing to some of its children\u2014and an indictment of the children, who lack the imagination and courage to try to escape.
