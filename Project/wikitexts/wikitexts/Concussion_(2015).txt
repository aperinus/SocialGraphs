2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Set during the 2000s, the film stars [[Will Smith]] as [[Bennet Omalu|Dr. Bennet Omalu]], a forensic pathologist who fights against the [[National Football League]] trying to suppress his research on [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players.\n\nThe film premiered at [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] on November 11, 2015 and was released  by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\n\nRetired [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] [[Mike Webster]] is found dead in his [[pickup truck]], after years of [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] and [[homelessness]]. Before his death, fellow former [[American Football|football]] player [[Justin Strzelczyk]] confides in Webster that he is suffering from memory loss, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. Webster deliriously responds by reciting from his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] speech, that the most important thing \"is to finish the game\".\n\n[[Bennet Omalu|Dr. Bennet Omalu]] (Will Smith), a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] with the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] [[coroner]]'s office, handles Webster's [[autopsy]]. Wondering how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, he closely examines [[microscope slide]]s of Webster's brain, seeing evidence of severe [[brain damage|neurotrauma]]. He concludes that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE).\n\nWith the help of former Steelers [[team doctor]] Julian Bailes, fellow [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Steven T. DeKosky|Dr. Steven DeKosky]] and county coroner [[Cyril Wecht|Dr. Cyril Wecht]], Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in [[Neurosurgery (journal)|''Neurosurgery'']], which are dismissed by the [[National Football League|NFL]]. In subsequent years, Dr. Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk and two other deceased NFL players, [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]] and [[Andre Waters]], exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. \n\nDr. Omalu persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee, but he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing former NFL employee Bailes to the presentation in his place. The NFL does not take the findings seriously and claim the players' head trauma is unrelated to football. Former [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] executive [[Dave Duerson]] angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to [[Africa]].\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in [[Pittsburgh]], providing jobs and college opportunities. Wecht is subject to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is threatened with [[deportation]] and a prison sentence on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. His wife, Prema, suffers a [[miscarriage]] after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to [[Lodi, California]] where he takes a job with the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits [[suicide]] due to his inability to cope with worsening [[cognitive skill|cognitive function]]. In his [[suicide note]], he acknowledges Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. The doctor is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He says that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace.\n\nAmid growing scrutiny from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, [[2011 NFL lockout|NFL players sue the league]] for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of [[Medical examiner|Chief Medical Examiner]] for the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], but Omalu turned the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming [[Naturalization|naturalized]] as a [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizen]] in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of [[Junior Seau]]'s suicide in 2012 and subsequent [[Concussions in American football#Federal NFL concussion litigation|lawsuits]] brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Dr. Julian Bailes\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Dr. [[Cyril Wecht]]\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Prema Mutiso\n* [[David Morse]] as [[Mike Webster]]\n** Ben McDonnell as young [[Mike Webster]]\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Dr. [[Joseph Maroon]]\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Daniel Sullivan\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Dr. [[Steven T.
