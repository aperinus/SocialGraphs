Written by [[Kevin Brodbin]] and [[Frank Cappello]], it is loosely based on [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Hellblazer]]'' comic book. The film stars [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Constantine]], a cynical [[exorcist]] with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true forms and to travel between Earth and Hell. [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Gavin Rossdale]], and [[Peter Stormare]] also feature.\n\n''Constantine'' was released theatrically in the United States on February 18, 2005. It grossed $230.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $70\u2013100 million, but met with a mixed reception from film critics. A sequel is currently in development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=2022-09-16 |title=Warner Bros Sets 'Constantine' Sequel; Keanu Reeves & Francis Lawrence To Reunite, Akiva Goldsman Scripting & Producing With Bad Robot's JJ Abrams & Hannah Minghella |url=https://deadline.com/2022/09/constantine-sequel-keanu-reeves-francis-lawrence-warner-bros-dc-akiva-goldsman-scripting-producing-bad-robot-jj-abrams-hannah-minghella-1235121127/ |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=Deadline |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!---Gabriel has been established as androgynous, being neither male nor female. Please keep this in mind as you edit so that you may avoid using terms which would apply to a gender.-->\nIn Mexico, a scavenger recovers the tip of the [[Holy Lance|spear that pierced Jesus Christ]] from a ruined church and, after becoming possessed, takes it to Los Angeles. There, cynical occult expert [[John Constantine]] exorcises a demon from a young girl after witnessing its attempt to come through her to Earth, something that should be impossible because of a treaty between Heaven and Hell. Suffering from terminal lung cancer, Constantine meets with the half-breed angel [[List of Hellblazer characters#Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]] to request an extension to his life in exchange for his work deporting Hell's forces. Gabriel responds that performing good deeds for selfish reasons will not secure his way into Heaven.\n\nElsewhere, detective Angela Dodson is investigating the death of her twin sister Isabel who leaped from a psychiatric hospital roof. Angela refuses to believe her sister, a devout [[Catholic]], would commit suicide and condemn herself to Hell. Watching security footage, Angela hears Isabel say \"Constantine\", and seeks out his assistance. He refuses to help until he witnesses demons pursuing Angela and fends them off. He uses a ritual to see Isabel in Hell and confirms she killed herself. Constantine tells Angela that he committed suicide as a teenager because he was traumatized by seeing supernatural creatures and, though he was revived, when he dies he is condemned to Hell.\n\nAt the morgue, Constantine's friend Father Hennesy discovers a symbol on Isabel's wrist but is killed by the half-breed demon Balthazar. Constantine and Angela discover Hennesy carved the symbol into his hand for them to find. Angela also finds a clue hidden in Isabel's hospital room concerning a chapter of Hell's bible. Before being killed by Balthazar, Constantine's ally Beeman tells the pair the symbol represents the [[antichrist]] [[Mammon]], [[Lucifer]]'s son, and the chapter prophesies him usurping his father and conquering the Earth, using a powerful psychic and divine assistance; the psychic, Isabel, killed herself to stop Mammon. Angela reveals she possessed powers like Isabel's but repressed them to avoid being deemed insane like her sister. Constantine helps Angela reawaken her powers by inducing a [[near-death experience]], and she uses them to find Balthazar.\n\nConstantine interrogates Balthazar and learns that the [[blood of Christ]] on the spear tip is Mammon's divine assistance, and Angela has been chosen as his new host. An unseen entity destroys Balthazar and abducts Angela who becomes possessed by Mammon. With the help of [[witch doctor]] [[Papa Midnite]], Constantine induces visions to locate Angela at the psychiatric hospital. Alongside his driver and apprentice, Chas Kramer, Constantine arms himself and assaults the building, battling through hordes of demons to Angela. Constantine and Chas seemingly exorcise Mammon from her, but Chas is killed by the unseen force, revealed to be Gabriel. Resentful at [[God]]'s favoritism for humanity and forgiveness for even the most wicked, Gabriel intends to unleash Hell on Earth so that those who survive will become truly \"worthy\" of His love. Gabriel tosses Constantine away and prepares to pierce Angela with the spear tip to unleash Mammon.\n\nDesperate, Constantine commits suicide by slitting his wrists, knowing that Lucifer will personally come to collect him. Time pauses and Constantine convinces Lucifer to intervene and stop Mammon. Gabriel ineffectually attempts to smite Lucifer, revealing God has abandoned them, and Lucifer burns away Gabriel's wings before banishing Mammon to Hell. Lucifer offers to restore Constantine to life for his assistance, but he instead asks that Isabel be sent to Heaven. Lucifer releases Isabel, but Constantine begins ascending to Heaven for his selfless sacrifice. Infuriated, Lucifer restores Constantine to life and removes his cancer, believing that, in time, he will prove he belongs in Hell. Constantine punches the now-mortal Gabriel before leaving and entrusts Angela with securing the spear tip. In a [[post-credits scene]], Constantine visits Chas's grave and witnesses Chas in an angelic form.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Constantine]], a chain-smoking cynic with the ability to perceive the true [[wikt:visage|visage]] of half-angels and half-demons on the human [[Astral plane|plane]].

In the finished film, however, the role consists of two brief shots and one line of dialogue (\"Holy water?\") during Constantine's climactic confrontation with the group of half-breeds in the hospital. Director Francis Lawrence said Ellie's relationship with Constantine was cut to make him more of a lonely character.<ref>{{cite web |title=Director Francis Lawrence Discusses \"Constantine\" and Keanu Reeves |url=http://movies.about.com/od/constantine/a/constntfl021705.htm |work=About.com |access-date=November 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621111241/http://movies.about.com/od/constantine/a/constntfl021705.htm |archive-date=June 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe character of [[John Constantine]] was introduced by comic book writer/creator [[Alan Moore]] in ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)#Second series|The Saga of Swamp Thing]]'' #37, released in June 1985.<ref>Markstein, Don. \"Don Markstein's Toonopedia: John Constantine\".
