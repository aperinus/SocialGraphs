The movie is about the [[Punk rock in California|Los Angeles punk rock scene]] and was directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]]. In 1981, the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[Chief of Police]] [[Daryl Gates]] wrote a letter demanding the film not be shown again in the city.<ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite web| url=http://penelopespheeris.com/bio | title=Penelope Spheeris Biography | website=PenelopeSpheeris.com | date=2008 | access-date=June 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film's title is possibly a reference to music critic [[Lester Bangs]]' 1970 two-part review of [[the Stooges]]' album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, where Bangs quotes a friend who had said the popularity of the Stooges signaled \"the decline of Western civilization\". Another possibility is that the title refers to [[Darby Crash]]'s reading of [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''Der Untergang des Abendlandes'' (''[[The Decline of the West]]'').<ref name=\"Bibliography\">{{cite news |url = http://www.laweekly.com/2001-01-04/news/annihilation-man/3 | title=Annihilation Man | author=Brendan Mullen | work=LA Weekly| date=January 4, 2001 | access-date=October 26, 2009}}</ref> In ''[[We Got the Neutron Bomb]]'', an oral history of the L.A. punk rock scene collected by [[Marc Spitz]], [[Claude Bessy (singer)|Claude Bessy]] aka: Kickboy, claims that he came up with the title.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spitz|first1=Marc|title=We Got the Neutron Bomb: The Untold Story of L.A.

The second film, ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]]'' (1988), covers the Los Angeles [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scene of 1987\u20131988. The third film, ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization III]]'' (1998), chronicles the [[gutter punk]] lifestyle of homeless teenagers in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2016, ''The Decline of Western Civilization'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=With \"20,000 Leagues,\" the National Film Registry Reaches 700|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFeaturing concert footage of Los Angeles punk bands and interviews both with band members, the publishers of ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' [[fanzine]], and with the punks who made up their audience, the film offers a look into a [[subculture]] that was largely ignored by the rock music press of the time.\n\nThe promotional poster for ''The Decline'' (and the record cover of the soundtrack album) featured a close-up frame of Germs singer [[Darby Crash]] [[Supine position|supine]] on stage with his eyes closed. Crash died from a heroin-induced suicide shortly before the film was released (the poster was designed before his death).\n\nBands included are [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Germs (band)|Germs]], [[X (American band)|X]], [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Alice Bag Band]], the [[Circle Jerks]], [[Catholic Discipline]], and [[Fear (band)|Fear]].
