The film stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Anna Paquin]] and [[Dean Stockwell]]. It follows a group of American soldiers stationed in [[West Germany]] during 1989 just before the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].\n\n''Buffalo Soldiers'' had its world premiere at the [[2001 Toronto International Film Festival|26th Toronto International Film Festival]] on 8 September 2001, and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom by [[Path\u00e9|Path\u00e9 Distribution]] on 18 July 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/buffalo-soldiers-finally-gets-uk-release/4013844.article|title=Buffalo Soldiers finally gets UK release|last=Minns|first=Adam|date=13 June 2003|website=[[Screen International]]|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref> The film began a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] in the United States on 25 July 2003, followed by a [[wide release]] on 8 August 2003, by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]]. It earned five nominations at the [[British Independent Film Awards 2003|6th British Independent Film Awards]], including [[BIFA Award for Best British Independent Film|Best British Independent Film]] and [[BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film|Best Actor]] for Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bifa.film/awards/2003/winners-nominations/|title=Winners & Nominations {{!}} The Awards 2003|website=[[British Independent Film Awards|BIFA]]|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Specialist (rank)|Supply Specialist]] (SPC) Ray Elwood is a disillusioned enlisted soldier stationed in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]]. With much spare time, he participates in [[black market]]eering and cooking [[heroin]] for several corrupt [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] (MPs) led by the menacing Sergeant Saad. His firm yet empathic Commanding Officer, Colonel Berman, thinks of SPC Elwood as a close friend and has no idea he's stealing Brigade Command supplies and having an affair with his wife. However, Elwood's uneventful existence changes when a new [[First Sergeant]] (\u201cTop\u201d / 1SG), Robert E. Lee, joins the Brigade's supply company. Lee is a [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] combat veteran who presents a strict and intimidating demeanor, quickly determining that Elwood and his squad are engaged in graft and other criminal activities.\n\nA three-man Army tank crew, under the strong influence of the heroin that Elwood cooked for the MPs, unintentionally kills two soldiers in charge of a weapons truck convoy by inadvertently crashing through a gas station's fuel pumps and detonating them. Elwood stumbles across the trucks, discovers and steals the weapons, and hides them in medical equipment boxes stored at a missile base. When later harassed by Lee for his extravagant barracks room, Elwood's attempt at [[bribery]] backfires; Lee subsequently revokes Elwood's privileges, destroys his property, and orders a new, inexperienced and by-the-book Soldier, [[Private first class|PFC]] Knoll, to bunk in his room. To get back at Lee, Elwood begins a sexual relationship with his daughter, Robyn. Lee retaliates by making Elwood destroy his beloved [[Mercedes-Benz]] with an [[M60 machine gun]] during a live-fire weapons exercise. Lee also boobytraps a locker that is used to hide heroin with a [[grenade]] that kills Stoney, one of Elwood's friends.\n\nElwood sells the stolen weapons to a Turkish gangster, accepting a large amount of raw [[opium]] as payment. However, to save Knoll from being killed by Saad in a fight, Elwood is forced to make Saad a business partner in cooking the opium. In order to get the weapons out of the missile base and collect the drugs, Elwood sells out Berman so a competing Infantry Regiment can easily capture their positions during a mobilization/defense operations exercise. Later, Berman reluctantly tells Elwood he has been relieved from Brigade Command but this has given him time to reflect \u2014 he'll retire from the Army and buy a vineyard in [[California]].\n\nOn 9 November, the night the [[Berlin Wall]] comes down, Elwood sneaks to the base swimming pool to meet Robyn while the opium is being cooked by his squad and the MPs. Knoll and Lee arrive. Elwood then discovers Knoll is actually an undercover [[2nd Lieutenant#United States|2nd Lieutenant]] from the [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Inspector General's Office]] and [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]]. While Knoll escorts Robyn away, she tells him her father intends to kill Elwood, something Knoll{{snd}}as a professional officer{{snd}}cannot allow. Meanwhile, Saad, intoxicated by the overwhelming opium fumes, provokes a shootout with [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] [[commando]]s sent to arrest everyone in the drug lab. Upstairs, just as Knoll prevents Lee at gunpoint from pushing Elwood out of a top-floor window, the building explodes from a growing gas leak and increasing heat generated by weapons fire. Elwood and Lee are blown out of the building's top floor by the massive impact. Elwood strangles Lee with his handcuffs and lands on top of him, surviving the fall.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Army's top commanders posthumously award Lee a [[Silver Star]] and also decorate Elwood, who is transferred to a new assignment in [[Hawaii]]. He tells his new commanding officer, who is just as dull-witted as Colonel Berman, that Robyn remains his girlfriend and she will be visiting soon. The film ends with Elwood submitting a requisition order for more excessive supplies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Specialist (SPC) Ray Elwood\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Colonel (COL) Berman\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as First Sergeant (1SG) Robert E.

Several former US Army bases that had recently been handed back to German control, like the depot at [[Siegelsbach]], were used as locations. The U. S. Army declined to support the film, for that reason military vehicles had to be rented from commercial companies and private collectors. Though a US tank platoon is equipped with [[Leopard 1]] tanks.\n\n==Release==\nThe world premiere was held at the 2001 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in early September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalhit.com/torontofilmfestival/2001/3/|title=26th Toronto International Film Festival Coverage: Day Three|work=Digital Hit|access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref> However, being a [[satire (film and television)|satire]] of the [[Military of the United States|US military]], the film's wider theatrical run was delayed by approximately two years because of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Angry viewers objected to alleged \"anti-American\" sentiments of the film, deeming it \"unpatriotic\". At a press conference a woman threw a water bottle at Anna Paquin. By the time the film was eventually released stateside on July 25, 2003, much of the momentum of the film had dissolved, and the positive reviews of the film did not help its reception.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/25/movies/film-review-a-portrait-of-the-army-but-few-heroes-in-sight.html|title=Film Review; A Portrait of the Army, but Few Heroes in Sight|work=The New York Times|first=A.
