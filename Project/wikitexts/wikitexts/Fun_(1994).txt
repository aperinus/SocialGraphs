It was lots of fun.\"<ref name=\"people\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s detailing the girls' relationship (in color), and their time in juvenile detention center (in black and white). Bonnie, aged 14, and Hillary, aged 15, meet at a bus stop in [[Los Angeles]], California, and begin a friendship. They stroll around their city, chuck rocks onto a [[highway]] from an overpass bridge, run rampant in shopping malls, and play [[video games]].\n\nTheir day escalates into an eruption of violence and rage when they brutally stab an elderly woman to death. They then run to a [[gas station]] and attempt to wash off the blood from their clothes. After their arrest, they claim that the murder was purely just for \"fun\". The story moves from the juvenile detention center where the girls are kept, to the girls on the day of the killing.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Renee Humphrey|Ren\u00e9e Humphrey]] as Hillary\n*[[Alicia Witt]] as Bonnie\n*[[William R.
