It co-stars [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[J. Smith-Cameron]], [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]], and [[Vanessa Lee Chester]]. Based on the [[Harriet the Spy|1964 novel of the same name]] by [[Louise Fitzhugh]], the film follows a sixth-grade student who aspires to become a writer and [[spy]].\n\nFilming began in the fall of 1994 in [[Toronto]] and was completed by the end of 1995. Produced by [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Nickelodeon Movies]] and [[Rastar]], it was the first film produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner and the first of two film adaptations of the ''Harriet the Spy'' books. In theaters, the pilot episode of ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'' called ''Arnold'' was shown before the film.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on July 10, 1996. It made $26.6 million worldwide on a production budget of $12 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film was released on home video on February 25, 1997, with an orange [[Clamshell (container)|clamshell]] packaging.\n\n==Plot==\nEleven-year-old [[sixth grade]]r Harriet M. Welsch, an aspiring spy and writer, lives a privileged life in [[New York City]] with her parents, Violetta and Ben, and her [[nanny]], Katherine \"Ole Golly\", the only person who knows all that Harriet has been snooping on. Harriet and her best friends Simon \"Sport\" Rocque and Janie Gibbs are enemies with an [[elitist]] rich girl named Marion Hawthorne, currently the class president and editor of the sixth-grade newspaper, ''The Guidepost''.\n\nOne night while alone with Harriet, whose parents are out of the house for the night, Golly invites a friend, George Waldenstein, over for dinner. After Golly accidentally burns the bratwurst, the three go out to dinner and a movie instead. When the three return home late in the evening, Violetta, enraged at Golly for letting Harriet stay out past her curfew, initially fires her, but quickly regrets this and begs for Golly to stay. However, Golly concedes that Harriet should be on her own, and shortly before departing, she encourages Harriet to never give up on her love for observing people, and promises her that she will be the first to buy her own autographed copy of Harriet's first novel. After bidding Golly goodbye, Harriet becomes depressed and withdrawn. While spying on people in various areas of the city, Harriet breaks into the mansion of Agatha Plummer, and gets caught hiding in her [[dumbwaiter]].\n\nAfter school the next day, following a game of bumper tag, Marion discovers Harriet's private notebook and begins vindictively reading all of Harriet's comments about her friends aloud in a sensationalizing manner, such as how she suspects Janie will \"grow up to be... a total nutcase\", and teasing Sport's father for barely earning any money. This results in Sport and Janie turning their backs on Harriet. Harriet's classmates subsequently create a Spy-Catcher club and torment Harriet on her spy routes.\n\nWhen Harriet begins avoiding her homework assignments, her parents take away her notebooks and request that her teacher, Miss Elson, search Harriet each day at school for notebooks, embarrassing Harriet. One day, during art class, Marion and her friends intentionally pour blue paint on Harriet, who slaps Marion in the face and flees the school. Harriet exacts revenge against her classmates, including exposing that Marion's father left her family to be with his [[secretary]] because he never loved her, cutting off a chunk of Laura's hair, sabotaging one of Janie's science experiments (triggering an angry response from Janie's parents), and humiliating Sport with a picture of him in a maid outfit. Harriet's revenge plans enrage her classmates, further alienating her.\n\nHarriet's parents discover her actions towards her classmates and send her to be evaluated by a psychologist, who assures them that Harriet is fine. Then things start to get better again. Harriet gets her notebook back, as well as a surprise visit from Golly, who tells her that in order to make things right again, she must do two things, both of which she will not like: apologize and lie. When Harriet tells her that it is not worth it, Golly disagrees, and tells Harriet that she is worth it as an individual, and her individuality will make others nervous (and keep making them feel as such), before finally adding, \"Good friends are one of life's blessings. Don't give them up without a fight.\"\n\nHarriet then tries to apologize to Sport and Janie, though they initially reject her (they later, however, quit Marion's bully group due to being treated unfairly, greatly upsetting Marion). Harriet also opines to Miss Elson and the class that Marion's appointment as editor of the sixth grade paper was done unfairly, to which Miss Elson agrees, and opens it up for a vote. Harriet's classmates vote her in as editor, replacing Marion. Through one article, she apologizes to the class, all of whom (except Marion) accept her apology. On opening night of the 6th grade pageant, Janie, Sport, and Harriet light off a stink bomb as revenge on Marion and dance to [[James Brown]]'s \"[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Harriet M.

So those things needed to be made more natural for the 1990s kids audience.
