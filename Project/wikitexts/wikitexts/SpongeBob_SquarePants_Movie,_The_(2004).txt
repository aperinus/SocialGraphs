The film was directed, co-written, and produced by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], with live-action sequences directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]]. It features the [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members|series' regular voice cast]] with [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Jeffrey Tambor]] voicing new characters and [[David Hasselhoff]] appearing as himself. It is the first film in the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (film series)|''SpongeBob SquarePants'' film series]]. In this film, [[Plankton and Karen|Plankton]] enacts a plan to discredit his business nemesis [[Mr. Krabs]], steal the [[Krabby Patty]] secret formula and take over the world by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and their world from Plankton's rule.\n\nHillenburg accepted an offer for a film adaptation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' from [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2002, after having turned it down multiple times the previous year. He assembled a team from the show's writing staff, including himself, [[Derek Drymon]], [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], [[Kent Osborne]], [[Aaron Springer]], and [[Paul Tibbitt]], and they structured the film as a mythical [[hero's journey]] that would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended to serve as the [[series finale]], but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, with Tibbitt taking his place.\n\n''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' premiered in Los Angeles on November 14, 2004, and was released in the United States on November 19. It grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the [[List of animated feature films of 2004#Highest grossing animated films of 2004|sixth highest-grossing animated film of 2004]]. Two [[standalone sequel]]s have been released: ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' (2015) and ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' (2020), with a fourth film currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn Bikini Bottom, [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] prepares for the opening ceremony of the Krusty Krab 2 (located next to the original [[Krusty Krab]]), believing that his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] will promote him as manager. At the ceremony, the title is instead given to his co-worker [[Squidward Tentacles]]. Krabs says that Squidward is more mature and that SpongeBob is \"just a kid\" who is unable to handle the task, upsetting SpongeBob.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Plankton and Karen|Plankton]] laments over his futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world, until his computer wife [[Plankton and Karen|Karen]] reminds him of \"Plan Z\". At night, Plankton carries out the plan by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and sending it to Shell City, leaving false evidence behind to frame Krabs for the crime. That same night, SpongeBob heads to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's, where he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend [[Patrick Star]], and wakes up the next morning with a hangover. King Neptune goes to the Krusty Krab 2 to confront Krabs about his stolen crown. The still-hungover SpongeBob also arrives and bad-mouths Krabs, but afterwards promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return with the crown within six days in order to spare Krabs's life. Neptune's daughter Mindy warns SpongeBob and Patrick of the dangers of Shell City, including \"the Cyclops\", a monster who kidnaps innocent sea creatures. SpongeBob and Patrick head off for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a Krabby Patty-shaped car stored underneath the restaurant.\n\nBack in Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula from the frozen Krabs and uses it to sell Krabby Patties. When Karen informs him that SpongeBob and Patrick are attempting to reclaim Neptune's crown, Plankton reveals he has hired a hitman named Dennis to eliminate the duo. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown, and confronts him at his reseatuarnt, the Chum Bucket. Before Squidward can leave and alert Neptune, Plankton activates his mind-controlling bucket helmets to enslave the residents of Bikini Bottom, enslaving Squidward as well. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick come across a hazardous trench and lose the Patty Wagon. On the verge of giving up, Mindy appears and gives them encouragement by using her \"mermaid magic\" to bestow seaweed mustaches on them, fooling them that they have matured from boys into men. The two then successfully pass the trench.\n\nSpongeBob and Patrick meet Dennis, who reveals that the mustaches are fake. He tries to crush them with his giant boot, but is abruptly stomped on by a larger boot - which belongs to the Cyclops (a [[Underwater diving|diver]]). The Cyclops captures SpongeBob and Patrick and takes them to his store by the beach where dried sea creatures are sold as souvenirs, which is in fact \"Shell City\" itself. SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, only to dry out and die from the intensity of the Cyclops' heat lamp. However, the tears they shed short-circuit the lamp, activating the emergency sprinkler system and reviving all the dried sea creatures. While the vengeful sea creatures attack the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head to the beach. After accidentally losing their way home, [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. On the way, Dennis catches up to them, but gets knocked off Hasselhoff's back into the sea when he passes underneath a [[catamaran]].\n\nBack at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Krabs, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just in time. Plankton drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune and surrounds SpongeBob, Patrick and Mindy with his army of slaves. SpongeBob, embracing the fact that he's accomplished so much despite being a kid, uses the power of rock and roll to play \"Goofy Goober Rock\", freeing Neptune and the citizens of Bikini Bottom from the buckets with his magic guitar. Plankton is arrested by the police, and King Neptune rewards SpongeBob for his bravery by unfreezing Krabs. A jubilant Krabs gives SpongeBob the job as manager of the Krusty Krab 2.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members|l1=List of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' cast members|List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters|l2=List of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters}}\n<!--This list includes the main cast only, as enumerated in the film's credits.
