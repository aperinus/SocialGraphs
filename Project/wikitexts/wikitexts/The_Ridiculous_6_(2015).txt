As [[Happy Madison Productions]]' first Western film, the plot follows six men who discover that they share the same bank-robbing father ([[Nick Nolte]]) and thereafter set out to reunite with him.\n\nReleased worldwide on [[Netflix]] on December 11, 2015, the film was panned by critics and is one of  the few films to receive an [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|approval rating of 0%]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\"tomatoes\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[American frontier|Old West]], Tommy ([[Adam Sandler]]), known as \"White Knife\" by the American Indian tribe who raised him after his mother was murdered, is to marry a member of the tribe named Smoking Fox ([[Julia Jones]]) as arranged by his adoptive father Chief Screaming Eagle ([[Saginaw Grant]]). Following a run-in with Will Patch ([[Will Forte]]) and his Left-Eye Gang who claimed to have removed their right eye, as well as a one-eyed food proprietor named Clem ([[Steve Zahn]]), Tommy is visited by a bank robber named Frank Stockburn ([[Nick Nolte]]) who claims to be his biological father. Frank tells Tommy that he is dying of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and had amassed $50,000 buried in a meadow, which he offers to Tommy and his tribe.\n\nThe next day, a group of bandits led by the ruthless Cicero ([[Danny Trejo]]) come to the village and want Frank to give them his \"big score.\u201d Frank has the bandits kidnap him so he can lead them to the money at the so-called \"Singing Windmill\", in return for the bandits not attacking Tommy or the Natives. After searching the meadow Tommy is unable to find the stash of money and sets off on a quest to steal the amount needed and save his father.\n\nDuring his journey, Tommy discovers that he has 5 half-brothers: [[Mexicans|Mexican]] burro rider Ramon ([[Rob Schneider]]) whose innkeeper mother had a fling with Frank; mentally challenged yet happy-go-lucky Lil' Pete ([[Taylor Lautner]]) whose strong neck makes him immune to hanging; [[mountain man]] Herm ([[Jorge Garcia]]) who speaks incomprehensibly and helped his mother sell their moonshine; a drunkard named Danny ([[Luke Wilson]]) who was the former bodyguard of [[Abraham Lincoln]] ([[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]]) and is guilt-ridden from accidentally leading [[John Wilkes Booth]] ([[Chris Kattan]]) to [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|murder the president]] when he mistook him for a fan of the president on his way to the restroom; and African-American saloon pianist Chico ([[Terry Crews]]) who confesses to being [[biracial|half-White]].\n\nMeanwhile, Clem joins the Left-Eye Gang at the cost of his only functional eye and helps them abduct Smoking Fox. She escapes due to Clem's blindness and begins searching for Tommy and his half-brothers, now known as the Ridiculous 6.\n\nAfter meeting Chico and Danny, the half-brothers have a run in with Chico's boss, sociopathic saloon owner Smiley Harris ([[Harvey Keitel]]), who was part of Frank's gang until Frank stole his cut of their biggest score and left him to die at the windmill. When Smiley attempts to kill the half-brothers out of revenge against Frank, he ends up being unintentionally decapitated by Ramon. The group later encounters [[Abner Doubleday]] ([[John Turturro]]) who is [[Doubleday myth|developing baseball]] with some Chinese immigrants.\n\nThe Left-Eye Gang soon catch up to the Ridiculous 6 while the latter are relaxing in a pond. The gang overpowers the Ridiculous 6 and steal their loot. Through Herm's ramblings, translated by Tommy, the Ridiculous 6 then decide to rob a gambling game in Yuma hosted by Ezekiel Grant ([[Jon Lovitz]]) and attended by [[Mark Twain]] ([[Vanilla Ice]]) and General [[George Armstrong Custer]] ([[David Spade]]). The Ridiculous 6 succeed, though [[Wyatt Earp]] ([[Blake Shelton]]) nearly jeopardizes their plan, and set off to ransom their father.\n\nOn the way, the Ridiculous 6 come across the Left-Eye Gang who have been left to die in the desert by Cicero. Tommy and the brothers rescue the Left-Eye Gang and reclaim the $50,000 they had stolen from them. That evening, Tommy sees a photograph carried by Danny that proves Cicero is the one who murdered his mother and sets off alone to rescue his father and confront the bandit leader. After meeting with Cicero and paying the ransom, Tommy confronts Cicero just and gets his revenge on his mother's killer.\n\nThe Ridiculous 6, who followed Tommy along with the Left-Eye Gang, have a reunion with their long-lost father. When Frank learns his sons exceeded his expectations by amassing $100,000, he reveals that he masterminded his abduction. But Tommy counters that his group had a Plan B: a hidden bomb inside the bag containing the ransom money. When the bomb explodes and commotion ensues, Frank runs off to a mine with Smoking Fox as his hostage. Tommy runs after them and successfully rescues his bride-to-be and captures his father.\n\nBack in the Native Village, Tommy weds Smoking Fox with his half-brothers in attendance. Since the revelation that their biological father Frank Stockburn was no more than a two-bit crook, Screaming Eagle decides to adopt all the half-brothers as he did with Tommy. The Left-Eye Gang revealed that they lied about removing their right eyes, much to the anger of Clem.\n\nIn the post-credits, Abner Doubleday and his Chinese baseball team do a chant to detail their appreciation for the Stockburns.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Tommy \"White Knife\" Dunson Stockburn, a man who was raised by American Indians.\n** Henry Steckman as Young Tommy Stockburn\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Chico Stockburn, a biracial saloon pianist and the half-brother of Tommy.\n* [[Jorge Garcia]] as Herm Stockburn, a [[mountain man]] and the half-brother of Tommy who speaks incomprehensibly.\n** [[Robin Leach]] as the voice of Herm Stockburn.\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as Pete \"Lil Pete\" Stockburn, a strong-necked man with a happy-go-lucky personality and the half-brother of Tommy.\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Ramon Lopez Stockburn, a Mexican burro rider and the half-brother of Tommy.\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Danny Stockburn, the former bodyguard of Abraham Lincoln and the half-brother of Tommy.\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Frank Stockburn, a bank robber who is the biological father of Tommy, Chico, Herm, Lil' Pete, Ramon, and Danny.\n* [[Will Forte]] as Will Patch, the leader of the Left-Eye Gang.\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Nelly Patch, a member of the Left-Eye Gang.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Clem, a former general store owner with one eye who sides with the Left-Eye Gang.\n* [[Julia Jones]] as Smoking Fox, a member of the Native American tribe that is assigned to marry Tommy.\n* [[Lavell Crawford]] as Gus Patch, a member of the Left-Eye Gang.\n* [[Jared Sandler]] as Babyface Patch, a member of the Left-Eye Gang.\n* Paul Sado as \"Stumbles\" Patch, a member of the Left-Eye Gang.\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Cicero, the leader of a group of bandits who targets Frank.\n* Ruben Rivera Young as Young Cicero\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as \"Smiley\" Harris, the owner of \"The Golden Nugget\" that Chico works for and former member of Frank's gang.\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as \"Doc\" Griffin, a doctor, dentist, and barber that works near \"The Golden Nugget.\"\n* [[David Spade]] as [[George Armstrong Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]], he is seen attending a gambling game.\n* Dana Goodman as Beaver Breath, a Native American whose name Will unintentionally guess the name of.\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Susannah\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Ezekiel Grant, the host of a gambling game.\n* [[Saginaw Grant]] as Screaming Eagle, the [[tribal chief]] of the Native American tribe that adopted Tommy.\n* [[Norm Macdonald]] as \"The Golden Nugget\" Customer.
