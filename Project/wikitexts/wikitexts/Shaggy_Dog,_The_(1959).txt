Directed by [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]] from a screenplay by [[Lillie Hayward]] and [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], the film stars [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Tommy Kirk]], [[Jean Hagen]], [[Kevin Corcoran]], [[Tim Considine]], [[Roberta Shore]], and [[Annette Funicello]]. The film follows a teenage boy named Wilby Daniels who, by the power of an enchanted ring of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]]s, is [[shapeshifting|transformed]] into a shaggy [[Old English Sheepdog]].\n\nThe film was released on March 19, 1959, and grossed over $9 million during its initial release, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1959. A sequel, ''[[The Shaggy D.A.]]'' (1976), starred [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]], [[Tim Conway]], and [[Suzanne Pleshette]]. It was followed by a [[The Return of the Shaggy Dog|1987 television sequel]], a [[The Shaggy Dog (1994 film)|1994 television remake]] and a [[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|2006 live-action theatrical remake]].\n\n== Plot ==\nWilbur \"Wilby\" Daniels is a boy who is misunderstood by his father, Wilson. Wilson thinks Wilby is crazy half the time because of his elder son's often dangerous inventions. As a retired mailman who often ran afoul of canines, he has a hatred of dogs, and he simply cannot understand why his younger son, Montgomery (\"Moochie\"), would want a dog.\n\nWilby and his rival Buzz Miller go with a French girl named Francesca Andrass\u00e9 to the local museum. Wilby gets separated from the other two, who leave without him. Wilby encounters former acquaintance Professor Plumcutt (whose newspaper Wilby used to deliver), who tells him all about mystical ancient beliefs, including the legend of the Borgia family, who used [[shape-shifting]] as a weapon against their enemies.\n\nOn the way out, Wilby collides with a table that holds a display case of jewelry. He accidentally ends up with one of the rings in the cuff of his pants. It is the cursed Borgia ring, and no sooner does he read the [[inscription]] on it (\"''In canis corpore transmuto''{{-\"}}, which, unknown to Wilby, means, \"Into a dog's body I change\") then he transforms into the Shaggy Dog, named Chiffonn, who is Francesca's shaggy \"Bratislavian sheepdog\", a.k.a [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Confused, Wilby, as a dog, goes to Professor Plumcutt, who says Wilby has invoked the Borgia curse upon himself, which can only be broken through a heroic act of selflessness. After getting chased out of his own house by his enraged father, who fails to recognize him as a dog, Wilby has a series of misadventures while switching back and forth between human form and dog form. Only Moochie and Professor Plumcutt know his true identity, as Wilby has spoken to them both in dog form. While at a local dance in his human form, he accidentally transforms himself into a dog.\n\nFrancesca sees that Chiffon has been acting strangely, and she asks her adoptive father, Dr. Valasky, to watch over Chiffon for the night. As she exits, a secretive associate of Dr. Valasky named Thurm enters. Wilby, as a dog, overhears Thurm and Dr. Valasky discuss plans to steal a government secret.\n\nThe next day, Wilby, as a dog, tells Moochie about the spies. Wilby reveals the secret to his dumbfounded father. As Wilby and Moochie discuss what to do next, Francesca's butler Stefano comes out and drags Wilby into the house. Moochie runs to his father to get help, who goes to the authorities, until Wilson suddenly finds himself accused of being either crazy or a spy.\n\nStefano and Francesca's adoptive father, Dr. Valasky, are discussing plans to steal a government secret, and Wilby, as a dog, overhears. Unfortunately for him, he transforms into human Wilby right in front of the spies and has been discovered, but not before he hears Dr. Valasky expressing his wish to get rid of his own daughter.\n\nThe spies angrily capture Wilby and force Francesca to leave with them, leaving the human Wilby bound and gagged in the closet at once. Fortunately, Moochie sneaks into the house just after Dr. Valasky, Stefano and Francesca leave, and discovers Wilby, who is transformed into a dog, still bound and gagged in the closet.\n\nWhen Buzz appears at the Valasky residence to take Francesca on a date, Wilby, still in his dog form, steals Buzz's hot rod automobile. Buzz reports this to Officers Hansen and Kelly, who are in disbelief until they see the shaggy dog driving Buzz's hot rod. Wilson and Moochie follow Buzz and the police, who end up chasing everyone. The spies attempt to leave aboard a boat, but the police call in the [[water police|harbor patrol]] to apprehend Dr. Valasky and stop his boat. Wilby, in his dog form, swims up and wrestles with the men, as Francesca gets knocked out of the boat. He then saves her life and drags her ashore, which finally breaks the curse of dog form. When Francesca regains her consciousness, Buzz tries to take credit for saving her. This angers Wilby, who is still a dog, so much that he attacks Buzz. Seconds later, Buzz is surprised to find himself wrestling with the ''real'' human Wilby, and the ''real'' Chiffon reappears. Since Chiffon is soaking wet, Francesca concludes that he has ''really'' saved her from the ocean and she hugs and praises him.\n\nNow that Wilson and Chiffon are declared heroes, Francesca is able to leave for Paris without her evil adoptive father and former butler, both of whom have been arrested for [[espionage]]; and she gives Chiffon to the Daniels family for them to keep as her way of thanking them. Since Wilson has gotten such commendation for foiling a spy ring because of \"his love of dogs,\" he has a change of heart over his hatred of dogs, a promise to change his ways, and a sense of humor, while he also realizes that his dog-hating attitude isn't really good anymore, so he allows Moochie to care for Chiffon, as he wanted a dog all along. Wilby and Buzz decide to forget their rivalry over Francesca and resume their friendship instead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Tommy Kirk]] as Wilby Daniels/The Shaggy Dog\n*[[Fred MacMurray]] as Wilson Daniels\n*[[Jean Hagen]] as Freeda Daniels\n*[[Annette Funicello]] as Allison D'Allessio\n*[[Tim Considine]] as Buzz Miller\n*[[Kevin Corcoran]] as Montgomery \"Moochie\" Daniels\n*[[Cecil Kellaway]] as Professor Plumcutt\n*[[Alexander Scourby]] as Dr. Mikhail Andrassy\n*[[Roberta Shore]] as Francesca Andrassy\n*[[James Westerfield]] as Officer Hanson\n*[[Strother Martin]] as Thurm\n*[[Forrest Lewis]] as Officer Kelly\n*[[Ned Wever]] as Security Agent E.P.

Prior to that film's release, Walt Disney bought the rights to five more Salten novels in May 1941, as well as options to have him adapt them. The novels were ''Bambi's Children'', ''Perri'', ''Renni'', ''City Jungle'', and ''The Hound of Florence''. He did not want to make ''Bambi's Children'' but did not want anyone else to make it; however, he intended to make the other films as cartoons. Salten was then living in [[Switzerland]] and was paid out of funds owing to Disney's then-distributor [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] which had been \"frozen\" in that country; this would be credited against money RKO owed Disney for distributing his films.<ref>Walt Disney Acquires Rights to 5 Works by Felix Salten By DOUGLAS W. CHURCHILL ''New York Times'' May 5, 1941: 13.</ref> (Salten would die in Zurich in 1945.)\n\nIn June 1955, when Disney was making ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', he said he still had no plans to film ''The Hound of Florence''.<ref>BY WAY OF REPORT: Of Disney's Dog Cartoon Feature -- Other Items By A.

''New York Times'' June 29, 1952: X3.</ref> However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] wanted Disney to make another TV series, and he pitched them ''The Shaggy Dog'', \"a story that treated the younger generation and its problems in a light manner,\" he said later. \"They turned me down flat. I was hopping mad when I went back to the studio, so I called in Bill Walsh and said 'Let's make a feature of it'.\"<ref name=\"hedda\">Looking at Hollywood: Hedda Gets the Lowdown on Walt Disney's Success Hopper, Hedda.

Veteran screenwriter Lillie Hayward also worked on the ''Spin and Marty'' serials, which featured several of the same young actors as ''The Shaggy Dog''.  Disney producer [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]] mused that \"The Shaggy Dog\" was the direct inspiration for the TV show ''[[My Three Sons]]'',  Walsh said \"Same  kids, same dog and Fred MacMurray!\"\n\n===Casting===\nThe lead role went to [[Tommy Kirk]], who had started with Disney in a [[Hardy Boys]] serial for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' alongside [[Tim Considine]]. Considine also played a role, as did [[Annette Funicello]] who had been the most popular member of ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.<ref>MAYOR, OUT WEST, SEES FILM STUDIO: Visits Fox Lot, Meets Stars and Governor Knight -- Blaustein Script Added By THOMAS M.

I liked him enormously. I tried to get to know him, and got to know him a little bit, but he did have a kind of wall that I never got around. He was distant, he was conservative, and kind of remote. He didn't go out and have lunch. Instead, he had a tiny can of Metrecal \u2014 a horrible diet drink. There were stories about him being cheap, and I heard that he was worth $500 million at the time of his death. But I just loved him. They say he was Walt Disney's favorite actor, and I can understand that. He ranks up there with Cary Grant as one of the great light comics.<ref name=\"kirk\" /></blockquote>\nVeteran Disney voice actor [[Paul Frees]] had a rare on-screen appearance in the film&nbsp;\u2014 for which he received no on-screen credit&nbsp;\u2014 as Dr. J.W. Galvin, a psychiatrist who examines Wilby's father (MacMurray), Wilson Daniels. Frees also did his usual voice acting by also playing the part of the narrator who informs the audience that Wilson Daniels is a \"man noted for the fact that he is allergic to dogs.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''The Shaggy Dog'' was [[1959 in film|the second-highest-grossing film of 1959]] and was Disney's most financially successful film of the 1950s. During its initial release, the film grossed $9.6 million<ref>[https://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/top-100-time-box-office-hits-1966/ Top 100 All Time Box Office Hits in 1966]</ref> in domestic theatrical rentals on a budget of less than $1 million, making it more profitable than the year's highest-grossing film, ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. ''The Shaggy Dog'' also performed very strongly on a 1967 re-release. The film was the most profitable film made by Disney at that time.<ref>Looking at Hollywood: Annette Funicello Is a Dream at Wedding Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Tribune January 13, 1965: a4.</ref>\n\nAccording to ''Diabolique'', \"the movie kicked off a whole bunch of comedies with a slight fantastical element that powered Disney film division for the next two decades. Much of the credit went to MacMurray; a lot of the credit should have gone to Kirk, whose easy-going boy next door charm made him the ideal American teen.\"<ref name=\"vagg\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|title=The Cinema of Tommy Kirk|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-cinema-of-tommy-kirk/|date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Novelization==\nWhile the movie is based on Salten's ''The Hound of Florence'', a [[novelization]] of the movie published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] eight years later in 1967 made some interesting changes to the plot. First, Funicello's character Allison was removed entirely, and her name is not listed among the movie's principal performers.  As a result, the rivalry between Wilby and Buzz is greatly reduced. Also, Dr. Valasky is changed into Francesca's uncle, not her adoptive father.\n\nA [[comic book]] adaptation also appeared from [[Western Publishing]], which followed the movie's storyline more closely.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/173634/ Four Color #985 (May 1959)]</ref> This was reprinted in 1978 as a companion story to an adaptation of ''[[The Cat from Outer Space]]''.\n\n==Legacy==\n''The Shaggy Dog'' was at that time the most profitable film produced by Walt Disney Productions, which influenced the studio's follow-up live-action film production.  Using a formula of placing [[supernatural]] and/or fantastical forces within everyday mid-twentieth century American life, the studio created a series of \"gimmick comedies\" (a term used by Disney historian and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]]) with action to keep children entertained and some light satire to amuse the adult audience.  Using television actors on their summer [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] who were familiar to audiences but did not necessarily have enough clout to receive over-the-title [[invoice|billing]] (or a large fee) from another major studio was one way these comedies were produced inexpensively; they also tended to use the same sets from the [[Disney]] backlot repeatedly.  This allowed Walt Disney Productions a low-risk scenario for production, any of these films could easily make back their investment just from moderate matinee attendance in neighborhood theatres, and they could also be packaged on the successful Disney anthology television series ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''.\n\nThe popular television series ''[[My Three Sons]]'' (1960\u20131972) reunited MacMurray and Considine, and also features a pet shaggy sheepdog named \"Tramp\".\n\n===Sequels===\n* The film was followed in 1976 with a theatrical sequel, ''[[The Shaggy D.A.]]'', starring Dean Jones as a 45-year-old Wilby Daniels. \n* In 1987, a two-part television movie set somewhere in the 17 years between the events portrayed in ''The Shaggy Dog'' and ''The Shaggy D.A.'', entitled ''[[The Return of the Shaggy Dog]]'', presented a post\u2013''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' [[Gary Kroeger]] as a 30-something Wilby Daniels.\n\n===Remakes===\n* In 1994, [[The Shaggy Dog (1994 film)|the first remake of the film was a television movie]], with Disney regular [[Scott Weinger]] as a teenaged Wilbert \"Wilby\" Joseph Daniels, and [[Ed Begley Jr.]] playing a part similar to the one originated by Fred MacMurray in 1959.\n* In 2006, Disney released a [[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|live-action remake of the movie]] with [[Tim Allen]] as a 50-something Dave Douglas. This film has an entirely different story, characters, and transformation plot device unrelated to the original trilogy. To tie-in with the theatrical release of the 2006 remake, the original 1959 movie was re-issued in the United States as a special DVD labeled ''The Wild & Woolly Edition'', which featured the movie in two forms: one in the original black and white, the other a [[colorized]] version. The colorized version however is not restored and suffers from age.  In the UK, however, the 1959 movie has only ever been made available on DVD in black and white.  The 2006 remake and Tim Allen's performance was poorly received by critics, with a moderately successful box office return.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=9481|title=Box Office Prophets: Box Office Estimates Report for March 10-12, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Shaggy D.A.]]'', the 1976 theatrical sequel\n* ''[[The Return of the Shaggy Dog]]'', the 1987 television sequel\n* ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', the 2006 Disney live-action remake of the 1959 live-action film\n* [[Felix Salten]], the author of ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'', the source material for the 1959 live-action film\n\n== References ==\n; Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n; Bibliography\n* {{cite book|last=Arkoff|first=Sam|title=Flying Through Hollywood by the Seat of My Pants: The Man Who Brought You I Was a Teenage Werewolf and Muscle Beach Party |publisher=Birch Lane Press |year=1992|isbn=1-55972-107-3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | last=Wills | first=John | chapter=Felix Salten\u2019s Stories: The Portrayal of Nature in ''Bambi'', ''Perri'' and ''The Shaggy Dog'' | title=Walt Disney, from Reader to Storyteller: Essays on the Literary Inspirations | pages=45\u201361 | editor1-last=Jackson | editor1-first=Kathy Merloch | editor2-last=West | editor2-first=Mark I. | publisher=McFarland | location=Jefferson (N.C.) | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-7864-7232-1 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/the-shaggy-dog-1959}} \n* {{IMDb title|0053271|The Shaggy Dog}}\n* {{Amg movie|44036|The Shaggy Dog}}\n* {{tcmdb title|25095|The Shaggy Dog}}\n* [http://www.ultimatedisney.com/shaggy.html UltimateDisney.com: The Shaggy Dog (1959) DVD Review]\n*[https://archive.org/details/variety213-1959-02/page/n229 Review of film] at ''Variety''\n\n{{Charles Barton}}\n{{The Hound of Florence}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shaggy Dog, The}}\n[[Category:1950s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1959 films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic dogs]]\n[[Category:1950s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Paul Smith (film and television composer)]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films about dogs]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films based on Austrian novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Charles Barton]]\n[[Category:The Shaggy Dog films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1959 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about father\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
