It's funny, disturbing, and unabashedly wrong.<ref>{{cite web|author=Christie Ko * |url=http://screencrave.com/2013-01-26/sundance-2013-movie-review-wrong-cops/ |title=Sundance 2013: Wrong Cops - Movie Review by Christie Ko |publisher=ScreenCrave |date=2013-01-26 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom Alex Koehne of ''Twitch'':\n{{cquote|Wrong Cops certainly has a sense of humor that isn't for anyone. If you like the exploitation films of the 70's and 80's, the abstract ridiculousness of Tim and Eric and Monty Python, the violence of grind-house cinema and the homespun stylings of web series and Funny or Die sketches, then you are primed and ready to love Wrong Cops. If Family Circus is your favorite comic, then you should steer clear.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Koehne * |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/01/sundance-2013-review-wrong-cops.html |title=Sundance 2013: \"Wrong Cops\" \u2013 Review by Alex Koehne |publisher=Twitch |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom Scott Menzel of ''We Live Film'' did not care for the film:\n{{cquote|I can only hope that ''Wrong Cops'' isn't what is next to come from the director and is simply a speed bump in his career. This is probably one of the most painfully unfunny and longest 45 minutes that I have ever had to sit through in quite sometime. It is without a doubt the worst film that I saw at Sundance 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Menzel * |url=http://welivefilm.com/sundance-2013-wrong-cops-review-by-moviemanmenzel/ |title=Sundance 2013: \"Wrong Cops\" \u2013 Review by MovieManMenzel |publisher=We Live Film |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|2166616}}\n*{{rottentomatoes|wrong_cops_2013}}\n*{{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Quentin Dupieux}}\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:French comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:French black comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Quentin Dupieux]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 independent films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s French films]]"}]}}}}
