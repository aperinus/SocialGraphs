It was the only time that Brando and De Niro appeared onscreen together. The screenplay was based on a story by Daniel E. Taylor and Kario Salem.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter nearly being caught during a burglary, master [[safe-cracking|safe-cracker]] Nick Wells (De Niro) considers retiring to live with his girlfriend Diane and run his [[Montr\u00e9al]] jazz club as a legitimate businessman. He declines another job from his [[fence (criminal)|fence]] Max (Brando), and is approached by the job's mastermind Jack Teller, an ambitious fellow thief. Nick sends his associate Burt to intimidate Jack into leaving town, but Jack gains the upper hand and arrives at Nick's home to change his mind. Nick agrees to join the heist in exchange for total control of the operation, and negotiates a $6 million cut from Max.\n\nTheir target is a royal [[sceptre]] smuggled into Canada but discovered by customs, now stored in the ultra-secure basement of the [[Custom House, Montreal|Montr\u00e9al Customs House]]. Jack has infiltrated the Customs House by posing as a mentally-challenged janitor, and Nick finds access to the basement through the sewers beneath. Diane, disappointed that Nick has taken on this final score, reconsiders their future together.\n\nNick recruits Steven, a [[hacker]] associate, who breaks into the Customs House security company's system to obtain bypass codes, but is caught by a systems administrator who demands $50,000 for the information. The administrator arranges to meet in a public park, bringing his cousin for protection; tensions arise when the cousin and Jack each reveal they have brought a gun, to Nick's displeasure, but the exchange is made.\n\nAfter seeing a pressurized beer keg burst open in the street, Nick concocts a plan to defeat the Customs House's impregnable safe. He frustrates Jack by urging patience and refusing to let him be part of the handoff with Max, despite Jack's insistence. Advised by Burt that the job may be too risky, Nick confronts Max, who confesses that he is deeply in debt to a mob boss but is secretly selling the sceptre for $30 million. Max implores him to finish the job, and Nick reluctantly agrees.\n\nThe Customs House adds additional [[closed-circuit television]] cameras and [[infrared]] detectors to the basement after realizing the sceptre's true value as a French [[national treasure]], forcing the thieves to move up their timetable. Jack arrives for his graveyard shift \u2014 with his gun hidden inside a portable radio \u2014 while Nick breaks into the basement through the sewer tunnels. Burt, posing as a garbage truck driver, delivers computer components that Jack uses to bypass the security system. Jack shuts off the cameras as Nick enters the storage room, but a fellow janitor stumbles upon Jack, who locks him in a closet at gunpoint.\n\nBypassing the infrared sensors, Nick fills the safe with water from the basement sprinkler system and inserts a [[depth charge]], blowing off the door. He packs the sceptre in a carrying case but is held at gunpoint by Jack, who forces him to hand over the case. As rigged by Jack, the cameras and alarms turn back on, alerting security and forcing Nick to escape back through the sewers; Jack returns upstairs, hiding the case inside his uniform and slipping past the police as they arrive.\n\nArriving at a bus station to flee the city, Jack calls Nick to gloat, but Nick reveals that he anticipated his betrayal: he had already planned a route through the sewers to evade pursuit, and Jack opens the case to discover a scrap metal decoy; Nick still has the real sceptre. Brushing off Jack's threats of vengeance, Nick advises him to flee as \"every cop in the city\" will now be looking for him. Later, Max smiles as he watches a news broadcast reporting a massive manhunt to find Jack, the prime suspect, whose accomplice has \"vanished without a trace,\" while Nick reunites with Diane at [[Montr\u00e9al-Mirabel International Airport]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Nick Wells\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Jack Teller\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Max\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Diane\n* [[Gary Farmer]] as Burt\n* Jamie Harrold as Steven\n* [[Paul Soles]] as Danny\n* [[Serge Houde]] as Laurent\n* [[Martin Drainville]] as Jean-Claude\n* [[Richard Waugh (actor)|Richard Waugh]] as Sapperstein\n* [[Mark Camacho]] as Sapperstein's Cousin\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nDuring the production, Brando repeatedly argued with Oz and called him \"[[Miss Piggy]]\", the [[The Muppets|Muppet]] whom Oz played from 1976 to 2001.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Cagle | first=Jess | title=How To Make A Score | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,166701,00.html | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=July 8, 2001 | access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | last=Cagle | first=Jess | url=http://www.edward-norton.org/score/scoretime.html | title=How To Make A Score | magazine=Time | date=June 16, 2001 | access-date=May 21, 2013 |via=edward-norton.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010803174200/http://www.edward-norton.org/score/scoretime.html |archive-date=2001-08-03}}</ref> Brando's eccentric behavior on set included performing scenes in his underwear and altogether refusing to be directed by Oz at times, having co-star De Niro take over with Oz instructing via an assistant director, an allegation that Oz confirmed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kelly |first=Brendan |url=http://www.edward-norton.org/score/montreal7201.html |title=Settling the Score Stories |newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=July 2, 2001 |via=edward-norton.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010803172650/http://www.edward-norton.org/score/montreal7201.html |archive-date=2001-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/frank-oz.s-tense-remake|title=Nicole Kidman-Frank Oz's Tense Remake |website=contactmusic.com |date=2003-02-10}}</ref> \"There was one scene\u2013two days of shooting\u2013when Marlon was too upset with me to act while I was on the set,\" Oz stated. \"I watched from outside, with a monitor, and Bob was very good and acted as mediator between us.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Robey | first=Tim | title=Brando's trousers - the truth | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4725638/Brandos-trousers-the-truth.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=September 18, 2001 | access-date=April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nNow-deceased screenwriter Scott Marshall Smith joined the crew late and received a writing credit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/scott-marshall-smith-dead-men-of-honor-writer-1234854374/|title = Scott Marshall Smith, 'Men of Honor' Screenwriter, Dies at 62|date = December 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOz downplayed the conflict after the film's release, taking unspoken note of the reported tension on the movie's Montreal set: {{blockquote|He's a very sweet, gracious -- childlike in some ways -- very, very humane, very complex person.
