The film follows the Carters, a suburban family targeted by a family of cannibal savages after becoming stranded in the [[Nevada]] desert.\n\nFollowing Craven's directorial debut, ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972), producer [[Peter Locke (producer)|Peter Locke]] was interested in financing a similar project. Craven based the film's script on the legend of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] cannibal [[Sawney Bean]], which Craven viewed as illustrating how supposedly civilized people could become savage. Other influences on the film include [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940) and [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974). ''The Hills Have Eyes'' was shot in the [[Mojave Desert]]. The film's crew were initially unenthusiastic about the project, but they became more passionate due to Craven's enthusiasm and came to believe that they were making a special movie.\n\n''The Hills Have Eyes'' earned $25 million at the box office and spawned [[The Hills Have Eyes (franchise)|a franchise]]. All subsequent films in the series were made with Craven's involvement. ''The Hills Have Eyes'' was released on [[VHS]] in 1988 and has subsequently been released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], while Don Peake's score for the film has been released on [[CD]] and vinyl. Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising its tense narrative and humor. Some critics have interpreted the film as containing commentary on morality and American politics, and the film has since become a [[cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe suburban Carter family is traveling on vacation towing a trailer enroute to Los Angeles. Parents Bob and Ethel are driving, accompanied by their teenage children Bobby, Brenda, eldest daughter Lynne, Lynne's husband Doug, Lynne and Doug's baby daughter Cathrine (Katy), and the family's dogs, Beauty and Beast.\n\nIn [[Nevada]], they stop at Fred's Oasis for fuel, and Fred urges them to stay on the main road as they leave. Fred's truck suddenly explodes. Dismissing Fred's warnings as a crazy person's ramblings, the Carters get startled by overhead aircraft when driving near [[Nellis Air Force Base Complex|Nellis Air Force Range]], and  skid off the road and crash. The dogs become very panicky and start barking at the hills. Beauty then runs off into the hills. Chasing after her, Bobby finds her mutilated body. Frightened, he runs, falls, and knocks himself unconscious.\n\nBob walks back to Fred's Oasis to get help. As night falls, he finds Fred, who tells him about his son Jupiter. As a child, Jupiter killed the family's livestock and later murdered his sister. Fred attacked Jupiter with a [[tire iron]] and left him in the hills to die. However, Jupiter survived and had children with a depraved, alcoholic prostitute known as Mama. Together, they had three sons \u2013 Mars, Pluto and Mercury \u2013 and an abused daughter, Ruby. The family led by \"Papa Jupiter\" survives by cannibalizing travelers and stealing supplies. Papa Jupiter suddenly crashes through a window, kills Fred with a tire iron, takes Bob prisoner, and [[crucifixion|crucifies]] him.\n\nBrenda finds Bobby, still shaken up about Beauty, and the two return to the trailer. Bobby does not mention Beauty's death to avoid frightening the rest of the family. Pluto sneaks to the trailer and signals Papa Jupiter to set Bob on fire as a distraction. Brenda stays in the trailer with Katy while Ethel, Lynne, Doug, and Bobby rush out to save Bob. The Carters eventually extinguish the fire, but Bob dies shortly afterwards.\n\nAs the Carters extinguish the fire, Pluto and Mars ransack the camper and Mars rapes Brenda. When Ethel and Lynne return, Mars shoots them both. Pluto abducts Katy and the brothers flee, intending for the family to eat her. Hearing their screams, Doug and Bobby rush back only to find Lynne dead, Ethel mortally wounded and Brenda traumatized.\n\nMars and Pluto return to their home, a cave. Beast pushes Mercury off a hilltop to his death. Mama chains Ruby outside the cave, torments her and forces her to eat Beauty as punishment for sympathizing with the Carters. The next morning, shortly after Ethel dies, Doug sets out to find Katy while Papa Jupiter and Pluto set out to kill the remaining family members.\n\nBeast tears Pluto's throat out. Brenda and Bobby use Ethel's corpse as a trap to kill Papa Jupiter. Doug gets to the cave, where he sees Ruby knocking out Mama and carrying Katy away. Doug catches up with Ruby, but Mars follows and attacks Doug. Mars gains the upper hand, but Ruby interferes, enabling Doug to overpower him. Doug then savagely stabs Mars and continues long after he is dead, whilst Ruby weeps.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Russ Grieve as Big Bob Carter\n* [[Virginia Vincent]] as Ethel Carter\n* [[Susan Lanier]] as Brenda Carter\n* [[Robert Houston (actor)|Robert Houston]] as Bobby Carter\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Lynne Wood\n* Martin Speer as Doug Wood\n* Brenda Marinoff as Baby Katy Wood\n*James Whitworth as Papa Jupiter\n* Cordy Clark as Mama\n* Lance Gordon as Mars\n* [[Michael Berryman]] as Pluto\n* Peter Locke as Mercury (credited as Arthur King)\n* [[Janus Blythe]] as Ruby\n* [[John Steadman (actor)|John Steadman]] as Fred\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Illustration at page 333 in Grimm's Household Tales (Edwardes, Bell).png|thumb|left|upright|275px|alt=Drawing of Hansel and Gretel|Steve Palopoli notes parallels between \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" and ''The Hills Have Eyes''.]]\nWes Craven desired to make a non-horror film, following his directorial debut, ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972), because he saw the horror genre as constraining.

According to Steve Palopoli of ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', the finished film still features elements of \"Hansel and Gretel,\" specifically its portrayal of people getting lost in the wilderness and setting a trap for their tormentors. Palopoli also noted the witch from \"Hansel and Gretel\" and the villains from ''Hills'' both try to cannibalize children.<ref name=hansel/> In writing the project for Locke, Craven decided he \"wanted something more sophisticated than ''Last House on the Left''.\" He added that he \"didn't want to feel uncomfortable again about making a statement about human depravity.\"{{sfn|Hutson|2016|page=32}}\n\n[[File:Sawney Bean.jpg|thumb|right|upright|275px|alt=Drawing of Sawney Bean outside of his cave |''The Hills Have Eyes'' is based on the legend of [[Sawney Bean]].]]\nSearching for a story to film, Craven began looking up \"terrible things\" at the [[New York Public Library]].{{sfn|Hutson|2016|page=32}} While going through the library's forensics department, Craven learned of the legend of [[Sawney Bean]] - the alleged head of a 48-person Scottish clan responsible for the murder and cannibalization of more than one thousand people. What interested Craven in the legend was how, after Bean's clan was arrested, they were tortured, [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartered]], burned and hanged. Craven saw this treatment of the Bean clan by supposedly civilized people as paralleling the clan's own savagery. Craven decided to base the film on the legend.{{sfn|Maddrey|2004|page=163-164}}<ref name=bd/> Another major inspiration for the project was [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974),<ref name=bd/> one of Craven's favorite films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a23810/texas-chainsaw-things-you-didnt-know/|title=11 Things You Didn't Know About The Texas Chainsaw Massacre|author=Wood, Jennifer M.|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=October 21, 2014|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230823/http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a23810/texas-chainsaw-things-you-didnt-know/|archive-date=January 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]]'s Zachary Paul says that both films center on a group of vacationers who are \"stranded in the wide open nowhere and must protect themselves against a tightly knit family of cannibals\" and feature an archetypal \"gas station of doom\".<ref name=bd>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3448707/40-years-later-hills-still-eyes/|title=40 Years Later and 'The Hills Still Have Eyes'|author=Paul, Zachary|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=July 22, 2017|access-date=September 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918012057/https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3448707/40-years-later-hills-still-eyes/|archive-date=September 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Like ''The Last House on the Left'' before it, the film drew influence from the work of European directors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]].{{sfn|Walker|Johnson|2008|page=218}}\n\nOther inspirations for ''The Hills Have Eyes'' were Craven's neighbors and family, on whom the Carters where modeled,<ref name=bd/> the director's nightmares,{{sfn|Hutson|2016|page=76}} and [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940).{{sfn|Walker|Johnson|2008|page=226}} The original script was titled ''Blood Relations: The Sun Wars'' and was set in [[New Jersey]] during 1984, several years in the future.{{sfn|Maddrey|2004|page=55}}<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56059?sid=87733cab-a0e3-479b-a51b-c92cff1862b9&sr=4.274821&cp=1&pos=0|title=The Hills Have Eyes (1977)|work=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=September 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925180745/http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56059?sid=87733cab-a0e3-479b-a51b-c92cff1862b9&sr=4.274821&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=September 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> As Locke's girlfriend, [[Liz Torres]], often performed in [[Las Vegas]] during this period, Locke saw a lot of desert landscapes as the film was being written, and suggested that Craven set the film in the desert. Due to budgetary constraints, the film was written to have few roles and be set in few locations. Originally, the film was to end with the surviving members of the family reuniting at the trailer site, signifying that they could move on with their lives. Craven ultimately opted for an ending where Doug stabs Mars as a disgusted Ruby watches, as he liked the role reversal that this ending created.<ref name=mf>{{cite magazine|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/79676/11-terrifying-facts-about-hills-have-eyes|title=11 Terrifying Facts About The Hills Have Eyes|author=Jackson, Matthew|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|date=July 22, 2017|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918193650/http://mentalfloss.com/article/79676/11-terrifying-facts-about-hills-have-eyes|archive-date=September 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Craven also wanted the two families in the story to be the \"mirror images of each other,\" believing that this would allow him to \"explore different sides of the human personality.\"{{sfn|Hutson|2016|page=33}}\n\n===Casting===\nMichael Berryman, who has twenty-six different birth defects, won the role of Pluto.<ref name=mf/> He was elated to be cast in a horror film due to his love of ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (1944) and other black-and-white [[Universal Classic Monsters]] films.{{sfn|Paul|2008|page=25}} The character of Ruby needed to be played by an actress who was a fast runner, so all of the actresses who auditioned for the part were required to race each other.
