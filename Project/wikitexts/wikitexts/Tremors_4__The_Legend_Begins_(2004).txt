S. Wilson]] and written by [[Brent Maddock]], [[Nancy Roberts (producer and screenwriter)|Nancy Roberts]], and Wilson. It is the fourth film in the ''[[Tremors (franchise)|Tremors]]'' series of films and released on DVD on January 2, 2004. As a [[prequel]] to the earlier films and television series, it depicts the town of Rejection, which is the location that would later be renamed Perfection, the main setting for the [[Tremors (1990 film)|first ''Tremors'' film]]. It stars [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] as Hiram Gummer, the great grandfather of the character [[Burt Gummer]], who Gross portrayed in every other ''Tremors'' film.\n\nPrim East Coast dandy Hiram Gummer (Gross) arrives in the town of Rejection, Nevada, to investigate a series of strange deaths at the silver mine he owns. Receiving help from local innkeeper Christine Lord (Botsford) and miner Juan Pedilla (Roam), Gummer finds out that gigantic killer worms that can burrow underground are responsible for the miners' deaths. Hiram decides he'd better call in expert gunslinger Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago) to save the day. However, the worms grow larger and the people of Rejection decide to kill them before they reach [[Carson City]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1889, the inhabitants of Rejection are completely dependent on the income from a nearby [[silver mine]]. One day, a [[hot spring]] causes graboid eggs to hatch, resulting in the death of 17 miners. Hiram Gummer, great-grandfather of Burt Gummer ([[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]]) and the mine's owner, arrives in town to fix the problem. After juvenile graboids that can shoot out of the ground (later dubbed Dirt Dragons) attack his camp one night, he is shocked by their presence. One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickaxe, and the pair escapes.\n\nInexperienced and not fond of firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly ([[Billy Drago]]). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive by a now fully grown graboid, but not before discovering that a total of four graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fates. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], Hiram receives a [[telegram]] revealing that the fully grown graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons with the last of his valuable belongings, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the graboids, and helps the town ready itself.\n\nAfter two graboids are killed, the third one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the flywheel of a steam [[traction engine]]. The graboid is reeled in and slammed against the front wheels and boiler with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact. With the creatures dead, the town decides to keep them secret out of fear that no one would settle in the area if their existence were known, and use the proceeds from the mine to pay for their belongings. Hiram settles in Rejection (renamed Perfection), building his home in the same place where his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 [[Gatling gun]] and begins target practice, enjoying it.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] as Hiram Gummer\n*[[Sara Botsford]] as Christine Lord\n*[[Billy Drago]] as Black Hand Kelly\n*Brent Roam as Juan Padilla\n*[[August Schellenberg]] as Tecopa\n*[[J.

According to Stampede Entertainment, \"S. S. Wilson and Michael Gross loved it so much they decided to use it anyway\". The handgun can be seen when Hiram gives it to Lu Wan to use in the final battle. However, Hiram calls it a \"derringer\". It is used by Lu Wan to blow the head off a tentacle of the graboid that attacks her on the wagon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stampede-entertainment.com/site/weapons-of-tremors-4/#MarkIII |title= Weapons of ''Tremors 4'': the Remington Mark III |website= Stampede Entertainment |accessdate= August 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n* [[Sharps rifle|Sharps]] 1874 [[buffalo rifle]]\n\nThe Sharps 1874 buffalo rifle was used by Juan in the final battle.

The gun had a 2-inch (5.1&nbsp;cm) bore, which classifies it as an \"A gauge\". According to Stampede Entertainment, \"The entire trigger assembly of the punt gun dropped down to allow the loading of the internal shotgun with triple load 12-gauge black powder blanks.\" In addition, [[WD-40]] was sprayed into the barrel before firing which would create extra smoke.<ref>[http://stampede-entertainment.com/site/weapons-of-tremors-4/#Punt Weapons of ''Tremors 4'', the Punt Gun]. stampede-entertainment.com.

In a retrospective essay on direct-to-video horror sequels, Gavin Al-Asif for the [[Houston Chronicle]] wrote that \"[Tremors 4] is noticeably better than [Tremors 3] in certain aspects, but also noticeably worse in others,\" critiquing the film for its unconvincing effects and hokey acting while praising the film for its fun characters, often clever humor, and western setting.\n\n==Browser game==\nA [[browser game]] [[tie-in]] called ''Dirt Dragons'' was created to market the film and released on January 2, 2004. The game concept, development, and programming was done by the Stampede Entertainment webmaster Allan Krahl.<ref name=dd>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dirtdragons.com/dirtdragons.html |website=DirtDragons |title=About The Game |publisher=Stampede Entertainment |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>Green, Paul.

The player has a selection of guns. The Sharps 1874 Buffalo Rifle, Henry 1860, Colt Peacemaker, and the Punt Gun. The Sharps has the most range and is the second most powerful but has one bullet that takes a small amount of time to reload. The Henry 1860 has 16 bullets, low-moderate damage, and a fast fire rate but takes around 30 seconds to reload. The Peacemaker has poor range and damage but an extremely fast fire rate with six bullets loaded that takes around 30 seconds to reload and is considered a ''last resort'' weapon. The Punt Gun has the most destructive power but only at close range while taking over a minute to reload a single shot. The objective is to kill advancing graboids that pop up while getting closer and strategize on how to conserve ammo to kill others. As a certain number is killed, the player advances to the next level which increases the amount by one for number of graboids that pop up on-screen, with a total of four levels. If all else fails to kill them, press space. If the player loses, they will be greeted with a Graboid tentacle and be eaten, ending the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Play Dirt Dragons |url=http://www.dirtdragons.com/dirtdragons.html |publisher=www.dirtdragons.com |accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe official game site has since been discontinued, but the game is still available on other sites.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dirt Dragons Game |url=https://www.playfg.com/dirt-dragons-game.html |publisher=www.playfg.com |accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|stampede-entertainment.com/site/}}\n*{{IMDb title|0334541}}\n\n{{Tremors (franchise)}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Western (genre) horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s monster movies]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) horror films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video prequel films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1889]]\n[[Category:Tremors (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:American prequel films]]"}]}}}}
