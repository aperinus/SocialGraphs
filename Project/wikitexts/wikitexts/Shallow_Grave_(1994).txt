Its plot follows a group of [[Roommate|flatmates]] in [[Edinburgh]] who set off a chain of events after dismembering and burying a mysterious new tenant who died and left behind a large sum of money. The film was written by [[John Hodge (screenwriter)|John Hodge]], marking his first screenplay.\n\nThe production was funded by [[Channel 4]] Television and [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], and the film was distributed by [[The Rank Organisation|Rank Film Distributors]] in the UK, while [[Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International]] distributed the film in other countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Plot ==\nChartered accountant David Stephens (Christopher Eccleston), delivers a monologue to camera about friendship. He shares a flat in [[Edinburgh]] with physician Juliet Miller (Kerry Fox) and journalist Alex Law (Ewan McGregor). Needing a new flatmate, they interview several applicants in a calculatedly cruel manner, amusing themselves at the applicants' expense before finally offering the room to a mysterious man named Hugo (Keith Allen). Shortly after Hugo moves in, the trio finds him dead from an apparent overdose in his room, with a large suitcase full of money. They agree to conceal the death, keep the money for themselves and bury the body in the woods after removing the hands and feet to prevent identification. They draw lots, and David is given the gruesome task of [[dismemberment|dismembering]] the corpse, while Juliet disposes of the hands and feet in her hospital's incinerator.\n\nUnknown to them, Hugo is being sought by a pair of violent men, who are torturing and murdering informants as they follow Hugo's trail. The flat below theirs is broken into, making them anxious. The police, who also notice the intrusion, are surprised when the three deny that they ever had a fourth flatmate. While Juliet and Alex spend part of the money to \"feel better\", David's fears turn into full-blown [[paranoia]]. He hides the suitcase of money in the attic and begins living there, drilling holes in the attic floor to watch the living space below. The relationship between the three becomes increasingly strained and distrustful.\n\nThe men trailing Hugo break into the flat, coercing Alex and Juliet to reveal where the money is. As the men enter the dark attic, David kills both of them with a hammer and returns to the woods to dispose of the bodies. Alex and Juliet become worried about his mental state, and David becomes worried that the two are conspiring against him. With police closing in, Juliet seduces David into getting her the money needed to secretly buy a plane ticket to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Matters come to a head after the three bodies are discovered in the woods, and Alex is sent by his editor to cover the story. Alex returns to find Juliet and David have reached an understanding about their shared plans, which excludes him. Fearing for his life, Alex tries to secretly phone investigators, but he is interrupted by David and Juliet. The confrontation quickly escalates into a violent three-way fight. David reveals that he knows Juliet's secret plan to betray them and punches her, prompting Alex to attack him. During the battle, David stabs Alex in the shoulder, but Juliet kills David before he can finish the job.\n\nWith David dead, Juliet betrays Alex and tells him that he can't come with her. She then forces the knife deeper into Alex's shoulder, pinning him to the floor, before fleeing to the airport with the suitcase of money. At the airport, she discovers that she has been tricked and cries hysterically: the suitcase is not filled with money, but with hundreds of headline clippings about the triple grave taken from Alex's newspaper. Devastated, with no possessions except her plane ticket, and knowing that she will soon be wanted for murder, Juliet boards the plane.\n\nThe police arrive at the flat to find Alex still skewered to the floor and grinning. The camera pans down, following the trajectory of the knife and through the floor of the flat, to reveal that Alex had hidden the missing bundles of cash under the floorboards.\n\nDavid finishes the monologue that began the film (which is now revealed to be occurring after he was dead), before a sheet is drawn over his face and his body is slid into a drawer in the [[morgue]].\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits scroll, stop before random victims  -->\n* [[Kerry Fox]] as Juliet Miller: A spirited and mysterious doctor, who is constantly being courted by different men, many of whom repeatedly call the flat trying to speak to her. Despite this, she also appears to be in a relationship with David as well as openly flirting with Alex. \n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as David Stephens: A shy chartered accountant, who keeps a low profile. After drawing the short straw and having to cut up the body, he becomes introverted and paranoid.\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Alex Law. A cheeky and vain, self-described \"hack\" journalist. Alex works for the local paper and is able to find out inside information of the police investigation. His confidence in their plot starts to be undermined by David's deteriorating mental health.\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Detective Inspector McCall\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Hugo. An enigmatic man who rents the spare room on the pretence of being a writer. He is later found dead after a drug overdose, leaving a suitcase full of money under his bed.\n* [[Colin McCredie]] as Cameron. A potential flatmate who is interviewed at the beginning of the film.

Write it down.\"\n\n== Production ==\nShooting for ''Shallow Grave'' lasted for thirty days. The tight budgetary restraints during filming meant many of the [[prop]]s had to be [[auction]]ed off for them to afford sufficient [[film stock]].<ref name=\"IW\">{{cite web |first=Cristina |last=A.
