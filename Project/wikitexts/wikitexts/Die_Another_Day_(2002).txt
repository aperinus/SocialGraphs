It was produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]], and directed by [[Lee Tamahori]]. The fourth and final film starring [[Pierce Brosnan]] as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], it was also the only film to feature [[John Cleese]] as [[Q (James Bond character)|Q]], and the last with [[Samantha Bond]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]]. [[Halle Berry]] co-stars as [[NSA]] agent [[Jinx (James Bond)|Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson]], the [[Bond girl]]. It follows Bond as he attempts to locate a mole in [[British intelligence]] who betrayed him and a [[Britons|British]] billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a North Korean operative whom Bond seemingly killed. It is an original story, although it takes influence from Bond creator [[Ian Fleming]]'s novels ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1965).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Field|first=Matthew|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930556527|title=Some kind of hero : 007 : the remarkable story of the James Bond films|date=2015|others=Ajay Chowdhury|isbn=978-0-7509-6421-0|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|oclc=930556527}}</ref>\n\n''Die Another Day'' marked the ''James Bond'' franchise's 40th anniversary.

Nevertheless, ''Die Another Day'' was the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film up to that time.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is trading weapons for African [[blood diamond|conflict diamond]]s. After Moon's right-hand man Zao receives notification of Bond's real identity, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a [[hovercraft]] chase ensues, ending with Moon's craft tumbling over a waterfall. Bond is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After fourteen months of captivity and [[torture]] at the hands of the [[Korean People's Army]], Bond is traded for Zao in a [[prisoner exchange]] across the [[Bridge of No Return]]. He is sedated and taken to meet [[M (James Bond)|M]], who informs him that his status as a [[00 Agent]] has been suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress to the North Koreans. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a [[double agent]] in the British government. After escaping MI6 custody, he finds himself in [[Hong Kong]], where he learns from Chang, a Chinese agent and old colleague, that Zao is in [[Cuba]].\n\nIn [[Havana]], Bond meets with [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson, and follows her to a [[gene therapy]] clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Jinx kills Dr. Alvarez, the leader of the therapy, while Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and fights him. Zao escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of conflict diamonds bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth and celebrity. At [[Blades Club]] in [[London]], Bond meets Graves along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a [[fencing]] match that escalates into a [[claymore]] duel, Graves invites Bond to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. M restores Bond's Double-0 status, and [[Q (James Bond character)|Q]] issues him an [[Aston Martin V12 Vanquish]] with [[active camouflage]].\n\n[[File:Die Another Day - Aston Martin V12 Vanquish & Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo.jpg|thumb|[[Aston Martin Vanquish#V12 Vanquish (2001\u20132005)|Aston Martin V12 Vanquish]] and Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo used in the film]]\nAt his [[ice palace]] in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus [[solar energy]] on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for agriculture. Bond seduces Frost and Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao. Bond rescues her and discovers that Graves is Colonel Moon, who has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance and amassed his fortune from conflict diamonds as a cover. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed him in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. He returns in his Vanquish to rescue Jinx, who has been recaptured in the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his [[Jaguar XK (X100)|Jaguar XKR]]. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.\n\nBond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the [[Korean peninsula]] and stow away on Graves' [[An-124]] cargo plane. Graves reveals his identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with concentrated sunlight, allowing [[Korean People's Army|North Korean troops]] to invade South Korea and unite the peninsula. Horrified, General Moon rejects the plan, but Graves murders him. Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but is prevented by a soldier. In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the fuselage, causing the plane to decompress and descend rapidly. Bond and Graves engage in a fistfight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, pulling Graves out of the plane and into one of its engines, disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, with Graves' stash of diamonds. Later, they spend a romantic evening at a Buddhist temple.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent.\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Jinx (James Bond)|Jinx Johnson]], an [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent.<ref>{{cite news |title=Halle's big year| work=Ebony | date=Nov 2002 | quote=Of her character, Berry said: She's the next step in the evolution of women in the Bond movies.

The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The [[Jogye Order|Jogye Buddhist Order]] issued a statement that the film was \"disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics\".
