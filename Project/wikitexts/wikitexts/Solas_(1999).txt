Both of the women in the story are portrayed as alone (''sola'', plural ''solas''), each in her own way.\n\nIt won five [[Goya awards]] in 2000 and several other prizes.\n\n==Plot==\n''Alone''<ref name=\"stratton\" /> tells the story of Mar\u00eda (Ana Fern\u00e1ndez) and her mother Rosa (Mar\u00eda Galiana). Mar\u00eda is one of four adult children, all of whom moved as far as they could get from their parents and the farm where they grew up. Before the movie starts, the father (later revealed to be a violent, cruel, abusive man) has fallen ill and been brought to a hospital in [[Seville]], where Mar\u00eda lives. Rosa has been staying at the hospital with him, but the doctor tells her to leave before she falls ill herself. Mar\u00eda takes Rosa to stay with her in the rundown suburban apartment where she lives, and Rosa rides the bus every day to visit her husband.\n\nMar\u00eda is intelligent and wanted an education, but her father wouldn't allow it. Now, at 35, she works for a cleaning service; she is lonely, poor, angry and bitter. She discovers she is pregnant by a man who doesn't want a baby and tells Mar\u00eda to get an abortion. When she tells him she wants to have the baby and raise it with him, the man rejects her. In her anger and despair, Mar\u00eda starts drinking heavily.\n\nAs her mother Rosa returns from shopping one day, she meets Mar\u00eda's neighbor (''vecino'') Don Emilio (Carlos \u00c1lvarez-N\u00f3voa), a kind old widower living alone with his dog. A friendship blossoms between them: he lends Rosa some money when she runs short at the supermarket, and she cooks for him after he burns a stew he forgot was cooking. He falls in love with Rosa, but Rosa is faithful to her abusive husband. (At one point she says to Mar\u00eda about her father, \"He must not have an easy conscience. I do.\")\n\nRosa's husband recovers and she returns with him to the country, not knowing about Mar\u00eda's pregnancy. Mar\u00eda tells Don Emilio about the baby and tells him she plans to abort it. In a long, emotional scene, he offers to be like a grandfather to the child if she decides to keep it, but Mar\u00eda has been so badly treated by the men in her life that she has trouble believing him.\n\nThe movie ends with Mar\u00eda visiting her parents' grave with her baby girl and Don Emilio. He is going to sell his apartment in Seville and the three of them will move into Rosa's house in the country to raise the baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Mar\u00eda Galiana]] as Mother<ref name=\"holden\">{{Cite web|author-link=Stephen Holden|website=[[The New York Times]]|title=Film Review; A Mother's Selfless Love and Dignity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/movies/film-review-a-mother-s-selfless-love-and-dignity.html|date=8 September 2000|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref>\n*[[Ana Fern\u00e1ndez (actress, born 1963)|Ana Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Mar\u00eda<ref name=\"holden\" />\n*[[Carlos \u00c1lvarez-N\u00f3voa]] as Neighbor<ref name=\"holden\" />\n*[[Antonio Dechent]] as Doctor<ref name=\"holden\" />\n* Paco De Osca as Father<ref name=\"holden\" />\n* [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Mej\u00edas|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Juan<ref name=\"holden\" />\n}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film screened at the Panorama section of the [[49th Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 1999.<ref name=\"stratton\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/reviews/alone-1200456816/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=David|last=Stratton|author-link=David Stratton|title=Alone|date=28 March 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/1999/febrero/21/sociedad/berlinale.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=21 February 1999|title=\"La delgada l\u00ednea roja\" gana el Oso de oro en el Festival de Berl\u00edn\n}}</ref> It was ensuingly pre-screened at the [[Lebrija]]'s Juan Bernab\u00e9 Theatre on 28 February 1999.<ref name=\"ddsevilla\" /> It received a wide release in Spain on 5 March 1999.<ref name=\"ddsevilla\">{{Cite web|website=[[Diario de Sevilla]]|title=No fue un 28-f m\u00e1s|url=https://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/20-anos-del-Diario-d-Sevilla_0_1331866803.html|date=28 February 2019|first=Francisco|last=Correal}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{{Awards table|5}}\n|-\n| align = \"center\" rowspan = \"11\" | 2000 || rowspan = \"11\" | [[14th Goya Awards]] || [[Goya Award for Best Film|Best Film]] || ''Solas'' || {{nom}} || rowspan = \"11\" | <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiosgoya.com/14-edicion/nominaciones/por-categoria/|website=[[Goya Awards|Premios Goya]]|title=Estas son las nominaciones de los Premios Goya 2000|access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiosgoya.com/14-edicion/premios/por-categoria/|website=[[Goya Awards|Premios Goya]]|access-date=18 March 2021|title=Estos son los premios de los Premios Goya 2000}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Director|Best Director]] || Benito Zambrano || {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Director|Best New Director]] || Benito Zambrano || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] || Benito Zambrano || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] || Antonio Meliveo || {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] || Mar\u00eda Galiana || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best New Actor|Best New Actor]] || Carlos \u00c1lvarez-N\u00f3voa || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best New Actress|Best New Actress]] || Ana Fern\u00e1ndez || {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Production Supervision || Eduardo Santana || {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Goya Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] || Fernando Pardo || {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Sound || Jorge Mar\u00edn, Carlos Faruolo, Patrick Ghislain || {{nom}}\n|-\n| align = \"center\" | 2001 || 43rd [[Ariel Awards]] || [[Ariel Award for Best Ibero-American Film|Best Ibero-American Film]] || ''Solas'' || {{won}} || <ref name=ser>{{Cite web|url=https://cadenaser.com/ser/2009/09/14/cultura/1252883830_850215.html|website=[[Cadena SER]]|title=La Academia de Cine da a conocer las pel\u00edculas candidatas a los Oscar y a los premios Ariel|date=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Spanish films of 1999]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0190798|title=Solas}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Benito Zambrano]]\n[[Category:Fireworks Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seville]]\n[[Category:Maestranza Films films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]"}]}}}}
