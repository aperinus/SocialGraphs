When his [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] wife Katie finds out, she sees it as an opportunity to file for divorce and to continue an affair with Harry Pfarrer, a married U.S. Marshal with paranoid tendencies. At the instruction of her lawyer, Katie delivers a copy of her husband's digital financial records and other files, unknowingly including the draft of Ozzie's memoir. The lawyer's assistant copies the files onto a CD, which she accidentally leaves on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym. The disc falls into the hands of personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his coworker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe it contains sensitive government information.\n\nChad and Linda devise a plan to return the disc to Osbourne for a reward; Linda is eager to raise money for cosmetic surgery. However, their efforts only enrage him. Chad and Linda try to sell the disc to the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington|Russian embassy]], meeting with an official who is actually a spy for the CIA. Osbourne's erratic behavior prompts Katie to change the locks on their house and to invite Harry to move in. Harry is a womanizer and routinely dates women he meets online; he starts seeing Linda after meeting her on a dating site.\n\nHaving promised the Russians more files, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Osbourne house to steal files from Osbourne's computer. Chad is discovered by Harry, who shoots him dead. Harry searches the body for clues, but finds an empty wallet and missing suit tags; he surmises that Chad was working for the CIA. At the CIA headquarters, Osbourne's former superior and a director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian embassy. They are perplexed because the information is of no importance and the perpetrators' motive is unknown. The director orders that Chad's death be covered up.\n\nHarry realizes that he is being tailed by a divorce lawyer hired by his wife. Depressed, Harry meets with Linda, who is distressed over Chad's disappearance. Harry agrees to help find him, unaware that Chad is the man he killed. Linda returns to the embassy, believing that the Russians have abducted Chad, but they deny this. After they inform her the contents of the CD she has given them are worthless, she convinces the manager of Hardbodies, Ted (who has unrequited feelings for Linda), to help her by sneaking into the Osbourne household to gather more files.\n\nHarry and Linda meet in a park, where Linda reveals the address where Chad went before he disappeared. Harry realizes that Chad is the man he shot and flees, convinced Linda is a spy. When Osbourne breaks into Katie's house to retrieve personal belongings, he finds Ted in the basement; Osbourne shoots him, chases him into the street, and kills him with a hatchet.\n\nAt the CIA headquarters, Osbourne's former superior informs the director of the events. A surveilling CIA officer who saw Osbourne's attack shot him, leaving him in a coma. Harry has been detained while trying to flee to Venezuela, a country with no [[extradition treaty]] with the U.S.; the director orders to let Harry continue to Venezuela rather than deal with the consequences of bringing him into custody. Linda has been captured but has agreed to keep quiet if they will pay for her plastic surgery. The director, bewildered, approves the payment and closes the file.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[George Clooney]] as Harry Pfarrer\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Linda Litzke\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Chad Feldheimer\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Osbourne Cox\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Katie Cox\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Ted\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Sandy Pfarrer\n* [[David Rasche]] as CIA Officer Palmer DeBakey Smith\n* [[J.
