Produced and distributed by [[Toho|Toho Studios]], it is the 24th film in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]], as well as the first film in the franchise's [[Godzilla (franchise)#Millennium era (1999\u20132004)|Millennium period]]. The film was also the 23rd ''Godzilla'' film to be produced by Toho, and was Toho's second [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''Godzilla'' franchise after the 1984 film ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]''. The film, along with the subsequent ''Godzilla'' films in the franchise's Millennium era, ignores continuity established by any previous films with the sole exception of [[Godzilla (1954 film)|the original 1954 film]].\n\n''Godzilla 2000'' was released in Japan on December 11, 1999 and in North America on August 18, 2000, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and performed below TriStar's expectations, grossing just over $10 million at the North American box office. It was the last film in the franchise to receive a North American theatrical release until ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'' in 2016. In Japan, the film was followed by ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]'', which was released on December 16, 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Godzilla]] is a literal force of nature to [[Japan]]. The Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) functions independently to study the monster and predict its landfalls. Meanwhile, the scientists of Crisis Control Intelligence (CCI) find a sixty-million-year-old unidentified flying object (UFO) deep in the [[Japan Trench]]. As CCI attempts to raise the UFO to study it, it takes off into the sky on its own. Godzilla arrives in a village and then battles the [[Japan Self Defense Forces]], now equipped with powerful Full Metal Missiles, but the UFO appears, searching for genetic information that only Godzilla possesses. It fights Godzilla, driving the monster underwater, and then lands to replenish its solar power.\n\nYuji Shinoda, the founder of the GPN, discovers the secret to Godzilla's regenerative properties (named Organizer G1 in the Japanese version, but Regenerator G1 in the North American release), but so has the UFO. It frees itself from the JSDF's attempts to contain it, and heads for [[Shinjuku]]. After landing atop [[Tokyo Opera City Tower]], it begins to drain all the files about Godzilla from Tokyo's master computers. As it begins to [[Terraforming|alter the oxygen content]] of the surrounding atmosphere, CCI attempts to destroy the UFO using explosive charges, but Shinoda, attempting to find out more about the aliens, is nearly caught in the blast. He survives, and joins his peers on a nearby rooftop, watching the UFO. Almost in response, the UFO broadcasts its message of invasion and creating a new empire on Earth, and Shinoda reveals that the aliens are after the regenerative properties contained inside Godzilla's DNA so that they may use it to re-form their bodies.\n\nGodzilla arrives and again battles the UFO. However, Godzilla is subdued by the UFO's assault, and the UFO absorbs some of Godzilla's DNA, which the aliens use to reform themselves outside the space ship as the gigantic Millennian. However, the Millennian is unable to control Godzilla's genetic information in the DNA and mutates into a horrible monster named Orga. Godzilla recovers and brings down the UFO before fighting Orga, but Orga, having absorbed the regenerative properties of Godzilla's DNA, is highly resistant to injury. Orga retaliates and extracts more of Godzilla's DNA in order to become a perfect clone. Godzilla breaks free and sets Orga ablaze with its atomic breath attack, but Orga re-emerges and attempts to swallow Godzilla whole. As Orga begins to transform, Godzilla charges a nuclear pulse and unleashes it, vaporizing Orga's entire upper body and killing it. Mitsuo Katagiri, head of CCI, dies when Godzilla partially destroys the roof of the building where he, Shinoda and the authorities were observing the battle. Those remaining on the roof reminisce on how Godzilla was wrought by human ambition, prompting Shinoda to suggest that \"Godzilla exists in us\u201d, as Godzilla begins rampaging through Tokyo.\n\n==Cast==\n* Takehiro Murata as Yuji Shinoda\n* [[Naomi Nishida]] as Yuki Ichinose\n* [[Hiroshi Abe (actor)|Hiroshi Abe]] as Mitsuo Katagiri\n* [[Shir\u014d Sano]] as Shiro Miyasaka\n* Mayu Suzuki as Io Shinoda\n* [[Tsutomu Kitagawa]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* Makoto Ito as Orga\n\n;[[TriStar Pictures|Tristar]] English dub cast\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] as Yuji Shinoda\n* Denise Iketani as Yuki Ichinose\n* Jack Ong as Shiro Miyasaka\n* [[Ron Yuan]] as Mitsuo Katagiri\n* Rachel Crane as Io Shinoda\n\n;Dubbing staff\n*Dubbing Director: Mike Schlesinger\n*Dubbing Studio: [[TriStar Pictures]]/[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]]\n\n==Production==\nDue to high demand from fans to revive the Toho Godzilla, development began on a new Toho production two months after the release of [[Godzilla (1998 film)|TriStar's ''Godzilla'']]. Executive producer Shogo Tomiyama hired Hiroshi Kashiwabara (writer of ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'') and [[Wataru Mimura]] (writer of ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II]]'') to write the script, stating, \"If we wanted to make a new kind of Godzilla, we needed several different views. That's why I chose both Mr Kashiwabara and Mr Mimura. One producer, two screenwriters, three viewpoints.\"<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2012/09/08/godzilla-2000-production-notes/|title=Godzilla 2000 Production Notes|work=Scifi Japan|date=September 8, 2012|access-date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> Kashiwabara felt that they had to go back to Godzilla's roots and reexamine what made him unique.<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\nRegarding Godzilla's design, director Takao Okawara wanted to make \"something new\" and noted that Godzilla's height has changed over the years, stating, \"I felt that that distance between human beings and Godzilla was too much, so we reduced its height back to something closer to the original at approximately 170 feet.\"<ref name=\"notes\"/> The basic design of the suit was modelled heavily after the KingGoji suit from 1962's ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''.\n\n''Godzilla 2000'' was produced on a budget of approximately $8,300,000.<ref name=\"tohoking\">[http://tohokingdom.com/box_office/g2k.htm Godzilla 2000: Millennium - Box Office Report], Toho Kingdom</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2018}} [[Kenji Suzuki (director)|Kenji Suzuki]], who had worked as an assistant director on previous ''Godzilla'' movies, supervised the special effects. Miniature effects work was not emphasized as strongly as it had been in preceding installments. Instead, compositing techniques such as [[chroma key]] were heavily utilized to integrate the suitmation Godzilla footage into shots of real-life locations. The film also contains the first fully computer-generated shot of Godzilla realized in a Japanese production (previous films only used CGI to visualize graphical display representations of Godzilla or to blend computer effects work with a live-action shot).\n\n==English versions==\nThere were two English dubbed versions of this film. As is standard practice for Toho, the film was originally dubbed in Hong Kong for use in Toho's international version. For Sony's theatrical release, the film was entirely re-dubbed by Asian-American voice actors (ADR director Mike Schlesinger deliberately made this choice because he did not want the characters to sound like they were \"from Wisconsin.\"). Only one line from the international version (\"As long as the beer's cold, who cares?\") was used in the re-dubbed North American version. Several Indian versions use the English pictorial elements of the international version, however.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svlng59royU Bengali language VCD release of ''Godzilla 2000: Millennium'']</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2018}}\n\nSony's [[Tristar Pictures|TriStar Pictures]] licensed ''Godzilla 2000'' for theatrical distribution in North America.

[[J. Peter Robinson]] composed some new music meant to supplement [[Takayuki Hattori]]'s music. The dubbing has a somewhat humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone to it, apparently in homage to ''Godzilla'' dubs of the 60s and 70s, with lines such as \"Great Caesar's Ghost!\", \"Bite me!\" and \"I guarantee it'll [Full Metal Missiles] go through Godzilla like crap through a goose!\". Dialogue was also reworked in places to change or jettison certain expository details. Some fans have criticized the English dubbed version of ''Godzilla 2000'' for camping up what they perceive as a \"serious\" movie;<ref>William Tsutsui, ''Godzilla on my Mind'', pg 124</ref> however, Toho and Takao Okawara approved all the changes to the film in advance, and various amusing sequences throughout the story (such as people comically surviving Godzilla's rampage early in the film) establish a light-hearted tone and make it evident that it was not meant to be taken seriously.<ref>''Godzilla 2000'' audio commentary</ref> In an interview in ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' #71, Schlesinger noted that people in real life tend to speak humorously; he also felt that giving audiences some intentionally funny dialogue would make them less inclined to laugh at the monster scenes, which were supposed to be taken seriously. Originally, the film ended with the words \"The End?\" in cartoonish lettering, but Mike Schlesinger and Toho rejected that. \"The End?\" was removed from home video and television releases, though it was retained for the Spanish-subtitled VHS of the film.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nIt opened in Japan on December 11, 1999, and grossed {{\u00a5|1.65 billion}}<ref name=\"Japanese Box Office\"/> (roughly $15 million) during its box office run, with approximately 2 million admissions.<ref name=\"tohoking\"/> Tristar Pictures released ''Godzilla 2000'' in 2,111 North American theaters on August 18, 2000.
