They don't need to be linked here multiple times.  --> directed by [[Trey Parker]] from a screenplay co-written with [[Matt Stone]] and [[Pam Brady]]. Parker and Stone also star, alongside [[Kristen Miller]], [[Masasa Moyo]], [[Daran Norris]], [[Phil Hendrie]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], Chelsea Marguerite, [[Jeremy Shada]] and [[Fred Tatasciore]]. The film [[satire|satirizes]] [[action film]] archetypes, American [[militarism]], and the global implications of the [[politics of the United States]]. It follows the titular [[paramilitary]] police force, who recruit a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor to assist in saving the world from [[Kim Jong-il]] and his conspiracy of [[Islamic terrorists]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actors.\n\n''Team America: World Police'' intertwines [[puppetry]] and [[miniature effect]]s in a manner similar to [[Gerry Anderson]]'s [[Supermarionation]]. Parker, Stone, and Brady worked on the screenplay for a period of two years. The film had a troubled production, with assorted technical problems regarding the puppets and the scheduling extremes of finishing on time. The crew came into routine conflict with the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]], which returned the film multiple times with an [[NC-17]] rating due to an explicit sex scene involving puppets.\n\n''Team America: World Police'' premiered at the [[Denver Film Festival]] on October 14, 2004, and was released theatrically in the United States on the following date by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It has received mostly positive reviews and grossed over $51 million worldwide on a $32 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nTeam America, a [[paramilitary]] [[Counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist]] police force, eliminates a gang of terrorists in [[Paris]], accidentally destroying the [[Eiffel Tower]], [[Arc de Triomphe]], and the [[Louvre]] in the process. The team includes Lisa, an idealistic [[psychologist]]; her love interest Carson; Sarah, a [[psychic]]; Joe, a [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] who is in love with Sarah; and Chris, a [[martial arts]] expert who harbors a phobia towards actors. Carson proposes to Lisa, but a terrorist shoots him dead as he is doing it.\n\nTeam America leader Spottswoode brings [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor Gary Johnston to Team America's base in [[Mount Rushmore]] and asks him to use his acting skills to infiltrate a terrorist cell. Unbeknownst to the team, [[North Korea]]n dictator and terrorist mastermind  [[Kim Jong-il]] is supplying international terrorists with [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Gary infiltrates a [[Boko Haram|terrorist group]] in [[Cairo]]. The team is discovered and a chase ensues, with the team killing the terrorists. However, the city is left in ruins, drawing criticism from the [[Screen Actors Guild|Film Actors Guild]] (often shown as \"F.A.G.\" in the film), a union of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Hollywood actors led by [[Alec Baldwin]].\n\nAt the base Gary tells Lisa that as a child his acting talent caused his brother to be savagely killed by [[gorilla]]s. While the two grow close and have [[sexual intercourse|sex]], terrorists blow up the [[Panama Canal]] in retaliation for the Cairo operation. The Film Actors Guild blame this on Team America, as well as Kim chastising the terrorists for detonating one bomb too early. Gary, feeling his acting talents have again resulted in innocent people dying, resigns from Team America. The remaining members depart for the [[Middle East]], but are defeated and captured by North Korean forces while [[Michael Moore]] blows up Team America's base in a [[suicide attack]]. In North Korea, Kim invites the Film Actors Guild and world leaders to a peace ceremony, planning to detonate a series of bombs around the globe while they are distracted.\n\nSuccumbing to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], Gary is reminded of his responsibility by a speech from a drunken [[tramp]]. Returning to the team's base, he finds Spottswoode has survived the bomb attack. After regaining Spottswoode's trust by giving him a [[Fellatio|blowjob]] and undergoing one-day training, Gary goes to North Korea, where he uses his acting skills to infiltrate the base and free the team, although Lisa is held hostage by Kim. The team are confronted by members of the Film Actors Guild and engage them in a fight in which most of the actors are killed. After Gary uses his acting skills to save Chris from [[Susan Sarandon]], Chris confesses to Gary that the reason he dislikes actors is because he was [[Gang rape|gang-raped]] by the cast of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' when he was 19 years old.\n\nThe team crash the peace ceremony and Gary goes on stage where he convinces the world's leaders to unite, using the same speech the tramp gave him. Alec Baldwin cannot counter Gary's arguments, so Kim betrays and kills Baldwin, but is kicked over a balcony by Lisa and impaled on a [[Pickelhaube]]. Kim reveals his true form as an enormous extraterrestrial [[cockroach]] and flees in a spaceship, promising to return. Gary and Lisa happily begin a relationship and the team reunites, preparing to fight the world's terrorists once again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Trey Parker]] as Gary Johnston / Joe Smith / Carson / [[Kim Jong-il]] / [[Hans Blix]] / [[Matt Damon]] / [[Tim Robbins]] / [[Sean Penn]] / [[Michael Moore]] / [[Helen Hunt]] / [[Peter Jennings]] / [[Susan Sarandon]] / Drunk in Bar / [[Liv Tyler]] / [[Janeane Garofalo]]\n* [[Matt Stone]] as Chris Roth / [[George Clooney]] / [[Danny Glover]] / [[Ethan Hawke]] / [[Martin Sheen]]\n* [[Kristen Miller]] as Lisa Jones\n* [[Masasa Moyo]] as Sarah Wong\n* [[Daran Norris]] as Spottswoode\n* [[Phil Hendrie]] as I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. / [[Chechens|Chechen]] terrorist\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] as [[Alec Baldwin]]\n* Chelsea Marguerite as a French mother\n* [[Jeremy Shada]] as Jean Francois\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as [[Samuel L. Jackson]]\n* [[Scott Land]], Tony Urbano, and Greg Ballora as Lead puppeteers\n\nThe film also features a [[Living statue|man dressed as a giant statue]] of [[Kim Il-sung]], two black [[cats]] who pose as [[Panthera|panthers]], two [[nurse shark]]s, and a [[cockroach]], with the difference in size with the marionettes played for humorous effect. A poster of the [[Barbi Twins]] was featured on the billboard in Times Square, making the Twins the only non-marionette humans in the film.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two adult males sitting in chairs; the male at the right is speaking into a handheld microphone|Creators [[Trey Parker]] (left) and [[Matt Stone]] (right) were exhausted with production on ''Team America'' and its scheduling extremes.]]\n\n=== Development ===\nThe film's origins involve Parker and Stone watching [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]]'s ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' on television while bored. Parker found that the series was unable to hold his interest as a child because \"the dialogue was so expository and slow, and it took itself really seriously\".<ref name=\"infocus\"/> The duo inquired about the rights to the series and found out that [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] was doing a [[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|''Thunderbirds'' film]] directed by [[Jonathan Frakes]]. \"We said, 'What?

After the \"hassle\" of producing the ''South Park'' film, Parker and Stone had vowed never to create another movie.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> Other studio executives were initially unenthusiastic about the project: the studio was in favor of the film's lack of [[political correctness]], but were confused by the use of puppets. The executives explained that they could not make profit from an R-rated puppet feature, and Parker countered that similar things had been said about the ''South Park'' film, an R-rated animated musical which had become a box-office hit.<ref name=\"mediasharx\" /> [[Tom Freston]], who was co-president of [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], Paramount's parent company, also supported the film, feeling that Paramount should make more lower-budget films that appeal to children and young adults after the studio's failures with adult-oriented films such as ''[[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> According to Parker and Stone, executives were finally won over after they saw the [[dailies]] from the film's production.<ref name=\"infocus\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nParker, Stone, and longtime writing partner [[Pam Brady]] spent nearly two years perfecting the ''Team America'' script. For influences, they studied scores of popular action and disaster films, such as ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Top Gun]]'', and ''[[S.W.A.T. (film)|S.W.A.T.]]''<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web |date= 12 September 2004 |author= Horn, John |title= Launching a small-scale offensive |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-sep-12-ca-horn12-story.html |website= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date= 2020-06-15 }}</ref> The duo watched ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' to get the nuances of the puppets just right when they were staring at each other, and also used [[Ben Affleck]] as a model.<ref name=\"mediasharx\"/> To help shape the film's archetypal heroes (from the true believer to the reluctant hero to the guy who sells out his friends for greater glory), they read the books of [[Joseph Campbell]]. \"On one level, it's a big send-up,\" Brady said. \"But on another, it's about [[foreign policy]]\".<ref name=\"latimes\"/> The first draft of the script was turned in well before the [[Iraq War]].<ref name=\"mediasharx\">{{cite news|url=http://treyparker.info/archives_mediasharx_13oct04.htm|title=Interview: Matt Stone/Trey Parker|date=October 13, 2005|publisher=Mediasharx|access-date=June 12, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115830/http://treyparker.info/archives_mediasharx_13oct04.htm|archive-date=March 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film takes aim at various celebrities, many of whom came out in opposition to the Iraq War in 2003. Brady explained that the film's treatment of celebrities was derived from her annoyance at the screen time given to celebrities in the beginning of the Iraq War, in lieu of foreign policy experts.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film's central concept was easier to conceive than to execute.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> ''Team America'' was produced using a crew of about 200 people, which sometimes required four people at a time to manipulate a marionette. The duo were forced to constantly rewrite the film during production due to the limited nature of the puppets. The 270 puppet characters were created by [[the Chiodo Brothers]], who previously designed puppets for films such as ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]'' and ''[[Dinosaur (2000 film)|Dinosaur]]''. The costumers of the crew were responsible for making sure the over 1,000 costumes remained in cohesive order and were realistic.\n\nProduction began on May 23, 2004.<ref name=\"zap2it\" /> The project was interrupted multiple times early on in production.<ref name=\"mediasharx\" /> As soon as filming began, Parker and Stone labored to find the right comic tone; the original script for the film contained many more jokes. After shooting the very first scene, the two realized the jokes were not working, and that the humor instead came from the marionettes.<ref name=\"salon\" /> \"Puppets doing jokes is not funny,\" Stone found. \"But when you see puppets doing melodrama, spitting up blood and talking about how they were raped as children, that's funny.\"<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Filming was done by three units shooting different parts at the same time. Occasionally, the producers had up to five cameras set up to capture the scene.<ref name=\"infocus\">{{cite news|url=http://treyparker.info/archives_infocus_04oct04.htm|title=Puppetry of the Meanest|date=October 4, 2004|publisher=In Focus|access-date=June 12, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232859/http://treyparker.info/archives_infocus_04oct04.htm|archive-date=July 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film was mainly based on the 1982 cult classic action film ''[[Megaforce]]'', of which Parker and Stone had been fans. Many ideas had been copied such as the flying motorcycle sequence.\n\nThe film was painstakingly made realistic, which led to various shots being re-done throughout the process due to Parker and Stone's obsession with detail and craftsmanship. For example, a tiny [[Uzi]] cost $1,000 to construct, and Kim Jong-il's eyeglasses were made with hand-ground prescription lenses.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Although the filmmakers hired three dozen marionette operators, simple performances from the marionettes were nearly impossible; a simple shot such as a character drinking might take a half-day to complete successfully.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Parker and Stone agreed during production of ''Team America'' that it was \"the hardest thing [they'd] ever done.\"\n\nRather than rely on computer-generated special effects added in post-production, the filmmakers vied to capture every stunt live on film.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Parker likened each shot to a complicated math problem.<ref name=\"Rstone\" /> The late September 2004 deadline for the film's completion<ref name=\"infocus\" /><ref name=\"latimes\" /> took a toll on both filmmakers, as did various difficulties in working with puppets, with Stone, who described the film as \"the worst time of [my] life,\" resorting to coffee to work 20-hour days, and sleeping pills to go to bed.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/dec/31/news|title=Stone says ''Team America'' was 'lowest point'|date=December 31, 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 12, 2011}}</ref> The film was barely completed in time for its October 15 release date.
