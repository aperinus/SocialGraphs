The plot concerns a fictional 1970s rock band named Strange Fruit, who, after being split up for two decades, are persuaded to get back together to perform at a [[wiktionary:reunion|reunion]] in the same concert venue where they played their last gig. The film focuses on the personal lives of the band members and those closest to them, and their individual experiences with approaching middle-age and the success that eluded them.\n\nIt was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]] in 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe band Strange Fruit performs at the 1977 Wisbech Rock Festival. Hughie Case tells how, due to the pursuit of \"fame, fortune and fornication\" \u2013 and the drug overdose of their original singer, Keith Lovell \u2013 this is their last performance. After various issues, the band prematurely ends their performance, frustrated over competing egos and members' lack of self-control.\n\nTwenty years later, a stranger who turns out to be the Festival's founder's son recognises keyboardist Tony Costello and convinces him to reunite the band for an anniversary show. Tony tracks down Karen Knowles, their original runaround-girl. Reluctant, she is inspired to return after finding memorabilia. She insists on being the manager, and Tony agrees. Gradually, Karen and Tony track down other members: bassist Les Wickes, now a family man and roofer; drummer David \"Beano\" Baggot, working at a nursery and on the run from the taxman; and lead singer Ray Simms who, after years of drug and alcohol abuse, is now sober. Though claiming to be working on a solo album, Simms has not released anything in ten years.\n\nThe band meets up at the Red Lion pub. Everyone expects Brian Lovell, the band's lead guitarist, to be there. Karen says she could not find him but learned he donated his royalties to charity; everyone assumes he died. Their roadie, Hughie, turns up during their first rehearsal to resume his original role. Ray insists on playing guitar but is convinced to sing. They find a replacement for Brian in young Luke Shand, a talented guitarist who remains unaware of the band's tensions.\n\nFollowing a warm up European tour, Karen negotiates for the rights to their catalogue. Their initial performances are poorly received. Les, Beano, and Hughie hold little hope for the band, believing the dead Keith and missing Brian to be the main talent. Tony propositions Karen, but she resists, remaining attached to Brian. At a gig, Ray's over-the-top ideas backfire, and Les and Ray walk off. Following a confrontation with Les, Ray has a nervous breakdown, exacerbated by turning 50. Ray leaves the gig, buys drugs, and falls into a canal. Karen's daughter rescues him, and Ray's wife blames Karen for his troubles. Following an angry reaction from locals over volume levels, the band escape to their bus and flee.\n\nLes and Ray make up, and Ray says he \"received a positive message\" from Brian's ghost. The bus breaks down, and Karen confronts the band about their lack of confidence. When the band meet a girl wearing a Strange Fruit tour T-shirt that belonged to her father, they take it as a positive omen. The next few shows go well; the band becomes more optimistic. Following a record deal, the band records a new song written and sung by Les, which Ray had never previously allowed. However, after watching a recorded drunken TV interview in which Les and Beano imply that the band was better with Keith and Brian, Ray breaks down again and quits.\n\nAs the band members return to their former lives, Karen and Claire visit Keith's grave to pay their respects. They find a note that quotes \"The Flame Still Burns\", a tribute to Keith written by Brian. Hughie is then confronted by Karen, and reluctantly admits he knows Brian is alive. Karen and Tony find Brian in a psychiatric hospital. He explains he gave up his material possessions to sever himself from his previous life. When he agrees to rejoin the band, the others follow. However, at a pre-show press conference, hostile questions cause Brian to walk out. Everyone but Luke follows, and Luke chastises the journalists. Visibly shaken, Brian decides to back out of the show but gives his blessing.\n\nBeano nearly misses the set when a stalker-groupie demands sex. The band starts their set with the same song with which they opened up the last Wisbech Festival. Though Ray's confidence is shaken, Tony saves him by playing \"The Flame Still Burns\". Brian is pleased to hear the band playing the song, which helps him finally overcome his demons, and joins the band onstage to play an inspiring guitar solo, much to everyone's surprise and delight.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Ray Simms\n* [[Juliet Aubrey]] as Karen Knowles\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as Hughie Case\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Tony Costello\n* [[Jimmy Nail]] as Les Wickes\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as David \"Beano\" Baggot\n* [[Hans Matheson]] as Luke Shand\n* [[Bruce Robinson]] as Brian Lovell\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as young Keith Lovell\n* [[Rachael Stirling]] as Clare Knowles\n* [[Helena Bergstr\u00f6m]] as Astrid Simms\n* [[Alphonsia Emmanuel]] as Camille\n* [[Phil Daniels]] as Neil Gaydon\n* [[Peter Baynham]] as Karen\u2019s boss\n* [[Zo\u00eb Ball]] as Herself\n* [[Frances Barber]] as Lady in Black\n* [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as young Ray\n* Virginia Clay as young Karen\n* [[Luke Garrett]] as young Hughie\n* Gavin Kennedy as young Tony\n* Alex Palmer as young Les\n* Sean McKenzie as young \"Beano\"\n* Matthew Finney as young Brian\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 73% approval rating based on 26 reviews and an average score of 6.56/10.
