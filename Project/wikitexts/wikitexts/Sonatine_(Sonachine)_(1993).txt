It won numerous awards and became one of Kitano's most successful and praised films, garnering him a sizable international fan base.\n\n==Plot==\nMurakawa, a [[Tokyo]]-based ''[[yakuza]]'' enforcer, has grown tired of gangster life. He is sent by his boss to [[Okinawa]], supposedly to mediate a dispute between their allies, the Nakamatsu and Anan clans. Murakawa openly suspects the assignment is an attempt to have him removed and even beats up one of his colleagues, Takahashi, but ends up going with his men. He finds that the dispute is insignificant; the group's temporary headquarters is bombed and his men are ambushed in a bar, leaving several of them dead.\n\nFleeing to the seaside, the survivors take refuge in a remote beach house belonging to a brother of one of the Nakamatsu members and decide to wait for the trouble to blow over. Whilst spending time at the beach, the group engages in childish games and pranks and begin to enjoy themselves. However, the games frequently have a violent undertone. When two of his men alternate [[Shooting an apple off one's child's head|shooting at a beer can on each other's head]], Murakawa turns it into a game of [[Russian roulette]]. Putting the gun to his head, he pulls the trigger on the last chamber, which is only then revealed to be empty.\n\nMurakawa later dreams of the Russian roulette game, although in his dream, the revolver is loaded and he dies. When he wakes up, he walks down to the shore and witnesses a man attempt to [[rape]] a woman. Murakawa shoots the man, but to his companions he claims the woman shot him. She then joins Murakawa and the gang at the beach house and comes frequently to visit, spending time with Murakawa. Later, an assassin, disguised as a fisherman, kills the boss of the Nakamatsu clan and one of Murakawa's men. Learning that Takahashi is arriving in Okinawa, Murakawa and two of his surviving men visit his hotel.\n\nUnable to find him at first, they unexpectedly run into Takahashi and the assassin in the elevator, which results in a shootout, killing the assassin and Murakawa's men. Murakawa learns from interrogating Takahashi that their boss had intended all along to partner with the Anan clan and had sent Murakawa on a suicide mission to take over his turf. He also learns that the boss will be meeting with the Anan that night in a hotel. Takahashi is killed and Murakawa sets off with the only survivor of the group, a member of the Nakamatsu clan, who helps him by rigging the electricity in the hotel to go off at a certain time. Murakawa tells the woman that he might come back.\n\nLater that night, Murakawa goes into the hotel and slaughters both clans with an [[assault rifle]]. The next morning, while the woman continues to wait for him, Murakawa is dropped off nearby. He gets into the woman's car alone and commits [[suicide]] by shooting himself in the head.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as Murakawa, an aging mid-level yakuza.\n* [[Aya Kokumai]] as Miyuki, an Okinawa rape victim.\n* [[Tetsu Watanabe]] as Uechi, the head of the Nakamatsu gang who drives the group's bus.\n* [[Masanobu Katsumura]] as Ry\u014dji, a young coworker of Uechi who befriends Ken.\n* [[Susumu Terajima]] as Ken, the gangly long-time lieutenant of Murakawa.\n* [[Ren \u014csugi]] as Katagiri, a businessman under Murakawa.\n* [[Tonbo Zushi]] as Kitajima, Murakawa's boss.\n* [[Ken'ichi Yajima]] as Takahashi, the lieutenant of Kitajima.\n* [[Eiji Minakata]] as The hit man, working for Takahashi and Kitajima.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was conceived with four basic scenes; Yakuza having to go to Okinawa, Yakuza arriving in Okinawa, the machine-gun shootout, and the main character shooting himself in the head. Kitano said his shooting technique is spontaneous in that he allowed the film to fill in the space between these four scenes itself.<ref>{{cite AV media |year=2004 |title=[[Zat\u014dichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]/Sonatine |chapter=The Genesis of Sonatine |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Miramax]]}}</ref>\n\nThe title ''Sonatine'' comes from the musical term [[sonatina]]. Kitano said that when learning the piano, when the learner gets to sonatinas they have to decide where they want to go, whether it is to classical, jazz or popular music; marking the point of crucial decision making. This refers to the character Murakawa in the film.<ref name=\"what is\">{{cite AV media |year=2004 |title=[[Zat\u014dichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]/Sonatine |chapter=What is Sonatine? |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Miramax]]}}</ref> The original title should have been \"Okinawa Pierrot\", a possible reference to [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le fou]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aaron Gerow|title=Kitano Takeshi|editor=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2019|page=234|isbn=9781838716639|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tn8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA234}}</ref>\n\nThe film's poster is of a [[Humphead wrasse|Napoleon fish]] being pierced with a spear. Kitano said this type of fish used to be very common in the oceans south of Japan, but has been decreasing. He used the image simply because the contrast of the \"beautifully shaped\" fish being speared seemed striking to him.<ref name=\"what is\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sonatine\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n| cover      = Sonatine 8066.gif\n| alt        =\n| released   = 9 June 1993\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 51:11\n| label      = [[Toshiba EMI]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Sonatine'' was composed by [[Joe Hisaishi]].

Delon was taken aback, and talking about Kitano's acting, said \"What's THAT? [...], this is not an actor [...], he only has three facial expressions and he almost doesn't talk on top of this.\" Most professionals around Dionnet had the same reaction, but the French publisher was both struck and puzzled by this new genre. He contacted the Japanese distributor in order to buy the license for ''Sonatine'', but his request was rejected. Dionnet had to insist for several months to finally discover that the [[Shochiku]] didn't want to release ''Sonatine'' abroad, claiming the film was \"too Japanese\" and would not be accepted, nor understood, by western audiences. Eventually Dionnet learned that the distributor didn't want to release the license because of its commercial failure in Japan. Dionnet had an agreement with the Shochiku arguing that the French audience did not know Kitano's career and would accept his violent character more easily. He bought ''Sonatine'' and three additional Kitano films, ''[[Violent Cop (1989 film)|Violent Cop]]'', ''[[Boiling Point (1990 film)|Boiling Point]]'' and the latest, ''[[Kids Return]]''. With the exception of ''Kids Return'', all had performed poorly in Japan. In 1995, ''Sonatine'' entered the 13th [[Festival du Film Policier de Cognac]] in [[France]], where it was critically acclaimed. ''Sonatine'', followed by the three other films were broadcast on the French channel Canal+ a few months later.<ref>Jean-Pierre Dionnet's interview on the ''Sonatine'' DVD edition, published in Jean-Pierre Dionnet's \"Asian Classics\" collection (DesFilms/[[Studio Canal]]), France, 2001 (EDV 384)</ref> Then a couple of years later on the Franco-German public channel [[Arte]]. A video release followed, including a [[DVD]] edition available in Dionnet's collection \"Asian Classics\".\n\nAs soon as 1995, Takeshi Kitano played the role of a yakuza in American director [[Robert Longo]]'s [[Science fiction|SF]] [[Thriller film|thriller]], ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''. In North America ''Sonatine'' was released in theaters in April 1998 and [[Quentin Tarantino]] released a subtitled video edition in 2000 as part of his [[Rolling Thunder Pictures]] collection. The same year, Kitano was convinced by his producer to go in the United States where he filmed his first (and last) film outside Japan. ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'' was shot in [[Los Angeles]] with an American crew and local actors including [[Omar Epps]]. In an interview, Kitano admitted he was not fully satisfied with the final result of ''Brother'' and that he regretted his \"Hollywood\" adventure which was supposed to bring him a broader audience with a higher exposure. Kitano confessed he had no intention of shooting outside Japan any more.<ref>Takeshi Kitano interview on the ''Brother'' DVD edition, published by [[TF1|TF1 Vid\u00e9o]], France, 2001 (EDV 1035)</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''Sonatine'' won the Cariddi D'oro award for Best Film at the 1993 [[Taormina Film Fest]].<ref name=\"office\">{{cite web|title=Director - Takeshi Kitano |url=http://www.office-kitano.co.jp/brother/english/director.html|publisher=Office Kitano|accessdate=2015-11-29}}</ref> Aya Kokumai received the Best New Encouragement award at the [[3rd Japan Film Professional Awards]] for her performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u7b2c\uff13\u56de\u65e5\u672c\u6620\u753b\u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb\u5927\u8cde |url=http://nichi-pro.filmcity.jp/3rd.htm|publisher=[[Japanese Professional Movie Awards]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2015-11-29}}</ref> The film's soundtrack won the [[Japanese Academy Award]] for Music in 1994.<ref name=\"music\"/> In 1995, it was awarded Critic's Choice at the [[Festival du Film Policier de Cognac]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Festival du Film Policier de Cognac 1995 |url=http://festivalcognac.chez.com/1995.html|publisher=festivalcognac.chez.com|language=French|accessdate=2015-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0108188|title=Sonatine}}\n* {{Amg movie|154181|Sonatine}}\n* ''[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonatine/ Sonatine]'' at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n\n{{Takeshi Kitano}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:Japanese crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Takeshi Kitano]]\n[[Category:Japanese neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Yakuza films]]\n[[Category:Existentialist films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Okinawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joe Hisaishi]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
