[[Hideo Nakata]], director of the original Japanese film ''Ring'', on which the American versions are based, directed this film in place of [[Gore Verbinski]]. [[Noam Murro]] was attached before Nakata, but left due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/helmer-exits-ring-2-1117901477/|title=Helmer exits 'Ring 2'|date= March 9, 2004|first=Nicole|last=LaPorte|access-date=March 25, 2022|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Astoria, Oregon]] and Los Angeles, California. It was released on March 18, 2005, and although it was met by generally negative critical reception, it opened in the United States with a strong US$35 million its first weekend, more than doubling the opening weekend of ''The Ring''. Its final $76 million domestic gross was less than the original's $129 million, but it took $87 million internationally, for a total gross of $163 million.\n\nIt is the second installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' film series]], and was followed by ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\nSix months<!-- The short film ''Rings'' (2005) takes place in 2003 and this film is set in the same year, do not remove it --> after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|the first film]] and immediately following the events of the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'', [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed videotape has been circulating among teenagers in [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Jake Pierce is on his seventh day as per the tape's rules, and asks his friend, Emily, to watch the tape. He briefly steps into his kitchen, while Emily supposedly watches the tape. Jake receives a phone call, and initially thinks it is Samara, but is relieved to realize it is only his friend, with whom he had planned to trick Emily into watching the tape. Suddenly, Jake notices dark liquid pouring from under the kitchen door, and runs outside to the living room, only to discover Emily got scared, and closed her eyes while watching the tape. Jake is then promptly murdered by Samara.\n\n[[Rachel Keller|Rachel]] and Aidan have moved to Astoria from [[Seattle]] after sending the tape off into the ether. Rachel works at ''[[The Daily Astorian]]'' for the editor, Max Rourke. Rachel learns of Jake's death, inspecting his body, only for Samara to appear, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel breaks into Jake's house, obtains the videotape, and burns it. Aidan experiences a nightmare, where Samara drags him into a television. He soon starts developing [[hypothermia]] and bruises on his arms. At a [[county fair]], Aidan wanders into a restroom, and takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel takes him home, but they are attacked by multiple wild [[deer]] on the way, wrecking the car. After the stampede, Rachel returns home with Aiden, and worries about his health. It is during this time that Rachel realizes that Aidan may be possessed by Samara.\n\nDeciding to not be alone in their home, they rush to the Daily Astorian, surprising her co-workers, including Max. Rachel then asks for his help, claiming to have lost power, so Max takes them in. While Rachel is attempting to give Aidan a bath, he develops an irrational [[Aquaphobia|fear of water]]. Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan with herself, and terrorizing Rachel so that she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take him to the hospital. Whilst Aidan is sleeping, he telepathically sends Rachel a vision from Samara consisting of many different images. Rachel is left with many questions about Samara's origins.\n\nBased on Aidan's bruises and his health, CPS is called. Psychiatrist Emma Temple shows up, and concludes that Rachel is abusing Aidan. Rachel doesn't want to talk, but Emma reveals her knowledge of Rachel's bout with postpartum depression. Thinking that Rachel was the one harming Aidan, Emma bans Rachel from seeing him until they can speak about it in depth.\n\nLooking for answers, Rachel tries to find out who Samara's birth parents were from an adoption agency, but this just directs her back to the Morgans. Rachel returns to the Morgan ranch on Moesko Island. She is all set to break in, until she learns that a real estate agent, Martin, is holding an open house, and she arrives early. Martin lies about what happened to the Morgans, but reveals that any furniture they left behind was sent down to the basement. She heads down there, and finds the mirror from the tape, many deer antlers, Samara's old toy merry-go-round, and a suitcase with a small flower on it. Inside the case is evidence of Samara's biological mother.\n\nWhile Rachel looks for answers, Samara takes control of Aidan's body, waking him up from sleep. The nurses call Emma in to speak with him, and while they talk, Samara telepathically forces Emma to commit suicide.\n\nRachel heads to a church, and learns that Samara's biological mother was named Evelyn, who showed up with no father in sight. It is also recorded that she tried to drown Samara as an infant, and was subsequently committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When Rachel goes to visit, Evelyn is expecting her, and she is allowed immediate entry to the facility. Evelyn advises her cryptically that: \"dreams are safe\", that \"my baby told me to kill her\", and that Rachel \"let the dead get in\". As Rachel leaves, she asks what to do, and Evelyn replies, \"listen to your baby\".\n\nUnbeknownst to Rachel, Aidan has left the hospital, and returned to Max's house. Max arrives, and, suspecting foul play, tries to secretly take photos of Aidan. When Rachel returns, an affectionate Aidan greets her, his behaviour seeming out-of-character. She steps out, and finds Max's corpse in his pickup truck. When Rachel falls asleep, she dreams of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to exorcise Samara. When she wakes up, Rachel drugs Aidan/Samara with sleeping pills, and puts Aidan's possessed body in the bath, temporarily drowning Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara leaves Aidan's body, but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara's monochromatic world, while Aidan pleads with her not to go.\n\nFinding herself in the bottom of the [[water well|well]] Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. Rachel scales the well's walls, pursued by Samara, who contorts her body to follow her. Rachel escapes by climbing out, and pushing the lid shut on Samara, permanently locking Samara out of her and Aidan's lives. Rachel wanders through the woods, and begins to hear Aidan's voice. Eventually she comes to the cliff where Anna committed suicide. Rachel cries before closing her eyes, still hearing Aidan's voice. She looks down into the water, then closes her eyes, and jumps. In this way, she is able to return to the real world, and reunites with Aidan, and believes that their ordeal is finally over.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Rachel Keller\n* [[David Dorfman]] as Aidan Keller\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Max Rourke\n* [[Kelly Stables]] as Samara Morgan\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Evelyn Borden\n** [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as young Evelyn Borden\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Dr. Emma Temple\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Martin Savide\n* [[Ryan Merriman]] as Jake Pierce\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as Emily\n* [[Kelly Overton (actress)|Kelly Overton]] as Betsy\n* [[James Lesure]] as Doctor\n* [[Chane't Johnson]] as Adoption Counselor\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 4.44/10.

These scenes included conversations with Rachel's new neighbor (and neighborhood gossip), numerous additions in which Max shows a romantic interest in Rachel, more scenes with Samara prior to her possession of Aidan (including one in which she is shown to enter him in the restroom at the local fair), and the short film ''[[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]]'' (2005) (which was also included on a special edition of ''The Ring'' released just before ''The Ring Two'' arrived in theaters). A scene in the theatrical cut in which Aidan first encounters a deer while wandering the local fair (prior to the deer attack) has also been removed from this version. Also, some musical cues were changed such as when Samara leaps out of the well in the opening scene. The opening scene was also longer. The scene when the power went out was changed with a scene of the lights in Aidan's room going on and off, as well as the oven downstairs catching fire.\n\nA [[Blu-ray]] version of the film has yet to be released in the United States. The film officially debuted on Blu-ray in October 26, 2012, in Japan, containing all the extras from the DVD and including the Unrated Cut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Ring-2-Blu-ray/124815/|title=The Ring 2 Blu-ray Release Date October 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0377109}}\n* {{Allmovie title|290590}}\n* {{Mojo title|ring2}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|ring_two|The Ring Two}}\n\n{{The Ring}}\n{{Hideo Nakata}}\n{{Ehren Kruger}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ring Two}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s ghost films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:2005 horror films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American ghost films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Asian-American horror films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films about nightmares]]\n[[Category:Films about spirit possession]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hideo Nakata]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walter F.
