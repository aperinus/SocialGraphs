A failure as a 3rd grade teacher and a family man, Shinichi Ichikawa lives with his cheating wife, his teenage daughter who dates older men, and his son who is bullied because of his father's presence in the school. Escaping from everyday life, Shinichi secretly dresses up nightly as \"Zebraman\", the title character from an unpopular 1970's [[tokusatsu]] TV series he watched as a child before it was canceled after the seventh episode. As a result of meeting a wheelchair-using transfer student named Shinpei Asano, also a fan of Zebraman, Shinichi not only regains his love for teaching but also develops feelings for the boy's mother. At the same time, a rash of strange crimes and murders have been occurring around the school at which Shinichi teaches. On his way to Shinpei's house in his costume to give him a surprise, Shinichi fights a crab-masked serial killer whom he defeats when he starts exhibiting actual superpowers. Confronting more criminals who are possessed by a strange slime-based alien force, Shinichi learns that the Zebraman series was actually a cautionary prophecy of an actual alien invasion written by the school's principal, revealed to be an alien who refused to go through with the invasion and attempted to keep his kind from getting out from below the school before they kill him off and attack in full fury. Though he knows how the show ends, Shinichi defies his predestined fate as he is the only person who can stop the aliens from taking over the Earth. As a result, when the aliens emerge from the ground, the government informs the United States, which will perform an airstrike on the aliens. Realizing this, Shinichi learns of his powers and defeats the aliens.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Show Aikawa]] as Shinichi Ichikawa/Zebraman\n*[[Ky\u014dka Suzuki]] as Kana Asano/Zebra Nurse\n*[[Naoki Yasukochi]] as Shinpei Asano\n*[[Atsuro Watabe]] as Oikawa\n*[[Koen Kondo]] as Segawa\n*[[Makiko Watanabe]] as Yukiyo Ichikawa\n*[[Yui Ichikawa]] as Midori Ichikawa\n*[[Yoshimasa Mishima]] as Kazuki Ichikawa\n*[[Ren Osugi]] as Kuniharu Kuroda\n*[[Teruyoshi Uchimura]] as Ippongi\n*[[Akira Emoto]] as Kitahara the Crab Man\n*[[Ryo Iwamatsu]] as Kanda\n*[[Yu Tokui]] as Pyromaniac\n*[[Yoji Boba Tanaka]]\n*[[Arata Furuta]] - Eggplant Vendor\n*[[Kumiko As\u014d]] as Clerk\n*[[Yoshihiko Hakamada]]\n*[[Miyako Kawahara]]\n*[[Hideki Sone]]\n*[[Masayuki Fukushima]]\n*[[Satoru Hamaguchi]] Midori's boyfriend\n*[[Hiroshi Watari]] - 1978 Zebraman\n\n==Other credits==\n*Produced by\n**Shigeyuki End\u014d - planner\n**Kumi Fukuchi - planner\n**Akio Hattori - producer\n**Takashi Hirano - executive producer: TBS\n**Mitsuru Kurosawa - executive producer: Toei/T\u00f4ei\n**Makoto Okada - producer\n*Production Design: Akira Sakamoto\n*Sound Department: Yoshiya Obara - sound\n*CGI producer: Misako Saka\n*Lighting Director: Seiichir\u00f4 Mieno\n\n==Manga==\nThe movie screenplay was adapted into a five volume manga by [[Reiji Yamada]].
