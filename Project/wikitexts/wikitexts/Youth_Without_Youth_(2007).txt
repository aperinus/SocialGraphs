The film is a co-production between the United States, Romania, France, Italy and Germany. It was the first film that Coppola had directed in ten years, since 1997's ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]''.\n\nThe film opens in 1938, with an elderly Romanian professor contemplating suicide. He is struck by [[lightning]], and consequently finds himself [[Rejuvenation|rejuvenated]]. He subsequently develops [[psychic powers]], which attract the attention of Nazi agents. He flees to Switzerland, where he meets a [[reincarnation]] of his past lover. He discovers information both about her various past incarnations, and about the evolutionary potential of humanity.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2007 [[Rome Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rome-film-coppola/coppola-seeks-lost-youth-with-return-to-film-making-idUSL2028976020071020|title=Coppola seeks lost youth with return to film making|publisher=Reuters|first=Silvia|last=Aloisi|date=October 20, 2007|access-date=July 12, 2020}}</ref> It was distributed through [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in the United States (where it was released on December 14, 2007) and by [[Path\u00e9 Distribution]] in France. The music was composed by Argentinian classical composer [[Osvaldo Golijov]]. In an interview, Coppola said that he made the film as a meditation on time and on consciousness, which he considers a \"changing tapestry of illusion\", but he stated that the film may also be appreciated as a beautiful love story, or as a mystery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiansrus.com/pr/interview_coppola.htm |title=Interview With Francis Ford Coppola |work=Italiansrus.com |access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=July 2020}}<!-- Film summaries should be less than 700 words per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nIn 1938, Dominic Matei is a 70-year-old professor of linguistics. He is pining after the love of his youth, Laura. He subsequently travels to Bucharest, the city where he and she met at university. Feeling that his fruitless search for the origin of human language has condemned him to a solitary, wasted life, Dominic is intent on committing suicide after this one last journey. However, he is abruptly yet non-lethally struck by lightning while crossing the street. In hospital, Professor Stanciulescu informs Dominic that, much to both their surprises, the lightning appears to have regenerated him into a much younger man. Soon after, while residing at the Professor's home, Dominic also discovers that he possesses strange, psychic capacities.\n\nAs Romania is invaded by Nazi Germany, Doktor Josef Rudolf begins to show an interest in Stanciulescu's miracle patient. Since Dominic's budding powers have blurred his perception of reality, he is bamboozled into mistaking a Nazi spy known only as the Woman in Room Six for an erotic fantasy. They spend their nights together, and she discovers that he has developed a talent for speaking in tongues. Meanwhile, invisible to human eyes, an alternate persona presents itself to Dominic as his \"Other\" from outside space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the \"Other\" obliges by bringing him two roses out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself, \"Where do you want me to put the third rose?\" Understanding the Nazis' designs, Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania.\n\nLiving like a spy, Dominic eventually winds up in Switzerland towards the end of [[World War II]]. There he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic's existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear conflicts can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the \"Other\" confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse.\n\nMany years later, Dominic encounters a woman named Veronica while hiking in the Alps. The \"Other\" reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent thunderstorm, Dominic rushes to her rescue and finds her chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Veronica now identifies herself as \"Rupini\", one of the first disciples of the [[Buddha]]. Suspecting she may now be afflicted with a condition similar to his own, Dominic calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid. Its representatives inform him that Rupini's last act in life was to retire into a cave for meditation on enlightenment. Since the cave's location is unknown, the scholars, led by Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]], agree to fund an expedition to find it in India. They hope that Veronica's past self will guide them. The venture proves a success when a local [[Boddhisatva]] recognises \"Rupini\" and directs her to the place of meditation. Following this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and falls for Dominic.\n\nThe couple elope to Malta, where for a time, they live happily together. Dominic eventually tells Veronica in her sleep that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe in bed as if possessed. She begins chanting in a language which he does not understand. The \"Other\" explains that she is speaking in the ancient [[Egyptian language]], having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. For the next two weeks, Dominic learns how to control this state in Veronica. He leads her to regress ever further in time and to speak previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion. Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions, or even remain close to Veronica. His proximity to her is accelerating her age. Over the objections of both Veronica and the \"Other\", he leaves.\n\nDespairing, Dominic returns to the town where he taught as a professor. His alter ego appears to him in a mirror and reveals the future of mankind.  Nuclear warfare will unleash an electromagnetic pulse, giving birth to a new, and powerful human species. Dominic is this species' first member. Veronica symbolised the dawn of man, and he stood for the dusk. Outraged at the idea of sacrificing millions of lives in the name of evolution, Dominic shatters the mirror. Without the mirror, the \"Other\" vanishes. In its final moments, it yells incoherently in an unfamiliar language. In the morning, townsfolk find Dominic's body, lying dead at the bottom of a staircase. As Veronica's voice is heard echoing \"Where do you want me to put the third rose?\", the rose appears in Dominic's lifeless grasp.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim Roth]] as Dominic Matei\n*[[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as Laura, Veronica\n*[[Bruno Ganz]] as Professor Stanciulescu\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Hennicke]] as Josef Rudolf\n*[[Marcel Iure\u0219]] as Professor Giuseppe Tucci\n*[[Adrian Pintea]] as Pandit\n*[[Matt Damon]] (''uncredited'') as Ted Jones, a reporter for [[Life magazine|''Life'' magazine]]\n*Alexandra Pirici as the woman in Room 6\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by [[Osvaldo Golijov]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Quevedo|first=Marysol|title=Golijov, Osvaldo|date=2011-06-02|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.a2093119|work=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.a2093119 |isbn=9781561592630 |access-date=2021-09-07}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on October 26, 2007 in Italy.<ref>{{Citation|title=Youth Without Youth (2007) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481797/releaseinfo|access-date=2021-09-07}}</ref> The original runtime was 210 minutes, then cut down to 170, then cut down to 140 minutes, [[Walter Murch]] then cut it down to the desired 124 minutes.<ref>{{Citation|title=Youth Without Youth (2007) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0481797/trivia/|access-date=2021-09-07}}</ref> It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on May 13, 2008.<ref>{{Citation|title=Youth Without Youth (2007)|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/Youth-Without-Youth/18619/|access-date=2021-09-07}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Youth Without Youth'' grossed $244,397 in North America and $2.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.6 million.<ref name=BOM />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{As of|2020|12}}, the film holds a 32% approval rating on the [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 106 reviews with an average rating of 4.80/10.
