In the small fictional town of West Canaan, [[Texas]], football is a way of life and losing is not an option. The film drew a domestic box office gross of $52 million against its estimated $16 million budget despite mixed critical reviews.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The film has since gone on to become a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small town of West Canaan, Texas, Jonathan \u201cMox\u201d Moxon is an academically gifted backup [[quarterback]] for the high school Varsity football team, the West Canaan Coyotes. Despite his relative popularity at school, easy friendships with other players, and smart and sassy girlfriend Jules Harbor, Mox is dissatisfied with his life. Wanting to leave Texas and attend [[Brown University]], he constantly clashes with his football-obsessed father Sam, and dreads playing under legendary coach Bud Kilmer, a verbally abusive, controlling authority who believes in winning no matter what it takes, and has a strong track record, remarking in a speech, \"In my thirty years of coaching at West Canaan, I have brought two state titles, and 22 district championships!\"\n\nKilmer's philosophy finally takes its toll when he pushes the Coyotes' star quarterback Lance Harbor, Mox's best friend and Jules' older brother, into taking painkilling shots into an injured knee. This leads to Lance injuring the knee further during a game, partly because Kilmer had forced offensive lineman Billy Bob to continuing playing despite a concussion. At the hospital, the doctors, appalled at the massive amount of [[Scar|scar tissue]] found under his knee, explain that recovery will take at least a year and a half, costing Lance his football scholarship to [[Florida State University|Florida State]].\n\nMox, who has accompanied Lance, is shocked when Kilmer denies his role in Lance's injury, when in fact he ordered the trainer to provide the painkillers. Needing a new quarterback, Kilmer reluctantly names Mox to replace Lance as [[team captain]] and starting quarterback, which brings unexpected dividends for Mox. Wanting to marry someone leaving West Canaan in order to escape small-town life, Darcy Sears, Lance's cheerleader girlfriend, shows sexual interest in Mox and even attempts to [[seduce]] him with a [[whipped cream]] \"[[bikini]]\" over her otherwise naked body, but he gently rebuffs her, telling her that she can independently escape West Canaan. \n\nDisgusted with Kilmer and not strongly needing to win, Mox starts calling his own plays on the field without Kilmer's approval. He also chides his father, screaming at him, \"I don't want your life!\" Sam had been a football player at West Canaan, and although Kilmer dismissed him for lacking talent and courage, Sam still respected and obeyed him. When Kilmer discovers that Mox has won a full academic scholarship to Brown, he threatens to alter Mox's transcripts to endanger his scholarship unless he falls in line.\n\nKilmer's disregard for players continues, resulting in Billy Bob dramatically mentally collapsing. When star running back Wendell Brown, another friend of Mox's, is injured in the district title game, Kilmer persuades him to take a shot of cortisone to deaden the pain in his knee, allowing Wendell to continue at risk of more serious, and perhaps even permanent, injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, Wendell almost consents when Mox intervenes and tells Kilmer he will quit if the procedure continues. Undaunted, Kilmer orders wide receiver Charlie Tweeder, a friend of both Mox and Wendell, to replace Mox, but Tweeder refuses. Mox tells Kilmer that the team will only return to the field without him.\n\nRealizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, an angered Kilmer physically assaults Mox, but the other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field. Knowing his outburst has cost him his credibility, Kilmer tries unsuccessfully to rally support and spark the team's spirit into trusting him, but none of the players follow him out of the locker room. Kilmer continues down the hall, and seeing no one following him, then turns in the other direction and into his office. Using a five-receiver offense in the second half, the Coyotes proceed to win the game and the district championship without Kilmer's guidance, thanks largely to Lance calling the plays from the sideline, and Billy Bob scoring the game-winning touchdown on a [[Hook and lateral|hook-and-ladder play]].\n\nIn a voice-over [[epilogue]], Mox recounts several characters' aftermaths: Kilmer left town and never coached again, but his statue still remained due to its weight; after the game, Tweeder drank beer and Billy Bob cried in celebration; Lance became a successful coach (presumably replacing Kilmer as head coach for the Coyotes), Wendell received a football scholarship to [[Grambling State University]], and Mox went on to attend Brown on an academic scholarship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Van Der Beek]] as Jonathan \"Mox\" Moxon, an academically successful, yet rebellious backup quarterback.\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Coach Bud Kilmer, the Coyotes' tyrannical 30-year head coach.\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Lance Harbor, the original captain and starting quarterback of the Coyotes and Mox's best friend.\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Julie \"Jules\" Harbor, Mox's girlfriend and Lance's younger sister.\n* [[Ron Lester]] as Billy Bob, an overweight but powerful offensive guard. \n* [[Scott Caan]] as Charlie Tweeder, a wild, cocky and hard-partying [[wide receiver]].\n* [[Eliel Swinton]] as Wendell Brown, the star [[running back]] and one of only three [[African American]] players on the Coyotes.\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Darcy Sears, Lance's girlfriend, captain of the cheerleading squad, the prettiest and most popular girl in the school, has straight As and a heart of gold.\n* [[Thomas F.
