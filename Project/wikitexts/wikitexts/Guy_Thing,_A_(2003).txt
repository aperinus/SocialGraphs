During his [[bachelor party]], Paul has a chat with one of the dancers at the party, Becky Jackson (Stiles), and they find that they have an affinity for each other. Paul wakes up the next morning and is terrified to see Becky in the bed next to him. Assuming they slept together, Paul rushes Becky out of his apartment and hopes never to see her again. He tries to cover up the connection for the few days before the wedding. Unfortunately, Becky unexpectedly shows up around town and turns out to be Karen's cousin. Even worse, Becky's malicious ex-boyfriend [[Police officer|cop]] Ray Donovan (Munro) had Becky followed and photographed. Becky and Paul meet again to steal those pictures from Ray's apartment. Further problems arise with family and friends consistently showing up at the wrong times. Crabs, dirty underwear in the toilet tank, a horny best friend, and a best man/brother who is in love with the bride all provide for a week of wedding preparation hijinks. Through the snowballing of all his implausible lies and half-truths, Paul receives corroboration and support from an unexpected corner; what seems to be a coordinated network of other men, including friends, complete strangers and, to Paul's astonishment, Karen's own father; all who give the same explanation: \"It's a guy thing\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Paul Morse \n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Becky Jackson\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Karen Cooper\n* [[James Brolin]] as Ken Cooper\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Jim\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Ray Donovan\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Sandra Cooper\n* [[David Koechner]] as Buck Morse\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Dorothy Morse\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Pete Morse\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Aunt Budge\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Howard\n* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] as Minister Ferris\n* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Minister Green\n* Dylan Winner as Moni Young\n* [[Fred Ewanuick]] as Jeff\n* Lisa Calder as Tonya\n* [[Victor Varnado]] as Hansberry\n\n==Release==\nThe film debuted at #7 in the U.S. box office, taking [[USD]] 6,988,749 in its opening weekend, before falling to #11 the following week.<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web |date=January 28, 2004 |last=Sternbergh |first=Adam |title=What's with the frigid fiancee films? |url=https://slate.com/culture/2004/01/what-s-with-the-frigid-fiancee-films.html |website=Slate Magazine }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}} and a consensus: \"Wasting the talent of its leads, ''A Guy Thing'' is a predictable romantic comedy that relies on cheap laughs.\" On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 27% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=A Guy Thing |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-guy-thing |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"B\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= GUY THING, A (2003) B- |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nDennis Harvey of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] said that the film \"does get slightly better as it goes along\" but suggested that the multiple rewrites polished any creativity or originality out of the script.<ref>{{cite web |date=16 January 2003 |first1=Dennis |last1=Harvey |title=A Guy Thing |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117919668 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=17 January 2003 |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |author1-link=Stephen Holden |title=FILM REVIEW; A Hangover Is the Least of His Problems |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/movies/film-review-a-hangover-is-the-least-of-his-problems.html |website=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=17 January 2003 |last=Travers |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Travers |title=A Guy Thing |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-guy-thing-121073/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0295289|A Guy Thing}}\n* {{mojo title|guything|A Guy Thing}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110822131952/http://movieplaces.tv/movies/a-guy-thing-2003.html Filming Locations] at MoviePlaces.tv\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guy Thing, A}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Mothersbaugh]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
