The main villain doesn't terrorize a group of people or kill them one by one - he stalks Helen, killing one or two people in the process. This is completely at odds with what slashers are known for.--->[[supernatural horror film|gothic supernatural horror film]], written and directed by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]] and starring [[Virginia Madsen]], [[Tony Todd]], [[Xander Berkeley]], [[Kasi Lemmons]], and [[Vanessa Estelle Williams|Vanessa E. Williams]]. Based on [[Clive Barker]]'s short story \"[[Books of Blood#\"The Forbidden\"|The Forbidden]]\", the film follows a Chicago graduate student completing a thesis on [[urban legend]]s and [[folklore]], which leads her to the legend of the \"[[Candyman (character)|Candyman]]\", the ghost of an [[African-American]] artist and the son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century for his relationship with the daughter of a wealthy white man.\n\nThe film came to fruition after a chance meeting between Rose and Barker who recently completed his own film adaptation of ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990). Rose expressed interest in Barker's story \"The Forbidden\", and Barker agreed to license the rights. Where Barker's story revolved around the themes of the [[Social class in the United Kingdom|British class system]] in contemporary [[Liverpool]], Rose chose to refit the story to [[Cabrini\u2013Green Homes|Cabrini-Green]]'s public housing development in [[Chicago]] and instead focus on the themes of [[race (human categorization)|race]] and social class in the inner-city United States.\n\n''Candyman'' was theatrically released on October 16, 1992 by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed over $25 million in the US, where it was also regarded in some critical circles as a contemporary classic of horror cinema.{{sfn|Badley|1996|p=142}} It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh]]'' (1995) and ''[[Candyman: Day of the Dead]]'' (1999).  A [[Candyman (2021 film)|direct sequel of the same name]] was released on August 27, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile researching [[urban legend]]s, [[University of Illinois Chicago]] [[semiotics]] graduate student Helen Lyle learns of the [[Candyman (character)|Candyman]], a spirit who kills anyone who speaks his name five times in front of a mirror. She learns of a recent murder at the [[Cabrini\u2013Green Homes]] public housing project and two dozen others that have been attributed by locals to the Candyman. Skeptical, Helen and her friend Bernadette Walsh repeat the Candyman's name to Helen's bathroom mirror, but nothing happens.\n\nHelen and Bernadette work together on a [[thesis]] on how Cabrini-Green residents use the Candyman legend to cope with hardship. She and Bernadette visit the scene of the most recent murder, where Helen discovers a room where offerings have been left for the Candyman. Afterwards they interview the victim's neighbor, Anne-Marie McCoy, a single mother raising her infant son Anthony. Helen and her husband Trevor later have dinner with an expert on the Candyman legend, who says that \"the Candyman\" was Daniel Robitaille, an African-American man born in the late 1800s as the son of a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]], and who grew up to become a well-known painter. After he fell in love with and impregnated a white woman, her father sent a [[Lynching in the United States|lynch mob]] after him. The mob cut off his right hand and smeared him with honeycomb stolen from an [[apiary]], attracting bees that stung him to death. His corpse was burned in a [[pyre]] erected on the site where the Cabrini-Green Homes were eventually built.\n\nWhen Helen returns to Cabrini-Green, a young boy named Jake tells her of an incident where a developmentally disabled boy was violently [[castrated]] by Candyman in a [[public bathroom]]. She goes to investigate, where a man calling himself the Candyman attacks her. She identifies her attacker, who in reality is the head of a local gang, to the police; he is charged for the murders attributed to the Candyman. The real Candyman appears to Helen in a parking garage and hypnotizes her. He explains that because she has discredited his legend, he must shed innocent blood to perpetuate it. Helen blacks out and awakens in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood, to find Anne-Marie's pet [[Rottweiler]] decapitated and her son Anthony kidnapped. The police arrive and arrest Helen.\n\nAfter Trevor bails her out of jail, Helen finds the Candyman in a photograph she took at Cabrini-Green. He appears inside Helen's apartment and cuts her neck, causing her to bleed and pass out. Bernadette arrives at Helen's apartment, and when Helen comes to, she sees that the Candyman has murdered Bernadette. Framed for the crime, Helen is committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. While being interviewed in preparation for her trial a month later, Helen attempts to prove her innocence by summoning the Candyman, who appears and murders her psychiatrist. Candyman then frees Helen from her restraints, allowing her to escape.\n\nShe returns to her apartment to find Trevor now living with one of his students. Helen confronts him, then flees to Cabrini-Green to rescue Anthony. When she finds the Candyman in his lair, he tells her that surrendering to him will ensure Anthony's safety. Offering Helen immortality, the Candyman opens his coat, revealing a ribcage wreathed in bees. The bees pour out of his mouth as he kisses her and stream down her throat. He vanishes with Anthony, and Helen awakes to discover a mural of the Candyman and his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to her.\n\nThe Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him strike fear into Cabrini-Green's residents. Attempting to feed his legend, the Candyman reneges and attempts to immolate both Helen and Anthony in a pyre. The flames destroy the Candyman, and Helen dies while saving Anthony. The residents, led by Anne-Marie and Jake, pay their respects at Helen's funeral. At home, the grief-stricken and guilt-ridden Trevor looks into the mirror and says Helen's name five times, whereupon Helen's [[vengeful spirit]] appears and kills him. A new mural of Helen dressed in white with her hair ablaze appears in the Candyman's lair.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Helen Lyle\n* [[Tony Todd]] as [[Candyman (character)|Candyman]]\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Trevor Lyle\n* [[Vanessa Estelle Williams]] as Anne-Marie McCoy\n* [[Kasi Lemmons]] as Bernadette \"Bernie\" Walsh\n* DeJuan Guy as Jake\n* [[Gilbert Lewis (actor)|Gilbert Lewis]] as Det.
