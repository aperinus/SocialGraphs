Much of it was filmed inside the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]], only a few miles from Hollywood.\n\n==Plot==\nAbbie Polin, a New York heart surgeon, has a heart attack in the middle of surgery. An expert, he is able to instruct his colleagues on exactly what to give him and do to minimize the damage.\n\nAbbie is later placed in a room and put on monitors. Fighting off sleep triggers a childhood memory in which he also resisted sleeping with his unsympathetic dad. \n\nWatching old home movies with Lisa, the romantic interest in Abbie's life and pediatrician in the hospital, she asks about his family. His parents divorced when he was seven, and she is shocked when he admits his father is still living, as he\u00b4d talked as if he wasn't. His mother lives in Vermont. \n \nLee goes to Los Angeles to see his father, Abe, who works in Hollywood as the \"king of the extras.\" Their relationship has been strained for several years. Immediately upon arrival, Lee accompanies him to a job where he is acting as a patient in a hospital. \n\nAfterwards, they to a bar where extras go, and Abe proves to be popular. He asks about Abbie's mom then asks why he's there. When told he had a heart attack, Abe disappears, calling Abbie with the bar's pay phone to avoid too intimate of an interaction. \n\nAbe insists Abbie stay in his apartment, but he won't take time off from work while he's there. While he's shooting, Lisa comes for a surprise visit. She and Abe bond well, just as gets along famously with everyone but his son. Abe begins having memory loss which Abbie and Lisa observe while he's shooting.\n\nThe couple plans to head back to NYC, but Abe reroutes them to Mexican [[Los Angeles|LA]]. He continues to show signs of confusion, so Abbie takes him to a medical facility. After running some tests he eventually diagnoses him with an inoperable brain aneurysm. \n\nFather and son grow closer in time, doing things together they hadn't before, like riding ponies, fishing... and, before it's too late, Abbie helps Abe get a speaking role in a film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Abbie Polin\n* [[Alan King]] as Abe Polin\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Lisa\n* [[David Ackroyd]] as 1st Assistant Director\n* Chris Aable as himself (as host of \"Hollywood Today\")\n* [[Phil Fondacaro]] as Horace Bosco\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Al (Broccoli)\n* [[Mark L.
