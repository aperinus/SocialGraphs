''Asterix: The Land of the Gods'' was released on DVD, VOD and Blu-ray on 9 June 2015, by M6 Vid\u00e9o.\n\n==Plot==\nFrustrated with the ongoing rebellion of the Gauls, Julius Caesar devises a new scheme to conquer them: the construction of a city of luxury apartments dubbed \u201cThe Mansions Of The Gods\u201d in the forest near the Gauls' village as a means to absorb them into Roman civilization.\n\nDuring a [[Boar hunting|boar hunt]], Asterix and Obelix discover the Mansions\u2019 construction site. Project leader and [[architect]] Squaronthehypotenus and the Roman legion commanded by Centurion Somniferus order slaves to deforest the surrounding area. Asterix and Obelix attempt to counteract the Romans\u2019 efforts using magic [[acorn]]s from Getafix the druid, which instantly sprout into full trees upon planting.\n\nUpon hearing the frustrated Squaronthehypotunus threatening to work the slaves to death, Asterix and Obelix invade the Roman camp to free the slaves and provide them with the Gauls' magic potion as a means to escape. This backfires however when the slaves instead use it to rapidly advance construction, as well as barter for the same pay as the legionaries, along with their freedom and apartments for each of them upon completion. The legionaries also go on strike for similar reasons upon hearing about it.\n\nThe Gauls prepares to attack and demolish the Mansions, but discover it to already be populated by Roman civilians. Realizing that they cannot harm the civilians, they return to the village to plan how to make them leave. Meanwhile, Anonymus, Dulcia and Mischiefus, a family from Rome, are denied their apartments given to them in a lottery due to lacking documents. Upon encountering and befriending Obelix and Dogmatix in the forest, the Gauls reluctantly agree to temporarily accommodate the Roman family\n\nAsterix, Obelix and Getafix try numerous methods to make the civilians leave, from causing heavy rain and noise pollution, to trying to create a noxious stench, only for these to backfire by the civilians embracing these as a natural part of life in Brittany. The Roman civilians also begin shopping in the village, causing an escalating price war over fish and 'antique' weaponry. Asterix, appalled with what the village has become, leaves with Obelix, Getafix, Dogmatix and Cacofonix to get their own apartment at the Mansions. While Squaronthehypotenus is reluctant to allow their stay, Senator Prospectus allows them to stay as part of Caesar's plan.\n\nCaesar then enacts the next phase of the plan by offering free apartments to the Gauls. In another attempt to make the Roman civilians leave, Asterix has Cacofonix to sing deafeningly loud outside the mansions. This almost works until the rest of the Gauls shows up to silence Cacofonix and move into their new apartments.\n\nCaesar begins the final part of his plan, razing the village. The legion, however refuses to cooperate with Getafix and Obelix still at large. Getafix, Mischiefus and Dogmatix are captured and held in the Mansions' reception, while Obelix faints from hunger next to the Roman legion while searching for the three, and is thrown into a chamber beneath the Mansions.\n\nAsterix awakens the next day to find the village being besieged, and the Gauls are brought along to watch the village's destruction. The Gauls keep the Romans at bay by pretending to still possess the magic potion, while Asterix makes his way to the Mansions. Meeting with Anonymus and Dulcia, they are able to free Getafix, Dogmatix, and Mischiefus and escaping into the apartments, Getafix brews the magic potion from ingredients in each of the rooms. The Gauls chase the Romans back to the Mansions, only to be captured once the Romans realise their deception. Asterix attempts to rescue them, but ends up in a poor condition from consuming an incomplete magic potion.\n\nCaesar and Prospectus arrive to declare victory over the Gauls, until Obelix rises from underground, revived after consuming food from an arrival banquet disposed into his chamber. The Gauls get their magic potion and defeat the Romans in battle, and demand Caesar take the civilians to head back to Rome, finally leading to the demolition of the Mansions of the Gods. In tradition, the Gauls celebrate their victory with a banquet atop the ruins of the mansions. Back in Rome, Anonymus and Mischiefus get even on Caesar by throwing one of Getafix's acorns into his podium at the [[Colosseum]], leaving him dangling from a tree branch.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character name\n!French voice actor\n!English dubbing actor<br /><small>([[Ocean Productions]], 2015)</small>\n!English dubbing actor<br /><small>(Kaleidoscope Entertainment, 2016)</small>\n|-\n|Asterix\n|[[Roger Carel]]\n|Ken Kramer\n|[[Jack Whitehall]]\n|-\n|Obelix\n|[[Guillaume Briat]]\n|[[C.
