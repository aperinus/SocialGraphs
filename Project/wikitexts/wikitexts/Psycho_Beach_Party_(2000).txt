However Chicklet begins displaying multiple personalities, experiences inexplicable blackouts, and fears that she might be the one responsible for a series of mysterious murders in her beachside town. The deaths are investigated by Captain Monica Stark ([[Charles Busch]]), who also suspects Chicklet's mother ([[Beth Broderick]]), Chicklet's best friend Berdine (Danni Wheeler), surfing guru the Great Kanaka ([[Thomas Gibson]]) and B-movie actress Bettina Barnes ([[Kimberley Davies]]).\n\nOther characters include university dropout (and Chicklet's love interest) Starcat ([[Nicholas Brendon]]), Swedish exchange student Lars ([[Matt Keeslar]]), surfers Yo-Yo (Nick Cornish) and Provoloney ([[Andrew Levitas]]), Starcat's girlfriend Marvel Ann ([[Amy Adams]]), and the class \"queen bee\" Rhonda ([[Kathleen Robertson]]).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lauren Ambrose]] as Florence 'Chicklet' Forrest\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as Kanaka\n* [[Nicholas Brendon]] as 'Starcat'\n* [[Kimberley Davies]] as Bettina Barnes\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Lars\n* [[Charles Busch]] as Captain Monica Stark\n* [[Beth Broderick]] as Ruth Forrest\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Marvel Ann\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as Rhonda\n* Nick Cornish as 'Yo-Yo'\n* [[Andrew Levitas]] as Provoloney\n* [[Channon Roe]] as 'Wedge' Riley\n* Jenica Bergere as 'Cookie'\n* Danni Wheeler as Berdine\n* Nathan Bexton as T.J.\n* Buddy Quaid as Junior\n* [[Nicholas D'Agosto]] as The Counterman\n\n==Play and productions==\nThe play was originally entitled '''''Gidget Goes Psychotic''''', but the title was changed due to concerns about copyright. In the original 1987 production, Charles Busch played the role of Chicklet.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Deciding that he might not be believable in the role of a sixteen-year-old girl (\"while I can still manage, with the aid of a sympathetic cameraman, to play a sophisticated 25, 16 would be a stretch\"), he added the character of Monica Stark to the movie.\n\nAfter over 20 years, the play had its premiere UK production by Vertigo Theatre Productions in Manchester in March 2011. The production returned in August 2012 at Sacha's Hotel Ballroom. A production was held in Australia at the [[Bondi Pavilion]] Theatre from November to December 2012;<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/sand-and-kooky-silhouettes-prove-perfect-fit-for-summer-20121203-2ar0n.html|title=Sand and kooky silhouettes prove perfect fit for summer|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald|smh.com.au]], [[Fairfax Media]]|access-date=April 29, 2013}}</ref> productions also ran in Melbourne (notably at the [[Midsumma Festival]]) in early 2013, receiving generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreworks.org.au/whatson/event/?id=145|title=Theatre Works >> Event >> What's On & Bookings >> Psycho Beach Party - MIDSUMMA|publisher=Theatre Works|access-date=April 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, there will also be another production of Psycho Beach Party [http://essendontheatrecompany.com.au/ opening in March 2021 by Essendon Theatre Company].\n<ref>http://essendontheatrecompany.com.au</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{As of|2020|07}}, the film holds a 55% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 33 reviews with an average rating of 5.55/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/psycho_beach_party/|title=Psycho Beach Party - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Flixster]], Inc.|access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a positive review, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the film \"accomplishes what no stage production could. By assiduously copying the look and sound of those '60s movies -- the wriggling title sequences, the twangy surf music and the gawky gee-whiz screen acting style -- it definitively skewers the false innocence of American pop culture on the eve of the countercultural deluge. Most of the play's subversive humor has arrived on the screen intact.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Kevin Thomas compared the film unfavorably to its source material, opining that it \"has to be twice as funny a play as it is as a movie\";<ref name=\"LAT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/topic/cl-movie000824-1,0,4345583.story|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629152054/http://www.latimes.com/topic/cl-movie000824-1,0,4345583.story|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2013|title=Psycho Beach Party - latimes.com|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2013|date=August 24, 2000}}</ref> he further explains that \"deliberate [[Camp (style)|camp]] like this film presents a special challenge: It must generate and sustain a high level of energy or it will swiftly fall flat. The latter is too often the case here.\"<ref name=\"LAT\"/>\n\nPraising the \"strong women\" of the film, Bob Graham of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also wrote that Busch (as Monica Stark) \"captures the woman-alone-in-the-world toughness of the roles played by the stars he loves. It goes beyond camp. He is sincere.\" However, Graham reasoned that the film has \"rough edges\", despite conceding that \"they probably work to this larky, cheeky picture's advantage\".
