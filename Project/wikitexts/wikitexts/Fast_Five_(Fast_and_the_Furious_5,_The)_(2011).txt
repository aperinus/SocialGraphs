It is the sequel to ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009) and the fifth installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. It stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]],  [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Matt Schulze]], [[Sung Kang]], [[Tego Calder\u00f3n]], [[Don Omar]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Joaquim de Almeida]] and [[Dwayne Johnson]]. In the film, [[Dominic Toretto]] (Diesel) and [[Brian O'Conner]] (Walker) recruit a team to steal $100&nbsp;million from a corrupt businessman while being pursued for arrest by [[Diplomatic Security Service|U.S. Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Johnson).\n\nWhile developing ''Fast Five'', [[Universal Pictures]] deliberately departed from the [[street racing]] theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. ''Fast Five'' is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as brawls, gun fights, and the central heist. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, with the film being advertised through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at [[NASCAR]] races.\n\nLin, Diesel, and Walker's returns were finalized in February 2010, and principal photography began that July and lasted until that October, with filming locations including [[Atlanta]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. [[Brian Tyler]], the composer of the previous two installments, returned to compose [[Fast Five (score)|the score]]. The film is notable for primarily featuring practical stuntwork as opposed to [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] placements seen in other entries in the franchise.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022|reason=not supported in body; the entire series is known for featuring heavily practical stunts}}\n\n''Fast Five'' premiered at the [[Cin\u00e9polis|Cin\u00e9polis Lagoon]] in Rio de Janeiro on April 15, 2011, and was theatrically released worldwide on April 29. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for Lin's direction, the action sequences, and the performances of the cast. ''Fast Five'' grossed $626 million worldwide, becoming the [[2011 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2011]], the then-highest-grossing film in the franchise, and set records related to Universal's highest-grossing opening weekend in several international markets. A sequel, ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', was released in the United States on May 24, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Dominic Toretto]] is being transported to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|Lompoc Prison]] by bus,{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the ending of ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009).}} his sister Mia Toretto and friend [[Brian O'Conner]] lead an assault on the bus and free Dom. While the authorities search for them, the trio escapes to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Awaiting Dom's arrival, Mia and Brian join their friend Vince and other participants on a job to steal three cars from a train. Brian and Mia learn that agents from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] are also on the train and that the cars are seized property. When Dom arrives with his accomplices, he realizes that their leader Zizi is only interested in stealing the [[Ford GT40]]. Dom has Mia steal the car herself before he and Brian fight Zizi and his henchmen, during which Zizi kills the DEA agents. Brian and Dom are captured and brought to crime lord Hernan Reyes, the owner of the cars and Zizi's boss. Reyes orders the pair interrogated to discover the car's location, but they escape to their safehouse.\n\nDom, Brian, and Mia are framed as the murderers of the DEA agents, and the U.S. government sends a team of [[Diplomatic Security Service]] agents, led by Luke Hobbs and assisted by local officer Elena Neves, to Rio to arrest them. While Brian, Dom, and Mia examine the car to discover its importance, Vince arrives and is caught removing a computer chip from it. He admits he was planning to sell the chip to Reyes on his own, and Dom forces him to leave. Brian investigates the chip and discovers it contains financial details of Reyes' criminal empire, including the locations of {{US$|100 million}} in cash. Hobbs and his team arrive at Dom's safehouse, but find it under assault by Reyes' men searching for the chip. Brian, Dom and Mia escape after a chase across the [[favela]]s. Dom suggests they split up and leave Rio, but Mia announces she is pregnant with Brian's child. Dom agrees to stick together, suggesting they steal Reyes' money to start a new life. They organize a team to perform the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos.\n\nTo centralize the cash, Dom's team attacks one of the locations and burns the money in front of Reyes' staff. Afraid of further attacks, Reyes consolidates the remaining money in an evidence vault inside a police station. Dom's team does surveillance, buys equipment, and acquires Reyes' handprint. After their fastest cars prove to be too slow for security cameras, they steal four 2010 [[Dodge Charger (2005)|Dodge Charger]] police cars to blend in. Vince rejoins Dom's team after saving Mia from Reyes' men. Hobbs' team eventually finds and arrests Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them for [[extradition]] to the United States in a [[Terradyne Armored Vehicles Gurkha|Gurkha LAPV]], the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men. Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince help Hobbs and Elena escape the ambush, but the rest of Hobbs' men and Vince are killed. Wanting to avenge their murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang breaks into the police station with the LAPV and uses two of the Chargers to tear the vault holding Reyes' money from the building, dragging it through the city. Han and Roman arrive to disrupt police vehicles on their trail.\n\nAdvancing on the bridge after an extensive chase, Dom has Brian continue without him while he turns around, smashing the police and Reyes' vehicles with the vault. Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault, and Brian returns and kills Zizi. Hobbs arrives and executes Reyes in retribution for his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is. When Dom and Brian depart, however, Hobbs finds the vault empty, as Dom's crew switched it via a trash truck before they reached the bridge. After splitting the cash and giving Vince's family his cut, Dom's team go their separate ways. On a tropical beach, Brian challenges Dom to a final, no-stakes race to prove who is the better driver. In [[Washington, D.C.]], Hobbs is given a file by Monica Fuentes concerning the hijack of a military convoy in [[Berlin]], where he discovers a recent photo of Dom's former girlfriend Letty, who had been presumed dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 175\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], and [[Jordana Brewster]] reprised their roles from the original ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001).\n   | image1    = Vin Diesel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n   | image3    = JordanaBrewsterMarch09cropped.jpg\n   | alt3      =\n   | caption3  =\n}}\n\n{{Further|topic=the characters|List of Fast & Furious characters}}\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]] <br /> A professional criminal, street racer, and fugitive.

It was also confirmed that Diesel, Walker, writer [[Chris Morgan (filmmaker)|Chris Morgan]] and producer [[Neal H. Moritz]] would all return to their roles for the new installment.<ref name=\"ProductionVariety\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantSequel\"/> Moritz said that, following the success of ''Fast & Furious'' (2009), which had reunited Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez and Brewster from the original film, the production wanted to bring them back again for the next one. Diesel felt that the story between the characters portrayed by himself and Walker should continue, envisioning it as three chapters, of which ''Fast Five'' would be the last. Diesel also wanted to bring back a variety of characters that had been in previous films without interacting, put them together and \"have a lot of fun\".{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=17}}\n\nThe production had originally intended to film on location in Rio de Janeiro. However, the Puerto Rican government offered tax incentives totaling nearly $11 million, influencing the decision to film there, using [[Puerto Rico]] to represent Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"ProductionCollider\"/><ref name=\"FilmingGeneral\"/>\n\nUniversal intended to transform the series from street-racing action into a series of heist films with car chases in the vein of ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), with ''Fast Five'' as the transitional movie.<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/> In April 2011, Universal chairman Adam Fogelson said:<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/>\n<blockquote>The question putting ''Fast Five'' and ''[[Fast & Furious 6|Fast Six]]'' together for us was: Can we take it out of being a pure car culture movie and into being a true action franchise in the spirit of those great heist films made 10 or 15 years ago?</blockquote>\n\nFogelson said that the racing aspect had put a \"ceiling\" on the number of people willing to see films in the series, and that, by turning it into a series where car driving ability is just one aspect of the film, he hoped to increase the series' audience.<ref name=\"DeadlineSequel\"/>\n\n===Writing===\n{{Quote box|width=27%|align=right|quote=\"For me, each chapter in this franchise is an extension of the first one, and they each get bigger.

Morgan worked with Diesel to produce a story arc that would further explore and develop Diesel's character.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=18}} An idea involving heisting a large safe had been conceived by Morgan during the production of ''Fast & Furious'', but that film's premise did not work with how Morgan envisioned it.  He later incorporated it into ''Fast Five''.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $125 million,<ref name=\"FFiveBudgetGross\"/> the shooting of ''Fast Five'' was scheduled for July and August 2010.<ref name=\"comingsoon\" /> Shooting had started by July 14, 2010.<ref name=\"Roush\" />\n\nThree film units worked simultaneously. The main cast were required to travel to Rio at the behest of Lin, who felt it important to understand the area and its culture to give the film a good sense of place.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=24}} Diesel agreed that it was important to shoot key scenes in Brazil, commenting \"we were able to shoot where other productions might not be able to shoot because our franchise has such good street cred.\"{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe Rio film unit captured aerial shots of the city including [[Sugarloaf Mountain]], [[Fort Copacabana]], [[Ipanema#Beach|Ipanema Beach]], the [[Dona Marta|Dona Marta lookout point]] and the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] statue. [[Establishing shot]]s of the heist team members were taken as each arrived in Rio. Gibson was filmed arriving in character at [[Rio de Janeiro-Gale\u00e3o International Airport|Gale\u00e3o International Airport]] but, when it became publicly known that a scene was being shot at the airport, the cast and crew were mobbed. A similar situation occurred while Ludacris was shooting a scene in which his character buys a car to drive around the city.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=24}} A scene where the completed heist team walk down a beach was filmed in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=24}}\n\nThe rooftop chase across [[favela]]s was filmed in Puerto Rico, where the production could have more control over the area. The main and second filming units began filming in and around the capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. The island's mixture of tropical greenery and wide streets allowed the production to re-create the densely populated favelas of Rio while completing the larger action and external scenes without incident. Production designer Peter Wenham had the task of transforming Puerto Rico and Atlanta into the previously scouted Rio locations in four weeks, as the production deemed Rio unsuitable for filming many of the larger scenes. Wenham had to reinforce buildings to support the heavy camera equipment, and to alter the colors of more than 30 buildings in the city to make them suitable for filming. His team needed to alter the buildings and strew debris to make the area look disheveled and appear as a Rio favela. Wenham remarked that, though the development was difficult, in part due to the heat, it was \"a walk in the park\" compared with filming in the Rio favelas themselves.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=26\u201327}} Wenham aimed to maintain a monochromatic color scheme for the film, with muted blacks and grays, including his choice of colors for the cars used. He only chose to add a multitude of colors in the favela set.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=27}} The Teodoro Moscosco bridge connecting San Juan to neighboring [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico|Isla Verde]] was used to film the final showdown between Dom and Reyes, while a U.S. Navy base pier 60 miles outside San Juan stood in for the bridge for scenes involving the vault smashing cars.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=30}}<ref name=\"FilmingGeneral\"/> Action scenes were also filmed in the [[Hato Rey, Puerto Rico|Hato Rey]] and [[R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico|R\u00edo Piedras]] districts of San Juan.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=30}}\n\nA foot pursuit in which Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson and his team was filmed over the course of a week in the small hillside town of [[Naranjito, Puerto Rico]]. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=26}} Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=26\u201327}} In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.<ref name=\"FilmingGeneral\"/>\n\nFilming moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], for the final phase.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=27}} Wenham and his team transformed a defunct train yard into an abandoned auto plant used by the protagonists as their headquarters.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=27\u201328}} Redesigning the train yard took place over several months. It was required to allow enough space for stunt drivers to drive into the building, and it had to include an integrated lighting system. The design team removed walls, hauled out old railway cars, suspended rusted car parts and auto-plant car rails, and constructed smaller buildings within the main building to transform the site. With twenty-five pages of script to shoot in a limited time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his team spent three weeks setting up a series of high-powered, motorized lights in the rafters of the building, that could be controlled remotely to allow lighting to be altered quickly while fully illuminating the set.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=28}} An exterior scene involving Diesel and Walker attending a car party, involving several high-performance cars, was filmed near the [[Georgia Dome]].{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=28}} The train heist scene was filmed in [[Rice, California]] over three weeks.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=25}}\n\nA brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's characters was considered difficult to choreograph. The characters were written to be equally formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of rehearsal and more than a week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n===Vehicle stunts===\n[[File:Milla-de-oro-min-2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Most of the climactic scenes were filmed in the [[Golden Mile, Puerto Rico|Milla de Oro]] district in [[Hato Rey, Puerto Rico]].]]\nThe climactic vault heist required four weeks of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance.<ref name=\"VehicleStunt\"/> The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=29}} The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing the capabilities of the prop vaults and the [[Dodge Charger]]s driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey,{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=32}} the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a [[Porsche Cayenne]], which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a [[Subaru Impreza]] with a steel cage built around it that allowed for [[tracking shot]]s.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=29}} The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower of sparks that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=29}}\n\nSix versions of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a fa\u00e7ade built onto the front of a semi-truck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=29\u201330}} The {{convert|4|ST|MT|spell=in|adj=on}} vault was driven by stunt driver [[Henry Kingi]], who had to wear a temperature-controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed {{convert|100|F}}.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=30}} A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated.<ref name=\"VehicleStunt\"/> Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=32}} Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the vault hanging over the edge of the [[Teodoro Moscoso Bridge]]. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.<ref name=\"VehicleStunt\"/>\n\nThe train heist presented several challenges. The filmmakers were required to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and meet the needs of the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to jump out of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=32}} The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist\u2014a 1972 [[De Tomaso Pantera]], a 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] GS Roadster, and a [[Ford GT40]]\u2014to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=32}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Fast Five (soundtrack)|Fast Five (score)}}\nThe film soundtrack was released on iTunes on April 25, 2011, and on CD on May 3, 2011, by [[ABKCO Records]].
