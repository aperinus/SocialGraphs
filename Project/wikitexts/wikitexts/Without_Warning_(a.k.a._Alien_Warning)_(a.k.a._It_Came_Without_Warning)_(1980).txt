The film released on September 26, 1980 and was released on home video for the first time on August 5, 2014 through [[Shout! Factory]]'s Scream Factory label in a [[Blu-ray]]/[[DVD-Video|DVD]] combo pack.\n\nThe film is credited with being an inspiration for the 1987 film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', both of which star [[Kevin Peter Hall]] as a costumed hunter of alien origin.<ref name=\"avclub\" />\n\nDan Grodnik optioned the script in 1978 and hired Bennett Tramer to do a rewrite. Half way through the script, Tramer went to Grodnik and told him he had an epiphany, that he couldn't finish the sci-fi script as he just realized he was a comedy writer. He handed Grodnik the unfinished script with apologies. Grodnik sat down in his living room on an IBM typewriter on top of a TV tray table and finished the script. Shortly thereafter the film went into production. When it was time to list the credits on screen Grodnik asked Tramer if he wanted his credit to read, Bennett Tramer or Ben Tramer. Because Tramer was trying to break into the comedy writing business he felt putting his name on the film wasn't a good idea so he asked to be credited as Ben Nett. Grodnik explained to Tramer, who had no credits at the time, that even the great director [[Robert Wise]], who directed ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' started off with a horror film entitled ''[[The Curse of the Cat People]]'', and that didn't hurt his career but Tramer was adamant that the film credit him as Ben Nett. Tramer went on to write the TV series ''[[Saved by the Bell]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA father and son go hunting in the mountains. Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying [[jellyfish]]-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles.\n\nSome time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor ([[Jack Palance]]). A group of [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]] is also in the area; their leader ([[Larry Storch]]) is also killed by the alien creatures, while his troop runs into an unidentified humanoid and flee.\n\nThe teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the jellyfish which tries to get through the car's windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred 'Sarge' Dobbs ([[Martin Landau]]), who is a mentally ill [[veteran]]. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg.\n\nWhile they discuss the situation, the [[sheriff]] arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \"jellyfish\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge.\n\nThey make it to a house where they find new clothing and try to relax. In the night, Sandy wakes up and goes looking for Greg, only to discover that he has been killed by the alien, who is still in the room. She flees to the basement and the creature is about to get her when Taylor arrives and saves her. On the way to the shack, he tells her about the creature: it is a tall extraterrestrial ([[Kevin Peter Hall]]) who hunts humans for sport to keep as trophies, using the living creatures as living weapons against its prey.\n\nThey wait at the shack to ambush the hunter with [[dynamite]] when Sarge shows up, almost spoiling their plan. He and Taylor fight, and Sandy is about to hit Sarge from behind when the alien arrives and kills Sarge. Taylor then shoots the creature, with little to no effect. Realizing the last chance of success, he lures it to the shack, which is then blown up by Sandy. She alone survives the horrible night.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* Tarah Nutter as Sandy\n* Christopher S.
