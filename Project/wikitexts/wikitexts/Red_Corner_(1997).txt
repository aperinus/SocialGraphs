Before the deal can be finalized, Moore is framed for the murder of a powerful Chinese general's daughter, and the satellite contract is instead awarded to Moore's competitor, Gerhardt Hoffman ([[Ulrich Matschoss]]). Moore's court-appointed lawyer, Shen Yuelin ([[Bai Ling]]), initially does not believe his claims of innocence, but the pair gradually unearth evidence that not only vindicates Moore, but implicates powerful figures within the Chinese central government administration, exposing undeniable [[cabal|conspiracy]] and [[political corruption|corruption]]. Shen manages to convince several high-ranking Chinese officials to release evidence that proves Moore's innocence. Moore is quickly released from prison while the conspirators responsible for framing him are arrested. At the airport, Moore asks Shen to leave China with him, but she decides to stay, as the case has opened her eyes to the injustices rife throughout China. She does admit, however, that meeting Moore has changed her life, and she now considers him a part of her family. They both share a heartfelt hug on the airport runway, before Moore departs for America.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Jack Moore\n* [[Bai Ling]] as Shen Yuelin\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Bob Ghery\n* [[Byron Mann]] as Lin Dan\n* [[Peter Donat]] as David McAndrews\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Ed Pratt\n* [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] as Chairman Xu\n* [[James Hong]] as Lin Shou\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Li Cheng\n* [[Ulrich Matschoss]] as Gerhardt Hoffman\n* [[Richard Venture]] as Ambassador Reed\n* Jessey Meng as Hong Ling\n* [[Roger Yuan]] as Huan Minglu\n* Chi Yu Li as General Hong\n* [[Henry O]] as Procurator General Yang\n* [[Kent Faulcon]] as Marine Guard\n* Jia Yao Li as Director Liu\n* Yukun Lu as Director Liu's Associate\n* Robert Lin as Director Liu's Interpreter<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for Red Corner |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119994/fullcredits#cast |access-date=March 20, 2012}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Red Corner'' was shot in Los Angeles using elaborate sets and CGI rendering of 3,500 still shots and two minutes of footage from China. In order to establish the film's verisimilitude, several Beijing actors were brought to the United States on visas for filming. The judicial and penitentiary scenes were recreated from descriptions given by attorneys and judges practicing in China and the video segment showing the execution of Chinese prisoners was an actual execution.
