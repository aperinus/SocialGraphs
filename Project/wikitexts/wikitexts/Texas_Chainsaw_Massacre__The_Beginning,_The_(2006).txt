The sixth installment in [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]], it was written by [[Sheldon Turner]] from a story by Turner and [[David J. Schow]], directed by [[Jonathan Liebesman]] and co-produced by [[Kim Henkel]] and [[Tobe Hooper]] (co-creators of the original [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|1974 film]]). The film's story takes place four years before its predecessor. It stars [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Diora Baird]], [[Taylor Handley]], [[Matt Bomer]] and [[R. Lee Ermey]].\n\nOriginally, the film had the [[Subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] ''The Origin''. [[New Line Cinema]] had to pay $3.1 million more than expected in order to keep the rights to the franchise after [[Dimension Films]] made a large offer to buy it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=B |first=Brian |date=2004-07-21 |title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 in the works |url=https://movieweb.com/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-2-in-the-works/ |access-date=2022-10-26 |website=[[MovieWeb]]}}</ref>\n\n''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning'' was released in [[North America]] on October 6, 2006. The film received negative reviews from critics but still grossed $51.8 million on a budget of $16 million, although this would be less than half the gross of the previous film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, a woman dies while giving birth prematurely in a [[slaughterhouse]] in [[Texas]], and the supervisor disposes of the baby by leaving him in a dumpster. When young [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Luda Mae Hewitt|Luda Mae Hewitt]] finds the child, she takes him back to the Hewitt residence, names him [[Leatherface|Thomas]] and raises him as her own son.\n\nThirty years later, Thomas ([[Andrew Bryniarski]]) works in the slaughterhouse under the same supervisor who left him in the dumpster. When the plant is shut down by the health department, he refuses to leave until the supervisor makes him. Thomas murders his supervisor and finds a [[chainsaw]], which he takes with him. When Sheriff Hoyt attempts to arrest him, Luda Mae's son, [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Sheriff Hoyt / Charlie Hewitt Jr.|Charlie Hewitt]] ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) shoots him and assumes his identity.\n\nMeanwhile, brothers Eric ([[Matt Bomer]]) and Dean ([[Taylor Handley]]), are driving across the country with their girlfriends, Chrissie ([[Jordana Brewster]]) and Bailey ([[Diora Baird]]), to enlist in the [[Vietnam War]]. At a diner, they run into a biker gang, one of whom follows them on her motorcycle. She draws a shotgun and orders the group to pull over. In the ensuing chaos, the car crashes, and Chrissie is thrown into a field. When Hoyt arrives, he kills the biker and makes them put her body in his car. He then calls for [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Monty Hewitt|Uncle Monty]] to tow the jeep, which Chrissie is hiding in.\n\nHoyt drives the group to the Hewitt house where he has Thomas butcher the biker's body. Chrissie runs to the highway and flags down Holden, the biker's boyfriend, and they return to the house together. Hoyt tortures Dean after finding out that he was [[Draft dodging|going to forgo the Vietnam War draft]]. When Hoyt leaves, Eric breaks free from his restraints and gets Dean to safety before sneaking into the house to free Bailey. Bailey escapes in Monty's truck but Thomas stabs her with a meat hook and drags her back to the house. Dean gets caught in a bear trap, and Hoyt knocks Eric unconscious.\n\nHolden and Chrissie part ways to search for their friends. While Chrissie finds Dean, Holden takes Hoyt hostage. Thomas straps Eric to a wooden table and slices off the nerves in both of his arms. Hoyt calls out to Thomas for help, and he cuts Holden in half with the chainsaw. Chrissie finds Eric in the basement but is unable to free him, and hides when Thomas returns. Thomas kills Eric with the chainsaw, then skins his face and wears it as a mask. Chrissie is about to flee when she hears Bailey's screams and decides to save her. She finds her upstairs, but Hoyt catches her and brings her downstairs for dinner, along with Bailey and an unconscious Dean. Leatherface slits Bailey's throat and tries to take Chrissie to the basement, but she stabs him in the back with a screwdriver, and jumps out of a window.\n\nDean regains consciousness and savagely beats Hoyt before heading off to find Chrissie. Chrissie enters the slaughterhouse, grabs a knife and cuts Leatherface's face, but he overpowers her. Dean intervenes but Leatherface kills him with the chainsaw. Chrissie escapes, hijacks an abandoned car, and drives off. She sees a [[state trooper]] and pulled over pedestrian, but as she pulls over, Leatherface appears in the backseat and impales her with the chainsaw, causing her to lose control and crash into the trooper and pedestrian. Leatherface walks along the road back towards the Hewitt house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as [[Leatherface#Remake series|Thomas Hewitt / Leatherface]]\n* [[R.

They contacted [[Scott Kosar]], who wrote the 2003 remake, but he was tied up with other projects, so they turned to [[Sheldon Turner]], whom they worked with on ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (2005). The producers asked Turner to answer questions posed by the original ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' story concerning the Hewitt family.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\">{{Cite web |title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning Production Notes |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2006/texas_chainsaw_massacre_beginning.htm |access-date=2022-11-01}}</ref>\n \nDirector [[Jonathan Liebesman]] was not certain about taking on the film until he learned that it was to be a prequel. He proposed not trying to explain too much of the killer's motives, and that \"the movie needed to feel like the beginning of hell.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrinciple photography began in Austin. Liebesman asked for [[Lukas Ettlin]] as [[cinematographer]], who had shot every student film Liebesman made. The filmmakers decided on a desaturated red, white and blue color theme, representing \"the decay of the American dream, the family that's gone off the rails.\" The film was shot in chronological order, and after the depiction of the car crash, Ettlin changed the [[shutter angle]] from 180 to 90 degrees for the rest of the shoot to make everything appear more hectic.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning'' was released on October 6, 2006, in 2,820 theaters, debuting at number 2 at the box office, grossing $18,508,228 on its first weekend.
