Giddy suggests settling the issue with the traditional end-of-the-summer boxing match over rights to the lake. A tough, inner city punk named Flash is at Camp Sasquatch for community service as a counselor-in-training.  Flash is recruited to box in order to save Sasquatch.  Cheryl, a naive teen on whom Flash has set his sights, has never seen a \"[[Penis|pinky]]\", so her fellow teenage girl campers arrange for her to see a man naked.  Meanwhile, the campers try to hide an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien from another planet]] who has been dropped off by his parents to learn Earth culture.  He is nicknamed \"Meathead\" by the kids after repeating one of them saying \"Me, Ted\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Coach Giddy\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Colonel Jack 'Batjack' Hershy\n* [[John Mengatti]] as Armand 'Flash' Carducci\n* [[Kim Richards]] as Cheryl\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]] as Jamie / Voice of Meathead\n* [[Misty Rowe]] as Fanny\n* [[John Larroquette]] as Lieutenant Felix Foxglove\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Albert\n* Joe Nipote as 'Boomer'\n* [[Jason Hervey]] as Tommy\n* [[Ralph Seymour (actor)|Ralph Seymour]] as Eddie\n* [[Elayne Boosler]] as Mother\n* [[Nancy Glass]] as Daughter\n* [[Felix Silla]] as 'Meathead'\n* [[Joaquin Martinez]] as Chief Rawhide\n* Blackie Dammett as Sergeant Paladin\n* [[Donald Gibb]] as 'Mad Dog'\n* Jason Luque as Jai Styxxx\n\n==Reception==\n''Meatballs Part II'' grossed [[USD|$]]2,515,268 the first week-end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=meatballs2.htm|title=Meatballs Part II|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|location=United States|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref>    The film grossed $5,410,972 domestically overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=meatballs2.htm|title=Meatballs Part II|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|location=United States|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nCritic [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in his review: \"Trailing bits of ''[[Rocky]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and using a plot device from the 1983 film ''[[Screwballs]],'' which itself aspired to be ''[[Porky's]]'', ''Meatballs Part II'' shares with 1979's ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' not much more than a summer camp setting. This time - amid the efforts of two senior counselors to find sexual privacy, amid prurience and budding romance involving an innocent blonde preppy and a young punk given a choice of a counselor's job or reform school, and amid the efforts of some of the little campers to harbor an extraterrestrial - the future of Camp Sasquatch is in peril.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05E0DE1238F93BA2575BC0A962948260|title=Screen: 'Meatballs Part II,' Hih Jinks At Summer Camp|first=Lawrence|last=Van Gelder|authorlink=Lawrence Van Gelder|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=August 18, 1984|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' lists only two critics' reviews, both of which are negative.
