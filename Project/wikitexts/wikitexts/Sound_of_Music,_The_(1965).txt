Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain [[Georg von Trapp]] to be [[governess]] to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military [[discipline]] following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her.\n\nWhile the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children from [[Drapery|drapes]] that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy [[socialite]], and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\n\nImpressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming [[Salzburg Festival]], but the Captain disapproves of letting his children to sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire [[waltz]] in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional ''[[L\u00e4ndler]]'' folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that that Captain's feelings for Maria haven't changed, so she peacefully calls off the engagement and returns to Vienna while encouraging the Captain to express his feelings for Maria, who marries him.\n\nWhile the couple are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the [[Third Reich]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the couple return to their home, where Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at [[Bremerhaven]] to accept a commission in the [[Kriegsmarine]]. Strongly opposed to the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and the ''Anschluss'', the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi soldiers]], led by the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.\n\nLater that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Maria von Trapp|Maria]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Georg von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]\n** [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] overdubbed Plummer's singing<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165806779/the-unsung-overdub-star-in-sound-of-music |title=The Unsung Overdub Star In 'Sound Of Music' |work=NPR |date=November 24, 2012 |access-date=May 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130233908/https://www.npr.org/2012/11/24/165806779/the-unsung-overdub-star-in-sound-of-music|archive-date=November 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Baroness Elsa von Schraeder\n* [[Richard Haydn]] as Max Detweiler\n* [[Peggy Wood]] as [[Virgilia, Mother Abbess|Mother Abbess]]\n* [[Charmian Carr]] as Liesl von Trapp\n* [[Heather Menzies]] as Louisa von Trapp\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Friedrich von Trapp\n* [[Duane Chase]] as Kurt von Trapp\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Brigitta von Trapp\n* [[Debbie Turner]] as Marta von Trapp\n* [[Kym Karath]] as Gretl von Trapp\n* [[Anna Lee]] as Sister Margaretta\n* [[Portia Nelson]] as Sister Berthe\n* [[Ben Wright (English actor)|Ben Wright]] as Herr Zeller\n* [[Daniel Truhitte]] as Rolfe\n* [[Norma Varden]] as Frau Schmidt, housekeeper\n* Gil Stuart as Franz, butler\n* [[Marni Nixon]] as Sister Sophia\n* [[Evadne Baker]] as Sister Bernice\n* [[Doris Lloyd]] as Baroness Ebberfeld\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womansworld.com/posts/entertainment/maria-von-trapp-cameo-166676|title=The Real Maria Von Trapp Made a Cameo in 'The Sound of Music' \u2014 Did You Catch It?|first=Melanie|last=Aman|work=Woman's World|date=September 23, 2018|access-date=December 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924102822/https://www.womansworld.com/posts/entertainment/maria-von-trapp-cameo-166676|archive-date=September 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| footer = Composer [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyricist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]\n| image1 = Richard Rodgers 1948.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| image2 = Oscar Hammerstein - portrait.jpg\n| width2 = 100\n| alt = Portrait photos of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II\n}}\n''The Sound of Music'' story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers'', published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband [[Georg von Trapp|Georg]] in 1947.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\">Hirsch 1993, p. 4.</ref> Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> In 1956, German producer [[Wolfgang Liebeneiner]] purchased the film rights for $9,000 ({{Inflation|US|9000|1956|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), hired [[George Hurdalek]] and [[Herbert Reinecker]] to write the screenplay, and [[Franz Grothe]] to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs.<ref name=\"hirsch-6\">Hirsch 1993, p. 6.</ref> ''[[The Trapp Family]]'' was released in [[West Germany]] on October 9, 1956, and became a major success.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, ''[[The Trapp Family in America]]'', and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/>\n\nIn 1956, [[Paramount Pictures]] purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Maria.<ref name=\"hirsch-4\"/> The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, [[Vincent J.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material.<ref name=\"hirsch-28\">Hirsch 1993, p. 28.</ref> While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was [[Robert Wise]], with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]''.<ref name=\"hirsch-13\">Hirsch 1993, p. 13.</ref> Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including [[Stanley Donen]], [[Vincent J.

After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-13-14\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 13\u201314.</ref> After hiring musical supervisor [[Roger Edens]], Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations.<ref name=\"hirsch-15\">Hirsch 1993, p. 15.</ref> In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences.<ref name=\"hirsch-31\">Hirsch 1993, p. 31.</ref> During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\">Hirsch 1993, p. 16.</ref> Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/> Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct ''[[The Collector (1965 film)|The Collector]]''. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.<ref name=\"hirsch-16\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Wise, whose film ''The Sand Pebbles'' had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film,<ref name=\"hirsch-17\">Hirsch 1993, p. 17.</ref> joining the picture in October 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-34\">Hirsch 1993, p. 34.</ref> and flew to Salzburg with associate producer [[Saul Chaplin]] and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified.<ref name=\"hirsch-75-78\">Hirsch 1993, p. 75, 78.</ref> When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]],'' whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's.<ref name=\"hirsch-34\"/> Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film.<ref name=\"hirsch-34-37\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 34\u201337.</ref> Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963,<ref name=\"hirsch-38\">Hirsch 1993, p. 38.</ref> but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain.

Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a [[letterboxed]] format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], periodically around Easter and other holidays.

[[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]] was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the [[Anschluss]], and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called [[Aigen (Salzburg city district)|Aigen]]. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in [[Zell Am See]] and [[Klosterneuburg]] after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in [[Pula|Pola]] following [[World War I]]. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, [[Agathe Whitehead]], in 1922.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nGeorg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a [[Austrian nobility|noble title]] of \"[[Ritter]]\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=M.

In reality, third child [[Maria Franziska von Trapp]] (called \"Louisa\" in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, [[Maria von Trapp|Maria Augusta Kutschera]], whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \"[She] had a terrible temper ... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\"<ref name=\"tfl-family\"/>\n\nMaria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the [[Great Depression|worldwide depression of the early 1930s]], when the Austrian national bank folded.<ref name=\"archives\"/> In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment.<ref name=\"hirsch-201-202\">Hirsch 1993, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref> In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of [[Berchtesgaden]], within sight of Adolf Hitler's [[Kehlsteinhaus]] Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in [[Zadar]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States on their Italian passports.{{refn|The ship's manifest listed all of the Trapps as citizens of Italy except the eldest son. Their original German names were typed in, but Italian names were written in by hand to match their passports. For example, Georg became Giorgio.<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n}}<ref name=\"archives\"/>\n\nThe character Max Detweiler, the scheming family music director, is fictional. The von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend [[Franz Wasner]], was their musical director for over twenty years and accompanied them when they left Austria.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.<ref name=\"archives\"/> The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers.<ref name=\"archives\"/> Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of.<ref>Hirsch 1993, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nAlthough ''The Sound of Music'' is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release.
