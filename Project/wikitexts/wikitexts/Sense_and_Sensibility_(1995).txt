[[Emma Thompson]] wrote the screenplay and stars as [[Elinor Dashwood]], while [[Kate Winslet]] plays Elinor's younger sister [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]]. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, members of a wealthy English family of [[landed gentry]], as they must deal with circumstances of sudden destitution. They are forced to seek financial security through marriage. [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Alan Rickman]] play their respective suitors.\n\nProducer [[Lindsay Doran]], a longtime admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay. She spent five years drafting numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were nervous that Thompson\u2014a first-time screenwriter\u2014was the credited writer, but [[Columbia Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film. Though initially intending to have another actress portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to take the role. Thompson's screenplay exaggerated the Dashwood family's wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Lee was selected as director, both for his work in the 1993 film ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'' and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.\n\n''Sense and Sensibility'' was released on 13 December 1995, in the United States. A commercial success, earning $135 million worldwide, the film garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release and [[List of accolades received by Sense and Sensibility (film)|received many accolades]], including three awards and eleven nominations at the 1995 [[British Academy Film Awards]]. It earned seven [[Academy Awards]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. Thompson received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], becoming the only person to have won Academy Awards for both acting and screenwriting. ''Sense and Sensibility'' contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen's works, and has led to many more productions in similar genres. It continues to be recognised as one of the best Austen adaptations of all time.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=42}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nWhen Mr. Dashwood dies, his wife and three daughters \u2014 [[Elinor Dashwood|Elinor]], [[Marianne Dashwood|Marianne]] and Margaret \u2014 are left with an inheritance of only \u00a3500 a year; the bulk of his estate, Norland Park, is left to his son John from a previous marriage. John and his greedy, snobbish wife Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house; Fanny invites her brother [[Edward Ferrars]] to stay with them. She frets about the budding friendship between Edward and Elinor, believing he can do better, and does everything she can to prevent it from developing into a romantic attachment.\n\nSir John Middleton, a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in [[Devon]]shire. She and her daughters move in, and are frequent guests at Barton Park. Marianne meets the older Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with her at first sight. Competing for her affections is the dashing [[John Willoughby]], with whom Marianne falls in love. On the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London. Unbeknownst to the Dashwood family, Brandon's ward Beth, illegitimate daughter of his former love Eliza, is pregnant with Willoughby's child; Willoughby's aunt, Lady Allen, has disinherited him upon discovering this.\n\nSir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr and Mrs Palmer, to visit. They bring with them the impoverished Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, thus dashing Elinor's hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne is inconsolable. The engagement of Edward and Lucy also comes to light. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he honourably refuses, his fortune is taken from him and given to his younger brother Robert.\n\nOn their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby. Marianne cannot resist going to see Willoughby's estate and walks a long way in a torrential rain to do so. As a result, she becomes seriously ill and is nursed back to health by Elinor after being rescued by Colonel Brandon. Marianne recovers, and the sisters return home. They learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume that she married Edward. However, Edward arrives to explain that Miss Steele has unexpectedly wed Robert Ferrars and Edward is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to Elinor and becomes a [[vicar]], whilst Marianne marries Colonel Brandon.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[Elinor Dashwood]]\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Marianne Dashwood]]\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Colonel Brandon]]\n* [[Imogen Stubbs]] as Lucy Steele\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as [[Edward Ferrars]]\n* [[Greg Wise]] as [[John Willoughby]]\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Mrs. Dashwood\n* [[Harriet Walter]] as Fanny Dashwood\n* [[James Fleet]] as John Dashwood\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Mr. Palmer\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Charlotte Palmer\n* [[Robert Hardy]] as Sir John Middleton\n* [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] as Mrs. Jennings\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Mr. Dashwood\n* [[Myriam Fran\u00e7ois|Emilie Fran\u00e7ois]] as Margaret Dashwood\n* [[Richard Lumsden]] as Robert Ferrars\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\nIn 1989, [[Lindsay Doran]], the new president of production company [[Mirage Enterprises]], was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the [[Jane Austen]] novel ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' to her colleagues.<ref name=ctdoran /> It had been adapted twice, most recently in a [[Sense and Sensibility (1981 TV serial)|1981 television serial]].{{sfn|Parrill|2002|pp=21, 24}} Doran was a longtime fan of the novel,{{sfn|Dole|2001|p=63}} and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}}{{sfn|Doran|1995|p=11}} She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads.{{sfn|Dobie|2003|p=249}} Doran stated that \"all of [Austen's] books are funny and emotional, but ''Sense and Sensibility'' is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns.

The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would \"very much lie in the editing.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} Thompson wrote \"hundreds of different versions\" of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as \"there was nothing for him to do.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it \"only seemed to subtract from the mystery.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=272}} She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as \"keeping plates spinning\".{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=9:30\u20139:50}}\n\nA scene was shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, but this was excluded from the film. {{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:29:10\u201301:29:50}} Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio \"couldn't stand the idea of these two people who we've been watching all the way through not kissing.\"{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:30:00\u201301:30:35}} It was one of the first scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=01:30:00\u201301:30:35}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=141}}{{sfn|Stovel|2011}} Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick.

Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|pp=42\u20133, 46}}{{sfn|Dole|2001|pp=51\u20133}} To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an \"erotic\" invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair \u2013 a direct contrast to Elinor's \"reserved relationship\" with Edward.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}} Lee also distinguishes them through imagery \u2013 Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames.{{sfn|Kohler-Ryan|Palmer|2013|p=56}} Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys \"the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century.\"{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=11}} Thompson uses Margaret for [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret \u2013 and by extension, the audience \u2013 why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=11}} Margaret's altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the \"feminine\" side of Edward and Brandon, as they become [[father figure|father or brother figures]] to her.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=44}}{{sfn|Nixon|2001|pp=36\u201337}} The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, as well as that of Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|pp=44\u201345}}\n{{Quote box\n | quote=\"The changes that Emma Thompson's screenplay makes to the male characters, if anything, allow them to be less culpable, more likeable, and certainly less sexist or patriarchal.\"\n | source  = \u2014Austen scholar Devoney Looser{{sfn|Looser|1996}}\n | width   = 27em\n | align   = right\n | bgcolor = #FFFFF0\n}}\nWhen adapting the characters for film, Thompson found that in the novel, \"Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods,\" and that \"making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=269}} Several major male characters in ''Sense and Sensibility'' were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences.{{sfn|Parrill|2002|p=7}} Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are \"ideal\" modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as \"pleasing manners\", especially when contrasted with Palmer.{{sfn|Looser|1996}} Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=43}} To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}}{{sfn|Nixon|2001|pp=35\u201336}}\n\n=== Class ===\nThompson viewed the novel as a story of \"love and money,\" noting that some people needed one more than the other.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=255}} During the writing process, executive producer [[Sydney Pollack]] stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job.{{sfn|Stempel|2000|p=249}} \"I'm from [[Indiana]]; if I get it, everyone gets it,\" he said.{{sfn|Thompson|1995|p=265}} Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, \"You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?\"<ref name=dailybeastlunch /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029680.html |title=Hollywood reeling over Jane Austen's novels |first=Jack |last=Kroll |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=13 December 1995 |access-date=27 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054108/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25029680.html |archive-date=21 September 2013  }}</ref> She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-10/entertainment/ca-12297_1_emma-thompson |title=Emma Thompson, sensibly: The levelheaded actress turns screenwriter with her adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility.' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=10 December 1995 |first=Jon |last=Stuart |access-date=26 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053740/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-10/entertainment/ca-12297_1_emma-thompson |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}</ref> and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage.{{sfn|Thompson|Doran|1995|loc=5:40\u20136:25}} Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists.{{sfn|Kohler-Ryan|Palmer|2013|p=41}} Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost.{{sfn|Scholz|2013|p=133}}{{sfn|McRae|2013|p=35}} \"Family dramas,\" he stated, \"are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will.\"{{sfn|McRae|2013|p=36}}\n\nThe film's theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes an important element in Austen's stories and is \"impossible\" to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an \"ambiguous treatment of class values\" that stresses social differences but \"underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel\";{{sfn|Dole|2001|pp=59\u201363}} for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the [[vicarage]].{{sfn|Dole|2001|p=63}} Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility is represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage.{{sfn|Flavin|2004|p=49}} James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised \"m\u00e9lange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes,\" in which little connection is made between \"individual subjects and the land that supports them.\"{{sfn|Thompson|2003|pp=24\u20135}} Andrew Higson argued that while ''Sense and Sensibility'' includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a \"sense of impoverishment [but is] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted.\"{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=150}} The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a \"visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage.\"{{sfn|McCreadie|2006|p=75}}\n\n=== Gender ===\nGender has been seen as another major theme of the film, often intersecting with class. Penny Gay observed that Elinor's early dialogue with Edward about \"feel[ing] idle and useless ... [with] no hope whatsoever of any occupation\" reflected Thompson's background as a \"middle class, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]-educated feminist.\"{{sfn|Gay|2003|pp=92\u20133}} Conversely, Dole wrote that Thompson's version of Elinor \"has a surprising anti-feminist element to it,\" as she appears more dependent on men than the original character; the film presents her as repressed, resulting in her emotional breakdown with Edward.{{sfn|Dole|2001|pp=55\u20136}} Linda Troost opined that Lee's production prominently features \"radical feminist and economic issues\" while \"paradoxically endorsing the conservative concept of marriage as a woman's goal in life.\"{{sfn|Troost|2007|pp=82\u201383}} Despite this \"mixed political agenda,\" Troost believed that the film's faithfulness to the traditional [[heritage film]] genre is evident through its use of locations, costumes, and attention to details, all of which also emphasize class and status.{{sfn|Troost|2007|p=83}} Gay and Julianne Pidduck stated that gender differences are expressed by showing the female characters indoors, while their male counterparts are depicted outside confidently moving throughout the countryside.{{sfn|Gay|2003|p=93}}{{sfn|Pidduck|2000|p=123}} Nora Stovel observed that Thompson \"emphasises Austen's feminist satire on Regency gender economics,\" drawing attention not only to the financial plight of the Dashwoods but also to eighteenth-century women in general.{{sfn|Stovel|2011}}\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nIn the United States, [[Sony]] and Columbia Pictures released ''Sense and Sensibility'' on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films, first premiering it on 13 December 1995.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}} Believing that a limited release would position the film both as an \"exclusive quality picture\" and increase its chances of winning [[Academy Awards]], Columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the US; it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned $721,341.{{sfn|Mills|2009|p=72}}{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}}<ref name=\"boxofficemojooverview\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=senseandsensibility.htm |title=Sense and Sensibility (1995) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725111841/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=senseandsensibility.htm |archive-date=25 July 2012 }}</ref> To benefit from the publicity surrounding potential Academy Award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations, the film was released within \"[[Oscar season]]\".{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=155}} The number of theatres showing ''Sense and Sensibility'' was slowly expanded, with particular surges when its seven Oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the [[68th Academy Awards|ceremony in late March]], until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the US.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}} By the end of its American release, ''Sense and Sensibility'' had been watched by more than eight million people,{{sfn|Higson|2004|p=65}} garnering an \"impressive\" total domestic gross of $43,182,776.{{sfn|Higson|2011|p=157}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1996&wknd=04&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 26-28, 1996 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054518/http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1996&wknd=04&p=.htm |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn the basis of Austen's reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film.
