The film, featuring a large [[ensemble cast]] including [[cameo appearance]]s from film and TV stars and even non-actors, was written by Michael Barrie and Jim Mulholland, and takes the form of a compilation of 21 [[sketch comedy|comedy skits]] directed by five different directors: [[Joe Dante]], [[Carl Gottlieb]], [[Peter Horton]], [[John Landis]], and [[Robert K. Weiss]].\n\nThe title ''Amazon Women on the Moon'' refers to the central [[film-within-a-film]], a [[Parody|spoof]] of [[science-fiction]] films from the 1950s that borrows heavily from ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' (1958) starring [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], itself a film that recycles elements of earlier science-fiction works such as ''[[Cat-Women of the Moon]]'' (1953), ''[[Fire Maidens from Outer Space]]'' (1955), and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/a-d/amazonwomenmoon87.htm |title=Amazon Women on the Moon |work=DVD Drive-In |access-date=April 4, 2018|last=Scott|first=Casey}}</ref>\n\nJohn Landis had previously directed ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' (1977), which employed a similar sketch anthology format.\n\n==Plot==\nFictional television station WIDB-TV (channel 8) experiences problems with its late-night airing of science-fiction classic ''Amazon Women on the Moon'', a 1950s [[B movie]] in which Queen Lara (Sybil Danning) and Captain Nelson (Steve Forrest) battle exploding volcanoes and man-eating spiders on the Moon. Waiting for the film to resume, an unseen viewer begins [[channel surfing]]\u2014simulated by bursts of [[white noise]]\u2014through late night cable, with the various segments and sketches of the film representing the programming found on different channels. The viewer intermittently returns to channel 8, where ''Amazon Women'' continues airing before faltering once more.\n\nThese segments feature:\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as a man who nearly kills himself in a series of mishaps around his apartment;\n* [[Monique Gabrielle]] as a model who goes about her daily routine in Laguna, California, completely naked;\n* [[Lou Jacobi]] as a man named Murray, zapped into the television, wandering throughout sketches looking for his wife;\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Peter Horton]] as a young couple having trouble with eccentric doctor [[Griffin Dunne]] delivering and then concealing their newborn baby;\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as the presenter of a commercial recommending stapling carpet to a bald head as a hair loss prevention measure;\n* [[David Alan Grier]] and [[B.B. King]] in a public-service appeal for \"blacks without soul\" featuring \"Don 'No Soul' Simmons\";\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as a young woman on a blind date, employing unusual methods of investigation to reveal the qualifications of [[Steve Guttenberg]];\n* [[Henry Silva]] as the host of a show entitled ''Bullshit or Not?'', clearly intended as a spoof of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not! (TV series)|Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' with [[Jack Palance]] and ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'';\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]] as a man who dies after being mauled (by [[Roger Barkley]] and [[Al Lohman]], mimicking [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]]), then is [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]ed at his funeral by a variety of people, including [[Steve Allen]], [[Henny Youngman]], and even his own wife;\n* [[William Marshall (actor)|William Marshall]] as the leader of the ''Video Pirates'', who hijack an [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment|MCA Home Video]] ship, uncover a vast amount of videotapes and laserdiscs, and promptly begin illegally bootlegging the media;\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]], as the son of the Invisible Man, having trouble with his formula;\n* [[Angel Tompkins]] as a president's [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] who is also a former [[Prostitution|hooker]];\n* [[Matt Adler]] as a sexually frustrated teenager trying to purchase a pack of [[condom]]s, with unexpected results;\n* [[Marc McClure]] renting a personalized date video that spills over into real life;\n* \"Reckless Youth\"&nbsp;\u2013 an epilogue at the end of the credits, with [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Paul Bartel]] in a black-and-white ephemeral film warning about the spread of \"[[Sexually transmitted infection|social diseases]]\" in the style of ''[[Reefer Madness]]''.\n\n===Alternative versions===\nAn alternate version of the \"Pethouse Video\" sketch was filmed for the television broadcast of the film, with Monique Gabrielle in lingerie instead of appearing naked throughout the segment. However, most European television broadcasts of the film retained the original theatrical version. ''Bullshit or Not?'' was retitled ''Baloney or Not?'' for the television version.\n\nThe American television edit, in addition to the alternative \"Pethouse Video\" sketch, features an additional bridging sequence between the death of Harvey Pitnik and his subsequent celebrity roast. In it, the mortician successfully cons Pitnik's widow into having the celebrity roast as part of the funeral, and her performance gets such strong positive feedback, it becomes a continuing performance series lasting for weeks.\n\nThe DVD release features an unreleased sketch titled \"The Unknown Soldier\", starring [[Robert Loggia]] with [[Ronny Cox]], [[Bernie Casey]], and [[Wallace Langham]]. Some television broadcasts of the film featured the sketches \"Peter Pan Theater\" and \"The French Ventriloquist's Dummy\", which were not present in the theatrical version.\n\n==Cast==\n\"Mondo Condo\" (directed by [[John Landis]]):\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as Apartment Victim\n\"Pethouse Video\" (directed by [[Carl Gottlieb]]):\n* Donald F.
