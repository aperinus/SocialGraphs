A parody of the [[erotic thriller]] genre, which at the time had reached its commercial peak, as well as being a pastiche of 1940s [[film noir]] and [[psychological thriller]] genres, the film stars [[Armand Assante]] as lawyer/cop Ned Ravine (a take-off on ''[[Body Heat]]'', in which [[William Hurt]] plays the similarly named Ned Racine) who has an affair with a woman named Lola Cain ([[Sean Young]]). [[Kate Nelligan]] stars as Ned's wife and [[Sherilyn Fenn]] stars as his secretary. The film title is a combination of ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', both of which starred [[Michael Douglas]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\nNed Ravine, who is both a police officer and lawyer (who often defends the people he arrests), believes that he knows everything about women, and says that he will throw away his badge if anyone ever proves him wrong. While on a [[stakeout]], he encounters a seductive woman named Lola Cain; the next day, Lola shows up at his law office, saying that she needs him to look over some papers she has come across. Meanwhile, Max Shady, who was just released from prison after seven years, starts stalking Ned, planning to kill him for failing to successfully defend Max in court.\n\nNed's wife Lana and her car mechanic Frank, with whom she is having an affair, start plotting to kill Ned in order to collect on his accident insurance, which has a [[Double indemnity (insurance)|triple indemnity]] rider; if Ned is shot, falls from a northbound train, and drowns in a freshwater stream, Lana will collect nine million dollars.\n\nLola gets Ned to come to her house to examine the \"papers\", which are actually a laundry receipt and an expired lottery ticket, and the two of them end up having sex in various wild ways. The next morning, Ned says that they can never do that again because he loves his wife; this drives Lola to start stalking Ned.\n\nA few days later, Ned takes the train to go to a legal [[symposium]]; Lana and Frank are also on the train, and so is Max. When the train passes over a lake, Lana shoots Max 36 times with a [[revolver]], mistaking him for Ned, and he backflips through the door to his death; Ned thinks that Lana had acted to save his life. He arrests Lana, and then defends her in court, getting her cleared of all charges. Lana later kills Frank, believing that he was going to abandon her, by pinning him against a wall with his power drill; Lola witnesses this, and starts [[blackmail]]ing Lana.\n\nNed confronts Lola, and learns that she and Lana are [[Twin|identical twin]] sisters; after Lana had smashed Lola's face with a shovel, the doctors had given her a whole new face, causing the man she loved to leave her for Lana; Frank was the man's son. Lola's plan from the beginning was to get revenge on Lana by seducing her husband and ruining her marriage.\n\nLater, Ned's secretary Laura tells Ned about Lana's plans to kill him, having figured it out herself. Upstairs, Lana is attacked by Lola, who drowns her in the bathtub. While Ned goes upstairs to investigate, Laura's abusive husband (whom she had escaped from three years ago) comes in and confronts her; she kills him with a frying pan. Lola and Ned fight, and Lola falls to her death from the second-floor landing after Ned pushes her back with a powered-up hair dryer through a broken handrail (which Lana had sawed off earlier). As Ned and Laura embrace each other (and Ned throws his badge away), Lola and Lana come back to life and attack; Laura shoots them both. Ned and Laura marry a few days later.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Ned Ravine\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Laura Lingonberry\n* [[Kate Nelligan]] as Lana Ravine\n* [[Sean Young]] as Lola Cain\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Frank Kelbo\n* [[James Remar]] as Max Shady\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Cliff Burden\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Arch\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as Himself\n* [[Clarence Clemons]] as Himself\n* [[Eartha Kitt]] as Trial Judge\n* [[Tony Randall]] as Judge Skanky\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Man In Park (uncredited)\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Woman In Pet Store (uncredited)\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics; it maintains an 18% approval rating based on 22 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 4.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1046049_fatal_instinct |title=Fatal Instinct |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2022-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] rated it one and a half stars out of four and stated \"It's a strange thing about the parody genre: Some of these movies work ... and some don't. And you can't say why, except that sometimes you laugh, and sometimes you don't, and the reasons for that are not arguable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fatal-instinct-1993 |title=Fatal Instinct |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt the film's gags \"vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit. All that hold this comedy together are a playful outlook and a conviction that detective stories are intrinsically funny, especially if the detective is as much of a blockhead as Ned Ravine. As played by Armand Assante, Ned is a bit too convincingly dense, but he does make a useful [[fall guy]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE2DB1739F93AA15753C1A965958260 |title=Mix at Will: Basic, Fatal, Instinct and Attraction |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref>\n\n== Home media ==\nThis movie was released in the spring of 1994 on [[VHS]] and it is available on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], but only for North America and Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1993]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0106873}}\n* {{Amg movie|133375}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1046049-fatal_instinct|Fatal Instinct}}\n* {{Mojo title|fatalinstinct|Fatal Instinct}}\n\n{{Carl Reiner}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Surreal comedy]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy mystery films]]\n[[Category:American comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:1990s parody films]]\n[[Category:1990s legal films]]\n[[Category:Legal comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American legal films]]\n[[Category:American courtroom films]]\n[[Category:Films about domestic violence]]\n[[Category:Films about adultery in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about lawyers]]\n[[Category:Films about stalking]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Carl Reiner]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Richard Gibbs]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Yiddish-language films]]\n[[Category:1993 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
