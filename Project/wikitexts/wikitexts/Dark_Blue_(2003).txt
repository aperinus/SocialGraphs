The film stars [[Kurt Russell]] with [[Ving Rhames]] and [[Brendan Gleeson]] in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nLos Angeles, 1992. The film opens ''[[in medias res]]'' to [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Eldon Perry, who is pacing in a motel room with a [[shotgun]] and [[pistol]].\n\nFive days earlier, four people are killed and one wounded when two men, Darryl Orchard and Gary Sidwell, rob a convenience store in order to gain access to a safe in the office. Meanwhile, Perry defends his partner, Detective Bobby Keough, before an internal hearing concerning Keough's use of [[deadly force]] in a previous case; Keough is later exonerated. Perry and Keough later celebrate the former's impending promotion with their superior, Jack Van Meter, who is also Keough's uncle. Van Meter, a [[police corruption|corrupt cop]] who often encourages his subordinates to fabricate evidence, visits Orchard and Sidwell's house later that night and takes the money stolen from the safe, admonishing them for behaving recklessly during the robbery.\n\nVan Meter assigns Perry and Keough to investigate the robbery, providing a false [[alibi]] for Orchard and Sidwell and telling them to pin the crime on someone else. Meanwhile, Assistant Chief Arthur Holland finds Perry's testimony at Keough's hearing suspicious, doubting that Keough killed the suspect as he was charged. His assistant, Beth Williamson, pulls files on the two men and sees that a man she has had anonymous [[casual sex]] with is Keough.\n\nAfter obtaining a search warrant with underhanded techniques, a [[SWAT]] team raids the house of the ex-cons who are to be Perry's fall guys. One of the men escapes and goes into a back alley, but is caught by Perry and Keough. Under Perry's orders, Keough reluctantly kills the innocent man and is left visibly shaken. When Perry arrives home later, he learns that his wife is leaving him. Meanwhile, Keough visits Williamson and admits to the killing, offering to testify against Perry on corruption. Seeing both Perry and the robbers as loose ends, Van Meter sets them up to kill each other just as the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]] begin.\n\nBelieving that Perry was sent by Van Meter to kill Orchard and Sidwell, Keough and Williamson also drive to the robbers' address. While all three eventually meet up in the alleys, Keough is killed by Orchard and Sidwell. Williamson tearfully blames Perry for what happened. Perry calls in the incident, hesitating briefly before pursuing Orchard and Sidwell. As the riots unfold, Sidwell is dragged out of his car and beaten to death while Orchard is captured by Perry. Perry then heads to his promotion ceremony, where he confesses about the corruption, implicates Van Meter, and volunteers himself to be arrested.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Sergeant Eldon Perry\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Detective Bobby Keough\n* [[Michael Michele]] as Sergeant Beth Williamson\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Commander Jack Van Meter\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Assistant Chief Arthur Holland\n* [[Master P]] as 'Maniac'\n* [[Kurupt]] as Darryl Orchard\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Gary Sidwell\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Deputy Chief Jimmy Barcomb\n* [[Eloy Casados]] as SWAT Commander Rico\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Detective Peltz\n* [[William Utay]] as Detective Sapin\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Sally Perry\n* [[Chapman Way]] as Eldon Perry III\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Assistant District Attorney Deena Schultz\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] as Janelle Holland\n* [[Dana Lee]] as Huan Henry Kim\n* [[Eddie Mui]] as Lucky 7 Bartender\n* [[Faleolo Alailima]] as Lucky 7 Bouncer\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Dark Blue'' has an approval score of 59% based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The consensus reads, \"Kurt Russell gives a good performance. Too bad there's nothing here that you haven't seen before.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark_blue|title=Dark Blue (2002)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=June 27, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 57 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dark-blue|title=Dark Blue Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=June 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Arnold of ''[[The Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' gave the film a positive review. \"Ron Shelton's ''Dark Blue'' is another harrowingly cynical dirty-cop movie in the recent tradition of ''[[Training Day]]'' and ''[[Narc (film)|Narc]]''. Yet it's so much more complex, engrossing and satisfying than those films that the comparison is not entirely fair....\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=William |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Down-and-dirty-Dark-Blue-weaves-a-thoroughly-1107951.php |title=Down-and-dirty 'Dark Blue' weaves a thoroughly engrossing tale |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2003-02-20 |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the film received a negative review from the ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'', \"''Dark Blue'' is stuffed to the gills with blithely improbable coincidence and subsidiary story line... Shelton is a likable, generous director who's made two pretty good films (''[[Blaze (1989 film)|Blaze]]'' and ''[[Bull Durham]]''), but it's not at all clear he has the chops to take on an action movie, let alone the intricacies of police politics \u2014 let alone the politics of race, about which he had more imaginative things to say in ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Ella |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2003-02-27/film-tv/our-dark-blue-places/ |title=Our Dark Blue Places - Page 1 - Film+TV - Los Angeles |publisher=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2003-02-20 |access-date=2012-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0279331|title=Dark Blue}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|dark_blue|Dark Blue}}\n* {{Mojo title|darkblue|Dark Blue}}\n\n{{Ron Shelton}}\n{{David Ayer}}\n{{James Ellroy}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Shelton]]\n[[Category:Films produced by James Jacks]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1992]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Ayer]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Ellroy]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Terence Blanchard]]\n[[Category:2000s police procedural films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
