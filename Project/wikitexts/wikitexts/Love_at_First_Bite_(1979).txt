Comedy ensues when the incurably romantic Count finds it difficult to adjust to life in the Big Apple in the late 1970s, but true love triumphs in the end. The original music score was composed by [[Charles Bernstein (composer)|Charles Bernstein]]. The film's tagline is: \"Your favorite pain in the neck is about to bite your funny bone!\"  An earlier version of the script by director [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]] was titled ''Dracula Sucks Again''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Love At First Bite |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56129-LOVE-ATFIRSTBITE?sid=25ca9f4e-deb9-4143-b9a7-7c0ff1ee3f1c&sr=14.244333&cp=1&pos=0 |website=catalog.afi.com |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=19 June 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe infamous [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]] is expelled from his castle by the Communist government of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], which plans to convert it into a training facility for gymnasts (including [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]]). The world-weary Count travels to [[New York City]] with his bug-eating [[manservant]], [[Renfield]], and establishes himself in a hotel ... only after an airport transport mix-up accidentally sends his coffin to be the centerpiece at a funeral in a black church in [[Harlem]]. While Dracula learns that late 1970s America contains such wonders as [[blood bank]]s, [[sex club]]s, and [[discotheque]]s, the Count also proceeds to suffer the general ego-crushing that comes from life in the Big Apple, after he romantically pursues flaky fashion model Cindy Sondheim. He has admired her from afar, believing her to be the current reincarnation of his true love [[Mina Harker]].\n\nDracula is ineptly pursued in turn by Cindy Sondheim's [[psychiatrist]] and quasi-boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg. Jeffrey is the grandson of Dracula's old nemesis Fritz {{sic}} [[Abraham Van Helsing|van Helsing]], who changed his name to Rosenberg \"for professional reasons\". Rosenberg's numerous methods to combat Dracula (mirrors, garlic, a [[Star of David]], which he uses instead of a cross, and [[hypnosis]]) are easily averted by the Count. Rosenberg also tries burning Dracula's coffin with the vampire still inside, but he is arrested by hotel security. Subsequently he tries to shoot Dracula with three [[werewolf|silver bullets]], but the Count remains unscathed, patiently explaining that this works only on [[werewolves]]. Rosenberg's increasingly erratic actions eventually cause him to be locked away as a lunatic. As mysterious cases of blood-bank robberies and vampiric attacks begin to spread, NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson starts to believe the psychiatrist's claims and gets Rosenberg released.\n\nAs a major [[Power outage|blackout]] hits the city, Dracula flees with Cindy via taxi cab back to the airport, pursued by Rosenberg and Ferguson. His coffin is accidentally sent to [[Jamaica]] instead of London and the couple miss their flight. On the runway, Cindy finally agrees to become Dracula's vampire bride. Rosenberg attempts to stake Dracula, but as he moves in for the kill, they fly away. A check falls from the sky, by which Cindy pays off her (enormous) psychiatry bill owed to Rosenberg. He remarks, \"She has become a responsible person ... or whatever\". Rosenberg keeps Dracula's cape (the only thing his stake struck) which Ferguson borrows, hoping, since the cape makes the wearer, it will help him be stylish on his wedding anniversary. Dracula and Cindy, now transformed into bats, fly toward Jamaica. Dracula warns Cindy that they can only live by night. \u201cThat's all right with me,\u201d she replies, \u201c\u2026I could never really get my (act) together before 7 anyway.\u201d \n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Count Vladimir Dracula\n* [[Susan Saint James]] as Cindy Sondheim\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Dr. Jeffrey Rosenberg/Van Helsing\n* [[Dick Shawn]] as Lieutenant Ferguson NYPD\n* [[Arte Johnson]] as Renfield\n* [[Ronnie Schell]] as Guy in Elevator\n* [[Isabel Sanford]] as Judge R.

In 2009, he stated:<ref>[http://www.moviehole.net/200920490-second-bite-for-hamilton Moviehole.net]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It's terrific. It's all about old world school of Dracula in the Bela Lugosi 1940s up against the Twilight felons with humor, It's hard to do but it's great fun. I think 'Twilight' is a wonderful series of books. It's so important for these young girls with hormonal changes and this love that's worth giving your life for. But now I have to find a way to bring my 'Love At First Bite' character into that kind of story and make it funny and not be at all like 'Twilight' and I think I found a way to do that.</blockquote>\n\nHe later elaborated about the plot:\n\n<blockquote>His [my character's] son is a sort of perennial student in California and he doesn't want to acknowledge his father, Dracula, at all and he's getting married into a family of televangelists. {Laughs} He met this girl that he's in love with who's a zoologist in a cave somewhere; he was a bat in this cave in South America.  So now, Dracula's forced himself to come to Hollywood for this big wedding and bring all of his relatives who are pretty ridiculous people.  There's a wonderful scene at the bachelor party in a strip club, it's great stuff.<ref>[http://www.thedivareview.com/My_One_and_Only_Interview.htm Interview with George Hamilton] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo date, a sequel has not gone into production.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vampire film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0079489}}\n* {{tcmdb title|22749|Love at First Bite}}\n* {{Allmovie title|30333}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=love_at_first_bite}}\n* [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=30333 ''New York Times'' listing]\n\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Stan Dragoti}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stan Dragoti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parodies of horror]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:1979 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
