He saves the life of Dolores Benedict, a [[Gold digger|gold-digging]] [[femme fatale]] who is accidentally run over by Michael when fleeing the scene of her latest husband's fatal coronary, caused by her malicious mind-games and scheming. As she recovers, Michael falls in love and they marry. Dolores torments Michael by pretending to be too ill to consummate the marriage, citing a continuing headache. On a [[honeymoon]] and business trip to a medical conference in [[Vienna]], a city living in fear of the serial \"Elevator Killer\", Hfuhruhurr meets [[mad scientist]] Dr. Alfred Necessiter, who has created a technique enabling him to store living [[brain]]s in liquid-filled jars using the Elevator Killer's victims.\n\nMichael discovers he can communicate telepathically with one of Necessiter's brains, that of Anne Uumellmahaye. Michael and Anne fall in love, with Michael taking her brain away to spend more time with her. Dolores \u2014 having learned that Michael has received a large inheritance from his step-grandmother \u2014 attempts to reignite their relationship, but catches on to his relationship with Anne when she spots him in a rowboat with the jar. She attempts to kill Anne by putting her brain in an oven, causing Michael to literally toss Dolores out of his house.\n\nMichael consults with Necessiter, who informs him that brains in tanks do not survive long, with Anne being his longest-living one to date. Necessiter recommends transplanting Anne's brain into a body of a recently-deceased woman, revealing that he has perfected a process that could allow him to do so. Filling a syringe with [[Hard-surface cleaner|window cleaner]], the substance used by the Elevator Killer, Michael sees a crowd gathering around an attractive woman hit by a car, and is seen as odd for hoping she will expire, only to see her regain consciousness. Michael next selects Fran - a prostitute with an annoying voice - but his conscience prevents him from killing her. Stepping into an elevator, he finds that Dolores has just been murdered by the Elevator Killer, who turns out to be [[Merv Griffin]]. Michael takes Dolores' corpse, and Griffin promises to turn himself in to the police.\n\nMichael hurriedly takes Dolores's body to Necessiter's lab. He is stopped by the Austrian police, who suspect him of [[drunk driving]]. After a series of unusual [[Field sobriety test|sobriety test]]s, the police permit him to leave. However, as Dolores' body flails, the police realize that she was not drunk, but dead, and pursue his car. Michael makes it to the lab, where Necessiter transfers Anne's consciousness to Dolores's body, which is viewed by the stunned policemen. In the process, Michael is electrically shocked by the equipment and falls into a coma.\n\nWaking up six weeks later, Michael meets Anne in Dolores's body. Anne is a compulsive eater, and has gained considerable weight in her new body. Michael loves Anne for who she is, and they get married. A note in the credits requests that the audience report the whereabouts of Merv Griffin if they see him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Dolores Benedict\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Dr. Alfred Necessiter\n* [[Paul Benedict]] as Dr. Necessiter's butler\n* [[George Furth]] as Timon\n* [[Peter Hobbs (actor)|Peter Hobbs]] as Dr. Brandon\n* [[Earl Boen]] as Dr. Felix Conrad\n* Randi Brooks as Fran\n* [[James Cromwell]] as realtor\n* [[Francis X.
