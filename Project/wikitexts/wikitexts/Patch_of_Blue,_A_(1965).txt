Made in 1965 against the backdrop of the growing [[civil rights movement]], the film explores racism while playing on the idea that \"love is blind.\"\n\n[[Shelley Winters]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], her second win for the award, following her victory in 1959 for ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''. It was the final screen appearance for veteran actor [[Wallace Ford]].\n\nScenes of Poitier and Hartman kissing were excised from the film when it was shown in film theaters in the Southern United States.<ref name=\"kiss\">{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title='A Patch of Blue' Draws in South |pages=42 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 April 1966}}</ref> These scenes are intact in the DVD version. According to the DVD audio commentary, it was the decision of director Guy Green that ''A&nbsp;Patch of Blue'' be filmed in black and white although color was available.\n\nThe film was adapted by Guy Green from the 1961 book ''Be Ready with Bells and Drums'' by the Australian author [[Elizabeth Kata]]. The book later won a [[Writers Guild of America]] award. The book's plot has a slightly less optimistic ending than the film.\n\nIn addition to the Best Supporting Actress win for Winters, the film was nominated for Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Elizabeth Hartman), [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Black-and-White)]] ([[George Davis (art director)|George Davis]], [[Urie McCleary]], [[Henry Grace]], [[Charles S.

She strings beads to supplement her family's small income and spends most of her time doing chores. Her mother is abusive, and Ole Pa is an alcoholic. Selina has no friends, rarely leaves the apartment, and has never received an education.\n\nSelina convinces her grandfather to take her to the park, where she happens to meet Gordon Ralfe, an educated and soft-spoken black man working night shifts in an office. The two quickly become friends, meeting at the park almost every day. Gordon learns that she was blinded at the age of five when Rose-Ann threw chemicals on her while attempting to hit her husband and that she was raped by one of Rose-Ann's \"boyfriends.\"\n\nRose-Ann's friend Sadie is also a prostitute, and while lamenting the loss of her youth, she realizes that Selina can be useful in their business. Subsequently, Rose-Ann and Sadie decide to leave Ole Pa, move with Selina into a better apartment, and force her into prostitution.\n\nIn the meantime, Gordon has contacted a school for the blind, which is ready to take Selina. While Rose-Ann is out, Selina runs away to the park, and, with some difficulty, meets Gordon. She tells Gordon about Rose-Ann's plan, and he assures her that she will be leaving for school in a few days. Finding Selina missing from the apartment, Rose-Ann takes Ole Pa to the park and confronts Gordon. Despite Rose-Ann's resistance, Gordon manages to take Selina away when the crowd of white people looks at Rose-Ann's anger and hysterics towards Gordon with disdain and ignores her pleas to stop the Black man from walking away with her daughter. Ole Pa then stops Rose-Ann from chasing after them, telling her that Selina is not a child anymore.\n\nAt Gordon's house, Selina asks Gordon to marry her, to which Gordon replies that there are many types of love, and she later will realize that their relationship will not work. Selina tells him that she loves him, knows that he is Black, and his skin color doesn't matter to her. Gordon tells her she must meet more people and wait a year to find out if their love is more than friendship. Then, a bus arrives to pick up Selina for her trip to the school and both friends say goodbye. Gordon had given Selina a music box that belonged to his grandmother that she left behind in the apartment, so he runs after her to give it back but just misses the bus and walks back upstairs in to his apartment building.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Gordon Ralfe\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Rose-Ann D'Arcey\n* [[Elizabeth Hartman]] as Selina D'Arcey\n* [[Wallace Ford]] as Ole Pa\n* [[Ivan Dixon]] as Mark Ralfe\n* [[Elisabeth Fraser]] as Sadie\n* [[John Qualen]] as Mr. Faber\n* Kelly Flynn as Yanek Faber\n* Debi Storm as Selina, age 5\n* [[Renata Vanni]] as Mrs. Favaloro\n* Saverio LoMedico as Mr. Favaloro\n* Casey Merriman as Casey M\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack to ''A Patch of Blue'' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]].

The short, titled ''A Cinderella Named Elizabeth,'' focuses on her status as an unknown actress from Youngstown, Ohio, and includes segments from her screen test and associated \"[[personality test]]\", in which the actress is filmed while being herself and answering questions about everyday topics such as her taste in clothing. The short also shows her visiting the [[Braille Institute of America]] to watch blind people being trained to do handwork &mdash; similar to the beadwork her character does in the film &mdash; and to perform tasks of daily living and self-care, of the sort that Poitier's character teaches Selina to do.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''A Patch of Blue'' has a 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on nine reviews.\n\n===Awards and honors===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
