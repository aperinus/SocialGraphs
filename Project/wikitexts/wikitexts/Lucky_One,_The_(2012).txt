It is an adaptation of [[Nicholas Sparks]]\u2019 [[The Lucky One (novel)|2008 novel of the same name]].\n\nThe film stars [[Zac Efron]] as Logan Thibault, a US Marine who finds a photograph of a young woman while serving in Iraq, carries it around as a good luck charm, and later tracks down the woman, with whom he begins a relationship.\n\nThe movie received negative reviews but grossed over $99.4 million.\n\n==Plot==\nLogan Thibault ([[Zac Efron]]), a US [[Marine (military)|Marine]] serving in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], witnesses a Marine called \"Aces\" die attempting to aid one of his men during an ambush. The following morning, he finds a picture of a young woman on the ground just before a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attack destroys where he had been sitting, killing many around him. Unsuccessful at finding the photo's owner, he keeps it. Logan's squad-mate declares the woman in the picture as his \"guardian angel,\" just before an explosion destroys their [[Humvee]].\n\nLogan returns to [[Colorado]] to live with his sister's family, who have been looking after his dog, Zeus. Suffering from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[survivor guilt]], he decides it is best to leave and departs to search for the woman in the photo. Logan and Zeus walk to [[Louisiana]], where a lighthouse in the picture has provided a clue. He shows the photo around town and a local resident tells him that the woman used to be married to his friend, a local deputy sheriff.\n\nLogan finds the woman, Beth Green ([[Taylor Schilling]]), but has difficulty explaining why he is there. She assumes he wants a job, and her grandmother, Ellie ([[Blythe Danner]]) hires him. At first, Beth is irritated by Logan's presence, but she begins to warm to him as his calm demeanor, willingness to work, and competence in repairing machinery are demonstrated. Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son, Ben, who is without a positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother, Drake.\n\nBeth's former husband, [[Sheriff|Sheriff's Deputy]] Keith Clayton ([[Jay R. Ferguson]])\u2014the son of the town's judge\u2014is immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. He discourages Ben from playing the violin around him, leading to Ben practicing in his [[tree house]]. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and he threatens to use his connections to take full custody of Ben. She is anxious about Keith's short temper and is fearful of losing her son to him.\n\nOn the anniversary of Drake's death, Beth becomes distraught and Logan calms her down. Keith tries to stop the budding relationship between Beth and Logan, but Beth stands up to Keith, showing that she is not intimidated by him anymore. Keith learns that Logan was asking about her when he first arrived in town and steals the photo, telling Beth that Logan has been stalking her. Her trust destroyed, she is distraught and sends Logan away. Ellie tries to soften Beth, explaining to her that it isn't Logan's fault he survived and Drake did not.\n\nAn intoxicated Keith sees Logan walking with his dog and angrily confronts him, drawing his gun while people on the street begin to panic and run. Logan disarms him, turning the weapon over to another officer. He then heads home to pack, finding a photo of Beth's brother, Drake, inside a book Ben had given him. The tattoo on Drake's forearm says \"Aces\" and he realizes that Drake was the sergeant from the night raid. He returns to Beth's house to tell her what he knows of how Drake died.\n\nAt Judge Clayton's, Keith is shocked and embarrassed over what he did though his father tells him it will all blow over before the election. Keith walks out into a gathering storm, leaving his badge behind, and goes to Beth to plead for reconciliation. When she gently but firmly refuses, he threatens to take Ben away. Ben overhears and runs out into the storm, followed by Keith and Beth, just as Logan arrives. Ellie urges Logan to follow. Ben is en route to the treehouse, but the [[rope bridge]] gives way and he falls into the river along with his father, just as Beth and Logan arrive. Keith, caught in the rope of the bridge, calls to Logan who grabs Ben and hands him to Beth. Before Logan can return for Keith, the treehouse falls on him and he is swept away in the raging river to his death.\n\nBack home, Beth thanks Logan for saving her son. Logan explains that Drake died saving one of his own men. He starts to leave, but Beth runs after him and says that he belongs with them. Later, Logan, Beth, Zeus, and Ben celebrate Ben's 9th birthday together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Logan Thibault\n* [[Taylor Schilling]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" Green\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Ellie \n* [[Jay R.
