Cowboy and Indian forget Horse's birthday, and come up with the idea of building him a brick barbecue. Not wanting Horse to find out they forgot, they get him out of the house by convincing their neighbor Steven to ask Horse to pick his animals up from the nearby music school. There, Horse meets his love interest, Mrs. Jacqueline Longray, a fellow horse who is also a music teacher. When he attempts to play piano for her, she offers to give him lessons.\n\nBack at the house, Indian attempts to order the fifty bricks needed for the grill, but Cowboy accidentally orders fifty million. They get rid of the excess bricks by building them into a cube and putting them on top of the house, then build the grill. That night, the house collapses under the weight of the bricks. Irate, Horse makes Cowboy and Indian help rebuild the house. When they try to put up the walls, an unknown figure continues to steal them. When staking out the house to find the culprits, the trio discover the walls are being stolen by a family of aquatic creatures whose heads are shaped like cones. All but one of them escape with the wall. They chase the straggler, Gerard, off of a cliff, where they fall into the earth's core. Gerard escapes.\n\nClimbing out, they find themselves in the middle of a tundra. While wandering throughout, they are sucked into a giant penguin robot that is being used by incomprehensible, super-strong scientists to make and throw giant snowballs. They catch up with Gerard, but they are all subsequently captured and put to work by the scientists. While the scientists battle a rogue mammoth, the group escapes by setting a snowball to launch at the house and climbing into it. At the last second, Gerard sets it for his home under the sea.\n\nGerard swims off when the snowball lands and the three give chase, donning scuba masks (Cowboy simply puts a TV on his head) and swimming after him. They find an underwater version of their house, revealing Gerard and his family wanted the walls to build their own house. The creatures chase the trio off with a group of barracudas, but they come back and trick the creatures into a hole by Horse posing as Santa Claus. They use a sawfish to destroy their house and escape to the surface, but the creatures follow them and attack with swordfish. Steven, his wife, and his animals help fight back. In the process, Steven's house explodes with water and the countryside is flooded.\n\nOne year later, Gerard's family is an accepted part of the community, and Horse is now a skilled piano player and dating Longray, who throws a surprise birthday party for him in an underwater department store. Cowboy and Indian accidentally set off Horse's birthday present, a giant firework, causing a giant fireworks display that destroys the landscape as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[St\u00e9phane Aubier]] as (Cowboy, Max Briquenet, Mr Ernotte)\n*[[Jeanne Balibar]] as (Madame Jacqueline Longr\u00e9e; spelled \"Longray\" in some English subtitles)\n*Nicolas Buysse as (Sheep, Jean-Paul)\n*Fran\u00e7ois De Brigode as (Sportscaster)\n*V\u00e9ronique Dumont as (Janine)\n*Bruce Ellison as (Indian)\n*Christine Grulois as (Cow, Student)\n*Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jannin as (Policeman, G\u00e9rard, Brick Delivery Man)\n*[[Bouli Lanners]] as (Postman, Simon, Cow)\n*Christelle Mahy as (Chicken)\n*\u00c9ric Muller as (Rocky Gaufres, Music Student 1)\n*Fran\u00e7ois Neyken as (Pig)\n*[[Vincent Patar]] as (Horse, Mother Atlante)\n*Pipou as (Michel's laugh)\n*Franco Piscopo as (Bear)\n*[[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as (Steven)\n*David Ricci as (Donkey, Michel)\n*Ben Tesseur as (Scientist 1)\n*Alexandre von Sivers as (Scientist 2)\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made over the course of 260 days in a studio on the outskirts of [[Brussels]]. 1500 plastic toy figures were used during filming.<ref name=\"post-gazette.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10098/1048675-120.stm|title='A Town Called Panic' induces wild, whimsical fun|first=Barbara|last=Vancheri|accessdate=22 July 2011|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=John Robinson Block|date=8 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2009 and was released theatrically on 17 June 2009 in Belgium by [[Cin\u00e9art]] and on 28 October 2009 in France by [[G\u00e9b\u00e9ka Films]].
