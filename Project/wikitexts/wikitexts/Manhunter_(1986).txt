Based on the 1981 novel, ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', by [[Thomas Harris]], it stars [[William Petersen]] as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] profiler [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]]. Also featured are [[Tom Noonan]] as serial killer [[Francis Dolarhyde|Francis Dollarhyde]], [[Dennis Farina]] as Graham's FBI superior [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]], and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as incarcerated killer [[Hannibal Lecter|Hannibal Lecktor.]]<!-- Do not change Lecktor to Lecter. --> The film focuses on Graham coming out of retirement to lend his talents to an investigation on Dollarhyde, a killer known as the Tooth Fairy. In doing so, he must confront the demons of his past and meet with Lecktor, who nearly killed Graham.\n\n''Manhunter'' focuses on the forensic work carried out by the FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, and the nature of the characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' [[Hannibal Lecter (franchise)|''Hannibal Lecter'' novels]], as well as the first adaptation of ''Red Dragon'', which later became the basis for a [[Red Dragon (2002 film)|film of the same name]] in 2002.\n\nOpening to mixed reviews, ''Manhunter'' [[Box office bomb|fared poorly at the box office]] at the time of its release, making only $8.6 million in the United States. However, it has been reassessed in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more favorable reception, as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years. Its resurgent popularity, which may be due to later adaptations of Harris' books and Petersen's success in ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', has seen it labelled as a [[cult film]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- DO NOT CHANGE the spellings of \"Lecktor\" and \"Dollarhyde\". \"Lecter\" and \"Dolarhyde\" are how they are spelled in the novel, but \"Lecktor\" and \"Dollarhyde\" are how Michael Mann wrote them in the screenplay, and it is how they appear within the film. -->\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. As of August 5, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 696 words. -->\n[[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] is a former FBI [[criminal profiler]] who has retired following a mental breakdown after being attacked by a cannibalistic serial killer, [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecktor]], whom he captured. Graham is approached at his [[Florida]] home by his former FBI superior [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]], who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife that he will do nothing more than examine evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, dubbed the Tooth Fairy by the police for the bite marks left on his victims.\n\nHaving found the killer's fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford, and they are accosted by tabloid journalist [[Freddy Lounds]]. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer's motivations. After a tense conversation, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Later, Lecktor obtains Graham's home address by deceit while ostensibly making a phone call to his attorney.\n\nGraham travels to the first crime scene in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He is contacted by Crawford, who patches Graham through to [[Frederick Chilton]], Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. They realize it is from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor removed. They discover an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the ''National Tattler'', Lounds' newspaper.\n\nThe FBI intends to plant a fake advertisement to replace Lecktor's, but without the proper [[Book cipher|book code]] the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake. They let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, giving a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the ''National Tattler'' as a warning.\n\nThe FBI decodes Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy: it is Graham's home address with an instruction to kill Graham and his family. Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham's family to a [[safe house]], he explains to his son Kevin why he  retired previously.\n\nAt his job in a St. Louis film lab, [[Francis Dolarhyde|Francis Dollarhyde]]\u2014the Tooth Fairy\u2014approaches a blind co-worker, Reba McClane, and offers her a ride home. They go to Dollarhyde's home, where Reba is oblivious to the fact that Dollarhyde is watching home-movie footage of his planned next victims. She kisses him and they have sex. The following night, Graham realizes the Tooth Fairy's murders are driven by a desire for acceptance. Meanwhile, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker. He murders the man and abducts Reba.\n\nSearching for a connection between the murdered families, Graham realizes that the killer must have seen their home movies; he brought bolt cutters to a home with a padlock in a home video. Graham and Crawford identify the lab in St. Louis where the films were processed. After determining which employees have seen these films, he and Crawford travel with a police escort to Dollarhyde's home. Inside, Dollarhyde prepares to kill Reba with a piece of glass, while police assemble. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and shoots two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen, where he is shot and killed by Graham. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics and Graham returns home to his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[William Petersen]] as FBI Agent [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]].

Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that [[Iron Butterfly]]'s \"[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]\" was \"their song.\" This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.<ref name=\"Total Film 177\" />\n\nTom Noonan, who played killer Francis Dollarhyde, initially researched other serial killers to study for the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with the sense that he felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. \"I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could,\" Noonan explained, \"that he was doing this out of love.\"<ref name=\"Inside\" /> Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman.

The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with ''Manhunter'' crew jackets.<ref name=\"Total Film 177\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Dante Spinotti]] made strong use of color tints in the film, using a cool \"romantic blue\" tone to denote the scenes featuring Will Graham and his wife, and a more subversive green hue, with elements of purple or magenta, as a cue for the unsettling scenes in the film, mostly involving Dollarhyde.<ref name=\"Look\">{{cite video|people=David Gregory (director) |title=The Manhunter Look |medium=DVD |date=2000 |publisher=[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]]}}</ref> Petersen has stated that Mann wanted to create a visual aura to bring the audience into the film, so that the story would work on an interior and emotional level.<ref name=\"LAF\" /> Mann also made use of multiple [[frame rate]]s in filming the climactic shootout: different cameras recording the scene at 24, 36, 72 and 90 frames per second, giving the final scene what Spinotti has called an \"off-tempo\" and \"staccato\" feel.<ref name=\"Look\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|quote=I was really wound up.

With no special effects crew to provide the blood spatter for the gunshots, Petersen described how the remaining crew would blow ketchup across the set through hoses when such effects were needed.<ref name=\"Inside\" /> Joan Allen also related that Mann would simulate the impacts of bullets in Dollarhyde's kitchen by throwing glass jars across the surfaces so they would shatter where he needed them to; one of these broken jars left a shard of glass embedded in Petersen's thigh during filming.<ref name=\"Inside\" /> The pool of blood forming around Noonan's character at the end of this scene was intended to allude to the \"Red Dragon\" tattoos worn by the character in the novel.<ref name=\"Total Film 177\" /> This shot left Noonan lying in the corn syrup stage blood for so long that he became stuck to the floor.<ref name=\"Inside\" />\n\n[[Ted Levine]], who later went on to play [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', crashed ''Manhunter''{{'}}s wrap party to spend time with Petersen, whom he knew from their days in Chicago theater.

He has also drawn attention to the scene in which Graham visits Lecktor in his cell, pointing out the constant position of the cell bars within the frame, even as the shots cut back and forth between the two characters. \"There is nothing in ''Manhunter'' ... which is just a nice shot,\" says Spinotti. \"[It] is all focused into conveying that particular atmosphere; whether it's happiness, or delusion, or disillusion.\"<ref name=\"Look\" /> This \"manipulation of focus and editing\" has become a visual hallmark of the film.<ref name=\"Reverse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reverseshot.com/article/michael_mann |title=Michael Mann  |publisher=Reverse Shot |author=Knight, Ryland Walker |date=28 June 2008 |access-date=24 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nDespite having initially filmed the scenes involving Francis Dollarhyde with an elaborate tattoo across Noonan's chest, Mann and Spinotti felt that the finished result seemed out of place and that it \"trivialize[d] the struggle\" the character faced.<ref name=\"Total Film 177\" /><ref name=\"Look\" /> Mann cut the scenes in which the character appeared bare-chested, and quickly re-shot additional footage to replace what had been removed. Spinotti noted that in doing so, scenes which he felt had been captured with a \"beautiful\" aesthetic were lost, as the production did not have the time to recreate the original lighting conditions.<ref name=\"Look\" />\n\nPetersen had difficulty ridding himself of the Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character \"always coming out\" instead of his new role.
