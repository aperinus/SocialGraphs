The film, a loose remake of [[Ferdinand the Bull (film)|Ferdinand the Bull]], and loosely based on [[Munro Leaf]] and [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]]'s 1936 children's book ''[[The Story of Ferdinand]]'', was written by Robert L. Baird, [[Tim Federle]], and [[Brad Copeland]], and directed by [[Carlos Saldanha]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast|ensemble voice cast]] that includes [[John Cena]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Peyton Manning]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[David Tennant]], Tim Nordquist, Lily Day, [[Juanes]], [[Jerrod Carmichael]], [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre]], [[Ra\u00fal Esparza]], [[Gina Rodriguez]], [[Daveed Diggs]], [[Gabriel Iglesias]], [[Flula Borg]], [[Boris Kodjoe]], and [[Sally Phillips]]. The music for the film was composed by [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]], making it his eighth and final collaboration with Blue Sky before it shut down on April 10, 2021. The story, written by [[Ron Burch]], David Kidd, and [[Don Rhymer]], follows a gentle pacifist bull named Ferdinand who refuses to participate in [[bullfighting]] but is forced back into the arena where his beliefs are challenged when he faces off against the world's greatest bullfighter.\n\n''Ferdinand'' premiered on December 10, 2017 in [[Los Angeles]], and was theatrically released in the United States on December 15, 2017 in 3D and 2D formats and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and audiences. It was a [[Box office bomb|box office bomb at the North American box office]], but fared better internationally, grossing $296 million worldwide against a production budget of $111 million.<ref name=\"DeadlineLockJedi\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule?filmSearch=Ferdinand|title=Past, present and future releases to Past, Present and Future Releases {{!}} UK Recent and Upcoming Movie|website=Launchingfilms.com|access-date=2017-04-01|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921050331/http://www.launchingfilms.com/release-schedule?filmSearch=Ferdinand|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://rogersmovienation.com/2017/12/16/box-office-jedi-headed-for-208-ferdinand-bombs/amp/ | title=Box Office: \"Jedi\" Headed for $208, \"Ferdinand\" bombs | date=December 16, 2017 }}</ref> ''Ferdinand'' received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (losing against ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'') while also receiving nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film|Best Animated Feature Film]] (also lost against ''Coco'') and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[Home (Nick Jonas song)|Home]]\") at the [[75th Golden Globe Awards]] (losing against ''[[This Is Me (Keala Settle song)|This Is Me]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-2018-nominees-full-list-1202634435/|title=Golden Globe Nominations: Complete List|work=Variety|date=December 11, 2017|access-date=December 11, 2017|first=Rebecca|last=Rubin|archive-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518210258/https://variety.com/2017/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-2018-nominees-full-list-1202634435/|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also the last film by Blue Sky Studios to be nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe, as the studio was shut down in April 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot must be more than 400 and less than 700 words.

Ferdinand is a [[pacifist]] and loves flowers, and is bullied by the other calves Valiente, Guapo, and Bones. A [[matador]] arrives, and the calves' fathers fight to impress him. Ferdinand's father Raf is picked, so Valiente crushes Ferdinand's favorite flower in retaliation. Raf does not come back from the ring, and Valiente\u2019s father states his belief that \"soft\" bulls always die. Ferdinand runs away from Casa del Toro, and he winds up on a flower farm owned by Juan and his daughter Nina, who adopt him.\n\nTwo years later, Ferdinand has grown into an enormous but still gentle bull. Juan determines that Ferdinand looks too scary to take along to the annual [[Garden Festival|Flower Festival]], as in previous years. Ferdinand follows them anyway, but is stung by a bee and panics, accidentally destroying the town square. [[Animal Control]] officers deem him dangerous, and take him away before Nina and Juan can explain.\n\nThe officers decide to give Ferdinand to Casa del Toro, where he meets his old bullies Valiente, Bones, and Guapo, plus new additions such as Lupe the goat, and two new bulls, Angus and Maquina. Ferdinand tries to escape, but is stopped by three [[Germany|German]] [[Lipizzan]] horses.\n\nThe next day, snooty matador El Primero arrives, needing a bull for his final bullfight before retirement. Moreno puts all the bulls in a ring to fight it out, but Ferdinand refuses to take part, causing a chain of mishaps when he tries to help Guapo recover from a [[stage fright]]-induced faint. El Primero gives Moreno two days to get the bulls into shape. Guapo is sent to the [[slaughterhouse]], and Valiente informs a horrified Ferdinand that non-fighters now become meat.\n\nThat night, Ferdinand comforts Bones as he grieves for Guapo, making a friend of him. The next day, he fixes Angus' hair so he can see better, earning another friend. Ferdinand, Bones, and Angus then challenge the horses to a dance off, and Maquina joins in the fun, helping them win. Valiente mocks them for bonding and wasting valuable practice time, causing the other bulls to sadly abandon Ferdinand and return to training.\n\nWith the help of the three [[hedgehog]] siblings Una, Dos, and Cuatro, Ferdinand and Lupe try to escape through the house. Ferdinand finds a wall of horns in a trophy room, including his father's. Realizing that bulls die whether they are selected or not, Ferdinand goes back and warns the others to run for their lives. Valiente refuses to accept the truth, and starts fighting Ferdinand, accidentally breaking off his own horn. He is taken to the slaughterhouse, and Ferdinand is chosen by El Primero, who believes he deliberately injured Valiente.\n\nFerdinand rescues Valiente, as well as Guapo, who had not yet been killed. Together, Lupe, the bulls and the hedgehogs steal Moreno's truck and flee to [[Madrid]].  El Primero threatens Moreno that if his staff does not catch Ferdinand, El Primero will fight Moreno in the ring instead. They abandon the truck and flee on foot to the [[Atocha (Madrid)|Atocha train station]]. Ferdinand helps the others get aboard the train, but sacrifices himself to buy them time to get away. He is captured and brought to the ring, but a video of the bulls' escape has made the news. Recognizing Ferdinand on TV, Paco alerts Juan and Nina, who hurry to Madrid to save Ferdinand.\n\nIn [[Las Ventas]] Arena, Ferdinand refuses to fight and starts running around in blind panic, accidentally knocking over and humiliating El Primero. El Primero wounds him with a [[Bullfighter#Banderillero|banderilla]], and Ferdinand nearly retaliates until he sees a [[carnation]] crushed beneath his hoof. Not wishing to hurt anyone, Ferdinand spares El Primero and sits down, waiting to be killed. The crowd yells for El Primero to let Ferdinand live, and he decides to put down his sword and leave with dignity. Through his pacifism, Ferdinand becomes the first bull to survive a bullfight, and is reunited with Nina. Moreno then brings Lupe, Ferdinand and the rest of the bulls to live at Nina's farm.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[John Cena]] as Ferdinand, a big-hearted [[Spanish Fighting Bull]] who does not want to fight and believes in looking out for others.<ref name=\"HUGDebutTrailer\">{{cite web|last1=Phelan|first1=Zehra|title=Like a bull in a china shop the debut trailer for Ferdinand barges in|url=http://www.heyuguys.com/ferdinand-trailer/|publisher=HeyUGuys|access-date=March 28, 2017|date=March 28, 2017|archive-date=March 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328235737/http://www.heyuguys.com/ferdinand-trailer/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n**Colin H.
