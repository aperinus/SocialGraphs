Soderbergh came out of retirement to direct the film and distributed it independently through his own company, Fingerprint Releasing. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Channing Tatum]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Riley Keough]], [[Daniel Craig]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Katherine Waterston]], and [[Sebastian Stan]]. The film follows the Logan family and their attempt to rob the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] whilst avoiding security officers and the FBI.\n\n''Logan Lucky'' premiered in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] on August 9, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 18, 2017 by [[Bleecker Street (company)|Bleecker Street]]. The film received positive reviews, with many critics praising the cast's performances and Soderbergh's direction, and grossed $48 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/the-hitmans-bodyguard-misses-the-mark/|title=The Hitman's Bodyguard Misses the Mark|first=Jeff|last=Giles|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|date=August 17, 2017|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWest Virginian Jimmy Logan is laid off from his construction job in the tunnels underneath the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]. He is close to his daughter, Sadie, who lives with her mom, Bobbie Jo, and her new, rich husband, Moody. Sadie performs in beauty pageants, and Jimmy's hair stylist sister, Mellie, does her hair. Bobbie Jo and Moody plan on moving to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] as Moody plans to open up a new dealership.\n\nJimmy goes to a bar tended by his brother Clyde, who lost his lower arm fighting in Iraq. A pretentious NASCAR-team owner, Max Chilblain, makes fun of Clyde's disability, leading to a fight with Jimmy, while Clyde sets fire to Max's car. The next day, Jimmy tells Clyde his plan to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of its underground [[pneumatic tube]] system for moving its vast amount of money.\n\nClyde and Jimmy recruit their sister Mellie, incarcerated safe-cracker Joe Bang, and Joe's dimwitted brothers, Sam and Fish. They will break Joe out of prison and return him later that day. Clyde intentionally gets himself sent to prison on a minor charge. With the unknowing help of a woman working at the vault, Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's tube system with painted cockroaches, determining which tubes go to the vault. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia, who gives him a tetanus shot inside her mobile clinic, which is in need of donations.  Jimmy learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule, forcing them to mount the heist a week earlier, during the much busier [[Coca-Cola 600]] race on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nJoe arranges for fellow inmates to stage a riot, resulting in a lockdown that hides his and Clyde's escape. Mellie meets them in a [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|Ford Shelby GT350]] stolen from Moody. At the speedway, Sam and Fish blow up a cell tower to disable the credit card machines, forcing vendors to accept cash only. Clyde, Jimmy and Joe enter the tube room, and Joe uses an explosive improvised from bleach, gummy bears and a dietary salt substitute to blow open the gate from the tube to the vault. They connect the tube to a giant vacuum pump, and suck up all the cash into garbage bags. Security guards investigate the smoke from the explosion, but are diverted by Earl, one of Clyde's bar patrons. Jimmy accidentally reverses the direction of the vacuum, sucking Clyde's prosthetic arm into the machine. Sam and Fish get the money out and into Jimmy's truck. On his way out, Clyde is recognized by Chilblain and hits him, then Clyde and Joe sneak back into the prison disguised as firefighters. Jimmy, having retrieved Clyde\u2019s arm from the machine, makes it to his daughter's pageant just in time to see her perform his favorite song, \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]].\" Jimmy then abandons the money and anonymously informs the police of its location.\n\nFBI agent Sarah Grayson investigates the heist, dubbed \u201c[[Ocean's Eleven|Ocean's]] [[7-Eleven|Seven-Eleven]]\" in the press. While she suspects Jimmy, Clyde and Joe, she has no evidence. Due to the unwillingness of the prison warden to report the riot, the refuting of Chilblain's eyewitness account by his disgruntled and bitter race driver, Dayton White, and the speedway president's satisfaction with the money's recovery and insurance settlement, the case is closed after six months. When Joe returns home after prison he finds a garbage bag of money buried in his yard. Sylvia receives an anonymous donation for her clinic, the inmate who orchestrated the prison riot and the woman working at the vault each receive an envelope stuffed with cash.\n\nUnknown to Joe and his brothers, Jimmy had filled extra trash bags during the heist, which he hid at the dump to retrieve later. Now working in a [[Lowe's]] store and having bought a house near his daughter and ex-wife's home, Jimmy happily reunites with Clyde, Mellie, Joe, and Sylvia at the bar. The group is watched by Grayson, who tells Clyde that she is new to the area but thinks she will stay for a while.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Jimmy Logan, a blue-collar worker whose once-promising football career was ruined by an injury.

Production lasted 36 days, with much of the photography taking place at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] during the NASCAR race meetings at both circuits. The Atlanta outside barriers were repainted yellow, in an attempt to resemble Charlotte; the Charlotte track had yellow walls owing to then NASCAR's premiership title sponsor Sprint (they have since been replaced with white walls);  Atlanta has white walls with red and blue pattern for Folds of Honor, the charity that is involved with (now spring) race sponsor [[QuikTrip]]. The scenes with the Fox commentators inside the commentary box were shot in Atlanta, because in Charlotte, the commentators are typically positioned on top of the grandstand roof for opening broadcast scenes and also since the road course can be seen from the Charlotte commentary box.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article150235527.html|title=Channing Tatum shot a movie at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
