''Return to Paradise'' is a [[remake]] of the 1989 French film ''[[:fr:Force majeure (film, 1989)|Force majeure]]''. The film had its premiere on August 10, 1998, and was released to theaters on August 14, 1998.\n\nIt is the first film on-screen collaboration between Vaughn and Heche, the second film being ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'', was released in the same year.\n\n==Plot==\nThree friends, Lewis McBride, Sheriff and Tony, are seen having a fun vacation in a [[Malaysia]]n paradise. Their adventures include being almost run over by a car while riding a bicycle, and being pressured into buying some [[rhinoceros]] horn from Malaysian locals. They also purchase a large bag of [[Hashish|hash]] from a drug dealer. The three men wind up at their beach front house on the ocean pondering their future in the island paradise.\n\nTony and Sheriff decide to return to New York, while Lewis, being a \"greenie\", wishes to travel to Borneo to save endangered [[orangutan]]s. On the last day, they toss the remaining hash in the garbage. As time passes in New York, Sheriff is working as a limo driver and Tony as an architect.\n\nA young lawyer named Beth informs them that their friend Lewis has spent the last two years in [[Penang]] prison in Malaysia, because of hash found at their Malaysian house. She reveals that he will receive the death sentence unless one or both of the men return to share responsibility. Beth assures both of them that they will not suffer in prison, be tortured, or harmed in any way. After a gruelling eight days, during which they must make a decision, Beth and Sheriff begin a heated love affair, and both men decide to return to Malaysia. Upon their arrival, all seems well until they visit the prison to see Lewis.\n\nLewis appears to have suffered psychological damage from the harsh imprisonment, although it is reported that he has not been tortured or starved as is the case with other prisoners. Beth subsequently reveals that she is Lewis' sister and has been blatantly manipulating the two men. Her lie makes Tony fearful of the Malaysian justice system and he abandons Lewis and flies back to the United States. Sheriff initially follows Tony, but decides to face jail to save his friend and returns to the courtroom in which Lewis is being tried.\n\nThe judge seems heartened by this act of courage, until he discovers a news clipping from an American newspaper blaming the Malaysian justice system and condemning them for their harsh sentencing of Lewis. Because of this, the judge becomes infuriated and gives Lewis a death sentence, despite Sheriff's decision to accept his share of the responsibility. He also gives Sheriff an unknown period of jail time.\n\nAs Lewis is taken to his execution, Sheriff hears his screams and struggles. From a window, he is able to call to him, to assure him repeatedly that he is not alone. Just before he is hanged, Lewis calms in response to these assurances and dies quietly.\n\nSheriff assures Beth that Lewis, despite his emotional deterioration, seemed at peace in his final moments. Beth becomes emotional and kisses Sheriff as a sign of their love and connection. She tells him that the attorney general has said that the Malaysian government will quietly release him within six months, once the media attention dies down, to save face. As the guard takes Sheriff out, Beth says that she will take her brother back home and then return to Malaysia to wait for his release.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as John \"Sheriff\" Volgecherev\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Beth Eastern\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Lewis McBride\n* [[David Conrad]] as Tony Croft\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Kerrie\n* [[Nick Sandow]] as Ravitch\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as M.J.

That was more of a visceral film. This one is more cerebral. Like Sheriff and Tony, we're pulled both ways by the story: We want them to go back and save Lewis, but we're not exactly sure we'd do the same. That's the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in a nutshell.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/return-to-paradise-1998|title=Return to Paradise Review (1998)|website=RogerEbert.com|date=August 14, 1998}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: \"''Return to Paradise'' sounds as gimmicky as a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode, but it's not. The film tracks the week in which Sheriff struggles to discover his conscience, and it puts us right in touch with his squirmy, divided soul.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284602,00.html|title=Movie Review: 'Return to Paradise'|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 21, 1998}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"As Sheriff, Mr. Vaughn projects a deep-seated skepticism and chilliness that give the story its suspense; he seems quite capable of keeping his distance and leaving Lewis to die. And Mr. Phoenix, though not often seen after the film's vivid Malaysian prologue, conveys the terrible pathos in Lewis's situation. But as Ms. Heche's formidable Beth Eastern does her best to manipulate the other characters on Lewis's behalf, ''Return to Paradise'' takes on the abstract weightiness of an ethical debate rather than the visceral urgency of a thriller. Though the clock ticks relentlessly enough to sustain the story's tension, the film finally seems to be a character study in search of a gripping plot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E1DF133AF937A2575BC0A96E958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|title=Return to Paradise (1998) FILM REVIEW; At the Mercy of Foolish Friends|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 14, 1998}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave a negative review, writing: \"If it's to be experienced at all, ''Return to Paradise'' is best seen as a lively piece of pulp, not a profound exploration of the vagaries of the human soul.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/14/entertainment/ca-12919|title=Movie Review 'Paradise': A Prison Potboiler With Serious Intent|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 14, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nTwo of the actors were nominated for [[Hungary]]'s Csapnival\u00f3 best performers awards in 2000.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
