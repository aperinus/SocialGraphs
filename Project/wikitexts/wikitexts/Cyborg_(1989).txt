[[Jean-Claude van Damme]] stars as Gibson Rickenbacker, a mercenary who battles a group of murderous marauders led by Fender Tremolo ([[Vincent Klyn]]) along the [[East coast of the United States]] in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic future]]. The film is the first in Pyun's Cyborg Trilogy. It was followed by 1993's ''[[Knights (film)|Knights]]'' (originally entitled ''The Kingdom of Metal: Cyborg Killer'') and ''[[Omega Doom]]'' in 1997.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}} ''Cyborg'' was followed by the sequels ''[[Cyborg 2]]'' (1993) and ''[[Cyborg 3: The Recycler]]'' (1994).\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Pandemic|plague]] known as the living death cripples civilization. A small group of surviving scientists and doctors \u2014 located in [[Atlanta]], home of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] \u2014 work on a cure to save what remains of humanity. To complete their work they need information stored on a computer system in New York City. Pearl Prophet volunteers for the dangerous courier mission and is made into a cyborg through surgical augmentation.\n\nPearl, accompanied by bodyguard Marshall Strat, retrieves the data in New York but is pursued by the vicious Fender Tremolo and his gang of pirates. Fender wants the cure so he can have a monopoly on its production. Strat, badly injured while fighting the pirates, tells Pearl to leave him and find a mercenary, known as a \"slinger\", who can escort her to safety. She gets cornered but is saved by a slinger named Gibson Rickenbacker. After she explains her situation, they are overrun by Fender's gang, and Gibson is knocked out by falling debris. Fender demands that she accompany him to Atlanta or die.\n\nFender's gang slaughters a family and steals their boat. They head south for Atlanta via the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] with the captive Pearl. Gibson, who had been tracking the pirates, arrives at the scene of slaughter later that night. A shadowy figure attacks him, but he disables her. She turns out to be Nady Simmons, a young woman who mistook him as a pirate. Nady, whose family was wiped out by the plague, joins Gibson. Gibson is less concerned with a cure for the plague than with killing Fender. Gibson and Nady trek southward through the wastelands, where bandits ambush them. Concerned for Nady, Gibson unsuccessfully attempts to convince her to stay away. After declining sex with Nady, Gibson reveals that all he cares about is revenge against Fender, who killed his lover and destroyed his chance to have a normal life and family.\n\nIntercepting Fender and his crew near [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Gibson defeats most of his men, but Fender shoots him with an air rifle. Now nursing a gunshot wound, Gibson realizes Haley (his dead lover's younger sister whom Fender kidnapped) is now a loyal member of Fender's crew. He flees the pirates and ends up alone with Pearl and Nady. Pearl refuses to go with him \u2014 she calculates that Gibson is not strong enough to defeat Fender and will be unable to get her to Atlanta safely. She says she will go along with Fender and lure him to his death in Atlanta, where she has resources at her disposal.\n\nTired, wounded and badly outnumbered, Gibson flees with Nady through the sewer into a [[salt marsh]], where they are pursued by the rest of the pirates and eventually separated from each other. Gibson is thoroughly beaten by Fender and [[crucified]] high on the mast of a beached, derelict ship. Haley lingers at the scene but still leaves with Fender. Gibson spends the night on the cross. In the morning, near death, he kicks the mast repeatedly with his dangling foot in a last fit of rage. The mast snaps, sending him crashing to the ground, his arms still tied and nailed to the cross. Finally, Nady appears out of the marsh to free him.\n\nGibson and Nady intercept Fender once again in Atlanta, this time better prepared. Fender's gang is taken down one by one until he and Gibson face off. During their fight, Nady rushes Fender with a knife, but he stabs and kills her. Gibson in turn stabs Fender in the chest. Thinking him dead, Gibson embraces Haley, who, during the battle turned decisively against Fender. However, Fender gets back up, and they continue to battle in a nearby shed, where Gibson finally kills Fender by impaling him on a meat hook. Gibson and Haley escort Pearl to her final destination before heading back off.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jean-Claude van Damme]] as Gibson Rickenbacker\n*[[Deborah Richter]] as Nady Simmons\n*[[Vincent Klyn]] as Fender Tremolo\n*[[Dayle Haddon]] as Pearl Prophet\n*Alex Daniels as Marshall Strat\n*Blaise Loong as Furman Vux / Pirate / Bandit\n*[[Ralf M\u00f6ller]] as Brick Bardo (credited as Rolf Muller)\n*Haley Peterson as Haley\n*Terrie Batson as Mary\n*Jackson 'Rock' Pinckney as Tytus / Pirate\n\n==Production==\n[[Cannon Films]] initially intended to make a sequel to the 1987 [[He-Man]] film ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'' and a live-action [[Spider-Man in film#Cannon Films|Spider-Man film]]. Both projects were planned to be shot simultaneously by [[Albert Pyun]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Cronin |url= https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-he-man-spider-man-films-became-cyborg/ |title=Movie Legends Revealed: He-Man & Spider-Man Films Became Cyborg?|publisher=CBR|date=January 30, 2013 |access-date=June 13, 2020}}</ref> Cannon, however, was in financial trouble and had to cancel deals with both [[Mattel]] and [[Marvel Entertainment]] Group, the owners of He-Man and Spider-Man, respectively. Cannon had already spent $2 million on costumes and sets for both films and decided to start a new project in order to recoup that money. Pyun wrote the storyline for ''Cyborg'' in one weekend. Pyun had [[Chuck Norris]] in mind for the lead, but co-producer [[Menahem Golan]] cast [[Jean-Claude van Damme]]. The film was shot for less than $500,000 and was filmed in 23 days.<ref name=\"interview1\">Loreti, Nicanor. Interview with Albert Pyun. ''La Cosa Fantastico'' #113 (July 2005).

He chose the latter although he later admitted \"I didn't like [the film] so much.\"<ref name=\"jean\"/>\n\nJackson \"Rock\" Pinckney, who played one of Fender's pirates, lost an eye during filming when Jean-Claude van Damme accidentally struck his eye with a prop knife.

The lyrics are slightly modified. The intro is also in the opening of the song \"World Damnation\" by the death metal band [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]]. The intro of Fender talking about death and starvation is thought as the official opening of metal band Chimairas' song \"Resurrection.\" It is often played at live shows as an intro. The same intro is also played the beginning of a song by Australian, Christian, gore-grindcore band [[Vomitorial Corpulence]].\n\n==References==\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0097138|Cyborg}}\n*{{AllMovie title|11869|Cyborg}}\n*{{Mojo title|cyborg|Cyborg}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|cyborg|Cyborg}}\n\n{{Cyborg film series}}\n{{Albert Pyun}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cyborg}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Cyborg (film series)]]\n[[Category:Cyborg films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Albert Pyun]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Menahem Golan]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Yoram Globus]]\n[[Category:Films set in Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Films set in Charleston, South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Martial arts science fiction films]]"}]}}}}
