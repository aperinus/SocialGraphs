The film is distributed by [[Sony Pictures Classics]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the summer of 1994 in New York City, Luke Shapiro is trading [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in exchange for therapy from his [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Jeffery Squires. Luke graduates from high school but while [[Illegal drug trade|dealing]] at a party, he finds out that Justin and most of his class have left for the summer, except for him and his classmate and Squires' stepdaughter, Stephanie \"Steph\" Squires. When Luke returns home, he finds his parents arguing over money and their probable eviction from their Manhattan apartment.\n\nLuke starts dealing more marijuana to make money for his family. After a session with Squires, he bumps into Steph and invites her to come with him dealing around the city. Steph has a great time and gives Luke her number so she will not be lonely in the city for the summer. Luke calls Steph but ends up talking to Squires and they go out to a bar. While getting drunk and high, they get kicked out for underage drinking. Walking back from the bar, Luke and Squires start [[Graffiti|tagging]] a wall but are apprehended by the police. Steph bails them out of jail and, against Squires' wishes, takes Luke out for the day. Luke and Steph end up kissing. When Luke gets home, he finds he has strong feelings for her.\n\nAfter Luke learns that his family is getting evicted, Steph invites him to her family's house on [[Fire Island]] while Squires and his wife go on a second [[honeymoon]] to repair their marriage. At the island, Steph finds out Luke is a virgin and gives him sex lessons. After taking a shower and having sex together, Luke tells Steph that he loves her. She reacts with astonishment, though Luke fails to realize that she is not interested in a committed relationship. Justin later contacts Steph asking if she wants to hang out.\n\nLuke asks Squires for help selling pot in order to make enough money for college. Luke introduces Squires to his client, Eleanor, and they hit it off. As Luke's family is evicted and moves in with his grandparents in [[New Jersey]], Luke visits Steph for companionship, only to find her on a date with Justin. A heartbroken Luke goes to Fire Island to seek counselling with Squires, who is on a [[suicidal|bender]] because his wife left him. While high, Squires tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea, but Luke stops him.\n\nLuke later talks with Squires inside the Squires' home and Squires wishes him good luck. As Luke is leaving, Steph follows him to the elevator to talk to him. However, Luke refuses to talk to her and leaves, leaving a regretful Steph behind. As Luke walks out of the complex, he puts in the [[mixtape]] Squires made for him and \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" by [[Mott the Hoople]] begins playing.\n\nIn New Jersey, Luke tells his family he plans to become a psychiatrist, wanting to help other people with their problems. Back in the city, Eleanor [[pager|beeps]] Squires and the two make plans to hook up that night. The film cuts to Luke, who is smoking a joint while waiting at a train stop.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Dr. Jeffrey Squires\n* [[Josh Peck]] as Luke Shapiro\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as  Kristin Squires\n* [[Olivia Thirlby]] as Stephanie \"Steph\" Squires\n* [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] as Union\n* [[Method Man]] as Percy\n* [[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Mr. Shapiro\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Eleanor\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Mrs. Shapiro\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Justin\n\n==Production==\nJonathan Levine has said that the film is semi-autobiographical: \"'I wish I could say that I sold pot and I had a shrink like Ben Kingsley, but no, it wasn't like that,' admits Jonathan Levine. 'It's the details and the backdrop, and a lot of the perspective of this kid and the way that he looks at the world,' explains Levine. 'The Stephanie character, I guess, is a composite of a few different ladies who broke up with me,' Levine says with a laugh. 'That happened.'\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rea |first=Steven |date=July 13, 2008 |title=On Movies: 'Wackness' writer's life not quite so wacky |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |url=https://www.inquirer.com/philly/entertainment/20080713_On_Movies___Wackness__writer_s_life_not_quite_so_wacky.html |url-status=dead |access-date=October 19, 2022 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2022.10.19-145129/https://www.inquirer.com/philly/entertainment/20080713_On_Movies___Wackness__writer_s_life_not_quite_so_wacky.html |archive-date=October 19, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Hehir |first=Andrew |date=July 3, 2008 |title=On the dopeness of \"The Wackness\" |url=https://www.salon.com/2008/07/03/wackness/ |access-date=October 19, 2022 |website=Salon |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFilming wrapped up on August 24, 2007.

[[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a 71% approval rating based on 136 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Sympathetic characters and a clever script help ''The Wackness'' overcome a familiar plot to make for a charming coming-of-age comedy.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Wackness |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wackness |access-date=November 5, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\nJosh Peck's performance in the film has been cited as helping him to establish his talents beyond his work in Nickelodeon television shows like ''[[The Amanda Show]]'' and ''[[Drake & Josh]]''. \"The film is a testament to how talented Peck really is,\" Noah Dominguez of ''[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]'' wrote. \"While he was great (not to mention absolutely hilarious) as Josh Nichols on ''Drake & Josh'', ''The Wackness'' highlights his range as an actor.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dominguez |first=Noah |date=9 May 2022 |title=The Wackness Proved Josh Peck Was More Than Drake & Josh |url=https://www.cbr.com/the-wackness-josh-peck-drake/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220511051049/https://www.cbr.com/the-wackness-josh-peck-drake/ |archive-date=11 May 2022 |website=CBR}}</ref> [[Ben Kingsley]]'s performance, however, earned him a [[Razzie Award]] nomination for Worst Supporting Actor (also for ''[[The Love Guru]]'' and ''[[War, Inc.]]'').\n\n==Music==\nLevine wrote in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', \"Beyond what worked tone-wise, a lot of the music speaks to what's going on in the movie. There's that 'Heaven & Hell' song by [[Raekwon]] when Josh is up on a water tower looking down, and it's asking, 'Is high school heaven or is it hell?' And '[[Can I Kick It?]]' by [[A Tribe Called Quest]] plays when Kingsley's trying to kick drugs. So a lot of it just kind of worked thematically.\"<ref name=dallas/>\n\nLevine targeted the most iconic acts of the era, with [[Notorious B.I.G.]] on the top of his list. Luke and Stephanie bond in Central Park over beer and the sounds of Total Featuring the Notorious B.I.G.'s single \"Can't You See\". \"The What,\" a song from that album featuring [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member [[Method Man]], who also appears in the film as Luke's supplier, leads off the soundtrack. Levine says he considered expanding the film's soundtrack to include [[Weezer]] and [[Smashing Pumpkins]], two of the year's biggest non-hip-hop acts, and that the original ending featured [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]].\"<ref name=dallas/>\n\nLevine added, \"Ultimately, tough choices refined the film's reach, which isn't such a bad thing. But that doesn't mean it was easy passing that other music up.\"<ref name=dallas>{{cite news|url=http://www.guidelive.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/music/stories/DN-wacknessfeature_0717gl.ART0.State.Edition1.4deb33a.html |title=Hip-hop music of mid-'90s defines new movie 'The Wackness' |work=The Dallas Morning News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930171119/http://www.guidelive.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/music/stories/DN-wacknessfeature_0717gl.ART0.State.Edition1.4deb33a.html |archive-date=September 30, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack from the Sundance submission edit of the movie differs from the final edit, with several tracks either being shifted, replaced, or cut out of some scenes possibly due to issues of licensing.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n# \"[[Ready to Die|The What?]]\" -- [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] feat.
