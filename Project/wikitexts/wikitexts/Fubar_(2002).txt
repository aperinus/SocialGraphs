''FUBAR'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Since its release, it has gained a cult status in [[North America]], particularly in [[Western Canada]].\n\n''FUBAR'' was filmed and set in and around [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], and was filmed entirely with digital cinematography on a [[List of Canon products|Canon XL1]] and a shoestring budget that required Dave Lawrence to max out his credit card and caused his dad to refinance their family home in order to complete the movie.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.avenuecalgary.com/city-life/top-40-under-40/dave-lawrence/|title=Dave Lawrence|first=Abby|last=Miller|website=Avenuecalgary.com|date=17 October 2011|access-date=24 January 2022}}</ref>\n\n''FUBAR'' features characters created by [[Dave Lawrence]] and Paul Spence that they developed based on the head-banger subculture. Terry Cahill, one of the main characters of the film played by Lawrence was based on a character Lawrence created at [[Loose Moose Theatre]] in the mid-90s. Many people featured in the movie (including the fist-fighters) were bystanders, who thought that the filmmakers were shooting a documentary on the common man. ''FUBAR'' did not have a set script, only a rough outline on which the actors improvised.<ref>{{Cite news|date=August 22, 2014|title=Michael Dowse's Happy Ending: Is Hollywood ready for the Fubar director?|newspaper=[[The Calgary Herald]]|url=https://calgaryherald.com/uncategorized/michael-dowses-happy-ending-is-hollywood-ready-for-the-fubar-director|url-status=live|access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''FUBAR'' is the story of two lifelong friends, Terry Cahill (Dave Lawrence) and Dean Murdoch (Paul Spence), who have grown up together: [[shotgunning]] their first beers, forming their first [[garage band]], and growing the great Canadian [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]] known as \"[[Hockey Hair]]\". The lives of these Alberta [[Everyman|everymen]] are brought to the big screen by documentarian Farrel Mitchner (Gordon Skilling), a young director who decides to take a look at Terry and Dean through a lens, exploring the depths of their friendship, the fragility of life, growing up gracefully, and the art and science of drinking beer \"like a man\".\n\nTheir lives are complicated by a snubbing by their \"party leader\" Troy, better known as Tron (Andrew Sparacino).  When Farrel discovers that Dean is hiding a serious case of [[testicular cancer]], the wheels are set in motion for Dean to seek [[Testicular cancer#Surgery|treatment]] from Dr. S.C. Lim (Dr. S.C. Lim).  With Dean's last weekend before surgery approaching, Terry decides to take Dean, Farrel and the film crew [[camping]].  Things take an unexpected turn by the third day, and Terry and Dean must cope with further tragedy.<ref>Slone, M. & Michael Ladano: Story Synopsis (first paragraph) written by Mark Slone.
