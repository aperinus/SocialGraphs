Beach Jr.]] The picture was directed by [[Robert Wise]] and produced by [[Harold Hecht]]. The title refers to \"[[Silent running (submarine)|silent running]]\", a [[submarine]] stealth tactic. The story describes [[World War II]] submarine warfare in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and deals with themes of vengeance, endurance, courage, loyalty, and honor and how these can be tested during wartime.\n\nIn addition to Gable and Lancaster playing the leads, the film also features [[Jack Warden]] and was the film debut of [[Don Rickles]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=Run Silent, Run Deep (1958) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/42321/Run-Silent-Run-Deep/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309084433/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/42321/Run-Silent-Run-Deep/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 9, 2014 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |author-link=Hal Erickson (author) |date=2014 |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[United Artists]] appropriately promoted ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' as a combination of the obsessiveness of ''[[Moby Dick]]'''s [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]] and the shipboard rivalry found in ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty]]''.<ref name=bret>{{cite book|last=Bret|first=David |title=Clark Gable: Tormented Star|year=2008|publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-1906779665 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TnIPJGPJXYC&pg=PT189}}</ref>\n\nAlthough based on a novel of the same name, and having many of the same characters, the plot of the film diverges from that of the book. Captain Beach, the author of the book, did not think highly of the film; he later said that the film company bought only the book title and was not interested in producing an accurate depiction of the theme and plot of his novel.<ref>{{cite magazine |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title= Interview with Captain Edward L.

Richardson ([[Clark Gable]]), is determined to get revenge on the [[Japan]]ese [[destroyer]] ''Akikaze'' and its ace captain, nicknamed \"Bungo Pete\", who has sunk four US submarines in the [[Bungo Channel|Bungo Straits]], including his previous command. He persuades the Navy Board to give him a new submarine command with the provision that his [[executive officer]] be someone who has just returned from active sea patrol. He single-mindedly trains the crew of his new boat, the [[USS Nerka|USS ''Nerka'']], to return to the Bungo Straits and sink Bungo Pete, in spite of the Navy having expressly forbidden him from approaching the Bungo Straits on this mission. Richardson's executive officer, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Jim Bledsoe ([[Burt Lancaster]]), is worried about the safety of his boat and his crew. He also resents Richardson and the Navy leadership for denying him command of the ''Nerka'', which he believes should have been his.\n\nRichardson begins to rigorously drill the crew on a rapid bow shot: Firing at the bow of an approaching ship, considered an act of desperation due to a vessel's extremely narrow profile. He then bypasses one target, only to take on a Japanese destroyer with a bow shot. The crew is outraged as it discovers that Richardson is avoiding legitimate targets in order to enter the Bungo Straits undetected in direct violation of his mission orders.\n\nFinally, they come upon a large convoy. Soon after blowing up a cargo ship and then engaging Bungo Pete, they are attacked by aircraft that had been alerted to their presence and were waiting in ambush. They are forced to dive and barely survive [[depth charge]]s. Three of the crew are killed, and Richardson suffers an incapacitating concussion. The submarine also narrowly dodges what the crew mistakenly believes is one of their own torpedoes doubling back on them. By sending up blankets, equipment, and the bodies of the dead, they convince the Japanese that the submarine has been sunk. Bledsoe uses Richardson's injury to assume command and set course for Pearl Harbor.\n\nWhile listening to [[Tokyo Rose]] proclaiming the sinking of their boat, several crewmen are mystified about how the Japanese are able to identify several of them by name. Bledsoe realizes that the Japanese have analyzed their floating trash, so he decides to turn that to his advantage. Since the Japanese believe the ''Nerka'' has been sunk, he returns to the Bungo Straits to fight the ''Akikaze'', which the submarine sinks with a bow shot, only to be attacked again by a mystery torpedo. Richardson deduces that the ''Akikaze'' was not working alone to sink US submarines, but was in concert with a Japanese submarine. He orders the boat into a dive just seconds before a Japanese torpedo races by.\n\nAfter a brief underwater standoff, Bledsoe realizes that, with the ''Akikaze'' gone, the Japanese sub must defend its convoy; by attacking the convoy, the ''Nerka'' forces its adversary to surface, and destroys it by firing torpedoes under a shallow-draft ship. Richardson then collapses on the bridge, dies, and is [[Burial at sea|buried at sea]].\n\n===Adaptation from the novel===\n{{main|Run Silent, Run Deep#Plot}}\n\nThe film draws many plot elements from the novel, including Japanese gathering intelligence from the submarine's trash. One key difference is that the novel places Richardson ashore recovering from a battle injury and working on the [[Mark 14 torpedo#Problems|torpedo exploder problem]] when Bledsoe takes out Richardson's boat and dies in the sinking of the USS ''Walrus''.\n\nIn the novel the conflict between Richardson and Bledsoe begins at the start of the war while they are reconditioning the old {{USS|S-16|SS-121}} in the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] and Richardson is compelled to disqualify Bledsoe for command of his own sub. The mutinous attitudes of the crew are an extension of Bledsoe's earlier rebelliousness, while the film provides them with no comparable context other than their loyalty to and respect for Bledsoe. Ensign Keith Leone, a sympathetic and loyal major character of the novel, is replaced by an unsympathetic and disloyal one who did not appear in the novel, Cartwright, to advance the conflict.\n\nAt Gable's insistence, the film has Richardson taken seriously ill before being relieved of command so Gable would not be perceived as playing a less than dominant character.<ref name=bret/>\n\nIn the film, the submarine does not ram Japanese lifeboats to ensure that Bungo Pete is killed. The US Navy, which helped with the film's production, may have been concerned with reviving memories of a 1943 incident in which [[Dudley W. Morton]] fired on Japanese shipwreck survivors while commanding {{USS|Wahoo|SS-238}}.\n\nThe film\u2019s opening credits omit the comma from the title.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clark Gable]] as Commander P.J. \"Rich\" Richardson\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe\n* [[Brad Dexter]] as Ensign Gerald Cartwright\n* [[Joe Maross]] as Chief Petty Officer Kohler\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Yeoman 1st Class \"Kraut\" Mueller\n* [[Don Rickles]] as Quartermaster 1st Class Ruby\n* [[Rudy Bond]] as Sonarman 1st Class Cullen\n* [[Nick Cravat]] as Russo\n* [[Mary LaRoche]] as Laura Richardson\n* [[Eddie Foy III]] as Larto\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe [[USS Redfish (SS-395)|USS ''Redfish'']] was used in many of the exterior scenes. This submarine had earlier portrayed the ''Nautilus'' in the Walt Disney film [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea (1954)]] and made several appearances in the television series ''[[The Silent Service (TV series)|The Silent Service]]''. She was scrapped in 1969. Rear Admiral [[Rob Roy McGregor (admiral)|Rob Roy McGregor]], who had commanded two fleet boats (''[[USS Grouper (SS-214)|Grouper]]'' and ''[[USS Sea Cat (SS-399)|Sea Cat]]'') during World War II, acted as the technical advisor.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytrGBAAAQBAJ&q=captain+rob+roy+mcgregor+advisor&pg=PA136 | title=World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide Volume II L-Z| isbn=9781105465437| last1=Rowan| first1=Terry}}</ref>\n\nThe actual Japanese destroyer ''[[Akikaze]]'' was lost with all hands while shielding the Japanese carrier ''Junyo'' from torpedoes launched by the submarine [[USS Pintado (SS-387)]] on November 1, 1944. She was stricken from the Navy list on January 10, 1945. The real [[USS Nerka]] (SS-380) was under construction during World War II, but construction was cancelled in July 1944.\n\n[[Nick Cravat]], who starred with Lancaster in nine films, had a speaking part. This was rare for him because his thick [[Brooklyn]] accent did not fit the historical dramas in which he often appeared.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186576/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Nick Cravat Biography]</ref>\n\n[[Don Rickles]] made his film debut in a small role, and in his 2007 memoirs he recalled that during filming Gable would sometimes frustrate the filmmakers (including Lancaster, who was a financial investor in the film) by adhering to a strict 9-to-5 approach to the workday \u2014 he would reportedly stop working during the filming of major scenes. Later in his life, Lancaster publicly had nothing but praise and admiration for Gable, whom he described as a consummate professional.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe film contains several accurate depictions of torpedo attacks being arranged with periscope sightings, [[Range of a projectile|range]] and [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] calculations, and use of a [[Torpedo Data Computer]] to achieve a shooting solution. On the surface, the Captain uses a Target Bearing Transmitter mounted on the [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]] to acquire a target visually and mark its bearing input for the shooting party inside the [[conning tower]]. This depicted the preferred tactic of night surface attack, taking advantage of both the submarine's greater speed and maneuverability using its [[diesel engine]]s, and the use of its [[SJ radar]] in making accurate range and bearing calculations, although with greater risk of being sunk by bombs and shell fire. The director [[Robert Wise]] had real submariners working with the cast until they could realistically depict the complexities of these torpedo attacks. Submarine veterans of World War II who viewed the film remarked on the accuracy of these scenes and the scenes now provide modern-day audiences with a view of what life was like aboard [[World War II]] submarines.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytrGBAAAQBAJ&q=Robert+Wise+had+real+submariners+working+with+the+cast+in+run+silent+run+deep&pg=PA136 | title=World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide Volume II L-Z| isbn=9781105465437| last1=Rowan| first1=Terry}}</ref>\n\nThe special effects were completed by using miniatures, considered to be state-of-the-art in 1957, when the film was made.\n\nThe US Navy and the production company staged a premiere for several journalists onboard the [[USS Perch (SS-313)|USS Perch]], while she was \"seven miles off Long Beach and 60 feet down\".<ref name=\"vtlb040258\">{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Len |title='Run Silent, Run Deep' Makes Bow in Submarine |work=Valley Times |date=April 2, 1958 |location=North Hollywood, California |page=8 |via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' \"a straight tale of undersea adventure, all-male and all-submarine ...
