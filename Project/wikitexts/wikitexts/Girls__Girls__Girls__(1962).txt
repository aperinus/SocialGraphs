Girls!''''' is a 1962 Golden Globe-nominated American [[Musical film|musical comedy film]] starring [[Elvis Presley]] as a penniless [[Hawaii]]-based fisherman who loves his life on the sea and dreams of owning his own boat. \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\", which reached No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles chart, is featured in the film. The film opened at #1 on the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' box office chart and finished the year at #19 on the year-end list of the top-grossing films of 1962. The film earned $2.6 million at the box office.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\nThe film was the second of three films Presley shot on location in [[Hawaii]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nElvis Presley plays Ross Carpenter, a Hawaii-based fishing guide and sailor who enjoys boating and sailing out on the sea. When he finds out his boss is retiring to [[Arizona]], he seeks to find a way to buy the ''Westwind'', a boat that he built with his father.\n\nRoss is caught in a love triangle with two women: childish, insensitive club singer Robin ([[Stella Stevens]]), and sweet Laurel ([[Laurel Goodwin]]). When Wesley Johnson ([[Jeremy Slate]]) makes advances on Laurel, Ross punches him out. Wesley owns the boat, so Ross thereby loses it. Laurel, however, is not who she pretends to be. Ross has to choose between her and Robin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elvis Presley]] as Ross Carpenter\t\n* [[Stella Stevens]] as Robin Gantner\n* [[Laurel Goodwin]] as Laurel Dodge\n* [[Jeremy Slate]] as Wesley Johnson\n* [[Benson Fong]] as Kin Yung\n* [[Beulah Quo]] as Madam Yung\n* [[Guy Lee]] as Chen Yung\n* Ginny Tiu as Mai Ling\n* Elizabeth Tiu as Tai Ling\n* Alexander Tiu as Mai and Tai Ling's Brother\n* [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] as Sam Anderson\n* Ann McCrea as Mrs. Arthur Morgan {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Jack Nitzsche]] as Piano Player in Lounge Band {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Nestor Paiva]] as Arthur Morgan {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* Linda Rand as Village Woman {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* Edward Sheehan as Ed-Man on Dock {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Red West]] as Bongo-Playing Crewman on Tuna Boat {{small|(uncredited)}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|Girls!

(soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reception==\nA review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film put Presley \"back into the non-dramatic, purely escapist light musical vein,\" adding, \"Essentially, Presley plays himself in the breezy sea session. He handles the role capably, though one would hardly expect a hardened fisherman to be as soft, smooth and white as the one Presley depicts. The character has little depth, but he is pleasant.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 7, 1962 |title=Girls! Girls!
