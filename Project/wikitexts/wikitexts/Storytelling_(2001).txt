It features original music by [[Belle & Sebastian]], later compiled on the album ''[[Storytelling (Belle & Sebastian album)|Storytelling]]''. It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1100059/year/2001.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Storytelling |accessdate=2009-10-23|work=Festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film consists of two stories that are unrelated and have different actors, titled \"Fiction\" and \"Non-Fiction\". College and high school serve as the backdrop for these two stories about dysfunction and personal turmoil.\n\n;Fiction\nVi ([[Selma Blair]]) is a graduate student dating an undergrad, Marcus, who has [[cerebral palsy]], though he observes that she no longer seems passionate about their relationship. They are in a creative writing class taught by a famed African-American author, Mr. Scott ([[Robert Wisdom]]). Marcus has written an amateurish story about the effect of Vi's love on his medical condition, and she encourages him to share it in the class's workshop. While other students give it tepid praise, Mr. Scott and his favorite student, Catherine, harshly dismiss it as mediocre trash. Upset, Marcus angrily blames Vi for not warning him against sharing the story, and breaks up with her, accusing her of being secretly attracted to Mr. Scott. A hurt and heartbroken Vi goes out to a bar and encounters Mr. Scott. She thanks him for being honest about Marcus's story, praises his writing, and asks if he thinks she will make a great writer; he tells her that he does not. After she flirts with him clumsily, they return to his residence, where she discovers photos of Catherine, naked and in various poses, which triggers an unwanted racist reaction in Vi. Though she becomes uncomfortable, she reluctantly has anal sex with Mr. Scott, an act which is censored by a large red square. During the act, he makes her call him an ethnic slur. Afterwards, Vi returns to Marcus in tears and reconciles with him. Later, back in the class workshop, Vi shares a fictionalized version of her encounter with Mr. Scott. The other students are appalled by the story's content, and Catherine calmly eviscerates the piece, claiming that \"Vi\" is an arrogant, narcissistic fetishist and racist. When Marcus and Vi defend the piece as being a real experience, an unimpressed Mr. Scott informs them that when she starts writing about an experience, it becomes fiction, and that the story is nevertheless an improvement over her other works because there \"is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end.\"\n\n;Non-Fiction\nToby Oxman ([[Paul Giamatti]]) is a struggling would-be filmmaker attempting to make his first documentary. Though he originally intends to make a film about the experiences of teenagers post-[[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]] on a wide scale, he is eventually forced to limit his scope to one dysfunctional, upper-middle-class suburban New Jersey family and their teenage son Scooby ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]). His father, the strict and unsympathetic Marty ([[John Goodman]]), is frustrated with Scooby's lazy attitude and unwillingness to attend college, while his football player brother Brady worries that Scooby is secretly gay and his obnoxious youngest brother Mikey is obliviously self-obsessed. Scooby's only vague ambition is to be famous, and have a talk show on television like his idol [[Conan O'Brien]], who appears to him in a dream sequence as Scooby allows a lovestruck friend to perform oral sex on him. Scooby intentionally flunks his exams, but to his surprise, he finds that he has been accepted to [[Princeton University]], which Marty privately reveals was because of a large donation from a family member.\n\nMeanwhile, Mikey torments the family's overworked, underpaid, and exhausted housekeeper, Consuelo, exercising his privileged and sheltered upbringing to badger her with questions that emphasize the discrepancy between their lifestyles. She reveals that she is still poor, has no time for any personal activities due to the constant demands from the family, and that her beloved grandson has been executed after being arrested for rape and murder. The self-centered Mikey only continues ordering her around. Later, Brady suffers a serious accident during football practice and falls into a deep coma. Mikey takes advantage of Marty's vulnerability over Brady's condition to perform hypnotism on him, during which he commands himself to be Marty's new favorite son and orders Marty fire Consuelo for petty reasons. Miraculously, the hypnosis works perfectly. Marty fires Consuelo despite her tearful pleading, much to Mikey's smug enjoyment.\n\nAfter the documentary is finished and Toby refuses to let him see the completed footage, Scooby secretly attends a late-night screening, where he witnesses the audience laughing uproariously at his dim-witted portrayal. Realizing that he will never be famous, Scooby is left devastated. While he is away, a vengeful Consuelo sneaks back into the house and murders the rest of the Livingstons by poisoning the house with [[carbon monoxide]]. Scooby returns home the next morning to find emergency services wheeling his deceased family into an ambulance. Toby, back with a camera crew, runs up to Scooby to tearfully apologize for what's transpired, but an emotionless and jaded Scooby coldly tells him to not be sorry, because \"the movie's a hit.\"\n\n;Autobiography\nThe original version of the film featured a third story entitled \"Autobiography\", concerning, among other things, a [[The closet|closeted]] football player ([[James Van Der Beek]]). The main character has an explicit sex scene with a male partner (Steven Rosen); the entire story was cut from the final version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,199194,00.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123091326/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,199194,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-23|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Kindest Cuts|first=Daniel|last=Fierman|date=Feb 6, 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n;Fiction\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vi\n* [[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Marcus\n* [[Robert Wisdom]] as Mr. Scott\n* [[Maria Thayer]] as Amy\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Elli\n* [[Devorah Rose]] as Lucy\n* Nancy Anne Ridder as Joyce\n* Steven Rosen as Ethan\n* [[Aleksa Palladino]] as Catherine\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Melinda\n* [[Tina Holmes]] as Sue\n{{col-break}}\n;Non-fiction\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Toby Oxman\n* [[Mike Schank]] as Mike the cameraman\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Mr. DeMarco\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Scooby Livingston\n* [[John Goodman]] as Marty Livingston\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Fern Livingston\n* [[Noah Fleiss]] as Brady Livingston\n* Jonathan Osser as Mikey Livingston\n* [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as Consuela\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Mr. Kirk\n* [[Franka Potente]] as Toby's editor\n* [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Storytelling'' premiered at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 12, 2001 before receiving a [[Limited release|limited North American theatrical release]] on January 25, 2002.\n\n===Red box controversy===\nDuring the sex scene in the ''Fiction'' entry, a \"red box\" was added for the American version of the film, blocking the audience's view of a rough sex scene between Blair and Wisdom.
