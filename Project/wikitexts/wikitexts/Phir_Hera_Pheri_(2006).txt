''Phir Hera Pheri'' tells the story of what happens after they become wealthy.\n\nThe film opens with a prologue bringing the audience up to raisin, stating that each has suffered a personal loss despite their new riches. Shyam lost his only love Anuradha Shivshanker Panikar in an accident, Raju lost his ailing mother,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Phir Hera Pheri - THE GREATEST COMEDY MOVIE|url=https://www.phirherapheri.com/2021/03/phir-hera-pheri.html|access-date=2021-04-28|language=en-GB}}</ref> and Babu Bhaiya - having nothing to lose in the first place - lost the little traces of common sense that he did possess.\n\nThe three men are living a lavish life in a massive [[mansion]] and splurging on various luxuries. Raju hears about an idea for doubling his wealth in 21 days from a [[Confidence trick|con woman]], Anuradha, who is claiming to be a bank manager, and she convinces Shyam and Babu Bhaiya to go along with it. Raju first arranges for \u20b930 [[lakh]] from Shyam and Babu Bhaiya and then a further \u20b950 [[lakh]] by selling their bungalow. He convinces a small-time goon, Pappu, to contribute the remaining balance of \u20b920 [[lakh]] so that he can come up with the minimum deposit of \u20b91 [[crore]], which Anuradha has promised to double.\n\nThe trio invests the money and three weeks later realizes that it was all a scam and that they are now penniless. To make matters worse, they do not even have possession of their bungalow, which Raju had sold off to arrange the last bit of money needed, and have to live in a [[chawl]] ([[tenement]]). Pappu shows up at the bungalow the next day to pick up his portion of the money but is shocked to learn that Raju has left and the bungalow is now in possession of a [[Parsi]] gun collector. Pappu is now in trouble because he had borrowed money from a [[lisping]] but dreaded gangster, Tiwari, who will kill him if he doesn't pay up.\n\nHe comes across Raju one day, and upon hearing of the scam pretends to be sympathetic. He tricks him and brings the three to his boss, telling him that they are the ones who took the money. Tiwari threatens them and tells them they have to come up with the money or else they will die. As they are being taken home by some of Tiwari's goons, the three manage to escape. Raju, Shyam, and Babu Bhaiya are about to leave the city when Raju remembers that he owes money to a woman named Anjali Patekar. The three head over to her house and are surprised to find that she is Pappu's sister. Tiwari's goons show up and kidnap Anjali because Pappu has not returned the money. Feeling guilty that he is the one who got Anjali in trouble, Raju decides that he will go to Tiwari and try to get her freed. Shyam and Babu Bhaiya refuse to leave without them and decide to stay as well. The three go back to Tiwari to ask him to release Anjali, and Tiwari tells them to bring the money, releasing Anjali.\n\nRaju, Shyam, and Babu Bhaiya now have three days to come up with \u20b940 lakh to pay back the goon, or else they will themselves be killed. Raju overhears the neighbor, Munna Bhai, plotting to steal drugs from another gangster, Nanji Bhai, and wrongly assumes they are talking about stealing money. Raju hatches a plan for the three of them to steal from Munna Bhai. The three manage to succeed barely but are confused when they do not find money inside. Raju recognizes stuff like drugs and tells them that they are worth at least \u20b93 crores (thirty million). They think that if they can sell them to Kachra Seth and pay off Tiwari, they can also become rich, but their neighbor once again steals the drugs from them. They then run into Anuradha, and she tells them that the entire scam was hatched by Kabeera (the gangster from the first ''[[Hera Pheri (2000 film)|Hera Pheri]]'') and his close aide Chhota Chetan to get revenge on the trio and that the only reason she went along with it was that they were holding her niece hostage (Anuradha's sister was Kabeera's gang member and part of the first film's kidnapping plot). Their money was converted to diamonds to pay the ransom, but she fled with them once she discovered her niece had escaped and hid them under a decoration of a circus train (named \"Kook-Doo-Koo\").\n\nIn the end, all the guys end up in a [[circus]] show where they attempt to get hold of the diamonds. These are strewn all over the ground in public by a [[gorilla]]. Soon the cops reach the spot, and they arrest Tiwari, Nanji Bhai as well as Chhota Chetan. Raju, Shyam, and Babu Bhaiya flee along with Anjali, Anuradha, and her niece. Raju escapes with Pappu's cellphone and three antique guns with him, which are worth \u20b95\u20136 crore, though he does not know about it. Pappu informs Shyam and Babu Bhaiya about the guns, after which they try to call Raju on his cellphone. The film ends in a cliffhanger where Raju is about to throw the weapons in the river with his cellphone ringing in his mouth.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Raju\n*[[Suniel Shetty]] as Ghanshyam \"Shyam\"\n*[[Paresh Rawal]] as Baburao Ganpatrao Apte a.k.a.
