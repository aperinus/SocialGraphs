It is the second [[Film adaptation|screen adaptation]] of the [[The Thin Red Line (novel)|1962 novel of the same name]] by [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]], following [[The Thin Red Line (1964 film)|the 1964 film]]. Telling a fictionalized version of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Battle of Mount Austen]], which was part of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], it portrays U.S. soldiers of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, played by [[Sean Penn]], [[Jim Caviezel]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Elias Koteas]] and [[Ben Chaplin]]. The novel's title alludes to a line from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem \"[[Tommy (Kipling poem)|Tommy]]\", from ''[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]'', in which he calls British foot soldiers \"the thin red line of heroes\",<ref>[http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Kipling/Tommy.htm\" Rudyard Kipling -- Tommy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401234723/http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Kipling/Tommy.htm |date=April 1, 2012 }}.

It co-stars [[Adrien Brody]], [[George Clooney]], [[John Cusack]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Jared Leto]], [[John C. Reilly]] and [[John Travolta]]. Reportedly, the first assembled cut took seven months to edit and ran five hours. By the final cut, footage of performances by [[Bill Pullman]], [[Lukas Haas]], and [[Mickey Rourke]] had been removed (one of Rourke's scenes was included in the special features outtakes of the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] Blu-ray and DVD release). The film was scored by [[Hans Zimmer]] and shot by [[John Toll]]. Principal photography took place in [[Queensland|Queensland, Australia]] and in the [[Solomon Islands]].\n\n''The Thin Red Line'' received generally positive reviews from critics, and was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Dramatic Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. It won the [[Golden Bear]] at the 1999 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] ranked it as his second-favorite film of the 1990s. On ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', [[Gene Siskel]] called it \"the greatest contemporary war film I've seen.\"\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Guadalcanal cemetery 1945.jpg|thumb|[[Guadalcanal]] cemetery, 1945]]\n\nIn 1942, United States Army [[Private (rank)|Private]] Witt goes [[desertion|AWOL]] from his unit to live among the carefree [[Melanesia]]n natives in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. He is found and imprisoned on a [[troopship]] by [[First Sergeant]] Welsh of his [[company (military unit)|company]]. Witt is not allowed to rejoin his unit, and is instead punitively assigned to act as a stretcher bearer for the upcoming campaign.\n\nThe men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], have been brought to the island of [[Guadalcanal]] as reinforcements in the campaign to secure [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]], seize the island from the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and block off their route to [[Australia]]. As they wait in the hold of a Navy transport ship, they contemplate their lives and the upcoming invasion. Among them is Private Bell, a married former officer; Private Doll, a cocky soldier; and Captain James Staros, the sensitive company commander. Elsewhere on the ship, Lieutenant Colonel Tall, the aging [[battalion]] commander, mulls over the importance of the invasion, which he sees as his last chance for glory in combat.\n\nThe company lands on Guadalcanal unopposed. They march into the interior of the island, and along the way encounter natives and evidence of the ongoing Japanese presence. The company soon finds their objective: Hill 210, a key enemy position. The Japanese have placed [[bunker]]s at the top of the hill, and anyone attempting the climb will be cut down by machine-gun fire.\n\nThe attack commences at dawn the next day. Charlie Company storms up the hill, but are immediately repelled by heavy machine-gun fire. Among the first killed is one of the [[platoon]] leaders, [[Second Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Whyte. Many of the men are scattered in the carnage. One group, a squad led by Sergeant Keck, hides behind a knoll safe from enemy fire to await reinforcements. When they are fired upon, Keck reaches for a grenade on his belt and accidentally pulls the pin, then throws himself back so that he will be the only one killed by the concussion. At another point, Sergeant Welsh attempts to rescue a dying soldier, only to provide him enough morphine to [[euthanasia|put him out of his misery]].\n\nTall orders Staros over the sound-powered field telephone to capture the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros balks, stating that he will not commit his men to what he sees as a suicide mission. Meanwhile, Bell (one of the men who was with Keck's squad) covertly scouts the summit of the hill by himself and assesses the Japanese stronghold.\n\nFurious at Staros's refusal to obey his command, Tall ventures up to Charlie Company's position, accompanied by his battalion executive officer, Captain John Gaff. When they arrive, they find that the Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros is sealed. After being advised on Bell's reconnaissance of the Japanese position, Tall suggests a small detachment of men to perform a [[flanking maneuver]] on the bunker to capture it. Among the men to volunteer for the mission are Witt (who has since rejoined the company during the battle), Doll, and Bell. Captain Gaff is given command of the detachment, and they proceed up the hill toward the bunker. A pitched battle ensues, but ultimately the American forces are victorious, and the hill is captured.\n\nFor their efforts, the men are given a week's leave, though they find little joy in the respite in the fighting: the airfield where they are stationed comes under frequent enemy artillery bombardment. While the company is bivouacked, Staros is relieved of his command by Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|JAG Corps]] in Washington, D.C. He offers to arrange a [[Silver Star]] for Staros, to avoid the unit's name being tarnished for having an officer removed from command. During this time, Bell receives a [[Dear John letter|letter]] from his wife, informing him that she has fallen in love with another man and seeks a divorce. Witt, meanwhile, comes across some of the locals and notices that, unlike the idyllic life he'd shared with the Melanesian natives when he went AWOL, the villagers have grown distant and distrustful of outsiders, and regularly quarrel with each other.\n\nWeeks later, the company is sent on patrol up a river under the command of the inexperienced Lieutenant Band. As Japanese artillery fire falls close to their positions and with communications severed, Band orders Corporal Fife and Private Coombs to scout upriver. Witt, sensing danger, volunteers to go along. The three men encounter an advancing [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] column, but as they attempt to retreat back to the company, they are fired upon and Coombs is wounded. In order to buy time for Fife to go back to inform the rest of the unit, Witt draws away the Japanese but is encircled by one of their squads, who demand that he surrender. Despite this, Witt raises his rifle to provoke them and is killed.\n\nAfter Witt's body is recovered and buried by his squadmates, the company receives a new commander, Captain Bosche. They are subsequently relieved of duty and board a waiting [[Landing craft tank|LCT]], which evacuates them from Guadalcanal.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast per closing tombstone credits order, roles as credited per closing credits scroll - roles do not include the extra detail someone had added to IMDB from the book, previous film, or dialogue during the film -->\n<!--- ranks as written in credits --->\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sean Penn]] as [[First sergeant#United States Army|1st Sgt.]] Edward Welsh\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as [[Corporal#United States Army|Cpl.]] Geoffrey Fife\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Private (rank)#United States|Pvt.]] Robert E.

Malick declined the offer, but instead discussed the idea of a film about the life of [[Joseph Merrick]]. Once word got out about [[David Lynch]]'s film of ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', he shelved the idea. In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in [[Paris]] about writing and directing a movie based on [[D. M. Thomas]]' 1981 novel ''[[The White Hotel]]''. Malick declined, but told them that he would be willing instead to write either an adaptation of [[Moli\u00e8re]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'', or of [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]]' ''[[The Thin Red Line (1962 novel)|The Thin Red Line]]''.

Five months later, the producers received his first draft, which was 300 pages long. According to an article in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', they gained the director's confidence by \"catering to his every whim,\"<ref name=\"Young\">{{cite magazine\n | last = Young\n | first = Josh\n | title = Days of Hell\n | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]]\n | date = January 15, 1999\n | url = <!--| access-date = 2008-01-07-->}}</ref> providing him with obscure research material, including a book titled ''Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia'', an audiotape of ''[[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo]]: Heartbeat Drummers of Japan'', information on the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[code talkers]] recruited by the [[United States Marine Corps]] to communicate in their native [[Navajo language]] to evade understanding by Japanese troops intercepting radio transmissions, making his travel plans, and helping the director and his wife Michele get a [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] for their Paris apartment.<ref name=\"Abramowitz\">{{cite news\n | last = Abramowitz\n | first = Rachel\n | title = Straight Out the Jungle\n | work = [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]\n | date = March 1999\n | url = <!--| access-date = 2008-01-07-->}}</ref>\n\nThe producers spent a lot of time talking with Malick about his vision of the film. Geisler said,\n<blockquote>Malick's Guadalcanal would be a [[Paradise Lost]], an [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], raped by the green poison, as Terry used to call it, of war. Much of the violence was to be portrayed indirectly. A soldier is shot, but rather than showing a [[Steven Spielberg|Spielbergian]] bloody face we see a tree explode, the shredded vegetation, and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree.<ref name=\"Biskind\"/></blockquote>\n\nMalick spent years working on other projects, including a stage production of ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' and a script known as ''The English-Speaker'', spending $2&nbsp;million of the producers' money, half of which for writing.<ref name=\"Biskind\"/> In 1990, he met with James Jones' widow Gloria and Jones' daughter Kaylie about adapting ''The Thin Red Line'' into a film.<ref name=\"Puig\">{{cite news\n | last = Puig\n | first = Claudia\n | title = The Magic of Malick\n | work = [[USA Today]]\n | date = January 7, 1999\n | url = <!--| access-date = 2008-01-07-->}}</ref> By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which one he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, [[Mike Medavoy]], who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on ''The Thin Red Line''.<ref name=\"Biskind\"/> Medavoy had a deal with [[Sony Pictures]] and Malick began scouting locations in [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]] before settling on the rain forests of northern [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Docherty\">{{cite news\n | last = Docherty\n | first = Cameron\n | title = Maverick Back from the Badlands\n | work = Sunday Times\n | date = June 7, 1998\n | url = <!--| access-date = 2008-01-07-->}}</ref> In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in [[Queensland]], because new studio chairman [[John Calley]] did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"Docherty\"/> Malick traveled to [[Los Angeles]] with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. [[20th Century Fox]] agreed to put up $39&nbsp;million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars from a list of 10 who were interested.<ref name=\"Docherty\"/> Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8&nbsp;million to the budget, and Phoenix added $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Docherty\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n\nCasting for the film became a hot topic. When [[Sean Penn]] met Malick, he told him, \"Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up.\"<ref name=\"Young\"/> Scripts were also sent to [[Robert De Niro]], [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Tom Cruise]]. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, numerous actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including [[Brad Pitt]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[George Clooney]] offered to work for a fraction and some even offered to work for free. [[Bruce Willis]] even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with [[Martin Sheen]] delivering the screen directions, and [[Kevin Costner]], [[Will Patton]], [[Peter Berg]], [[Lukas Haas]], and [[Dermot Mulroney]] playing the main roles.<ref name=\"Biskind\"/> In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested [[Johnny Depp]] about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the [[Sunset Strip]].<ref name=\"Biskind\"/>\n\n[[Edward Norton]] flew out to Austin and met Malick, who had been impressed by the actor's screen test for ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]''. [[Matthew McConaughey]] reportedly took a day off filming ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' to see Malick. Others followed, including [[William Baldwin]], [[Edward Burns]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Stephen Dorff]], and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]; the last of these flew up from the Mexico set of ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet|Romeo + Juliet]]'' to meet Malick at the [[American Airlines]] lounge in the Austin airport.<ref name=\"Abramowitz\"/> Before the casting was finalized, [[Nicolas Cage]] had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer only to find out that his phone number had been disconnected. [[Tom Sizemore]], however, was offered a more substantial role in ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film instead.<ref name=\"Abramowitz\"/> Actors [[Bill Pullman]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time constraints.<ref name=\"http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/09/thin-red-line-dvd-first-look-at-mickey.html\">{{cite web | url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/09/thin-red-line-dvd-first-look-at-mickey.html | title=The Thin Red Line DVD: First Look at Mickey Rourke & 8 Other Outtakes from Terrence Malick's War Film | access-date=May 22, 2011 | archive-date=August 17, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817032355/http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/09/thin-red-line-dvd-first-look-at-mickey.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt.

Malick and Toll began [[location scouting]] in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.<ref name=\"Bourton\"/>\n\nPre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer [[Grant Hill (producer)|Grant Hill]].<ref name=\"Biskind\"/> Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them, however, that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set.<ref name=\"Young\"/> Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told ''Entertainment Weekly'', \"I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude.\"<ref name=\"Young\"/>\n\nMalick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the [[Solomon Islands]] and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over [[malaria]] limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there:<ref name=\"Bourton\"/> As director of photography John Toll put it, \"It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras.

Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.\n\nMalick's unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset.

According to Jones, \"Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept.\"<ref name=\"Torgerson\"/> Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film.<ref name=\"Bourton\"/> In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.<ref name=\"Bourton\"/>\n\nThe editing resulted in many of the well-known cast members being on screen for only a brief period. John Travolta and George Clooney's appearances are little more than [[Cameo appearance|cameos]], yet Clooney's name appears prominently in the marketing of the movie. The unfinished film was screened for the New York press in December 1998 and [[Adrien Brody]] attended a screening to find that his originally significant role, \"to carry the movie\", as he put it, had been reduced to two lines and approximately five minutes of screen time.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Mottram\n | first = James\n | title = The Prime of Mr. Adrien Brody\n | work = [[The Independent]]\n | date = April 21, 2001\n }}</ref>\n\nMalick was upset that the studio screened his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping him in the editing room, shaping the final version.<ref name=\"Young\"/> Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film.

It was Hans Zimmer's fifth Oscar nomination as a composer, but he lost out to [[Roberto Benigni]]'s ''[[Life is Beautiful]]'' (music by [[Nicola Piovani]]). The album was released by [[RCA Victor]] and conducted by [[Gavin Greenaway]].
