Relocated to deep space, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by millions of species from thousands of planets. A police division is created by the United Human Federation to preserve peace throughout the galaxy. Among its staff are the arrogant [[Major]] [[Val\u00e9rian|Valerian]] and his partner, no-nonsense [[Sergeant]] [[Laureline]].\n\nEn route to a mission, Valerian dreams of a planet, M\u00fcl, where a low-tech [[humanoid]] race lives peacefully. They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy, and use animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, followed by a huge spacecraft that causes an [[Extinction event#Impact events|explosion]] annihilating every being on the planet. Some of the inhabitants enter a discarded vessel, accidentally trapping themselves inside, but the planet's princess Lih\u00f6-Minaa is stranded outside. Just before her death, she conveys a [[telepathic]] message.\n\nShaken, Valerian awakes. Analysis reveals he might have received a signal from across time and space. He learns that his mission is to retrieve a \"M\u00fcl converter\". It is the last of its kind, and currently in the hands of [[black market]] dealer Igon Siruss. Valerian asks Laureline to marry him, but she brushes him off.\n\nIn a marketplace on planet Kirian in an alternate dimension, Valerian disrupts a meeting between Igon and two hooded figures who resemble the humanoids from his vision. They seek the converter, the small animal in his vision. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter and steal one of the energy pearls. Aboard their ship, Valerian learns that M\u00fcl was destroyed 30 years earlier, and all information about it is classified.\n\nThey return to Alpha where commander Ar\u00fcn Filitt informs them the center of the station has been irradiated by an unknown force, rendering it highly toxic. Troops sent into the area have not returned, and the radiation is increasing. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit to discuss the crisis; against the commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.\n\nDuring the summit, unidentified humanoids suddenly attack, incapacitating everyone and kidnapping Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers to the irradiated area but crashes  his [[spaceplane]] during the pursuit. Laureline enlists alien information brokers known as Dogan Daguis to track Valerian, and finds him unconscious at the edge of the irradiated zone. She rouses him, but is kidnapped by a primitive tribe, the Boulan Bathors of the planet Goara, and presented at their emperor's dinner as the choice course. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of the shape-shifting Bubble. They rescue Laureline and escape, but Bubble is fatally wounded.\n\nValerian and Laureline venture further into the irradiated area, discover it is not dangerous, and that it contains the remains of some antique spacecraft. They reach a large shielded hall where they find the humanoids, known as the Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt. The Pearls' leader, Emperor Haban Lima\u00ef, explains that his people lived peacefully on M\u00fcl until a battle occurred between the Federation and another faction. Filitt, the human commander, ordered the use of [[Thermonuclear weapon|fusion missiles]] that disabled the enemy mothership and sent it crashing into the planet, annihilating M\u00fcl. Upon her passing, Princess Lih\u00f6-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body.\n\nWhen the surviving Pearls were trapped in a downed space vehicle from the battle, they managed to repair it and learned the humans' technology and history. They eventually came to Alpha, where they assimilated more knowledge and built a ship of their own. They needed the converter and pearl in order to launch their ship and find a planet to recreate their homeworld. Filitt admits his role in the genocide, but argues it was necessary to end the war\u2014as was the coverup, to prevent humans from losing their credibility and influence in Alpha. Valerian and Laureline disagree, arguing that the commander is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions. When Filitt becomes belligerent, Valerian knocks him out.\n\nValerian hands over the pearl he took from Igon, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter. While the Pearls prepare their spacecraft for takeoff, Filitt's K-Tron robot soldiers attack the Pearls and the government soldiers sent to assist Valerian, but are ultimately defeated. The spacecraft departs and Filitt is arrested. Valerian and Laureline are left adrift aboard an [[Apollo Command/Service Module]], and Laureline answers Valerian's marriage proposal with a \"maybe\" as they wait for rescue.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cara Delevingne, Dane DeHaan and Luc Besson.jpg|thumb|325px|[[Cara Delevingne|Delevingne]], [[Dane DeHaan|DeHaan]] and [[Luc Besson|Besson]] at the San Diego Comic-Con 2016 presentation of ''Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets'' at Camp Conival]]\n\n* [[Dane DeHaan]] as Valerian, a United Human Federation soldier and Laureline's partner/love interest<ref name=\"McNary\" />\n* [[Cara Delevingne]] as Laureline, a United Human Federation soldier and Valerian's partner/love interest<ref name=\"McNary\" />\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Ar\u00fcn Filitt, Valerian and Laureline's commander<ref name=\"McNary\" />\n* [[Rihanna]] as the human form of Bubble, a shapeshifting Glamopod entertainer.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\" />\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jolly the Pimp, Bubble's \"protector\".<ref name=\"McNary\" />\n* [[Herbie Hancock]] as Defence Minister<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\" />\n* [[Kris Wu]] as Sergeant Neza<ref name=\"Besson\">{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/lucbesson/status/676567785028214785|title= Excited to announce Kris Wu in @ValerianMovie!|first= Luc|last= Besson|date= 15 December 2015|access-date= 6 January 2016|work= [[Twitter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=eOne Films|title=Kris wu is sergeant neza. see him in action in luc besson's stunning sci-fi spectacle #valerian, july 20!|url=https://twitter.com/eOnefilms/status/869297365206937600|website=Twitter|access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as The President of the World State Federation\n* [[John Goodman]] as Igon Siruss {{small|(voice)}}, a Kodar'Khan pirate captain and the galaxy's most-wanted criminal<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2239822/mediaviewer/rm1913662976/|title=Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=23 September 2017|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* [[Elizabeth Debicki]] as Emperor Haban Lima\u00ef {{small|(voice)}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/valerian-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-elizabeth-debicki-voice-over/|title=Elizabeth Debicki Joins Valerian in Voice-Over Role|date=1 June 2017|website=Screenrant.com|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Sasha Luss]] as Princess Lih\u00f6-Minaa\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as General Okto Bar\n* [[Ola Rapace]] as Major Gibson\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as Bob the Pirate\n* Thom Findlay as The Pirates {{small|(voice)}}\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Camelot on Big Market\n* [[Jonas Bloquet]] as K-Tron Warrior/Control Room Soldier\n* [[Sand Van Roy]] as  Jessica Rabbit Creature\n* [[Louis Leterrier]] as Captain Welcoming Mercurys\n* [[Olivier Megaton]] as Captain Welcoming KCO2\n* Gavin Drea as Sergeant Cooper\n* Eric Lampaert as Guide Thaziit, a human guiding tourists in the Big Market\n* Claire Tran as Control room Sergeant\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAlthough Luc Besson loved the Valerian comics while growing up, he did not seriously consider adapting them into a movie until he was working on ''[[The Fifth Element]].''
