He reports that the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] will move [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], no longer under his mother's protective spell, to a safe location. Voldemort confiscates [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s wand; his own is powerless against Harry because it and Harry's wand are \"brothers\" by sharing the same phoenix feather core. During the move, Harry survives Voldemort's attack but Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig are killed.\n\nDuring preparations for [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s wedding, the new [[Minister for Magic]] arrives. He informs Harry, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] that [[Albus Dumbledore]] left each a bequest: Ron a [[Deluminator]], Hermione a copy of ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'', and Harry the [[Golden Snitch]] he caught in his first [[Quidditch]] match. Dumbledore had also bequeathed the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] to Harry, but it has gone missing.\n\nNews arrives during the wedding that the Ministry has fallen and the Minister is dead. Death Eaters attack and Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to [[Number 12, Grimmauld Place]]. While there, Ron realizes that Sirius' brother, Regulus Black, is the R.A.B. who stole [[Salazar Slytherin's locket]] from Voldemort. Local thief [[Mundungus Fletcher]] later sold it to [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Harry, Ron and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry and recover the locket but they are chased by Death Eaters in a chaotic exit. Hermione [[Apparate|disapparates]] them to a forest. Meanwhile, Ron is injured. The trio decide to start their journey to discover and destroy all of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, starting from the locket.\n\nAttempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor's sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry, then disapparates, leaving Harry and Hermione to continue their journey. When Harry touches the Snitch to his lips, it reveals a cryptic message: \"I open at the close.\" Hermione notices a strange symbol drawn in ''Beedle the Bard'' that is identical to one [[Luna Lovegood]]'s father [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] wears.\n\nHarry and Hermione search for the sword in [[Godric's Hollow]] and encounter the same strange symbol in a cemetery. Elderly historian [[Bathilda Bagshot]] invites them in her cottage, where they find a photo of the young man in Harry's dream who stole a wand from wandmaker [[Gregorovitch]]. Bathilda morphs into Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] and attacks Harry. Hermione disapparates them to safety, but her rebounding spell accidentally destroys Harry's wand. Hermione identifies the man in the photo as dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. That night, a doe [[Patronus Charm|patronus]] leads Harry to a frozen pond where Gryffindor's sword lies on the bottom. Harry dives into the frigid water, but the locket around his neck tightens, strangling him. Ron appears, retrieves the sword, and saves Harry. They destroy the locket Horcrux with the sword. Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location.\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione visits Xenophilius Lovegood and learn the symbol represents the [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]]. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the [[Resurrection Stone (Harry Potter)|Resurrection Stone]], the [[Cloak of Invisibility (Harry Potter)|Cloak of Invisibility]], and the [[Elder Wand]], the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them. During a vision, Harry sees an elderly Grindelwald telling Voldemort that the Elder Wand is buried with Dumbledore.\n\nAt [[Malfoy Manor]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] sees a Snatcher has Gryffindor's sword that she believed was in her [[Gringotts]] vault. Harry and Ron are locked into the cellar where they encounter Luna, [[Ollivander]], and [[Griphook]]. Upstairs, Bellatrix tortures Hermione. Harry begs for help using a mirror shard in which he believes he glimpsed Dumbledore; [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] appears in response and helps save everyone while Harry grabs their captured wands from [[Draco Malfoy]]. As they disapparate, Bellatrix throws a knife, killing Dobby. Harry buries him near Bill and Fleur's [[Places in Harry Potter#Shell Cottage|seaside cottage]], an Order safe house. Meanwhile, Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 17-year-old [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]].\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: A young wizard and one of Harry's best friends and ally.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: A young witch and one of Harry's closest friends and ally.\n* [[Bonnie Wright]] as [[Ginny Weasley]]: Ron's younger sister and Harry's love interest.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]: A [[Death Eater]], [[Sirius Black]]'s insane cousin and murderer, and the aunt of [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]].\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: Harry's half-giant friend, and [[gamekeeper]] at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Griphook]]: A [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank.
