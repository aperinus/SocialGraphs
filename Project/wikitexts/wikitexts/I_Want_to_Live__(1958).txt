It follows the life of [[Barbara Graham]], a [[prostitution|prostitute]] and habitual criminal who is convicted of murder and faces [[capital punishment]]. The screenplay, written by [[Nelson Gidding]] and [[Don Mankiewicz]], was adapted from personal letters written by Graham in addition to newspaper articles written by [[1951 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist [[Edward S. Montgomery|Ed Montgomery]]. The film presents a highly fictionalized version of the case, indicating the possibility that Graham may have been innocent.\n\nReleased in late 1958, ''I Want to Live!'' was a commercial and critical success, garnering favorable reviews from critics for Hayward's performance as well as the film's realistic depiction of capital punishment. The film earned a total of six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, with Hayward winning a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Oscar]] at the [[31st Academy Awards]] as well as the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|same category]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950 [[San Francisco]], petty criminal and [[prostitution|prostitute]] [[Barbara Graham]] faces a misdemeanor charge for soliciting sex. She returns to her native [[San Diego]], but is soon charged with [[perjury]] after she provides two criminal friends a false [[alibi]]. She subsequently returns to prostitution and other criminal activities to make a living and begins working for thief Emmett Perkins by luring men to his gambling parlor. Barbara manages to earn a significant amount of money, and quits working for Emmett to marry Hank, her third husband. The couple have a son, Bobby, but their marriage is in turmoil because of Hank's gambling addiction and physical abuse.\n\nBarbara forces Hank to leave, but she is soon evicted from her apartment. Desperate, she leaves Bobby in the care of her mother and returns to working for Emmett, who is now associated with thugs John Santo and Bruce King. Police crack down on the operation and Barbara surrenders. During the interrogation, she is stunned when authorities accuse her of helping Perkins and Santo murder Mabel Monahan, an elderly [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] woman. Barbara insists that she was home with her husband and son on the night of the murder but is indicted by a grand jury. Barbara's childhood friend Peg visits her in jail and agrees to help care for Bobby.\n\nAttorney Richard Tibrow is assigned to Barbara's case and informs her that her alibi is meaningless unless Hank can corroborate it. Barbara furtively concocts a phony alibi with Ben Miranda, supposedly a friend of a fellow prisoner. At the trial, it is revealed that Ben is a police officer who recorded her confession with a hidden microphone during their meeting. Barbara insists that she sought the false alibi only to avoid the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], and that her admission is false. She is ultimately convicted, along with Emmett and John, and all three are sentenced to death.\n\nTibrow withdraws from Barbara's case and is replaced by Al Matthews. In prison, Barbara is relentlessly defiant, refusing to wear her uniform and demanding a radio. Matthews has psychologist Carl Palmberg evaluate Barbara, hoping to ultimately administer a lie detection test. After visiting with her, Carl states that while Barbara appears to be [[amorality|amoral]], she is averse to violence. He also observes that she is left-handed, and the murder was committed by a right-handed person. Journalist [[Edward S. Montgomery|Edward Montgomery]], who has covered Barbara's case all along, questions her conviction and publishes a sympathetic series of articles describing her troubled life. As her execution date draws near, Barbara grows increasingly anxious. A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Stay of execution|stay]] gives her hope that her sentence may be commuted, but it is overturned when Carl dies unexpectedly of heart disease. Al's petition for a retrial is denied, and Barbara's execution date is set.\n\nThe day before her execution, a demoralized Barbara is transferred to [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin Prison]], where she meets with a priest. That evening, she is angered to hear that multiple couples are seeking to adopt her son. She stays awake all night, wistfully recounting her marriage with Hank to a prison nurse. In the morning, 45 minutes before Barbara's scheduled execution, [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Goodwin J. Knight]] declares a stay, but Al's [[writ]] is invalidated and the execution is ordered to proceed. Barbara is taken to the [[gas chamber]], but the execution is again halted when Al's amended writ is declared.\n\nThe uncertainty and desperation surrounding her fate reduces Barbara to hysterics. She is returned to her cell, where she and the prison staff wait several minutes for a response to Al's writ. They are informed that it has again been rejected and that Barbara's execution is to proceed immediately. Before entering the gas chamber, Barbara demands a mask, as she does not want to see the faces of the witnesses to her murder. She is strapped to the chair and executed with [[Hydrogen cyanide|cyanide gas]]. After Barbara is pronounced dead, a despondent Edward leaves the prison. On his way out, he is met by Al, who gives him a note from Barbara thanking him for his efforts to help her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Susan Hayward]] as [[Barbara Graham]]\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as [[Edward S.
