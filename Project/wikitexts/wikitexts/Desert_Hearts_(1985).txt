Set in [[Reno, Nevada]] in 1959, it tells the story of a university professor awaiting a divorce who finds her true self through a relationship with another, more self-confident woman. The film stars [[Helen Shaver]] and [[Patricia Charbonneau]] with a supporting performance by [[Audra Lindley]].\n\n''Desert Hearts'' was [[Film release|released]] theatrically in the United States on March 7, 1986<ref name=BOM /> and in the United Kingdom on June 6, 1986.<ref name=BBFC /> It is regarded as one of the first [[wide release]] films to present a positive portrayal of lesbian [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, Vivian Bell, a 35-year-old English professor at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, travels to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] to establish residency in Nevada (a process that takes six weeks), in order to obtain a quick divorce. She stays at a guest house ranch for women who are waiting for their divorces to be finalized. The ranch is owned by Frances Parker.\n\nSoon after her arrival in Reno, Vivian meets Cay Rivers, a young, free-spirited sculptor. Frances was the longtime mistress of Cay's late father, Glenn, and raised Cay after her biological mother (Glenn's wife) abandoned her. Cay is employed as a change operator at a casino in Reno, and is ending a relationship with Darrell, her controlling boss, saying that she was \"attracted to his attraction\" to her. When Vivian arrives, Cay takes an immediate interest in her; the proper, elegant Vivian is taken aback by Cay's lack of concern for what others think of her, as Cay has had relationships with women in the past. Frances, dismayed by Cay's lesbianism but frightened by the possibility of Cay leaving her alone, becomes resentful as Cay and Vivian grow closer.\n\nAfter they attend an engagement party for Silver, Cay's best friend and co-worker, Cay takes a mildly inebriated Vivian to see [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] at twilight and kisses her. Vivian returns the kiss passionately, but then becomes apprehensive and asks Cay to take her home. When they return to the ranch early the next morning, Frances angrily kicks Vivian out and accuses her of seducing Cay. Deeply hurt, Cay leaves the ranch immediately as Vivian transfers to a hotel near the casino for the rest of her stay.\n\nLater, Cay arrives at Vivian's hotel room, where they initially clash but ultimately consummate their love after Cay removes her clothes and invites Vivian to bed. With the impending finalization of Vivian's divorce, the two struggle with the future of their relationship. At Silver's wedding, Cay attempts to reconcile with Frances, stating that Vivian \"just reached in and put a string of lights around my heart,\" directly quoting Frances's own description of how she fell in love with Glenn.\n\nAfter Vivian's divorce has become finalized, she packs up and boards a train to return to New York City. Cay still refuses to commit to leaving Nevada, but boards the train at the last minute as it begins to move away, agreeing to accompany Vivian until they reach the next station.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Vivian Bell\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Cay Rivers\n* [[Audra Lindley]] as Frances Parker\n* [[Andra Akers]] as Silver\n* [[Gwen Welles]] as Gwen\n* [[Dean Butler (actor)|Dean Butler]] as Darrell\n* James Staley as Art Warner\n* Katie La Bourdette as Lucille\n* [[Alex McArthur]] as Walter\n* Tyler Tyhurst as Buck\n* [[Denise Crosby]] as Pat\n* [[Antony Ponzini]] as Joe\n}}\n\n==Development and production==\n''Desert Hearts'' is loosely based on the 1964 romance novel ''[[Desert of the Heart]]'' by [[Jane Rule]].{{efn|The novel's story mirrored Rule's life, as she met and fell in love with an older married woman, Helen Sonthoff, a creative writing and literature teacher at [[Concord Academy]] in Massachusetts.<ref name=martin />}} In 1979, Donna Deitch was searching for a story about a lesbian romance that \"was mainstream, not in the context of the women's community or (New York's) the Village.\"<ref name=gambling>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Ed|title=Gambling in the Desert, Then and Now|url=https://archive.org/details/bodypolitic120toro|publisher=[[The Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]|pages=35\u201336|date=November 1985|access-date=February 8, 2017}}</ref> The first draft of the screenplay, written by Deitch, followed the original story, but when Natalie Cooper was hired as the screenwriter she veered away from it. The names of the main characters were changed: Evelyn Hall became Vivian Bell and Ann Childs became Cay Rivers. Other characters were minimized or excluded, subplots were eliminated, and the love scene was made explicit. Jane Rule described the film as \"beautifully simplified\".<ref name=gambling />\n\nDeitch raised the $1.5 million needed for the production budget with a $20,000 grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and sales of $15,000 shares to stock brokers and individual investors. The largest group of investors were lesbian and [[Feminism|feminist]] women in several cities of the U.S., and the largest single investor was a gay man. She gave fundraising parties and published a regular newsletter to keep investors informed about the project's development. Raising funds took almost four years.
