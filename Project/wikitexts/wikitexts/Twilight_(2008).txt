Directed by [[Catherine Hardwicke]], the film stars [[Kristen Stewart]] and [[Robert Pattinson]]. It is the first film in [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|''The Twilight Saga'' film series]]. This film focuses on the development of the relationship between [[Bella Swan]] (a teenage girl) and [[Edward Cullen]] (a [[vampire]]), and the subsequent efforts of Edward and his family to keep Bella safe from a [[coven]] of evil vampires.\n\nThe project was in development for approximately three years at [[Paramount Pictures]], during which time a [[film adaptation|screen adaptation]] that differed significantly from the novel was written. [[Summit Entertainment]] acquired the rights to the novel after three years of the project's [[development hell|stagnant development]]. [[Melissa Rosenberg]] wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]] and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline.

Her mother, Ren\u00e9e, is remarried to Phil, a [[minor league baseball]] player whose career often keeps them on the road.\n\nBella becomes re-acquainted with [[Jacob Black]], a Native American teen who lives with his father, Billy, on the [[Quileute|Quileute Indian Reservation]] near Forks. She makes friends at her new high school, but finds the mysterious and [[Shyness|aloof]] Cullen siblings particularly intriguing. Bella is seated next to [[Edward Cullen]] in [[biology]] class on her first day, but he seems repulsed by her. After a week's absence from school, Edward returns and socializes normally with Bella. A few days later, she is nearly struck by a skidding van in the school parking lot. Edward instantaneously covers a distance of over thirty feet, putting himself between Bella and the van, stopping it with only his hand. He subsequently refuses to explain his actions to her, warning her against befriending him. Jacob tells Bella about a long-standing animosity between the Cullens and the Quileutes, and says the Cullens are not allowed on the reservation.\n\nEdward appears out of nowhere and saves Bella a second time. After much research, Bella concludes that Edward has mysterious powers that resemble a vampire's. He eventually confirms this, but says that he and the other Cullens only consume animal blood. They fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. [[Carlisle Cullen]], the family patriarch, is a doctor at the Forks hospital. [[Esme Cullen|Esme]] is Carlisle's wife and the family matriarch. [[Alice Cullen (Twilight character)|Alice]], [[Jasper Hale|Jasper]], [[Emmett Cullen|Emmett]], and [[Rosalie Hale|Rosalie]] are their informally-adopted children. The family's reaction to Bella is mixed, concerned that the family's secret could be exposed.\n\nEdward and Bella's relationship is jeopardized when three nomadic vampires\u2014[[James (Twilight)|James]], [[Victoria (Twilight)|Victoria]], and [[Laurent (Twilight)|Laurent]]\u2014arrive in the Forks area, and are responsible for a series of deaths being investigated as animal attacks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is excited by Bella's scent and becomes obsessed with hunting her for sport. Edward and the other Cullens protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice.\n\nJames lures Bella into a trap at an old ballet studio. He attacks her, infecting her with vampire venom. Edward arrives and, after a ferocious battle, subdues James just as other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and Jasper kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her becoming a vampire. In the aftermath, she has suffered a broken leg and is hospitalized. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school [[prom]], where he refuses her request to transform her into a vampire. They are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching them, plotting revenge for her lover's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Twilight cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Bella Swan]], a seventeen-year-old girl who moves to the small town of Forks, Washington from [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and falls in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire.
