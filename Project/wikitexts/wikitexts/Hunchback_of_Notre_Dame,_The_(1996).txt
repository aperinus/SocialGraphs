It is the 34th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the seventh produced during the [[Disney Renaissance]]. The film is loosely based on the 1831 novel [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|of the same name]] by [[Victor Hugo]]. The plot centers on [[Quasimodo]], the deformed and confined bell-ringer of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], and his yearning to explore the outside world and be accepted by society, against the wishes of his cruel, puritanical foster father [[Claude Frollo (Disney adaptation)|Claude Frollo]], who also wants to exterminate Paris' [[Romani people|Romani population]]. The film's voice cast features [[Tom Hulce]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Tony Jay]] and [[Kevin Kline]].\n\nThe film is considered to be one of Disney's darkest animated films due to its mature subject matter such as [[infanticide]], [[lust]], [[damnation]], [[antiziganism]], [[genocide]], and [[sin]], despite the changes made from the original source material in order to ensure a [[Motion picture content rating system|G rating]] from the [[MPAA]]. The musical score was written by [[Alan Menken]], with songs written by Menken and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had previously collaborated on ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). The pair later also collaborated on 2007's ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]''.\n\n''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' was released on June 21, 1996, to generally positive reviews. It was a commercial success, grossing over $325&nbsp;million worldwide and becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 1996. The film received [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for its musical score. A [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (musical)|stage adaptation]] of the film was produced by [[Disney Theatrical Productions|Walt Disney Theatrical]] in 1999. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', was released in 2002.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->[[File:Paris Notre-Dame East View 02.JPG|left|thumb|The eastern view of the Cathedral [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], France.]]\nThe story is narrated by [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]], a [[Romani people in France|Romani]] puppeteer, to a group of children.\n\nA group of Roma immigrating to [[Paris]] were ambushed by [[Claude Frollo|Judge Claude Frollo]], Paris' Ministry of Justice, and his soldiers. One woman attempted to flee with her baby, reaching the doors of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] pleading for [[Sanctuary#Sanctuary as a sacred place|sanctuary]]. Frollo chased her down and knocked her onto the cathedral's steps, where she fractured her skull and died. Seeing her baby's appearance, Frollo believed it to be a [[demon]] and went to drown the child but was interrupted by the [[archdeacon]], who rebuked Frollo for murdering an innocent woman. Afraid for his soul, Frollo reluctantly agreed to raise the child as his own, naming him \"[[Quasimodo]]\" (meaning 'half-formed') and hiding him away in the cathedral's [[bell tower]].\n\nTwenty years later, Quasimodo has grown into a kind yet isolated young man, now with a pronounced [[Kyphosis|hunchback]] caused by [[kyphosis]]. He has lived his entire life in the cathedral with his only company being a trio of living stone [[Gargoyle (monster)|gargoyles]] Victor, Hugo, and Laverne. The gargoyles encourage him to attend the annual [[Feast of Fools|Festival of Fools]], despite Frollo's warnings that he would be shunned for his appearance. Quasimodo attends and is celebrated for his appearance but then, prompted by Frollo's guards, is humiliated by the crowd. Frollo refuses Quasimodo's pleas for help, but he is rescued by [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]], a kind Traveller. Frollo, who intends to commit genocide against Romani people living in Paris, orders her arrest but Esmeralda escapes using a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]].\n\nQuasimodo retreats back into the cathedral, followed by Esmeralda and [[Captain Phoebus]] of Frollo's guard. Phoebus refuses to arrest her for [[witchcraft]] inside Notre Dame and instead tells Frollo that she has claimed [[Sanctuary|asylum]]. Esmeralda finds and befriends Quasimodo, who helps her escape Notre Dame out of gratitude for defending him. She entrusts Quasimodo with a pendant containing a map to the Roma hideout called the [[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]]. Frollo develops an obsessive lust for Esmeralda and, upon realizing them, begs the [[Virgin Mary]] to save him from her \"[[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]\" and avoid eternal [[damnation]].\n\nWhen Frollo discovers that Esmeralda escaped, he searches for her, [[bribing]] and arresting Travellers and [[Arson|setting fire to]] houses trying to find her. Phoebus defies Frollo when ordered to burn down a house with a family inside and Frollo orders him executed. Phoebus flees but is struck by an arrow and falls into the [[River Seine]], where he is found by Esmeralda and taken to Notre Dame for refuge. The gargoyles encourage Quasimodo to confess his feelings for Esmeralda, but he is heartbroken to discover she and Phoebus have fallen in love. Realizing that Quasimodo helped Esmeralda escape, Frollo tells him he knows about the Court of Miracles and plans to attack it at dawn. Using the map Esmeralda gave him, Quasimodo and Phoebus find the court to warn the Roma, only for Frollo to follow them and capture all the Travellers present.\n\nWhen Esmeralda again rejects Frollo's advances, he attempts to burn her at the stake at [[Parvis Notre-Dame \u2013 Place Jean-Paul II|Place du Parvis]], but Quasimodo swoops down and carries her to the cathedral tower, crying \"Sanctuary!\" from the ledge. When Frollo attempts to seize the cathedral, Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead onto the streets to prevent anyone entering. Phoebus releases the Roma and rallies the Paris citizens against Frollo's guards while Frollo himself breaks into the cathedral. Violating the tradition of sanctuary, he pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the bell tower with the intent of killing them both. He and Quasimodo fight, eventually both falling from a ledge. Frollo plummets to his death in the molten lead while Quasimodo is saved by Phoebus. Quasimodo accepts Phoebus and Esmeralda's love and they encourage him to leave the cathedral; when he does so, the people of Paris hail him as a hero.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as [[Quasimodo]]\n* [[Demi Moore]] as [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]] (singing voice by Heidi Mollenhauer)\n* [[Tony Jay]] as [[Judge Claude Frollo]]\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as [[Captain Phoebus]] \n* [[Paul Kandel]] as [[Clopin Trouillefou]]\n* [[Charles Kimbrough]], [[Jason Alexander]], and [[Mary Wickes]] as Victor, Hugo, and Laverne respectively. This was Wickes' final acting performance as she died a year before its release, at age 85. [[Jane Withers]] provided Laverne's remaining dialogue for the film.\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as the [[Archdeacon]]\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea to adapt ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' came from development executive [[David Stainton]] in 1993, who was inspired to turn Victor Hugo's novel ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' into an animated feature film after reading the [[Classics Illustrated]] comic book adaptation.{{sfn|Robello|1996|p=44}} Stainton then proposed the idea to then-studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]. After the release of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), [[Gary Trousdale]] had taken a sabbatical break from directing, instead spending several months developing storyboards for ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994).<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/disney-signs-up-more-toon-talent-99129197/ | title=Disney Signs Up More Toon Talent | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November 5, 1995 | access-date=November 30, 2014 | archive-date=December 26, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226055354/http://variety.com/1995/film/features/disney-signs-up-more-toon-talent-99129197/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Following this, Trousdale and [[Kirk Wise]] subsequently developed an animated feature based on the Greek myth of ''[[Orpheus and Eurydice]]'' titled ''A Song of the Sea'', adapting it to make the central character a humpback whale and setting it in the open ocean.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/194360%7C0/Gary-Trousdale/milestones.html | title=Milestones for Gary Trousdale | access-date=November 30, 2014 | website=[[Turner Classic Movies]] | archive-date=December 18, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218054216/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/194360%7C0/Gary-Trousdale/milestones.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Gary Trousdale]] |date=October 23, 2012 |access-date=February 16, 2015 |title=TAGInterview GaryTrousdale 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Sm0kIBw2ok&t=4m1s |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> While they were working on the project they were summoned to meet with Katzenberg. \"During that time,\" explained Trousdale, \"while we working on it, we got a call from Jeffrey.

The production crew also visited the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]] and an original location of the [[Cour des miracles|Court of Miracles]].{{sfn|Robello|1996|p=98}}\n\n=== Writing ===\n{{Quote box|width =33%|quote=\"We knew it would be a challenge to stay true to the material while still giving it the requisite amount of fantasy and fun most people would expect from a Disney animated feature.

In the early drafts, Quasimodo served as a [[Cyrano de Bergerac|Cyrano]] between Phoebus and Esmeralda, but it was discarded to focus more on Quasimodo.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-16/entertainment/ca-15443_1_quasi-original | title=A Quasi Original | last=Clark | first=John | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 16, 1996 | access-date=November 30, 2014 | archive-date=December 22, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222021604/http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-16/entertainment/ca-15443_1_quasi-original | url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, a love story between Quasimodo and Esmeralda was also conceived, according to Murphy, but \"we decided to make [[Captain Phoebus|Phoebus]] more heroic and central to the story. Out of that decision grew the idea of some sort of a triangle between Quasimodo, Esmeralda and Phoebus.\"<ref name=\"Dretzka\" /> Some of the novel's key characters were jettisoned entirely. The gargoyles of Notre Dame were added to the story by Trousdale and Wise. Their portrayal as comedic friends and confidantes of Quasimodo was inspired by a portion of the novel, which reads: \"The other statues, the ones of monsters and demons, felt no hatred for Quasimodo\u2026The saints were his friends and blessed him; the monsters were his friends, and protected him. Thus he would pour out his heart at length to them.\"{{sfn|Robello|1996|p=132}}<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-07-03/lifestyle/9607010647_1_gargoyles-hunchback-crotchety | title=Holy Medieval Icon!

Following Stephen Schwartz's suggestion to musicalize the sequence, French animators [[Paul and Ga\u00ebtan Brizzi]] storyboarded the sequence to Menken and Schwartz's music resulting in \"The Bells of Notre Dame.\"<ref name=\"Norman\" /> Lyricist Stephen Schwartz also worked closely with the writing team even suggesting that the audience should be left wondering what the outcome of what Phoebus would do before he extinguishes the torch in water in retaliation against Frollo.{{sfn|Laird|2014|p=240}} Another was the film's conclusion. While Frollo's death was made more explicit, Quasimodo and Esmeralda were both spared their fates and given a happy ending. This revised ending was based in part on Victor Hugo's own libretto to a ''Hunchback'' opera, in which he had permitted Captain Phoebus to save Esmeralda from her execution.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn late 1993, pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] was the first actor cast during the film's initial stages. She had been hired one week after reading for a part with the directors, who felt her performance was \"hilarious and sweet\". Thinking she had been cast as Esmeralda, Lauper was startled to learn she was to voice a gargoyle named Quinn.<ref name=\"Gargoyles\">{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608202849/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115030-115030.asp | url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID115030.asp | title=Getting the Gargoyles right proves to be a gruesome go... | last=Hill | first=Jim | website=The Laughing Place | date=April 5, 2001 | archive-date=June 8, 2003 | access-date=November 30, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"OralHistory\">{{cite web |last=Spiegel |first=Josh |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/hunchback-of-notre-dame-oral-history/ |title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame' at 25: An Oral History of Disney's Darkest Animated Classic |website=/Film |date=June 21, 2021 |access-date=June 21, 2021 |archive-date=June 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621134030/https://www.slashfilm.com/hunchback-of-notre-dame-oral-history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The development team had came up with the names of Chaney, Laughton and Quinn\u2014named after the actors who portrayed Quasimodo in preceding ''Hunchback'' film adaptations. However, Disney's legal department objected to the proposed names of the gargoyles, fearing that the estates of [[Lon Chaney]], [[Charles Laughton]], or [[Anthony Quinn]] (who was still alive at the time) would file a lawsuit over the unauthorized use of their names, so the idea was dropped.<ref name=\"Gargoyles\" /> Trousdale and Wise then suggested naming the characters Lon, Charles, and Anthony, which would have resulted in the same legal concern. Instead, they would name the first two gargoyles after Victor Hugo, and the third gargoyle after [[Andrews Sisters]] singer [[Laverne Andrews]] as suggested by Wise.<ref name=\"Gargoyles\" />\n\nNow cast as Laverne, Lauper was deemed too youthful for a friend who would provide wise counsel to Quasimodo.

''The Gospel According to Disney'' includes a quote that says \"religion... appears as an impotent, irrelevant caricature [and] Disney refuses to admit a serious role for religion.\" At one point, the archdeacon says to Esmeralda, \"You can't right all the wrongs of this world by yourself... perhaps there is someone in here who can,\" referring either to God or Mary.
