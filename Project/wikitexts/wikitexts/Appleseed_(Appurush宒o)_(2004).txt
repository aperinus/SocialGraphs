It features the voice acting of [[Ai Kobayashi]], [[J\u016br\u014dta Kosugi]], [[Mami Koyama]], [[Yuki Matsuoka]], and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]. The film tells the story of Deunan Knute, a former soldier, who searches for data that can restore the reproductive capabilities of bioroids, a race of genetically engineered clones. Although it shares characters and settings with the original manga, this film's storyline is a re-interpretation, not a true adaptation. This ''Appleseed'' film should not be confused with the [[Appleseed (1988 film)|1988 OVA]] which was also inspired by the manga. ''Appleseed'' was released on April 18, 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Plot summaries in feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (film)#Plot. Please refrain from adding unnecessary detail.-->\nDeunan Knute, a young soldier and one of the [[World War III|Global War]]'s last survivors, is rescued by Hitomi, a Second Generation Bioroid. Knute's escape attempt is stopped by her former lover [[Briareos Hecatonchires]], now a [[cyborg]]. She realizes that the war had ended and she is in a [[Utopia]]n city called Olympus. Its population is half-human and half-[[Cloning|clone]], a genetically-engineered species called [[Biorobotics|Bioroid]]s. Olympus is governed by three factions: Prime Minister Athena Areios; General Edward Uranus III, head of the Olympus Army; and a Council of Elders. Everything in the city is observed by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Gaia from a building called Tartaros. While there, Deunan joins the counter-terrorism organization ESWAT.\n\nThe Bioroids were created from the [[DNA]] of Deunan's late father, Carl, making the Second Generation Bioroids her brothers and sisters. However, they have a much shorter lifespan than humans due to suppressed reproductive capabilities. The Bioroid's life extension facilities are destroyed by a secret faction of the Regular Army in a terrorist attack against the Bioroids. However, the Appleseed data, which contains information on restoring the Bioroids reproduction capabilities, still exists.\n\nOlympus is plagued by conflicting factions. Along with a strike force, Deunan and Briareos head to the building where the Bioroids were originally created. She activates a [[holographic]] recording showing the location of the Appleseed data. Dr. Gilliam Knute, who created the Bioroids and revealed to be Deunan's mother, entrusted Appleseed to Deunan, but was inadvertently killed by a soldier. After mourning her death, Leyton turns against his men. They then get cornered by the Regular Army. Deunan discovers from anti-Bioroid terrorist Colonel Hades that Briareos had intentionally allowed his Landmate, a large [[Powered armor|exoskeleton-like battlesuit]], to escape. Kudoh then sacrifices himself to get Deunan and Briareos out of harm's way and escape to the rooftop. Uranus attempts to convince Deunan that Bioroids seek to control humanity, and he wants to destroy Appleseed and the D-Tank containing the Bioroid reproductive activation mechanism. Briareos tells Uranus that the Elders manipulated the Army into wanting to destroy the D-Tank, but Athena is trying to prevent them from doing so and protect humanity. Hades, who resents Carl, wounds Briareos. She and Briareos flee into the sea, killing Hades in the process. Despite Deunan's pleas not to leave Briareos behind, he persuades her to search for the Elders. Mechanic Yoshitsune Miyamoto arrives in his Landmate and begins repairing Briareos after receiving an SOS from him. Deunan flies back to Olympus in Yoshitsune's Landmate and uses the Appleseed data to fully restore Bioroid reproductive functions.\n\nAs Deunan encounters the Council of Elders, they reveal their involvement in Gilliam's death and also plan to use the D-tank virus to sterilize humans, which will leave the Bioroids the new rulers of Earth. They needed the Appleseed data to keep the Bioroids alive, but Gilliam hid the data so they could not move forward with their plan. Athena, stepping in to stop them and announcing that Uranus has surrendered, tells Deunan that the Elders had been acting on their own and had shut Gaia down once they realized humanity had softened their stance against Bioroids. The Elders state that they will soon die since Gaia kept them alive, but that they were ready to sacrifice themselves. They then activate the city's mobile fortress defenses, which begin marching towards Tartaros. Athena states that D-tank's security system is nearly impenetrable, but a shot from the fortresses' main cannons might puncture the tank, releasing the virus. ESWAT begins mobilizing, but suffer heavy casualties due to the fortresses' heavy weaponry.\n\nBriareos arrives and asks Deunan to join the battle. Despite the Elders' objections, she goes with him to the seventh tower, and attempts to enter the password to shut the defenses down, but a malfunction makes it difficult. The final password letter appears by itself, and Deunan secures the D-Tank, shutting down the towers. She reveals that the sins of humanity will probably get worse, but that there is always the chance that future generations will learn from these mistakes; she vows to keep fighting for the children.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Role\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n!<small>[[Animaze]] (2005)</small>\n!<small>[[Seraphim Digital]] (2010)</small>\n|-\n!Deunan Knute\n|[[Ai Kobayashi]]\n|[[Jessica Straus]]\n|[[Luci Christian]]\n|-\n!Briareos Hecatonchires\n|[[J\u016br\u014dta Kosugi|Juurouta Kosugi]]\n|[[Jamieson Price]]\n|[[David Matranga]]\n|-\n!Athena Areios\n|[[Mami Koyama]]\n|[[Carolyn Hennesy]]\n|[[Allison Sumrall]]\n|-\n!Nike\n|[[Miho Yamada]]\n|[[Cindy Robinson]]\n|[[Shelley Calene-Black]]\n|-\n!Hitomi\n|[[Yuki Matsuoka]]\n|[[Karen Strassman]]\n|[[Hilary Haag]]\n|-\n!Yoshitsune Miyamoto\n|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]\n|[[Dave Wittenberg]]\n|[[Chris Patton]]\n|-\n!Edward Uranus III\n|[[Yuzuru Fujimoto]]\n|[[Michael McConnohie]]\n|[[Jason Douglas]]\n|-\n!Colonel Hades\n|[[Takehito Koyasu]]\n|[[Skip Stellrecht]]\n|Andrew Love\n|-\n!Kudou\n|Tadahisa Saizen\n|[[Skip Stellrecht]]\n|Kalob Martinez\n|-\n!Dr. Gilliam Knute\n|[[Emi Shinohara]]\n|[[Karen Strassman]]\n|Kara Greenberg\n|-\n!Seven Elders\n|Fumio Matsuoka\nHirotake Nagata\n\n[[Ikuo Nishikawa]]\n\nRyuuji Nakagi\n\nTakehiro Koyama\n\nToshihiko Kuwagai\n\nYoshiyuki Kaneko\n|[[Doug Stone (voice actor)|Doug Stone]]\n[[Kim Strauss]]\n\n[[Michael Forest]]\n\n[[Michael Sorich]]\n\n[[Mike Reynolds (actor)|Mike Reynolds]]\n\n[[William Bassett (actor)|William Bassett]]\n\n[[William Frederick Knight|William Knight]]\n|[[Andy McAvin]]\n[[Christopher Ayres]]\n\n[[John Gremillion]]\n\nMarty Fleck\n\nStefan Craig\n\nT.
