It is written by [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]], who adapted [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1908 novel ''[[A Room with a View]]''. Set in England and Italy, it is about a young woman named Lucy Honeychurch ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) in the final throes of the restrictive and repressed culture of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian England]], and her developing love for a free-spirited young man, George Emerson ([[Julian Sands]]). [[Maggie Smith]], [[Denholm Elliott]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Judi Dench]] and [[Simon Callow]] feature in supporting roles. The film closely follows the novel by use of chapter titles to distinguish thematic segments.\n\n''A Room with a View'' received universal critical acclaim and was a box-office success. At the [[59th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), and won three: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It also won five [[British Academy Film Awards]] and a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]]. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] placed ''A Room with a View'' 73rd on its list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|top 100 British films]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1907, a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), and her spinster cousin and [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], Charlotte Bartlett ([[Maggie Smith]]), stay at the Pensione Bertolini while on holiday in [[Florence]]. They are disappointed their rooms lack a view of the [[Arno]] as promised. At dinner, they meet other English guests: the [[Reverend]] Mr Beebe ([[Simon Callow]]), two elderly spinster sisters, the Misses Alan ([[Fabia Drake]] and [[Joan Henley]]), the romance author Eleanor Lavish ([[Judi Dench]]), and the freethinking Mr. Emerson ([[Denholm Elliott]]) and his handsome philosophical son, George ([[Julian Sands]]).\n\nLearning about Charlotte and Lucy's view predicament, Mr. Emerson and George offer to exchange rooms, though Charlotte considers the suggestion indelicate. Mr Beebe mediates, and the switch is made. While touring the Piazza della Signoria the next day, Lucy witnesses a local man being brutally stabbed. She faints but George Emerson appears and comes to her aid. When Lucy has recovered, the two have a personal discussion before returning to the pensione.\n\nLater, Charlotte, Lucy, and the Emersons join other British tourists for a day trip to the [[Fiesole]] countryside. Charlotte and Eleanor Lavish engage in conversation considered \"unsuitable\" for young ladies, so Lucy goes looking for Mr. Beebe. Instead, the Italian driver mistakenly leads her to where George is admiring the view from a hillside. Seeing Lucy, he suddenly embraces and passionately kisses her. Charlotte appears and intervenes. Worried that Lucy's mother will consider her an inadequate chaperone, Charlotte swears Lucy to secrecy and cuts their trip short.\n\nUpon returning to [[Surrey]] in [[England]], Lucy says nothing to her mother about the incident and pretends to forget it. She is soon engaged to Cecil Vyse ([[Daniel Day-Lewis]]), a wealthy and socially prominent man who is snobbish and pretentious. Cecil loves Lucy but he and his mother consider the Honeychurch family as their inferiors, dismaying Mrs Honeychurch. Lucy soon learns that Mr. Emerson is moving into Sir Harry Otway's rental cottage, with George visiting on weekends. Lucy intended for the two Misses Alan to live there and is cross with Cecil upon learning that through a chance meeting with the Emersons in London, Cecil recommended the cottage to them. He proclaims his motive was to annoy Sir Harry, who Cecil considers a snob; he believes Harry will find the Emersons to be \"too common.\"\n\nGeorge's presence upends Lucy's life, and her suppressed feelings for him surface. Meanwhile, Lucy's brother, Freddy ([[Rupert Graves]]), has become friends with George. Freddy invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner, the Honeychurch home, during which Cecil mockingly reads aloud from Miss Lavish's latest novel set in Italy. Cecil, still reading, is oblivious when George passionately kisses Lucy in the garden. As Cecil continues reading aloud, Lucy recognizes a scene as being identical to her encounter with George in Fiesole. She confronts Charlotte, who admits to telling Miss Lavish, who used it in her story. Lucy orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. He says that Cecil sees her only as a possession and will never love her for herself, as he would. Lucy seems unmoved, but soon after ends her engagement to Cecil, saying they are incompatible. To escape the ensuing fallout, she arranges to travel to Greece with the Misses Alan. George, unable to be around Lucy, arranges for his father to move to London, unaware Lucy is no longer engaged. When Lucy stops by Mr. Beebe's home to fetch Charlotte, she is confronted by Mr. Emerson, who happens to be there. She finally realizes her true feelings for George. At the end, newlyweds George and Lucy honeymoon at the Italian pensione where they met, in the room with a view, overlooking Florence's Duomo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Lucy Honeychurch\n*[[Julian Sands]] as George Emerson\n*[[Maggie Smith]] as Charlotte Bartlett\n*[[Denholm Elliott]] as Mr. Emerson\n*[[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Cecil Vyse\n*[[Simon Callow]] as The Reverend Mr. Beebe\n*[[Rosemary Leach]] as Mrs Honeychurch, Lucy's mother\n*[[Rupert Graves]] as Freddy Honeychurch, Lucy's brother\n*[[Patrick Godfrey]] as The Reverend Mr. Eager \n*[[Judi Dench]] as Eleanor Lavish, a novelist\n*[[Fabia Drake]] as Miss Catharine Alan\n*[[Joan Henley]] as Miss Teresa Alan\n*[[Amanda Walker]] as Cockney Signora, pension owner\n*[[Maria Britneva]] as Mrs Vyse, Cecil's mother\n*Mia Fothergill as Minnie Beebe\n*[[Peter Cellier]] as Sir Harry Otway, a landlord\n}}\n\n===Background===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2022}}\n[[E. M. Forster]] began to write ''A Room with a View'' during a trip to [[Italy]] in the winter of 1901\u201302 when he was twenty-two. It was the first novel he worked on; however, he put it away before returning to it a few years later. Forster finished first two other novels: ''[[Where Angels Fear to Tread]]'' (1905) and then ''[[The Longest Journey (novel)|The Longest Journey]]'' (1907). ''A Room with a View'' was finally published in 1908. Set in Italy and England, ''A Room with a View'' follows Lucy Honeychurch, a proper young Englishwoman who discovers passion while on a trip to Italy. At her return to the restrained culture of Edwardian-era England, she must choose between two opposite men: the free-thinking George Emerson and the repressed aesthete Cecil Vyse. The story is both a romance and a humorous critique of English society at the beginning of the 20th century. The novel, Forster's third, was very well received, better than his previous two, but it is considered lighter than his two best-regarded later works ''[[Howards End]]'' (1910) and ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924). In Forster's own appreciation \"''A Room with a View,'' may not be his best, but may very well be his nicest\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantivory.com/film/aroomwithaview|title=A Room With a View|website=merchantivory.com|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{copypaste|section|url=https://merchantivory.com/film/aroomwithaview|date=May 2022}}\nForster's early draft of the novel, entitled ''Lucy'', has the triangle of Lucy, Miss Bartlett, and a shadowy George Emerson already in place, as well as the two Miss Alans and the novelist, Miss Lavish. In these first notes, the story begins in the Pensione Bertolini in [[Florence]] but breaks off before the return to England, and its various sketchy episodes bear little resemblance to the finished work. In 1903, Forster went on with his novel, and now Cecil Vyse makes his appearance, as well as old Mr. Emerson, Reverend Beebe, and Lucy's mother and brother Freddy. The action, commencing in Italy as before, is carried forward to England, but the plot was unresolved when Forster laid the novel away for the second time. In this version, the story ended with George riding his bicycle into a tree during a storm.\nThese early drafts have been published by [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]] in ''The Lucy Novels'' (1977), edited by Oliver Stallybrass. In it, one may follow to some extent the development of the novel. He liked, too, the character of Lucy Honeychurch and, somewhat dyspeptically comparing her with the women in ''Howards End'' (1910), counting her as one of his few successes. The character of Lucy anticipates that of Adela Quested in ''A Passage To India'', published in 1924. Both women seem to be fighting their own best natures, to be hysterically turning away from any kind of honest introspection, and at a crucial point in the story, to be embarking on an enterprise which will plunge them and everyone who loves them into misery.\nThe ''Lucy Novels'' also contain some bits that were used in the film, not in the published novel. The scene between Lucy and the guide in [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]], for instance, with its mishmash of Italian and pidgin English, is from Forster's notebook. It is revealing, too, about the originals of some of the characters: George Emerson began as Forster's Cambridge friend, Hugh Meredith, Forster designating the character by the initials H.O.M. in his notes. As a type, Miss Lavish was based on [[Emily Spender]], a writer Forster and his mother met in their travels, swinging about in a military cape and affecting thin cigars in the ''pensione'' smoking room.\n\nIn 1946, [[20th Century Fox]] offered $25.000 for the film rights to ''A Room with a View'', but Forster did not hold cinema in high regard and refused even though the studio was willing to pay him even more.<ref name=\"Ingersoll 119\">Ingersollg, '' Filming Forster'', p. 119</ref> Following Forster's death in 1970, the board of fellows of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College at Cambridge]] inherited the rights to his books.<ref name=\"Long 211\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 211</ref> However, Donald A Parry, chief executor, turned down all approaches. Ten years later, the film rights for Forster's novels became available when the film enthusiast Professor Bernard Williams became chief executor.<ref name=\"Ingersoll 79\">Ingersollg, '' Filming Forster'', p. 79</ref>\nThe trustees of Forster's estate invited producer [[Ismail Merchant]] and director James Ivory to Cambridge to discuss filming Forster.<ref name=\"Ingersoll 79\"/> Merchant and Ivory surprised their hosts with their interest in ''A Room with a View'', which the fellows of King's College considered  \"A little inconsequential early novel\", rather than ''A Passage to India'', which was generally considered to be the writer's best. Merchant and Ivory had no interest in ''A Passage to India'' because they had just finished a film featuring the [[British Raj]]: ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' was released in 1983.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nFor Merchant and Ivory, ''A Room with a View'' was their breakthrough to broader success.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe role of Lucy Honeychurch was [[Helena Bonham Carter]]'s breakthrough as a film actress.<ref name=\"Long 204\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 204</ref> She was nineteen at the time and had just finished the art-house film ''[[Lady Jane (1986 film)|Lady Jane]]'' (1986).<ref name=\"Long 203\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 203</ref> Ivory gave her the role as he found \"she was very quick, very smart, and very beautiful\".<ref name=\"Long 204\"/> She fit Forster's description of Lucy as \"a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face\" .\n\n[[Rupert Everett]] auditioned for the role of Cecil Vyse.

(She would later become widely known after her starring role in the 1997 film ''[[Mrs Brown]]''.)
