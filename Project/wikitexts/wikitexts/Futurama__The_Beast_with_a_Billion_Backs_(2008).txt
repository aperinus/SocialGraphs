Amy and Kif get married. Fry starts dating a girl named Colleen, but breaks up with her when he discovers she has many other boyfriends.\n\nAt a conference, Professor Farnsworth proposes an expedition to investigate the anomaly. When Bender explores the anomaly, his touch causes it to emit a shock wave that sends him and the ship flying. Farnsworth discovers that only living beings can pass through the anomaly; electrical objects are either repelled or destroyed. His plans for another expedition are rejected in favor of a military assault led by Zapp Brannigan.\n\nDuring Zapp's unsuccessful attack, Fry enters the anomaly while Kif is killed. On the other side of the anomaly, Fry comes across a colossal, one-eyed, tentacled alien named \"Yivo\" which begins forcing its appendages through the anomaly.<!-- Yivo has no gender and should be referred to as \"it\" in this article instead of the in-universe pronouns provided (shkle/shkler/shklim), as it deviates from the focus of the story. --> Yivo's tentacles touch everyone in the universe, and nothing can stop them since they are made of \"electro-matter\", which can only be harmed by other electro-matter. Fry returns to Earth with Yivo's tentacle attached to the back of his neck and tells everyone to \"love the tentacle.\" Yivo's tentacles attach themselves to nearly everyone, causing their victims to fall in love with it, eventually leaving Leela as the only one unattached. Fry becomes the pope of a religion established to worship Yivo.\n\nLeela examines Yivo's tentacle fragment and discovers that they are actually reproductive organs, revealing this to everyone at a universal religious gathering. Yivo admits that mating with everyone in the universe was its original intention but claims that it is now truly in love with them. As a sign of good faith, Yivo resurrects Kif who is heartbroken to discover that while he was dead, Zapp capitalized on Amy's grief and slept with her. Yivo begins the relationship anew and removes its tentacles from everyone.\n\nYivo takes everyone in the universe out on a date at the same time, which goes well. However, the universe's leaders feel that Yivo has made no commitment and send a delegation to break up with it. Before they can do so, Yivo proposes marriage and they accept. Bender becomes frustrated from being neglected by Fry and makes a deal with the Robot Devil for an army of robots to take over the world in exchange for his first-born son, with Robot Devil being genuinely shocked over how callous it was. His attack is made unnecessary when humanity leaves Earth willingly to live on Yivo, along with the other civilizations of the universe. This leaves Bender lonely and stagnates the robot population, who are built to serve humans. The universe's residents promise Yivo that they will never contact other universes. Fry, however, cannot help writing a letter to Bender, which is sent without Yivo's knowledge.\n\nBender receives Fry's letter, which is made out of electro-matter, and decides to set out and \"rescue\" his friend from his relationship with Yivo. He and his army harpoon Yivo from the other side of the anomaly and tow it into their own universe. Fry convinces Bender to spare Yivo, but Yivo discovers that the robots' weapons are lined with the electro-matter from Fry's letter, allowing them to harm it. Since Fry broke his promise, Yivo breaks up with the universe and makes everyone leave. Yivo finds consolation with Colleen, and they begin a relationship as they return to the other universe and close the anomaly.\n\nFry decides to find love elsewhere and tries to ask Leela out, but she rejects him. Kif and Amy's relationship is strained due to Amy's affair with Zapp. Bender breaks up his friends' quarrel and assures them that what they experienced was not love, as love is a jealous, hard-to-obtain emotion that does not share itself with the world. Bender shares his own love with Fry and Leela by giving them a big hug, which chokes them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Do not add all the characters credited unless they are substantial to the plot, listed in the \"recurring characters\" articles, etc.-->\n* [[Billy West]] as [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J.

The opening subtitle reads \"The proud result of prison labor\" and the opening cartoon consists of a short black-and-white cartoon after the normal sequence. However, rather than immediately crash through the large television billboard, the Planet Express Ship is absorbed by it and is transformed into an appropriately animated black-and-white version of itself. The cartoon to which they're transported is a spoof of ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' starring Zoidberg, Leela (in the [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] role), Fry, and Bender. The Planet Express Ship then flies by the moon and zaps the Hydroponic Farmer from \"[[The Series Has Landed]]\" with the ship's ray gun. Following the cartoon, the Planet Express Ship crashes out from the television billboard.\n\nIn the [[Comedy Central]] broadcast, the opening sequence is shortened to remove the entire scene where the Planet Express crew flies by the moon. In the opening sequence of the second part, the opening subtitle reads \"It Makes a Nice Sandwich\", and the third part's opening subtitle is \"0100100001101001\", which is the [[Binary code|binary]] representation of the [[ASCII]] encoding of the word \"Hi\", and the fourth part's opening subtitle is \"[[Paul Revere|The Robots are Coming! The Robots are Coming!]]\". The opening cartoon of the first part is the 1931 ''[[Flip the Frog]]'' cartoon ''The Soup Song'', while the opening cartoons for the last three parts is the same one seen in \"[[The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings]]\", that of ''Futurama''{{'}}s own opening sequence.\n\n===Guest stars===\nThe film features voice talents from: [[Brittany Murphy]] as Colleen, Fry's new [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] girlfriend; [[David Cross]] as Yivo, the planet-sized [[tentacle]]d omnipotent alien; [[Stephen Hawking|Professor Stephen Hawking]] reprising himself, this time as his own head in a jar; and [[Dan Castellaneta]] reprising his role as [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Robot Devil|the Robot Devil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotfuturama.com/Information/Articles/4_New_Futurama_DVDs|title=Can't Get Enough Futurama: Four New Futurama DVDs|access-date=2007-08-01}}</ref>\nAside from her regular work on the animated series ''[[King of the Hill]]'', this was Murphy's last voice-over role before her death on December 20, 2009.\n\n===DVD===\nThe DVD features a commentary track, deleted scenes, and footage animated for the  [[Futurama (video game)|''Futurama'' video game]] retitled ''[[List of Futurama episodes#Futurama: The Lost Adventure|Futurama: The Lost Adventure]]''.
