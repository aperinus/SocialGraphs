Avildsen]] and written by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]]. It is the first installment in the [[Rocky franchise|''Rocky'' franchise]]. It also stars [[Talia Shire]], [[Burt Young]], [[Carl Weathers]], and [[Burgess Meredith]]. In the film, [[Rocky Balboa]] (Stallone), an uneducated, small-time [[club fighter]] and debt collector gets an unlikely shot at the world heavyweight championship held by [[Apollo Creed]] (Weathers).\n\n''Rocky'' entered development in March 1975, after Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days. It entered a complicated production process after Stallone refused to allow the film to be made without him in the lead role; [[United Artists]] eventually agreed to cast Stallone after he rejected a six figure deal for the [[film rights]]. [[Principal photography]] began in January 1976, with filming primarily held in [[Philadelphia]]; several locations featured in the film, such as the [[Rocky Steps]], are now considered cultural landmarks.<ref name=\"Rocky\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20655/Rocky/|title=Rocky|work=TCM database|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=February 27, 2016|archive-date=March 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113915/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20655/Rocky/|url-status=live}}</ref> With an estimated production budget of under $1 million, ''Rocky'' popularized the [[rags to riches]] and [[American Dream]] themes of sports dramas which preceded the film.\n\n''Rocky'' was premiered in New York City on November 21, 1976, and was theatrically released in the United States by United Artists on December 3.  Rocky became the [[1976 in film|highest-grossing film of 1976]], earning approximately $225 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim toward Stallone's writing, performance and the story; among other accolades, it received ten [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and won three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. \n\nIt has been ranked by numerous publications as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films of all time]], as well as one of the [[List of films considered the best#Sports|most iconic sports film ever made]].

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent Mac Lee Green is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nCreed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], an Italian American journeyman [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a loan shark. Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens assuming that Creed is seeking local [[sparring]] partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as [[punching bag]]s.\n\nRocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former [[bantamweight]] fighter who turned trainer and whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and sees him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer.\n\nRocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish [[Pet store|pet shop]]. Adrian's brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a corner man with him for the fight. Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meat packing business]] where Paulie works as part of the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, a sleepless Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone.\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision. Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final bell sounds, with both fighters embracing each other, they promise each other there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]], Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Sylvester_Stallone_-_1977.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvester Stallone]] in 1977]]\n{{See also|List of Rocky characters}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adriana \"Adrian\" Pennino]]\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill|Michael \"Mickey\" Goldmill]]\n* [[Thayer David]] as [[List of Rocky characters#George \"Miles\" Jergens|George \"Miles\" Jergens]]\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Tony Gazzo|Tony Gazzo]]\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]\n* [[Pedro Lovell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Spider Rico|Spider Rico]]\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as \"Big Dipper\" Brown\n* [[Joe Frazier]] as Himself\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]], on March 24, 1975.

They expressed interest in turning it into a made-for-television movie and actually bought the script but insisted that someone else re-write it. Upon hearing the news, Stallone begged Winkler not to let ABC change writers, so Winkler went back to the executives and offered to return the money in exchange for the rights. While ABC refused at first, Winkler said he was able to use his status as one of its biggest stars at the time to convince them to sell the rights back.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metv.com/stories/henry-winkler-revealed-how-the-fonz-saved-rocky|title=Henry Winkler revealed how The Fonz saved Rocky|access-date=27 June 2022|website=MeTV}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Film Artists Management Enterprises (FAME), a joint venture between Hollywood talent agents Craig T.

They shopped the script to various producers and studios in Hollywood but were repeatedly rejected because Stallone insisted that he be cast in the lead role. Eventually, they secured a meeting with Winkler-Chartoff productions. After repeated negotiations with Rumar and Kubik, Winkler-Chartoff agreed to a contract for Stallone to be the writer and also star in the lead role for Rocky.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 6, 2020 |author=Phil Jay |url=https://www.worldboxingnews.net/2020/06/01/sylvester-stallone-rocky-negotiations/ |title=Exclusive: Sylvester Stallone negotiations for Rocky movie uncovered |website=World Boxing News |access-date=June 10, 2020 |archive-date=June 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610050316/https://www.worldboxingnews.net/2020/06/01/sylvester-stallone-rocky-negotiations/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[United Artists]] liked Stallone's script and viewed it as a vehicle for a well-established star like [[Robert Redford]], [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Burt Reynolds]], or [[James Caan]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weisman|first1=Aly|title=Dirt-Poor Sylvester Stallone Turned Down $300,000 In 1976 To Ensure He Could Play 'Rocky'|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sylvester-stallone-made-rocky-against-all-odds-2014-4|website=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|access-date=December 1, 2015|date=April 2, 2014|archive-date=December 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201172339/http://www.businessinsider.com/sylvester-stallone-made-rocky-against-all-odds-2014-4|url-status=live}}</ref> Stallone's agents insisted that Stallone portray the title character, to the point of issuing an ultimatum.
