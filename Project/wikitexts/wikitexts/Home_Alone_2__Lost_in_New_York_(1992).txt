The sequel to the 1990 film ''[[Home Alone]]'' and the second film in the [[Home Alone (franchise)|''Home Alone'' franchise]], the film stars [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Brenda Fricker]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. It follows Kevin McCallister (Culkin), as he is separated from his family on their holiday vacation in [[Florida]], this time in [[New York City]].\n\nHughes finished writing the film by February 1991, after signing a six-picture deal with [[20th Century Fox]]. Culkin's return was confirmed in May, and the rest of the cast was finalized soon after. [[Principal photography]] took place between December 1991 and May 1992, and was done on location in [[Illinois]] and [[New York City|New York]], including at the [[Rockefeller Center]] and the original [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].\n\n''Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'' was theatrically released in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 20, 1992. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, but criticism for its darker tone, use of violence and similarities to the first film. The film grossed over $359 million worldwide, becoming the [[1992 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 1992]]. A sequel with a new cast, ''[[Home Alone 3]]'', was released in 1997. \n\n''Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'' is the last ''Home Alone'' movie to feature the cast from the first film. However, [[Devin Ratray]] reprised his role as Buzz McCallister in the sixth film in the franchise, ''[[Home Sweet Home Alone]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Note: Plot summaries in films should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Please do not add unnecessary detail to the article. -->\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in [[Miami]], and gathers at Peter and Kate's Chicago home. Their youngest son, Kevin, views [[Florida]] as contradictory to Christmas, due to its [[Climate of Florida|tropical climate]] and lack of Christmas trees. At a school pageant, during Kevin's solo, his older brother Buzz pranks him; Kevin retaliates by pushing him, which causes all the singers to fall and so ruins the pageant. At home, Buzz makes a [[fauxpology|false apology]], which the family accepts, berating Kevin when he says he retaliated for Buzz humiliating him. Kevin insults his family for believing his brother's lies and for spending Christmas in a tropical climate, and storms off to the attic, wishing to have his own vacation alone. The next day, the family accidentally oversleeps, and rushes to make their flight.\n\nAt the airport, Kevin loses sight of his family while looking through Peter's bag; he accidentally follows a man dressed similarly to Peter onto a flight bound for [[New York City]], while still carrying the bag. Upon arriving, Kevin decides to tour the city and in [[Central Park]], Kevin is frightened by a stern-looking homeless woman tending to pigeons. He then goes to the [[Plaza Hotel]] and uses Peter's credit card to check in. Meanwhile, the Wet Bandits, Harry and Marv have also traveled to New York after recently escaping from prison in Chicago; they immediately begin seeking a new target to rob.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Kevin visits a toy store where he meets its philanthropic owner, Mr. Duncan. Kevin learns that the proceeds from the store's Christmas sales will be donated to a children's hospital, and provides a donation. As a token of appreciation, Mr. Duncan offers Kevin a pair of ceramic turtledoves as a gift, instructing him to give one to another person as a gesture of eternal friendship. After encountering Harry and Marv outside the store, Kevin runs back to the Plaza. The concierge and hotel staff confronts Kevin about the credit card, which has been reported stolen. Kevin flees the hotel via an emergency exit, but is ambushed by Harry and Marv. They brag about their plan to kill him and break into the toy store at midnight, just before Kevin escapes amid their encounter with a passerby.\n\nEarlier, upon landing in Miami, the McCallister family discover that Kevin is missing and file a police report. After the police trace the \"stolen\" credit card, the family flies immediately to New York. Meanwhile, Kevin goes to his uncle's townhouse, only to find it vacant and undergoing renovations. In Central Park, Kevin encounters and eventually befriends the pigeon lady. They go to [[Carnegie Hall]], where she explains how her life collapsed when her lover left her; Kevin encourages her to trust people again. After considering her advice that he perform a good deed to make up for his misdeeds, he decides to prevent Harry and Marv from robbing the toy store.\n\nHaving rigged the townhouse with booby traps, Kevin visits the toy store during Harry and Marv's robbery, takes their picture, and breaks the store's window to set off the alarm. He then lures them to the townhouse, where they spring the traps and suffer various injuries. While the duo searches for Kevin outside of the townhouse, he calls the police using a payphone, and leads Harry and Marv into Central Park, where they capture him after he falls on ice. As Harry holds Kevin at gunpoint, the pigeon lady intervenes, tossing a bucket of birdseed onto Harry and Marv, attracting a massive flock of pigeons that incapacitate them. Kevin then sets off fireworks to signal the police, who scare off the pigeons with a gunshot and arrest Harry and Marv. At the toy store, Mr. Duncan finds a note from Kevin, explaining the robbery. The family arrives in New York, and Kate, remembering Kevin's fondness for Christmas trees, finds him making a wish at the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]].\n\nOn Christmas morning, a truckload of free gifts arrives at the McCallisters' hotel room, sent from a grateful Mr. Duncan for foiling the robbery. Kevin reconciles with his family, and goes to Central Park to give the pigeon lady the second turtledove, cementing their friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious 10-year-old boy with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short, hot-tempered thief\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall, dim-witted thief\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble even though he instigates trouble with Kevin.\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister\n* Maureen Elisabeth Shay as Linnie, Kevin's older sister; she was previously portrayed by [[Angela Goethals]] in the first film\n* [[Michael C.

Kevin bolts into the garage with Marv and Harry in hot pursuit. Harry and Marv end up triggering extra traps that Kevin had set up in the garage.
