Released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], the film is a biographical film of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Rock and roll]] singer [[Frankie Lymon]], lead singer of the pioneering rock and roll group [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers]] for one year. Moreover, the film highlights the three women in his life, each of whom claim to have married Lymon and lay claim to his estate.\n\nWritten by Tina Andrews, ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' stars [[Halle Berry]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], [[Lela Rochon]], and [[Larenz Tate]], who portrays Lymon. [[Little Richard]] also appears in the film as himself.<ref>{{AFI film|id=61627|title=Why Do Fools Fall in Love}}.</ref>\n\nOne of the singles from the soundtrack, \"[[I Want You Back (Melanie B song)|I Want You Back]]\" by [[Melanie Brown]] featuring [[Missy Elliott]], peaked at number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 324}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLymon was 13 years old when the teenage group [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers]] erupted from radios and jukeboxes with their 1956 hit \"[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (song)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love?]]\" and appeared in the movie ''Rock, Rock, Rock'' (1956).\n\nAfter ''Mr. Rock and Roll'' (1957), Lymon started a solo singing career, but it all fell apart. Lymon's career was over by the time he was 18 years old, and he died of a heroin overdose seven years later.\n\nJumping from the 1950s to the 1960s, the film traces the rise and fall of Lymon ([[Larenz Tate]]) in a series of flashbacks as courtroom claims on Lymon's royalties are outlined by three women: [[Zola Taylor]] ([[Halle Berry]]) of the R&B group [[The Platters]]; Elizabeth Waters ([[Vivica A. Fox]]), a petty thief from Philadelphia; and schoolteacher Emira Eagle ([[Lela Rochon]]). Ending credits show the real Frankie Lymon singing his song \"Goody Goody\".\n\n[[Little Richard]] also makes a courtroom appearance, while [[Miguel A. Nunez Jr.]] portrays Little Richard in scenes set in the 1950s.\n\nThe film ends with Emira winning Frankie's estate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Zola Taylor]]\n* [[Vivica A.

He wrote, \"''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' is a fresh, enlightening example of how to take a tragic American show-business story and make it funny, warm and terrifically entertaining...[it] brims with joyful spirit and raucous comedy...[and the film] deftly juggles a surprising number of elements, but they all work.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Captivating-Fools-Hits-Right-Notes-Superb-2953950.php Stack, Peter].

Executive produced by [[Missy Elliott]] and primarily produced by her and [[Timbaland]], this soundtrack album features songs by artists such as Elliott, [[Busta Rhymes]], [[En Vogue]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Coko]] of [[SWV]] and, making her solo debut, [[Spice Girls]] member [[Melanie Brown|Melanie B]].\n\nIt peaked at 55 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and 15 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] and spawned the singles \"[[I Want You Back (Melanie B song)|I Want You Back]]\" by [[Melanie Brown]] featuring [[Missy Elliott]] (which peaked at number-one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]),<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> En Vogue's \"[[No Fool No More]]\" (which peaked at 57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), and Destiny's Child's \"[[Get on the Bus (song)|Get on the Bus]]\".
