Among the featured players are [[Franklin Pangborn]] and [[Eric Blore]]. The songs in the film were written by [[Vincent Youmans]] (music), [[Gus Kahn]] and [[Edward Eliscu]] (lyrics), with musical direction and additional music by [[Max Steiner]]. During the initial year that a [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] was given during [[7th Academy Awards]], the film obtained a nomination for MUSIC (Song) \u2013 \"[[Carioca (1933 song)|Carioca]],\" Music by [[Vincent Youmans]]; Lyrics by [[Edward Eliscu]] and [[Gus Kahn]] [came in 3rd].  Ironically, the song lost to \"[[The Continental (song)|The Continental]]\" from ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'', the subsequent film of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] (the duo now top-billed) after ''Flying Down to Rio''.\n\nThe black-and-white film (later computer-[[colorized]]) with, according to Arlene Croce's ''The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book,'' a color-tinted sequence, was directed by [[Thornton Freeland]] and produced by [[Merian C. Cooper]] and [[Lou Brock (producer)|Lou Brock]]. The screenplay was written by Erwin S. Gelsey, H. W. Hanemann and [[Cyril Hume]], based on a story by Lou Brock and a play by [[Anne Caldwell]]. [[Linwood Dunn]] did the [[special effects]] for the celebrated airplane-wing dance sequence at the end of the film. In this film, [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] became the first major actress to wear a two-piece women's bathing suit onscreen.<ref>[https://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms6.html History of Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential  Sexual Films and Scenes]</ref>\n\nAstaire and Rogers made nine musical films at RKO from 1933 to 1939: ''Flying Down to Rio'' (1933), ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''[[Top Hat]]'' (1935), ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938), and ''[[The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle]]'' (1939). ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'', their only color film, was produced later at MGM, in 1949.\n\n==Plot==\nComposer Roger Bond ([[Gene Raymond]]) and his orchestra are appearing in [[Miami]], with vocalist Honey Hales ([[Ginger Rogers]]). Despite the warnings of accordionist and assistant bandleader Fred Ayres ([[Fred Astaire]]), Roger is attracted to the beautiful and flirtatious Belinha ([[Dolores del R\u00edo]]) in the audience. He leaves the bandstand to pursue her.\n\nDona Elena ([[Blanche Friderici]]), Belinha's [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], is informed of this, and arranges for Roger and the band to be fired. But Roger pursues Belinha to [[Brazil]], and organizes an engagement for the band at the Hotel Atl\u00e2ntico in [[Rio de Janeiro]], unaware that the hotel is owned by Belinha's father ([[Walter Walker (actor)|Walter Walker]]). Roger persuades Belinha to allow him to fly her there in his private plane, which runs into trouble inflight, forcing a landing on an apparently deserted island. Under the moonlight, she falls into his arms, while admitting to him that she is already engaged.\n \nIn Rio, Roger informs his good friend Julio ([[Raul Roulien]]) that he has fallen in love, but finds out that Belinha is engaged to Julio. During rehearsals for the Hotel's opening (a brief bit of Astaire tap), Fred is told by police that the hotel lacks an entertainment license. When Roger spots a plane overhead, he comes up with the idea of strapping dancing girls to planes, with Fred leading the band and Honey and Julio leading the planes. The show is a great success and the hotel's future guaranteed. Julio gives Belinha up to Roger while Fred and Honey celebrate.<ref name=\"Billman\">{{cite book\n  | last = Billman\n  | first = Larry\n  | title = Fred Astaire \u2013 A Bio-bibliography\n  | publisher = Greenwood Press\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Connecticut\n  | isbn = 0-313-29010-5\n  | page = 82 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/flying-down-to-rio-17969 |title=Flying Down to Rio |first=Hal |last=Erickson |publisher=AllMusic |date=2015 |access-date=June 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.
