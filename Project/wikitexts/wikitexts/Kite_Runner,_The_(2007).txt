It tells the story of Amir, a well-to-do boy from the [[Wazir Akbar Khan, Kabul|Wazir Akbar Khan]] district of [[Kabul]] who is tormented by the guilt of abandoning his friend Hassan. The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of the monarchy in [[Afghanistan]] through the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet military intervention]], the mass exodus of [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan]] [[Afghan refugees|refugees]] to [[Pakistan]] and the United States, and the [[Taliban]] regime.\n\nThough most of the film is set in [[Afghanistan]], these parts were mostly shot in [[Kashgar]] and [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang, China]] due to the dangers of filming in Afghanistan at the time.<ref name=\"NYT2006\">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/movies/31fren.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=ad87d27aa2736916&ex=1325221200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |title= Where to Shoot an Epic About Afghanistan?

This is EXTREMELY excessive. Thousands of words--->\nIn San Francisco in 2000, Afghan-American writer Amir Qadiri and his wife Soraya watch children flying kites at a bayside park. Arriving home, Amir receives a call from his father's old friend and business associate, Rahim Khan, who lives in [[Peshawar, Pakistan]].\n\nIn 1978 in Kabul, 10-year-old Amir is the son of a wealthy philanthropist and iconoclast, known locally by the [[honorific]] title Agha Sahib, whom Amir refers to as \"Baba\", meaning \"father\". Amir's best friend Hassan is the son of Baba's longtime servant, Ali. Amir participates in [[kite fighting]], and Hassan serves as Amir's spool-holder and \"kite runner\". Hassan has a preternatural ability to predict where loose kites will land as well as deadly aim with his [[slingshot]], and on Hassan's birthday, Amir gifts Hassan a slingshot made in the United States.\n\nAmir enters the citywide kite-fighting contest, where he breaks his father's record of 14 \"kills\", and Hassan sprints off to \"run\" for the last defeated kite. After some time, Amir goes to look for Hassan, and finds him trapped in a dead end by Assef and his gang. Assef demands Amir's kite as a payment for letting Hassan go but Hassan refuses, asserting that the kite rightfully belongs to Amir. Assef then beats and [[rape]]s Hassan in retaliation. Amir watches unseen, unable to help Hassan and too afraid to intervene. He is wracked with guilt over the next few weeks and avoids Hassan, who privately teaches himself to read and write. Ali and Baba question Amir on Hassan's strange behavior, but Amir feigns ignorance. Amir asks his father if he has ever considered replacing Ali and Hassan, in response to which Baba angrily rebukes Amir.\n\nBaba then throws a party for Amir's 11th birthday, but Amir, still upset by what happened to Hassan, cannot enjoy it. The next day, Amir plants his new wristwatch, a birthday present from his father, under Hassan's pillow, and tells everyone that Hassan stole it. Hassan is confronted by Baba, and instead of professing innocence, he takes the blame. Although Hassan is quickly forgiven, Ali tells Baba that he and his son can no longer work for him and are leaving immediately, much to Baba's distress.\n\nIn June 1979, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union militarily intervenes]]. Baba leaves his house in the care of Rahim and flees to Pakistan with his son and other refugees across the border on an oil truck. Amir is frightened by their circumstances. Baba comforts Amir by having him recite poems.\n\nIn [[Fremont, California]] in 1988, Baba runs a [[filling station|service station]] and operates a stall at a weekly flea market. Amir earns a degree at a local community college, and Baba allows Amir to work with him at the station. One day, at the flea market, Baba introduces him to General Taheri, a Pashtun who is a former officer in the Afghan army. Amir meets Taheri's daughter, Soraya, whom he finds attractive. Later, Amir gives Soraya a copy of one of his stories, but the General confiscates it.\n\nSoon after, Baba is diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]. Amir asks his father to ask General Taheri\u2019s for Amir to marry Soraya and Taheri gives his consent, but on a chaperoned stroll, Soraya tells Amir that when the Taheris  lived in [[Virginia]], she had run away with a Pashtun man and lived with him until her father came to retrieve her. Soon after, the Taheris moved to [[California]] to escape the gossip about this. Amir is shocked by Soraya\u2019s revelation, but still pledges his love, and they marry. Baba dies soon afterward.\n\nThe story then returns to the phone call in 2000: Rahim persuades Amir to visit him in Pakistan, offering him an opportunity to make amends. In Peshawar, Rahim, who is dying, tells Amir that he had asked Hassan to return, which he did-with his wife and his son Sohrab. Later, Rahim had fled to Pakistan and had left the home to Hassan and his family. Meanwhile, after the [[civil war in Afghanistan (1992\u20131996)|civil war]], the [[Taliban]] had taken power. When the Taliban demanded that Hassan vacate the home, and Hassan refused, the Taliban had murdered him and his wife and Sohrab had been taken to an orphanage. After telling Amir of these events, Rahim urges Amir to return to Kabul to find Sohrab and give him a letter written by Hassan, who had taught himself to read and write. Amir declines until Rahim reveals that Amir and Hassan are biological half-brothers: Amir's father had had an affair with Ali's wife and had fathered Hassan.\n\nAmir travels to a Kabul orphanage to seek Sohrab but learns that he had been taken away by a Taliban official. Amir arranges to get an appointment at the Taliban official's house, where he is surprised to find that the official's assistant is actually Assef, who recognizes Amir immediately. Assef introduces Sohrab as his [[Bacch\u00e1|dance boy]] and begins to beat Amir as payback for having let Sohrab leave. In the confusion, Sohrab pulls out the same slingshot that Amir had given to Hassan long ago and shoots Assef in the eye. Sohrab and an injured Amir then flee to Peshawar, where they find that Rahim has died, leaving behind a letter for Amir.\n\nBack in San Francisco, Amir introduces Sohrab to Soraya, and the couple welcomes Sohrab into their home. Amir teaches Sohrab how to fly kites and volunteers to act as Sohrab's \"runner\". As Amir runs off to fetch a defeated kite, he repeats to Sohrab the words Hassan had said to Amir when they were boys: \"For you, a thousand times over.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Khalid Abdalla]] as Amir Qadiri, a young novelist who fled to the U.S. as a boy during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan\n** [[Zekeria Ebrahimi]] as Young Amir\n* [[Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada]] as Hassan, Amir's childhood friend who was the victim of brutal torment.
