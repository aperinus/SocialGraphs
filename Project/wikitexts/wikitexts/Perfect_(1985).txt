It was written by [[Aaron Latham]] and James Bridges and is based on a series of articles that appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the late 1970s, chronicling the popularity of Los Angeles health clubs among single people. Its story follows journalist Adam Lawrence, who is assigned to interview a successful entrepreneur accused of dealing drugs. He is then assigned to cover a second story and decides to do an expos\u00e9 on fitness clubs, where he meets an aerobics instructor named Jessie Wilson, who does not have a great deal of trust in journalists. It stars [[John Travolta]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], Anne De Salvo, [[Marilu Henner]], [[Laraine Newman]], Matthew Reed, and [[Jann Wenner]].\n\nThe film was produced by Delphi III and Pluperfect and was released on June 7, 1985. It grossed $4.2 million during its opening weekend and $12.9 million worldwide, against a budget of $20 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl107513345/weekend/|title=Perfect|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reporter Adam Lawrence (John Travolta) is sent from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Los Angeles]] to write an article about a businessman arrested for dealing drugs. During his stay in L.A., Adam sees a chance to collect material for another story about how \"Fitness clubs are the singles bars of the '80s\". He visits \"The Sport Connection,\" a popular gym where he meets workout instructor Jessie Wilson (Jamie Lee Curtis) and asks her for an interview. Because of a previous bad experience with the press when she was a competitive swimmer, Jessie declines.\n\nAdam joins the fitness club and soon coaxes other club members to tell him about the gym and its impact on their love lives. Some, such as fun-loving Linda and Sally, are all too candid about their experiences with the opposite sex. Although she doesn't agree to be a part of his story, a romance does ultimately develop between Jessie and Adam, resulting in a [[moral dilemma]]; as a journalist he has lost his [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective point of view]].\n\nJessie comes to trust him. Less cynical than before, Adam makes a determined effort to show Jessie that not all journalists are out for the cheap sensation. He writes an in-depth, fair-minded analysis of fitness clubs as a singles meeting scene. But it is deemed unacceptable by his boss, Rolling Stone's editor in chief Mark Roth ([[Jann Wenner]]).\n\nAdam's article is turned over to others for editing, using material supplied by his colleague Frankie, a photographer. She finds an old magazine article featuring embarrassing details about a romance involving Jessie. Adam travels to [[Morocco]] for another assignment, unaware of the changes being made in his story; he finds out too late to stop it. This has devastating impact on Jessie, as well as on others like Sally and Linda, described as \"the most used piece of equipment in the gym.\"\n\nAdam tries to explain the whole situation to Jessie, but can't. Meanwhile, he must attend a trial at which he's supposed to testify. As a reporter, using rights granted by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|the First Amendment]], he decides not to comply with a judge who orders Adam to hand over tapes from the businessman's interview. Adam is jailed for contempt of court.\n\nJessie can see that Adam is a man of his word and believes him that he did not write the article the way it appeared in ''Rolling Stone''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Travolta]]  as Adam Lawrence\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Jessie Wilson\n* [[Jann Wenner]] as Mark Roth\n* [[Marilu Henner]] as Sally Marcus\n* [[Laraine Newman]] as Linda Slater\n* Anne De Salvo as Frankie\n* Mathew Reed as Roger\n* John Napierala as City News Editor\n* [[Stefan Gierasch]] as Charlie\n* Ramey Ellis as City News Receptionist\n* [[Alma Beltran]] as Grieving Woman\n* Perla Walter as Grieving Woman\n* Gina Morelli as Grieving Woman\n* Philippe Delgrange as Maitre d' in New York\n* [[Tom Schiller]] as Carly Simon's Friend\n* [[Paul Kent (actor)|Paul Kent]] as Judge\n* [[Murphy Dunne]] as Peckerman\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Joe McKenzie\n* Michael Laskin as Government Prosecutor\n* Robert Stark as Government Prosecutor\n* Laurie Burton as Mrs. McKenzie\n* Ann Travolta as Mary\n* Nanette Pattee-Francini as Nanette\n* Steven J.
