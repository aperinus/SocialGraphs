The film follows a hotel manager ensnared in an [[assassination]] plot by a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] while aboard a [[red-eye flight]] to [[Miami]]. The [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Marco Beltrami]]. It was distributed by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] and was released on August 19, 2005. The film received positive reviews from critics and fans of Craven's work and was a box office success. An extended version of the film, which added previously unused footage to increase the running time, was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network several times.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter attending her grandmother's funeral, hotel manager Lisa Reisert arrives at [[Dallas Love Field]] to take a [[red-eye flight]] back to [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. She meets a handsome young man named Jackson Rippner, also traveling to Miami. While waiting to board, they share a drink at the airport bar and engage in small talk.\n\nLisa is surprised to find that Jackson is seated beside her. After takeoff, his charming demeanor quickly turns sinister as he informs her that he works for a [[domestic terrorist]] organization planning to assassinate Charles Keefe, the current [[United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]]. Lisa's managerial position at the Lux Atlantic Hotel in Miami, where Keefe and his family are staying, is crucial to their plot.\n\nAs Acting Manager, Lisa must make a call from the [[in-flight phone]] to order the Keefe family be moved to a targeted room where a missile launched from a boat in the harbor will strike. Her non-compliance will result in Jackson's [[hitman]] accomplice killing Lisa's father, Joe.\n\nWhile Jackson is distracted, Lisa writes a warning inside the self-help book she had previously given away to a friendly fellow-passenger. He head-butts her unconscious and retrieves the book before the woman reads the message. Lisa awakens half an hour later and is forced to make the call to the hotel.\n\nWhen a storm disrupts the sky phone service mid-conversation with her co-worker, Cynthia, Lisa pretends to be ordering the room change until Jackson catches on. She then persuades him to let her use the restroom while the phone service is still disrupted. Lisa writes a fake bomb threat in soap on the mirror; Jackson, checking on her, sees it and angrily wipes it off. A young girl waiting outside becomes suspicious, telling the flight attendant that Jackson is inside with Lisa, but it is dismissed as a sexual escapade.\n\nWhen the sky phones are operational again, Lisa calls Cynthia and has her move the Keefe family to the targeted suite. She then pleads with Jackson to call off the accomplice waiting outside Joe's house, but he refuses until the assassination is confirmed.\n\nAs the plane lands at [[Miami International Airport]], Lisa reveals that she got the scar Jackson noticed on her chest during a violent rape at knife point two years earlier, and that she swore after the assault that something like that would never happen again. She then stabs Jackson in the throat with a [[ballpoint pen]], grabs his phone, and flees the plane.\n\nTo further slow Jackson down, the young girl who had previously observed him and Lisa trips him, making it look like an accident. Lisa makes her way to the airport exit while evading both Jackson and security personnel; once outside, she steals an unattended SUV. She calls Cynthia, telling her to evacuate the hotel and warn all of the Keefes. Cynthia, the Keefes, and [[U.S. Secret Service]] agents escape seconds before a [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin missile]] hits the room. \n\nThe cell phone's battery dies as Lisa is calling her dad. Arriving at his house and seeing the hitman at the front door, she hits and kills him with the car when he shoots at her with a [[suppressor|suppressed]] [[pistol]]. Lisa's dad is unharmed and has called 9-1-1.\n\nLisa calls Cynthia, unaware Jackson arrived and incapacitated her dad. He pursues her throughout the house. As they struggle, he throws her down the staircase. Lisa, stunned, retrieves the dead hitman's gun and shoots Jackson. Wounded, he disarms her and is about to kill her when a revived Joe shoots Jackson with the gun. Lisa returns to the hotel to provide assistance where Keefe praises both women for their actions.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Lisa Reisert\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Jackson Rippner\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Joe Reisert\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as Cynthia\n* [[Jack Scalia]] as Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Charles Keefe\n* [[Robert Pine (actor)|Robert Pine]] as Bob Taylor\n* Teresa Press-Marx as Marianne Taylor\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Nice lady\n* [[Suzie Plakson]] as Senior flight attendant\n* Monica McSwain as Junior flight attendant\n* Dane Farwell as Hitman at dad's house\n* [[Laura Johnson]] as Blonde Woman\n* [[Loren Lester]] as Doctor\n* [[Max Kasch]] as Headphone kid\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Headphone kid's Brother\n* Brittany Oaks as Rebecca\n* [[Beth Toussaint]] as Lydia Keefe\n* [[Colby Donaldson]] as Keefe's head bodyguard\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Coast Guard officer\n* [[Jenny Wade]] as Coffee shop girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Red Eye'' opened theatrically on August 19, 2005, in 3,079 venues, earning $16,167,662 in its opening weekend, ranking second in the domestic box office behind ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' ($21,422,815).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2005&wknd=33&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 19-21, 2005 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=August 22, 2005 | access-date=November 26, 2015}}</ref> At the end of its run, eight weeks later (on October 13), the film grossed $57,891,803 in the United States and Canada, and $37,685,971 overseas for a worldwide total of $95,577,774.
