Her teenage daughter Elizabeth is unsympathetic, preferring the company of the evangelical Miss Kilman. A passionate old suitor, Peter Walsh, turns up and does not disguise the mess he has made of his career and his love life. For Clarissa this confirms her choice in preferring the unexciting but affectionate and dependable Richard Dalloway. At her party Sally turns up, who was her closest friend, so close they kissed on the lips, but is now wife of a self-made millionaire and mother of five.\n\nIntercut with Clarissa's present and past is the story of another couple. Septimus was a decorated officer in the First World War but is now collapsing under the strain of delayed shell-shock, in which he is paralysed by horrible flashbacks and consumed with guilt over the death of his closest comrade. His wife Rezia tries to get him psychiatric help but the doctors she consults are little use: when one commits him to a mental hospital, he jumps from a window to his death. The doctor turns up late at Clarissa's party, apologising because he had to attend to a patient's suicide. Clarissa stands by a window and ponders what it would mean to jump.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] \u2013 Mrs Clarissa Dalloway\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] \u2013 Young Clarissa\n* [[Michael Kitchen]] \u2013 Peter Walsh\n* [[Alan Cox (actor)|Alan Cox]] \u2013 Young Peter\n* [[Sarah Badel]] \u2013 Lady Rosseter\n* [[Lena Headey]] \u2013 Young Sally\n* [[John Standing]] \u2013 Richard Dalloway\n* Robert Portal \u2013 Young Richard\n* [[Oliver Ford Davies]] \u2013 Hugh Whitbread\n* [[Hal Cruttenden]] \u2013 Young Hugh\n* [[Rupert Graves]] \u2013 Septimus Warren Smith\n* [[Amelia Bullmore]] \u2013 Rezia Warren Smith\n* [[Margaret Tyzack]] \u2013 Lady Bruton\n* [[Robert Hardy]] \u2013 Sir William Bradshaw\n* [[Richenda Carey]] \u2013 Lady Bradshaw\n* [[Katie Carr]] \u2013 Elizabeth Dalloway\n* [[Selina Cadell]] \u2013 Miss Kilman\n* [[Amanda Drew]] \u2013 Lucy\n* [[Phyllis Calvert]] \u2013 Aunt Helena\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed \u00a3200,892 ($0.3 million) in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 December 1998|page=72|title=British biz at the box office}}</ref> In the United States and Canada, it grossed $3,309,421.<ref>{{mojo title|id=mrsdalloway}}</ref> ''Mrs Dalloway'' received positive reviews from critics.
