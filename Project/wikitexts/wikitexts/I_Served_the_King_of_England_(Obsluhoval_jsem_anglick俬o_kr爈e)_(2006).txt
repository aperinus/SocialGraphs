He occupies his time by rebuilding a deserted house, and begins to recall his past, saying his main wish in life was to become a millionaire. Jan begins his career as a [[Frankfurter Sausage|frankfurter]] vendor at a railroad station, and quickly learns the power of money and the influence it exerts on people.\n\nAt one point during his reminiscences, a young woman, Marcela, and her older traveling companion, a professor, settle in the area. Jan and Marcela develop a mutual attraction, though it remains unconsummated. The film continues to alternate between past and present, as the relationship between the older Jan and the new neighbors develops.\n\nIn the restaurant, the younger Jan has a number of affairs with various women, including an actress and a prostitute at a brothel. He also gets increasingly prestigious jobs, including a stint at a spa, the Hotel Tichota, where he has an affair with a maid. Eventually Jan finds employment in Prague at the Hotel Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017e, where he falls under the tutelage of the Ma\u00eetre d', Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek, who claims that he once served the {{sic|[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of England]]}}. Eventually, Jan serves the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] at one occasion. The Emperor tries to award Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek a medal, but is too short to place the award around Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek's neck. Jan is short enough for the Emperor to reach, and maneuvers to receive the medal in Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek's place.\n\nWith the Third Reich's [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation of Czechoslovakia]], Jan falls in love with Liza, a young [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] woman who worships [[Adolf Hitler]]. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure [[Aryan race|Aryan]] descent through medical examination. During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by being as unhelpful as possible in their service to them. Jan is the only member of the waitstaff not to express such symbolic resistance. For this reason, Brandejs dismisses Jan, and says Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and Jan tells Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek that serving the King of England has done him no good, Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek pours food over Jan in protest. Soon, the occupying authorities take Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek away and he is never seen again.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Jan works in an institute, formerly the Hotel Tichota, where German women reside to [[Lebensborn|breed a new \"master race\"]] with selected soldiers. Because the owner, Mr Tichota, uses a wheelchair, he has been displaced as its owner and is never seen again. In the meantime, Liza serves as a nurse on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]]. She returns with valuable stamps taken from the homes of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] families. As the war progresses and the tide turns against Germany, the women are displaced from the facility, and wounded and amputee soldiers replace them. Near the war's end, the facility is attacked, and the soldiers and staff evacuated. Liza tries to retrieve the stamps from the burning building, but dies when its roof collapses on her. Jan finds her body holding the box of stamps, and pries it from her hands. After the war, the stamps' value allows Jan to become a wealthy hotelier on the same premises.\n\nAfter the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communists]] take power in Czechoslovakia [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|in 1948]], Jan loses his property and wealth when he tells the Communist resistance that he himself is a millionaire. He is sentenced to prison for 15 years: one year for each of his millions. In prison, he sees that Brandejs and other formerly wealthy customers are prisoners. Jan tries to sit among them, but they exclude him from their circle.\n\nMarcela and the professor leave the area. Jan completes the restoration of his home and releases the stamps by letting the winds blow them into the valley.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ivan Barnev]] as Jan D\u00edt\u011b, as a young man\n* [[Old\u0159ich Kaiser]] as Jan D\u00edt\u011b, as an older man\n* [[Julia Jentsch]] as Liza\n* [[Martin Huba]] as Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek\n* [[Mari\u00e1n Labuda]] as Walden\n* Milan Lasica as Professor\n* [[Zuzana Fialov\u00e1]] as Marcela\n* [[Josef Abrh\u00e1m]] as Brandejs\n* [[Jarom\u00edr Dulava]] as Karel\n* [[Pavel Nov\u00fd]] as General\n* [[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]] as stock marketeer\n* [[Petra H\u0159eb\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1]] as Jaru\u0161ka\n\n==Critical reception==\n''I Served the King of England'' received generally positive reviews from critics. {{asof|2018|03|08}}, the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 80% of critics rated the film positively based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
