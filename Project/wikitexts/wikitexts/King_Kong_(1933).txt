However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate, [[Jack Driscoll (character)|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann. Denham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a mysterious entity named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an enormous stone wall with a large wooden gate. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They refuse him and return to the ship.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the gate and onto an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], a giant [[gorilla]]-like beast. Kong carries a terrified Ann away as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They encounter a living [[dinosaur]], a charging ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to kill. Soon after, the crew runs into an aggressive ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and eventually Kong himself, leaving Jack and Denham as the only survivors. After Kong slays a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' that tried to eat Ann, Jack continues to follow them while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's mountain lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two drop into the water below. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, renders him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a [[Broadway theatre]] audience as \"Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World!\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose as the audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. He rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grasp; wrecking a crowded elevated train and eventually climbing the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Wray, Fay 01.jpg|thumb|Fay Wray \u2013 Studio Publicity Photo]]\n[[File:Robert Armstrong.JPG|right|thumb|Armstrong featured in the [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936)]]\n<!-- Please do not remove or change this Copyvio message until the issue is settled -->\n{{nobots}}\n{{Copyvio/core\n|url=Various print sources.

In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see primates on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] had earlier [[monkey]] experience directing ''[[Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness]]'' (1927), also with [[Merian C. Cooper]], and ''[[Rango (1931 film)|Rango]]'' (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130103102653/http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html |date=January 3, 2013 }}, repr.

Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO greenlighted ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies | access-date=July 6, 2017 | archive-date=March 14, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314080024/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading [[W. Douglas Burden]]'s ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on an expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was under way, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work, but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\" Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the drafts in the final product beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper recruited [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow, and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \"beauty and the beast\" angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong to be hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\" Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was also recruited to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \"mythic elements,\" believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in the script. RKO \nchief Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that \na suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\" Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\" Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was recruited to do rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York.

The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann.

Knight]]'s murals in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop.

Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and warplanes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of the island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga, and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composited with separate bird elements and rear-projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) was also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the [[Williams process]], in order to produce the effect of a traveling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into the black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different films at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\n[[File:KingKong001C.png|thumb|Colored publicity shot combining live actors with [[stop motion animation]].]] Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two-hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\" Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann at the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the [[Tanystropheus]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke, and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 1961|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-date=March 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318035303/https://www.nytimes.com/1961/08/20/archives/charlie-gemora-58-had-king-kong-role.html|url-status=live}}{{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|author-link1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=November 27, 1990|access-date=December 24, 2016|archive-date=December 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221232727/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong/|url-status=live}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|author-link1=Donald F.

Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mortion |first1=Ray |title=King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson |date=November 15, 2005 |publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books |location=New York |isbn=9781557836694 |page=50 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/King_Kong/UPXbsJLVgCcC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |access-date=8 August 2021 |archive-date=March 18, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318035251/https://www.google.com/books/edition/King_Kong/UPXbsJLVgCcC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] warplanes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File: King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\" Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll and Ann reunite at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re-shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and reshot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him. {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The final negative cost of King Kong was $672,254.75, $270,000 more than the original projected budget.<ref>{{AFI film|58307}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded vocals of captive [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backward slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams while bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors; Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Von Gunden, Kenneth|year=2001|title=Flights of Fancy: The Great Fantasy Films|publisher=McFarland|page=117|isbn=9780786412143}}</ref>\n\nFor budgetary reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer [[Max Steiner]] to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|access-date=March 28, 2011|year=2007|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322|archive-date=January 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105070019/http://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm| title = KING KONG - 75th anniversary of the film and Max Steiner's great film score| access-date = March 2, 2019| archive-date = March 6, 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190306044804/http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File: Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n\n===Theatrical===\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

These scenes were as follows: \n* The Brontosaurus mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him.\n* Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers.\n* Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village.\n* Kong biting a man in New York.\n*  Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death, after realizing his mistake. \n* An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a [[reptile]]-like predator and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong into the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards, and thus the scene was studio self-censored prior to the original release.
