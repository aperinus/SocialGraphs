Set in [[New York City]], it chronicles the lives and hardships of students attending the [[High School of Performing Arts]] (known today as [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School]]), from their auditions to their freshman, sophomore, junior and senior years.\n\nProducer [[David De Silva]] conceived the premise in 1976, partially inspired by the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''. He commissioned playwright [[Christopher Gore (writer)|Christopher Gore]] to write the script, originally titled ''Hot Lunch'', before selling it to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). After he was hired to direct the film, Parker rewrote the script with Gore, aiming for a darker and more dramatic tone. The script's subject matter received criticism by the New York Board of Education, which prevented the production from filming in the actual High School of Performing Arts. The film was shot on location in New York City, with [[principal photography]] beginning in July 1979 and concluding after 91 days. Parker encountered a difficult filming process, which included conflicts with [[Labor unions in the United States|U.S. labor unions]] over various aspects of the film's production.\n\nMGM released ''Fame'' using a [[Limited release#Platform release|platform]] technique which involved opening the film in several cities before releasing it [[wide release|nationwide]]. The film grossed over $42 million worldwide against a production budget of $8.5 million. It initially received a mixed response from reviewers who praised the music, but criticized the dramatic tone, pacing and direction although the film has been reappraised over the years. The film received several awards and nominations, including two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]\") and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] (\"Fame\"). Its success spawned a media franchise encompassing several television series, stage musicals and a [[Fame (2009 film)|remake]] released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\n\n'''Auditions'''\n\nIn [[New York City]] in the late 1970s, a group of teenagers audition to study at the [[High School of Performing Arts]], where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music, and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a [[closeted]] homosexual; Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl; and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having no interest in the subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents than his friend's.\n\n'''Freshman year'''\n\nThe students learn during their first day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. In the lunchroom, Doris becomes overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity of the other students (\"Hot Lunch Jam\"). She befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Leroy clashes with his English teacher Mrs. Sherwood over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that he is semi-[[Illiteracy|illiterate]]. Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa that she is not working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the [[William Morris Agency]] wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.\n\n'''Sophomore year'''\n\nA new student, Hilary van Doren, joins the school's Dance department and becomes romantically involved with Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate the merits of traditional orchestras versus [[synthesizer|synthesized]] instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (\"[[Fame (Irene Cara song)|Fame]]\") outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the students are asked to divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while [[coming out]] in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her [[stage mother]] to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol [[Freddie Prinze]]. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a [[New York City Subway]] station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.\n\n'''Junior year'''\n\nRalph and Doris discover their mutual attraction, but their growing intimacy leaves Montgomery feeling excluded. Hilary brings Leroy home, much to the shock of her father and stepmother. Ralph's young sister is attacked by a [[Substance dependence|junkie]] and Ralph lashes out at his mother's attempts to comfort the child by taking her to the local [[Catholic church]], instead of to a doctor. Doris begins to question her Jewish upbringing, changing her name to \"Dominique DuPont\" and straining the relationship with her mother. During a late-night showing of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' at the 8th Street Playhouse, Ralph encourages Doris to smoke [[marijuana]]. Intoxicated, Doris takes part in the stage show during the film's \"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\" musical number. The next day, she realizes that as an actress she can put on any personality she wants, but is sobered upon running into Michael, who is struggling as an actor and waiting tables.\n\n'''Senior year'''\n\nRalph performs comedy at [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]], where he garners some initial success, but falls into a hard-party lifestyle which upsets Doris. Given a prime spot at another comedy club, he bombs after clashing with both Doris and Montgomery over his new lifestyle. Disgusted with himself, Ralph believes his career is over, but is comforted by Montgomery, who tells him that failure is a part of the entertainment business. Hilary, now pregnant, plans to have an abortion and move to California to take a position with the [[San Francisco Ballet]] company. Coco is approached in a diner by a man claiming to be a director; she na\u00efvely goes to his apartment for a [[screen test]], but discovers that he is an amateur [[pornographic film]] director. He manipulates her into taking her shirt off, as he films her sobbing. Leroy is offered a position in [[Alvin Ailey]]'s dance company, but must graduate first in order to be accepted. After receiving a failing grade, he confronts a grieving Mrs. Sherwood outside her husband's hospital room, but upon realizing that she has her own problems, he comforts her. During graduation, the student body showcases their talents by performing an original song (\"I Sing the Body Electric\"). The opening lines are sung by Lisa, Coco, and Montgomery. Intercut with the performance are scenes of Leroy dancing and Bruno playing with a rock band, finally sharing his music with others.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Irene Cara]] as Coco Hernandez \u2013 Drama, Music and Dance\n* [[Lee Curreri]] as Bruno Martelli \u2013 Music\n* [[Laura Dean (actress)|Laura Dean]] as Lisa Monroe \u2013 Dance\n* [[Antonia Franceschi]] as Hilary Van Doren \u2013 Dance\n* [[Paul McCrane]] as Montgomery MacNeil \u2013 Drama\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Ralph Garci/Raul Garcia \u2013 Drama\n* [[Gene Anthony Ray]] as Leroy Johnson \u2013 Dance\n* [[Maureen Teefy]] as Doris Finsecker \u2013 Drama\n* [[Albert Hague]] as Mr. Shorofsky \u2013 Music\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Mrs. Sherwood \u2013 English\n* [[Joanna Merlin]] as Ms. Berg \u2013 Dance\n* [[Jim Moody (actor)|Jim Moody]] as Mr. Farrell \u2013 Drama\n* [[Debbie Allen]] as Lydia \u2013 Dance\n* [[Eddie Barth]] as Angelo Martelli, Bruno's father\n* [[Boyd Gaines]] as Michael\n* [[Tresa Hughes]] as Naomi Finsecker, Doris's mother\n* [[Steve Inwood]] as Fran\u00e7ois Lafete\n* [[Richard Belzer]] as [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch a Rising Star]] M.C.\n* [[Bill Britten]] as Mr. England\n* [[Isaac Mizrahi]] as Touchstone\n* [[Sal Piro]] as ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror]]'' M.C.\n* [[Michael DeLorenzo]] as Principal dancer\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Principal dancer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n{{quote box|align=right|quote=\"It's a very strange thing to grow up to be a performer, to expose yourself at a time when growing up is difficult enough anyway.
