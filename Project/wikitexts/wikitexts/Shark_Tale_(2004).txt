Directed by [[Vicky Jenson]], [[Bibo Bergeron]], and [[Rob Letterman]] (in Letterman's feature directorial debut), the film contains an [[ensemble cast]] starring the voices of [[Will Smith]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jack Black]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Doug E. Doug]], [[Michael Imperioli]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Peter Falk]], [[Kevin Pollak]], and [[Katie Couric]]. It tells the story of an underachieving fish who falsely claims to have killed the son of a shark mob boss, to advance his community standing and teams up with the mobster's other son Lenny to keep up the facade.\n\n''Shark Tale'' premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 1. It made $374.6 million worldwide against its $75 million budget, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2004]]. The film received mixed reviews from film critics. <!-- NOTE: Criticism not from film critics deliberately in separate sentence, to avoid ambiguity -->Advocacy groups criticized the film for its use of Italian-American stereotypes. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] at the [[77th Academy Awards]], but lost to [[Pixar]]'s ''[[The Incredibles]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Southside Reef, a lowly [[Hawaiian cleaner wrasse]] named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous. He owes money to his boss, a [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] named Sykes. His  best friend, an [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] named Angie, offers him a pearl that was a gift from her grandmother to pawn and pay his debt. Meanwhile, Don Edward Lino, the boss of a mob gang of [[shark]]s, [[orca]]s, [[swordfish]] and [[octopus]]es, dislikes that his son Lenny is a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Lino orders his violent eldest son, Frankie, to mentor Lenny.\n\nOscar brings the money from the pearl to a [[horse racing|seahorse race]] to meet Sykes, but hears that the race is rigged and bets it all on a [[seahorse]] named \"Lucky Day\". A [[lionfish]] [[gold digger]] named Lola sees this and flagrantly seduces Oscar. Sykes is annoyed that Oscar bet the money, but he hopes that Oscar might win. Lucky Day eventually takes the lead, only to trip and lose short of the finish line. Sykes loses his temper and orders his two Jamaican [[jellyfish]] henchmen, Ernie and Bernie, to deal with Oscar. While the two shock a tied-up Oscar, Frankie sees them and urges Lenny to eat Oscar, but Lenny instead frees Oscar and tells him to escape. Furious and fed up with his brother\u2019s tenderness, Frankie charges at Oscar, but suddenly an [[anchor]] from above the surface falls on his neck, killing him. Devastated and blaming himself for his brother's demise, Lenny leaves. With no other witnesses, Oscar takes credit for killing Frankie and quickly rises in fame as the \"Sharkslayer\".\n\nSykes becomes Oscar's manager and forgives his debt, and Oscar moves to the \"top of the reef\" to live in luxury. At the same time, Lino has everyone search for Lenny and the \"Sharkslayer\". Oscar encounters Lenny who, aware of Oscar's lie, begs Oscar to let him stay at his place to avoid returning to his father. Angie soon finds out about Oscar's lie and threatens to tell everyone, but he and Lenny convince her to be quiet. The next day, Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town, and Oscar pretends to defeat him in battle, thus cementing Oscar's popularity and making the sharks believe that Lenny has been killed too, infuriating Lino. Lola kisses Oscar on camera, making Angie jealous. That night, as Lenny disguises himself for his new life as a [[dolphin]], Oscar and Angie get into a heated argument, where she reveals that she had feelings for Oscar even before he became the \"Sharkslayer\". Oscar reflects on his selfishness and dumps Lola, who beats him up in anger.\n\nOscar buys some gifts for Angie, only to discover that Lino has kidnapped her to stage a meeting, which Lola is also attending in revenge for being dumped. Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not surrender, but Lenny \"eats\" Angie to save her. He soon regurgitates her, and Lino realizes that the disguised Lenny is his son. Enraged, Lino chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar flees to the Whale Wash, accidentally trapping Lenny in the machinery before also trapping Lino. Everyone cheers for Oscar, but he finally confesses the truth behind Frankie's death while urging Lino to respect Lenny's lifestyle. Lino reconciles with his son and accepts him, and states that he and his gang bear the city no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, becomes co-owner of the Whale Wash (which is now frequented by the gang members), and begins a relationship with Angie.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as Oscar, a comical, streetwise [[Hawaiian cleaner wrasse]] who works in the Whale Wash of Reef City and often concocts schemes to become rich.\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Don Lino, a [[great white shark]] and leader of a mob consisting of criminally-inclined sharks, who wants his two sons to take over his business and run it together.\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Angie, Oscar's [[Pterophyllum|angelfish]] best friend and colleague who harbors a secret crush on Oscar.\n* [[Jack Black]] as Lenny, Don Lino's youngest son, a vegetarian, and the younger brother of Frankie, who becomes good friends with Oscar and Angie.\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Lola, a seductive female [[lionfish]] whom Oscar develops a [[romantic interest]] in.\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Sykes, a [[loan shark]] [[pufferfish]] who owns the Whale Wash and to whom Oscar owes five thousand clams.\n* [[Ziggy Marley]] and [[Doug E.
