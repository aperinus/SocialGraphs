Lee and Harry Lee. It stars [[Jane Wyman]] and [[Rock Hudson]] in a tale about the social complications that arise following the development of a romance between a well-to-do widow and a younger man, who owns a tree nursery.\n\nIn 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCary Scott is an affluent widow in the town of Stoningham, in suburban [[New England]], whose social life revolves around the weekend visits of her college-age son and daughter, her best friend's country-club activities, and a few men vying for her affection. Feeling stuck in a rut, she becomes interested in Ron Kirby, her [[arborist]]. He is an intelligent, down-to-earth, and respectful, yet passionate, younger man, and she discovers he is content with his simple life outside the materialistic society in which they live. Ron introduces Cary to his friends, who seem to have no need for wealth or status, and their exuberance provides a welcome contrast to her staid existence.\n\nRon and Cary fall in love, and Ron [[Marriage proposal|proposes]]. Cary accepts, but she has concerns about the viability of their relationship, due to their different ages, classes, and lifestyles. These concerns are magnified when she tells her children and friends about the engagement and is met with a solid wall of disapproval, and, eventually, she breaks up with Ron. Particularly influential in her change of mind are her children's protestations against Cary's plan to sell the family home and move to Ron's tree [[Plant nursery|nursery]], as they will not want to visit her there.\n\nAfter spending most of the Christmas season alone, Cary misses her life with Ron, but she thinks she has missed her opportunity for happiness because she mistakenly believes Ron is seeing another woman. On Christmas, her daughter announces she will be getting married soon and her son says that, since he is likely going to study abroad and then work overseas, they should start thinking about selling their house, which is too big for just Cary. She is overwhelmed by how pointless her sacrifice was, and her spirits are not lifted when her children give her a television set to fill her empty life.\n\nCary goes to see a doctor about recurrent headaches she has started having, and he suggests they are being caused by her body punishing her for ending her relationship with Ron. Leaving the appointment, she runs into one of Ron's friends, and in the course of their conversation she learns that Ron is still single. She goes to his property, but then changes her mind and leaves. Ron sees her from a precipice and excitedly, though unsuccessfully, tries to get her attention. The ground collapses out from under him, and he falls off the cliff.\n\nThat night, Ron's friend tells Cary about the accident, and she hurries over to his house. She decides she no longer wants to allow other people to dictate how she lives her life and settles in to nurse Ron back to health. When Ron regains consciousness, Cary tells him that she has come home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as Cary Scott\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Ron Kirby\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Sara Warren\n* [[Conrad Nagel]] as Harvey\n* [[Virginia Grey]] as Alida Anderson\n* [[Gloria Talbott]] as Kay Scott\n* [[William Reynolds (actor)|William Reynolds]] as Ned Scott\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Mick Anderson\n* [[Hayden Rorke]] as Dr. Dan Hennessy\n* [[Jacqueline deWit]] as Mona Plash (as Jacqueline de Wit)\n* [[Leigh Snowden]] as Jo-Ann Grisby\n* [[Donald Curtis]] as Howard Hoffer\n* Alex Gerry as George Warren\n* [[Nestor Paiva]] as Manuel \n* [[Forrest Lewis]] as Mr. Weeks\n* [[Tol Avery]] as Tom Allenby\n* [[Merry Anders]] as Mary Ann\n* [[David Janssen]] as Freddie Norton, Kay's boyfriend (uncredited)\n* [[Gia Scala]] as Marguerita, Manuel's daughter (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nScreenwriter [[Peg Fenwick]] wrote the screenplay for ''All That Heaven Allows'' based on the 394-page novel of the same name by Edna L. and Harry Lee. Notations made on various pages of a copy of the original screenplay owned by the New York Public Library indicate that the script was written in August 1954.\n\nSome scenes in the script differ from those in the finished film. For instance, in the screenplay Rock Hudson's character, Ron Kirby, lies on the grass eating his lunch, but in the final cut of the film, he has lunch with Jane Wyman's character, Cary Scott.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1956/02/29/archives/screen-doleful-domestic-drama-mayfair-offering-all-that-heaven.htmlScreen: Doleful Domestic Drama; Mayfair Offering 'All That Heaven Allows' Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson Teamed Again-The New York Times]</ref>\n\nSirk considered having Hudson's character die at the end of the film, but Ross Hunter, the film's producer, would not allow it, because he wanted a more positive ending.\n\n===Development===\nAfter the success of ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' in 1954, [[Universal Studios|Universal-International Pictures]] wanted Sirk to make another film starring Wyman and Hudson. He found the screenplay for ''All That Heaven Allows'' \"rather impossible\", but was able to restructure it and use the big budget to film and edit the work exactly the way he wanted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/96-all-that-heaven-allows |title=All That Heaven Allows |author=Laura Mulvey |author-link=Laura Mulvey |date=18 June 2001 |work=Film Essays |publisher=The Criterion Collection |access-date=2 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWyman was 38 when she played the film's \"older woman\", who scandalizes society and her grown-up children by becoming engaged to a younger man. Hudson, \"the younger man\", was 29 at the time.\n\n===Filming===\nSome exteriors for the film were shot on \"[[Colonial Street]]\", a studio backlot built by Paramount Pictures on the property of Universal Studios four years earlier and used in the film ''[[The Desperate Hours (1955 film)|The Desperate Hours]]''. The set was re-designed to mimic an upper-middle class New England town. The film contains only one visible crane shot, when the camera scans over the fictional town of Stoningham during the opening credits. Tracking and dollying shots are used frequently for interior shots.<ref>Internet Movie Database. \"\"All That Heaven Allows\" Filming Locations.\" IMDb. IMDb.com, n.d. Web. 18 Nov. 2016.

The film press compared it favorably to ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' (1954), which also starred Wyman and Hudson and was directed by Sirk. A review in ''[[Motion Picture Daily]]'' was generally positive and praised Sirk for his use of color and [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]], saying: \"In a print by [[Technicolor]], the exterior shots and the interior settings are so beautifully photographed that they point up the action of the story with telling effect.\" ''Motion Picture Daily'' also reported that the film earned $16,000 on its opening day and did \u201cabove average\u201d business in areas like [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Jacksonville]].\n\nThe film was released in [[Great Britain]] on August 25, 1955, several months before its U.S. premiere. It opened in [[Los Angeles]] on Christmas Day, 1955, and in [[New York City]] on February 28, 1956, following an extensive advertising campaign focusing on popular women's magazines, such as ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[Family Circle]]'', ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and ''[[Redbook]]''.<ref>Media History Project. \"Motion Picture Daily (Jan-Mar 1956).\" Motion Picture Daily (Jan-Mar 1956).
