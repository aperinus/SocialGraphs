He and his wife Mary Parker try to flee aboard a [[private jet]] that is hijacked by an assassin. The jet crashes, killing the couple.\n\nIn the present day, two years after his battle with [[Curt Connors (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Dr. Curt Connors]], Richard and Mary's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Spider-Man]] and apprehends Russian criminal [[Rhino (character)|Aleksei Sytsevich]]. Due to Peter's reservations about his relationship with his girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Gwen Stacy]] since making a vow to her late father to stay away from her, Gwen ends their relationship after their high school graduation. Peter's childhood friend, [[Harry Osborn (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Harry Osborn]], returns home to see his terminally sick father [[Norman Osborn]], [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Oscorp. He explains that his illness is genetic and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new CEO.\n\nWhile working in an Oscorp laboratory, mild-mannered electrical engineer [[Max Dillon (film character)|Max Dillon]] accidentally shocks himself and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered [[electric eels]]. They attack him and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Gwen tells Peter that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to [[Oxford University]]. Unaware of the extent of his power, Dillon wanders into [[Times Square]], accidentally causes a [[power outage]], and is stopped by Peter, as Spider-Man. Dillon is taken to the [[Ravencroft Institute]], where he is studied by German scientist Dr. Ashley Kafka.\n\nMeanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses information Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter is unsure of what effects the transfusion would have, and the possibility of Harry suffering a mutation similar to Dr. Connors. He later refuses Harry as Spider-Man, angering Harry. Oscorp vice president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO, and takes control of Oscorp. Harry proposes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself \"Electro\", to get back inside the Oscorp building. Electro agrees and kills Dr. Kafka.\n\nUpon getting back into Oscorp, Harry finds the venom from the now-destroyed genetically altered spiders. However, after he forces Menken to inject him with the venom, it accelerates his illness and turns him into a [[Green Goblin|goblin-like creature]], but the built-in emergency protocol in an armored suit restores his health. Meanwhile, Peter finds his father's secret lab in an abandoned subway station and learns that he had to flee because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons with his research. Peter then discovers that Gwen was offered the Oxford scholarship. He professes his love for her, and they agree to go to England together.\n\nWhen Electro causes another power outage, Peter and Gwen restore power and overload Electro's body, killing him. Harry, as \"Green Goblin\", arrives equipped with Norman's weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, takes her to the top of a large clock tower. Peter manages to subdue Green Goblin, but is unable to save Gwen, who falls to her death. Guilt-ridden and depressed, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.\n\nFive months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while being imprisoned at Ravencroft. His associate, [[Gentleman (character)|Gustav Fiers]], visits him and the pair discusses forming their own [[Sinister Six|team]]. Fiers orders Harry to start with Sytsevich, escaped from prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich dubs himself the \"Rhino\" and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, confronts him as Spider-Man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 175\n | footer    = Andrew Garfield (top) and Emma Stone (bottom), the principal cast of the film.\n | image1    = Andrew Garfield by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = \n | image2    = Emma Stone by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = \n}}\n\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Peter Parker (The Amazing Spider-Man film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: <br />An orphaned teenage boy who received spider-powers after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider.
