The first five films form a series,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} starting with ''[[The Belles of St. Trinian's]]'' in 1954, with [[sequel]]s in [[Blue Murder at St Trinian's|1957]], [[The Pure Hell of St Trinian's|1960]], [[The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery|1966]] and a reboot in [[The Wildcats of St Trinian's|1980]]. The release of 2007, 27 years after the last entry, and 53 years after the first film, is a [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]] of the franchise, rather than a direct sequel, with certain plot elements borrowed from the first film.\n\nWhereas the earlier films concentrated on the adults, this film gives the school pupils greater prominence. [[St Trinian's School|St Trinian's]] is an [[Anarchy|anarchic]] school for uncontrollable girls run by eccentric headmistress Camilla Dagey Fritton (the reboot continues the tradition, established by [[Alastair Sim]] in the original film, of [[Cross-gender acting|casting a male actor to play the female]] headmistress, with [[Rupert Everett]] inheriting the role).\n\n''St Trinian's'' received mixed reviews but remains one of the highest-grossing British independent films of the last thirty years.\n\n==Plot==\nAnnabelle Fritton, an uptight daddy's girl, unwillingly transfers to St Trinian's from the distinguished [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] at the request of her father, Carnaby Fritton. Annabelle is clearly different and doesn't fit in, telling her father that the school is \"like [[Hogwarts]] for [[pikey]]s\". She is taken around the school by Kelly Jones, the [[head girl and head boy|head girl]], who introduces her to the various cliques within the school.\n\nOn her first night, Annabelle is pranked by the girls, resulting in her being poured in slime and pillow feathers, the temperature of her shower water being tampered with, and a video of her running around the school naked and wet being [[livestream|broadcast live on the internet]] leading to her getting knocked unconscious after slipping on wet floor and slides into the doors. She calls her father to pick her up, but Carnaby pretends to have bad phone reception so he can stay at a bar. Annabelle is drafted to the hockey team when she hits her phone with her hockey stick, smashing a statue. The girls of St Trinian's are involved in business with [[spiv]] Flash Harry, who pays them to make cheap vodka. Flash is shown to be romantically interested in Kelly, who initially turns him down.\n\nThe Cheltenham Ladies' College hockey team arrive at St Trinian's, along with Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites. Thwaites is shown to have romantic history with the headmistress of St Trinian's, Camilla Fritton. Annabelle is forced to face her former bullies, including captain Verity Thwaites. The hockey match is violent, ending in Kelly shooting a winning goal for St Trinian's, which is followed by a brawl between the two schools. As the match is being played, Thwaites inspects the school, finding the illegal vodka-making business and the chatline being run by the Posh Totty clique.\n\nThe following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of \u00a3500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her. Carnaby encourages Camilla to turn the school into a boutique hotel, telling her that \"when this school closes down, you'll have lost everything. More importantly, so will I.\"\n\nKelly and Flash work with the students to devise a plan to save the school. They must get into the final of ''School Challenge'', a TV quiz show held in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]], as a cover for stealing [[Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl With a Pearl Earring]]''. Chelsea, Peaches and Chloe (the Posh Totty clique) are chosen as the ''School Challenge'' Team. By cheating in every round, they make it to the grand final. As the final is being filmed, Kelly, Taylor and Andrea manage to steal the painting, with help from the Geeks, as well as Annabelle and Camilla.\n\nCamilla paints an exact copy of the painting and has Flash, posing as a German art dealer, sell it to Carnaby in a black market deal. The school then receives a further \u00a350,000 reward for returning the real painting to the National Gallery. The loans are able to be repaid and the school is saved.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- Order based on main end-credits, as per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Annabelle Fritton, a shy new student at St Trinian's after Carnaby, her father, dumps her there, and Camilla's niece\n* [[Lily Cole]] as Polly, the Geek\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Celia, the \"Trustafarian\" one\n* [[Kathryn Drysdale]] as Taylor, the Chav\n* [[Paloma Faith]] as Andrea, the Emo\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as Kelly, the resourceful Head Girl of St Trinian's\n* [[Tamsin Egerton]] as Chelsea, a Posh Totty\n* [[Antonia Bernath]] as Chloe, a Posh Totty\n* [[Amara Karan]] as Peaches, a Posh Totty\n* [[Cloe and Holly Mackie]] as Tara & Tania, the Twins\n* [[Caterina Murino]] as Miss Maupassant, the Foreign Languages Teacher\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Matron, of St Trinian's\n* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Beverly, the receptionist at St Trinian's\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Stephen Fry, the ''School Challenge'' presenter\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Bursar, of St Trinian's\n* [[Fenella Woolgar]] as Miss Cleaver, the Sports Teacher\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Miss Bagstock, Cheltenham School's Headmistress\n* [[Lucy Punch]] as Verity Thwaites, the Minister's daughter, and Cheltenham's [[School bullying|school bully]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Miss Dickinson, St Trinian's new English Teacher\n* [[Mischa Barton]] as JJ French, the PR Guru, and previous Head Girl of St Trinian's\n* [[Russell Brand]] as [[Flash Harry (St Trinian's)|Flash]], the [[spiv]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Camilla Fritton / Carnaby Fritton, St Trinian's Headmistress and Annabelle's aunt, and Camilla's brother and Annabelle's father, respectively\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Geoffrey Thwaites, the Education Minister\n* Dolly as Mr Darcy\n<!-- End of main end-credits -->\n* Theo Cross as Art Teacher\n* [[Tereza Srbova]] as Anoushka\n* [[Steve Furst]] as Bank Manager\n\nThe members of [[Girls Aloud]] ([[Nicola Roberts]], [[Kimberley Walsh]], [[Sarah Harding]], [[Nadine Coyle]] and [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]]) all make [[cameo appearance]]s as the members of St Trinian's school band in the film.
