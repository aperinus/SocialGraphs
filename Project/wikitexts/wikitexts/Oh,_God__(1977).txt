Based on the 1971 novel of the same name by [[Avery Corman]], the film was directed by [[Carl Reiner]] from a screenplay written by [[Larry Gelbart]]. The story centers on unassuming supermarket manager Jerry Landers (Denver), who is chosen by [[God]] (Burns) to spread his message, despite skepticism of the media, religious authorities, and his own wife ([[Teri Garr]]).\n\nThe film inspired two sequels, ''[[Oh, God! Book II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Oh, God! You Devil]]'' (1984), both of which featured Burns reprising his role, but with no other recurring characters from the original story.\n\n==Plot==\nGod appears as a kindly old man to Jerry Landers, an assistant supermarket manager. After a few failed attempts in trying to set up an \"interview,\" God tells Jerry that he has been selected to be His messenger to the modern world, much like a contemporary [[Moses]]. Timidly at first, Landers tells his wife, children and a religion editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' of his encounters with God and soon becomes a national icon of comedic fodder.\n\nJerry soon appears on television with [[Dinah Shore]] and describes the look God takes when he encounters him. The next day, after Jerry is stranded from a car breakdown, God appears as a taxi driver to take Jerry home, where they are met by a bunch of chanting \"religious nuts.\" Before he disappears, God consoles Jerry that he has the \"strength that comes from knowing.\"\n\nSkeptical at first, Landers finds his life turned upside down as a group of [[theologian]]s attempt to discredit him by challenging him to answer a series of questions written in [[Aramaic]] while locked in a hotel room alone to prove God is contacting him directly. To Jerry's relief after an agonizing wait, God, working as [[room service]], delivers food to Jerry and answers the questions. After being sued for [[slander]] by a charismatic preacher that God directed Jerry to call a \"phony\", Jerry decides to prove his story in a court of law.\n\nJerry argues that if [[God's existence]] is a reasonable possibility, then He can materialize and sit in the witness chair if He so chooses.  At first, God fails to appear and the judge threatens to charge Jerry with contempt for \"what you apparently thought was a clever stunt.\" Jerry argues that when everyone waited for a moment to see what would happen when he raised the mere possibility of God making a personal appearance in the courtroom, it proved that He at least deserves the [[Wiktionary:benefit of the doubt|benefit of the doubt]].\n\nSuddenly, without opening the doors, God appears and asks to be sworn in, concluding the procedure with \"So help me Me.\" \"If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court, I'm God, your honor.\"\n\nGod provides some miracles, first in the form of a few rather impressive card tricks for the judge. Then, to help the people believe, he leaves the stand, walks a few steps and, with everyone watching, literally disappears before their eyes. His disembodied voice then issues a parting shot: \"It can work. If you find it hard to believe in Me, maybe it will help to know that I believe in you.\"\n\nSometime later, after hearing the ringing of a public telephone, Jerry meets up with God once again. God states he's going on a trip to spend some time with animals. Jerry expresses worry that they failed, but God compares him to [[Johnny Appleseed]], saying he was given the best seeds and they will take root. Jerry then says he has lost his job and that everybody thinks he's a nut, but God assures him that there are other supermarkets and that he's in \"good company\". God had said to Jerry earlier: \"lose a job; save a world.\" God gets ready to leave and says that he will not be coming back. Jerry then asks what if he needs to talk with him. God says to him \"I'll tell you what, you talk. I'll listen.\" He then disappears. Jerry smiles as God departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George Burns]] as God\n* [[John Denver]] as Jerry Landers\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Bobbie Landers\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Doctor Harmon\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as Sam Raven\n* [[William Daniels]] as George Summers\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Judge Baker\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as Reverend Willie Williams\n* [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Bishop Reardon\n* [[Dinah Shore]] as Herself\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as Dinah's Guest\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Rabbi Silverstone\n* [[George Furth]] as Briggs\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Mr McCarthy, District Produce Manager\n* [[Titos Vandis]] as Greek Bishop\n* [[Moosie Drier]] as Adam Landers\n* Rachel Longaker as Becky Landers\n* [[Jerry Dunphy]] as Newscaster\n* [[Mario Machado]] as TV Reporter\n* [[Connie Sawyer]] as Mrs Green\n* Jane Lambert as Mrs Levin\n* Kres Mersky as Check-out Girl\n* Byron Paul as TV Engineer\n* Hector Morales as Waiter\n* [[Wonderful Smith]] as Court Clerk\n* [[Murphy Dunne]] as Stenographer\n* Boyd Bowdell as Religious Fanatic \n* [[Zane Buzby]] as Girl\n* Dennis Kort as Norman\n* [[Bob McClurg]] as Mechanic\n* Celeste Cartier as Second Check-out Girl\n}}\n\n===Casting===\n\nGelbart originally wanted [[Woody Allen]] to play Jerry Landers and [[Mel Brooks]] to play God but Allen declined because he was already making his own movie dealing with God, ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/05/the-lost-roles-of-woody-allen.html|title = The Lost Roles of Woody Allen|date = May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on October 7, 1977 in 198 theaters and earned $1.9 million on its opening weekend.<ref name=\"the numbers\"/> It ultimately grossed $51,061,196 domestically,<ref name=\"the numbers\"/> making it the [[1977 in film|ninth-highest-grossing film of 1977]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Oh, God!'' was a critical and commercial success.
