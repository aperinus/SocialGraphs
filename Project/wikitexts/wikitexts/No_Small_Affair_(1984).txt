When his big brother Leonard and his fianc\u00e9e come into town, they sneak him into a bar, where he sees her sing. Photographing her by the stage, the bouncer tries to drag him out and finally the cops do, but he finds out her name is Laura.\n\nThe lead guitarist of Laura's band quits, so she is about to lose her job. Although rejected at first by the 22-year-old, Charles offers to photograph her. That night, he convinces his brother and friends to move the stag night to her bar.\n\nEven though Charles had increased the numbers that night, Laura's band was still cut, so she let him do a shoot. Afterwards, they dress up to sneak into a wedding reception. Caught by the father of the bride, Charles convinces him to let Laura literally sing for their supper.\n\nUsing the publicity photos he took, and all of his savings, Charles attempts to boost her performing career by starting an ad campaign without her knowing on the city's taxis \u2014 with unexpected results.\n\nAdded to the taxi ads was a short article that goes national, explaining the ad and their story. Laura has a huge gig, and a major record label picks her up. Before she moves to L.A., Charles stops by her place, spends the night and loses his virginity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Charles Cummings\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Laura Victor\n* [[George Wendt]] as Jake\n* [[Peter Frechette]] as Leonard Cummings\n* [[E.G.
