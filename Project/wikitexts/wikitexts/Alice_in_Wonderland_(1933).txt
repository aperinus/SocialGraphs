The film was produced by [[Paramount Pictures]], featuring an [[ensemble cast|all-star cast]]. It is all [[live action]], except for the [[The Walrus and the Carpenter|Walrus and The Carpenter]] sequence, which was animated by [[Harman and Ising|Harman-Ising Studio]].<ref name=splog>{{cite web|title=Harman-Ising's Alice|date=September 30, 2010|website=Michael Sporn Animation|url=http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?p=2391}}</ref>\n\nStars include [[W. C. Fields]] as [[Humpty Dumpty]], [[Edna May Oliver]] as the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking Glass)|Red Queen]], [[Cary Grant]] as the [[Mock Turtle]], [[Gary Cooper]] as [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|The White Knight]], [[Edward Everett Horton]] as [[The Hatter]], [[Charles Ruggles]] as [[March Hare|The March Hare]], [[Baby LeRoy]] as [[Joker (playing card)|The Joker]], and [[Charlotte Henry]] in her first leading role as [[Alice (Alice in Wonderland)|Alice]].\n\nThis adaptation was directed by [[Norman Z. McLeod]] from a screenplay by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] and [[William Cameron Menzies]], based on [[Lewis Carroll]]'s books ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Alice Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871). It also drew heavily from [[Eva Le Gallienne]] and [[Florida Friebus]]'s then-recent stage adaptation.\n\nWhen Paramount previewed the film in 1933, the original running time was 90 minutes. By the time it was shown to the press, it was truncated to 77 minutes. Many reviews, including the savage one in ''Variety'', made a point of how long it seemed at an hour-and-a-quarter. Though being released at this shorter time, it is often mistakenly reported that [[Universal Pictures]] edited it when it bought the television rights in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023753/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=Alicia en el pa\u00eds de las Maravillas (1933)|work=IMDb}}</ref> Universal released the film on [[DVD]] on March 2, 2010, as the first [[home video]] release.\n\nIt is the only major live-action Hollywood theatrical production to adapt the original ''Alice'' stories. The next major live-action Hollywood production to do so is a [[Alice in Wonderland (1985 film)|two-part adaptation for television in 1985]], and the second major live-action Hollywood production for movie theaters to use the title ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' was made by [[Tim Burton]] for [[Disney]] in 2010 as a sequel to the original story.\n\n==Plot==\nAlice (Charlotte Henry) and Dinah live peacefully in their home, until chasing a White Rabbit into a hole. Falling in, Alice is transported to various doors. She drinks a bottle that reads \"Drink Me, Not Poison\", which makes her grow big. Her tears flood the room while weeping. She eats a cookie and turns tiny. Swimming in her tears, she meets a couple of odd men named Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. She encounters a tea party, where the Mad Hatter and March Hare live. She meets the Cheshire Cat, then she meets Humpty Dumpty, who tells her what a unbirthday is. She leaves and meets a caterpillar and changes size again. Alice returns to her normal size and runs away from the caterpillar and meets the Queen of Hearts. They play croquet by grabbing a flamingo by the neck. Alice is welcomed to a castle, realizing that she is Queen or Princess of the land. The people of Wonderland start to go crazy. Alice gets choked by the Queen, wakes up in her room, and lives happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Richard Arlen]] as [[Cheshire Cat]]\n*[[Roscoe Ates]] as Fish Footman\n*[[William Austin (actor)|William Austin]] as [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]]\n*[[Gary Cooper]] as [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Knight]]\n*[[Leon Errol]] as Uncle Gilbert\n*[[Louise Fazenda]] as [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]]\n*[[W.C.
