It stars [[Jean Reno]] and [[Gary Oldman]], and features the film debut of [[Natalie Portman]]. The plot centers on L\u00e9on (Reno), a professional hitman who reluctantly takes in twelve-year-old Mathilda Lando (Portman) after her family is murdered by corrupt [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agent [[Norman Stansfield]] (Oldman). L\u00e9on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and learns the hitman's trade.\n\n==Plot==\nL\u00e9on is an Italian hitman (or \"cleaner\", as he refers to himself) in the [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] neighborhood of New York City working for a [[American Mafia|mafioso]] named \"Old Tony\". One day, L\u00e9on meets Mathilda Lando, a lonely twelve-year-old who lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall from L\u00e9on, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father attracts the ire of corrupt [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents, who have been paying him to stash [[cocaine]] in his apartment. After they discover he has been stealing the cocaine, DEA&nbsp;agents storm the building, led by their boss, the sharply dressed drug addict [[Norman Stansfield]]. During the raid, Stansfield murders Mathilda's family while she is out shopping for groceries. When she returns, Mathilda realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to L\u00e9on's apartment; he hesitantly gives her shelter.\n\nMathilda quickly discovers that L\u00e9on is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. At first, L\u00e9on is unsettled by her presence and considers murdering her in her sleep but he eventually trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In exchange, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment and teaches him how to read. Mathilda looks up to L\u00e9on and quickly develops a crush on him, often telling him she loves him but he does not reciprocate.\n\nWhen L\u00e9on is out on a job, Mathilda fills a bag with guns from L\u00e9on's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, and is ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. One of his men arrives and informs him that L\u00e9on killed Malky, one of the corrupt DEA agents, in Chinatown that morning. L\u00e9on, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, killing two more of Stansfield's men in the process. An enraged Stansfield confronts Tony, who is tortured for L\u00e9on's whereabouts.\n\nL\u00e9on tells Mathilda about how he became a hitman. When L\u00e9on was eighteen in Italy, he fell  in love with a girl from a wealthy family, but L\u00e9on was from a poor family. The two made plans to elope but when the girl's father discovered their plans, he killed her out of anger. L\u00e9on killed the father in revenge and fled to New York, where he met Tony and trained to become a hitman.\n\nLater, while Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|NYPD ESU]] team sent by Stansfield captures her and infiltrates L\u00e9on's apartment. L\u00e9on ambushes the ESU team and rescues Mathilda. L\u00e9on creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft. He tells her that he loves her and to meet him at Tony's place in an hour, moments before the ESU team blow up the apartment. In the chaos, a wounded L\u00e9on sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He goes unnoticed by everyone except Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back. As L\u00e9on dies, he presses a grenade pin in Stansfield's palm, saying that it is from Mathilda. Stansfield opens L\u00e9on's vest to find a cluster of grenades, which detonate, killing Stansfield.<!--L\u00e9on is already dead, therefore it is incorrect to say the explosion kills them both.-->\n\nMathilda goes to Tony and tries to convince Tony to hire her but Tony flatly refuses to hire a twelve-year-old and tells Mathilda that L\u00e9on told him to give his money to her if anything happened to him. He gives Mathilda $100 as an allowance and sends her back to school, where the headmistress re-admits her after Mathilda reveals what has happened. Mathilda walks onto a field near the school to plant L\u00e9on's houseplant, as she had told L\u00e9on, to \"give it roots\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jean Reno]] as L\u00e9on\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Mathilda Lando\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Norman Stansfield]]\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Tony\n* [[Michael Badalucco]] as Mathilda's father\n* [[Ellen Greene]] as Margie Lando, Mathilda's stepmother\n* Peter Appel as Malky\n* [[Adam Busch]] as Manolo\n* [[Joseph Malerba]] as Stairway Swat\n* [[Ma\u00efwenn]] as The Blond Babe\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as The Hotel Receptionist \n* [[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as Cameo\n* [[Keith A.
