The film stars [[Reese Mishler]], Pfeifer Brown, Ryan Shoos and [[Cassidy Gifford]].\n\n''The Gallows'' was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]] on July 10, 2015. It was largely disliked by critics and audiences but grossed $43 million worldwide against a $100,000 budget. A sequel, ''[[The Gallows Act II]]'', was released in October 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 29, 1993, Beatrice High School student Charlie Grimille is accidentally hung and killed after a prop malfunction during a presentation of the [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''The Gallows''. His parents, along with the whole audience, witness the tragic event.\n\nTwenty years later, on October 28, 2013, the school attempts to put on a new performance of ''The Gallows''. Reese Houser is excited, as this gives him a chance to grow closer to his crush Pfeifer Ross. His friend Ryan Shoos comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. That night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school and begin to dismantle the set, only to hear Pfeifer in the hallway. They try to leave but find that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school at this time, which angers Pfeifer.\n\nThe group see the set reassembled and find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated. Alone, Ryan sees various things, such as a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and a body hanging. When the group is reunited, Cassidy is yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns.\n\nThey return to the stage, where Pfeifer points out an air conditioning duct they can escape through. Ryan is thrown off the ladder by an unseen force, and his leg is broken. The group becomes locked out of the stage where Ryan lies helpless. They eventually get back, finding only Ryan's phone. The audience then sees footage from the phone.\n\nRyan sees a figure holding a noose. He is then pulled away by the neck by a fly rig. As the night progresses, Cassidy is killed by Charlie dressed as the Hangman, a character from ''The Gallows''. Reese and Pfeifer end up on the stage, where the spirit begins to choke her. Realizing Charlie wants them to act out the final scene (in which Reese and Charlie's characters are hung), Reese and Pfeifer reenact the scene. However, when Reese puts the noose around his neck, he is hung and killed by Charlie. Once he is dead, Pfeifer and Charlie, now appearing as an adult, both bow, and Alexis, who was watching the performance, gives a standing ovation.\n\nThe police enter the house where Pfeifer and Alexis are living and watching footage of Charlie's death, showing that Pfeifer is the daughter of Charlie and Alexis. When they attempt to question them about Charlie, Pfeifer warns, \"You shouldn\u2019t say that name\". The officer witnesses his partner being dragged by a noose, killing him. Charlie then attacks and kills the policeman, as the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Reese Mishler]] as Reese Houser\n* Pfeifer Brown as Pfeifer Ross\n* Ryan Shoos as Ryan Shoos\n* [[Cassidy Gifford]] as Cassidy Spilker\n* Price T.
