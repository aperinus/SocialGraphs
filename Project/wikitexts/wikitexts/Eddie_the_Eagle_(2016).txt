The film stars [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards|Michael Edwards]], a British skier who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent [[British Olympic Association|Great Britain]] in [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[ski jumping]] since 1928. [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Iris Berben]] and [[Jim Broadbent]] co-star. The film had its first public screening at the [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] on December 12, 2015<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/73985 |title=Nordling Gives You The Rundown On BNAT 17! |date=2005-12-14 |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |access-date=2022-05-01}}</ref> and its world premiere at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26, 2016.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on February 26, 2016 by [[20th Century Fox]] and in the United Kingdom on March 28, 2016 by [[Lionsgate UK|Lionsgate]].\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics and in 2017 it was nominated for the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1973, after a long period of medical treatment for walking difficulties, ten-year-old Michael Edwards dreams of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Games]] in favour of [[skiing]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]]. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realising he could make the team as a [[Ski jumping|ski jumper]] (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated for six decades), he decamps to a training facility in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[West Germany]]. The more seasoned jumpers, especially the Norwegian team, belittle him.\n     \nEdwards self-trains, and after successfully completing the {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first attempt at a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} slope. Alcoholic [[Snow grooming|snow groomer]] Bronson Peary advises Eddie to give up, but Eddie's tenacious spirit and a shared sense of being an outsider convince Bronson to train Eddie. Peary is an American former champion ski jumper who left the sport in his twenties after a conflict with his mentor, Warren Sharp, as Eddie learns from Petra, a cafe owner who takes him in. With very little time to qualify for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to condition and refine Eddie's form, and he successfully completes the 40m hill.\n\nTo qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie only needs to complete a jump from a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} hill. He manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112&nbsp;ft), thus winning a place on the British Olympic Team. However, the officials, in an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, change their criteria and demand that he jump at least {{convert|61|m|ft}}. Though discouraged, Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time.\n\nWhile practicing for the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, he lands a 61m jump exactly, but misses the mark on his official jump and is disqualified. Eddie resolves to return home to work with his father as a plasterer, but he receives a letter stating that his qualifying practice jump is valid, and he tells Bronson that he is eligible to compete in the Winter Olympics. Bronson suggests he wait until the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 games]] and train for the next four years to give himself a better chance of winning a [[Olympic medal|medal]], concerned that he will make a fool of himself and his country if he goes ahead, but Eddie is undeterred, since simply competing in the Olympics was always his goal.\n\nUpon arriving in Calgary, he is scorned by the other British competitors, who get him drunk so that he fails to attend the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with {{convert|60.5|m|ft}}, Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie \"The Eagle\". Over the phone, Bronson criticizes Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologises for his antics and, wanting to ensure he does not leave the games without recognition, he enters the {{convert|90|m|ft|adj=on}} jump, which he has never attempted before. Bronson now travels to the games to support him.\n\nAfter an encouraging conversation with his idol [[Matti Nyk\u00e4nen|Matti \"The Flying Finn\" Nyk\u00e4nen]] on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie miraculously lands a {{convert|71.5|m|ft|adj=on}} jump. Once again, he comes last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience and TV viewers worldwide, which earns him recognition in the closing speech of the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]], Frank King, who says, \"You have broken world records. You have established many of your own personal bests and some of you have even soared like an Eagle\". British Olympic officials grudgingly accept him.\n\nWarren Sharp is reconciled with Bronson, and Edwards returns home a national hero, welcomed by fans at the airport, as well as his mother and father; the latter reveals he is wearing a jumper that says \"I'm Eddie's dad,\" and says he is proud of him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as [[Eddie the Eagle|Michael Edwards]]\n** Tom Costello as Michael Edwards at age 10\n** Jack Costello as Michael Edwards at age 15\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Bronson Peary\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Warren Sharp\n* [[Iris Berben]] as Petra\n* [[Mark Benton]] as Richmond, a [[British Olympic Association|BOA]] official\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Terry Edwards, Eddie's father\n* [[Jo Hartley]] as Janette Edwards, Eddie's mother\n* Ania Sowinski as Carrie\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Dustin Target\n* [[Edvin Endre]] as [[Matti Nyk\u00e4nen|Matti \"The Flying Finn\" Nyk\u00e4nen]]\n* Marc Benjamin as Lars Holbin\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as a [[BBC]] commentator\n* [[Daniel Ings]] as Zach\n* [[Rune Temte]] as Bj\u00f8rn, a Norwegian coach\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Eddie the Eagle'' is a  co-production of [[Marv Films]] (UK), [[Studio Babelsberg]] (Germany) and Saville Productions  (US).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.screendaily.com/world-of-locations/world-of-locations-germany/5079622.article |title=World of Locations: Germany |last=Blaney |first=Martin |magazine=[[Screen International]] |date=2015-05-08 |access-date=2016-04-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/eddie-the-eagle |title=Eddie the Eagle |work=British Films Directory |publisher=British Film Council |access-date=2016-04-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/eddie-the-eagle-review-1201691900/ |title=Film Review: 'Eddie the Eagle' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=2016-01-29 |access-date=2016-04-07 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment on the film was first reported in 2007 as a project of Irish director [[Declan Lowney]]<ref>Tilly, Chris (8 August 2007). \"[https://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/3312/knowing-me-steve-coogan-playing-you-eddie-the-eagle.html Knowing me Steve Coogan, playing you Eddie the Eagle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820124534/http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/3312/knowing-me-steve-coogan-playing-you-eddie-the-eagle.html |date=August 20, 2007 }}\".
