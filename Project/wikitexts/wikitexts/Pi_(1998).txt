He suffers from [[cluster headache]]s, extreme [[paranoia]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[schizoid personality disorder]], and his only social interactions are with Jenna, a young girl fascinated by his ability to perform complex calculations, Devi, a young woman living next door who sometimes speaks with him, and Sol Robeson, his mathematics mentor, now disabled from a stroke.\n\nMax tries to program his computer, [[Euclid]], to make [[stock]] predictions. Euclid malfunctions, printing out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max throws away the [[printout]]. The next morning, he learns that Euclid's pick was accurate, but cannot find the printout. When Max mentions the number, Sol becomes unnerved and asks if it contained 216 digits, revealing that he came across the same number years ago. He urges Max to take a break from his work.\n\nMax meets Lenny Meyer, a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jew]] who does mathematical research on the [[Torah]]. Lenny demonstrates some simple [[Gematria]], the correspondence of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to numbers, and explains that some people believe the Torah is a string of numbers forming a code sent by God. Intrigued, Max notes some of the concepts parallel other mathematical concepts such as the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]. Agents of a [[Financial District, Manhattan|Wall Street]] firm approach Max; one of them, Marcy Dawson, offers him a classified computer chip called \"Ming Mecca\" in exchange for the results of his work.\n\nUsing the chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid displays the 216-digit number before crashing. As Max writes down the number, he realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], and passes out. Waking up, Max appears to become [[clairvoyant]] and visualizes the stock market patterns he had searched for. His headaches intensify, and he discovers a vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after Sol urges him to quit his work.\n\nDawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number, having found the printout Max threw away. Attempting to use it to manipulate the [[stock market]], the firm instead caused the market to [[Stock market crash|crash]]. Driving by, Lenny rescues Max, but takes him to his companions at a nearby synagogue. They ask Max to give them the 216-digit number, believing it was meant for them to bring about the [[messianic age]], as the number represents the [[Shem HaMephorash|unspeakable name of God]]. Max refuses, insisting that the number has been revealed to him alone.\n\nMax flees and visits Sol, only to learn from his daughter Jenny that he died from another stroke, and finds a piece of paper with the number in his study. At his own apartment, Max experiences another headache but does not take his painkillers. Driven insane, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through his pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who turns out to be an hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and begins to use a drill on his head in a [[trepanning]] procedure.\n\nSometime later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 \u00f7 238 (an approximation for [[pi]]). Max smiles and says that he does not know the answer. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Gullette]] as Maximillian \"Max\" Cohen\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Sol Robeson\n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Lenny Meyer\n* [[Samia Shoaib]] as Devi\n* Pamela Hart as Marcy Dawson\n* [[Stephen Pearlman]] as Rabbi Cohen\n* [[Ajay Naidu]] as Farouq\n* Kristyn Mae-Anne Lao as Jenna\n* Lauren Fox as Jenny Robeson\n* [[Clint Mansell]] as Photographer\n\n==Production process==\n{{Tone|section|date=May 2020}}\nPrior to production, to finance the complex visual sets and shots for the film, producer Eric Watson and director Darren Aronofsky went to every friend, relative, or acquaintance and begged them for donations of $100 each. Eventually they managed to accumulate an estimated $60,000 for their production budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1998/07/26/darren-aronofsky-pi-in-the-sky/329a7b37-fa35-48bf-9ed9-65bf5c2370c1/|title=Darren Aronofsky: 'Pi' in the Sky|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=July 26, 1998|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on an [[Aaton Digital|Aaton]] XTR Prod Camera, which shoots with 16mm film, with a [[Bolex]] H16 Camera<ref>{{Citation|title=Pi (1998)|url=https://shotonwhat.com/pi-1998|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref> used for most of the handheld shots. Lenses were from [[Pierre Ang\u00e9nieux|Angenieux]]. The film was shot on black and white [[Reversal film|reversal]] film stock; Aronofsky aimed for high-contrast shots to give ''Pi'' a more \"technically raw and spontaneous\" look.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/movies/film-festival-review-math-as-a-secret-decoder-of-markets-and-mysticism.html|title=Film Festival Review; Math as a Secret Decoder Of Markets and Mysticism|date=April 3, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWithin ''Pi'', stunts were replaced with ideas, action sequences with allegorical montages, and special effects with a haunting redefinition of [[New York City]]. For the main set which was Max Cohen's apartment, [[Scott Franklin (producer)|Scott Franklin]]'s father allowed the production to use a warehouse he owned in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]]. A back room was cleared out and used as a sound stage,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/summer1998/numbers_game.php|title=Darren Aronofsky's Pi - Filmmaker Magazine - Summer 1998|website=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref> upon which Max's Euclid supercomputer was built and the majority of the film was shot. New York was chosen as the setting due to Darren Aronofsky's upbringing and all that he was surrounded with growing up. The nuanced multicultural view of the city in the film reflects Aronofsky's personal views of New York. Shooting on location would require expensive permits to be obtained; to get around this, much of the film was technically shot illegally,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/556028/facts-about-pi-darren-aronofsky|title=10 Fascinating Facts About Pi|date=March 14, 2019|website=MentalFloss|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref> with all of the subway and outdoor city scenes shot without permits.\n\nFinishing the film was more costly than shooting it. The post budget was $68,183, most of which went into post-production sound, film and lab work, and film editing. Throughout the filming, fifty-three thousand feet of [[16 mm film|16mm film]] was shot, amounting to about 23 hours over a 28-day period.<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n===Budget breakdown===\n''Pi'' was produced under the [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]] Limited Exhibition Agreement, which allowed the film to be shown only in limited art venues, and actors were paid $75 a day. If or when the film was sold for broader distribution, it was stipulated that the actors would receive an increased payment. On set operations, including catering, different location expenses, and the grip department, Aronofsky stated that \"Every member of the crew was on deferment for $200 a day. These deferred personnel also split 45 profit points. But we couldn't find a grip or gaffer to do it for free, so we paid those guys $50 a day.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/summer1998/pieces_pi.php|title=The Pieces of Pi |date=Summer 1998|website=Filmmaker Magazine|access-date=April 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMost of the costumes used in the film were the actors' own clothes, with the exception Sean Gullette's which came from thrift stores. There was a standard kit fee for make-up and hairstyling that amounted to about $25 per day.\n\nThe producers managed to get a free lighting package, and all of the money within the electric department was then shifted toward the [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] and expendables. The [[Bolex]] H16 camera was borrowed, but the crew ended up breaking it, and money had to be budgeted to fix it; an Aanton 16mm camera package was also used.\n\nVehicles used in the film included a cab and a station wagon. In order to obtain the cab, Aronofsky stated that they hailed a cab and paid the driver $100 to keep his car there. The station wagon belonged to the film's consulting producer, who rented it to them.\n\nThe film was sent to be developed in Bono Labs in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], which, according to Aronofsky, was the only one that could develop black and white reversal stock. Consequently, the crew only received dailies after a week of sending the footage in. [[Raw stock]] cost $5,414, and developing it cost $18,000. While the crew was able to shoot in the warehouse for free, they did have to pay the electricity bill, which increased dramatically during filming.\n\nDuring post-production, most of the budget went toward the negative cut, which was a matchback from an [[Avid Technology|AVID]] cut-list. The score was created by Clint Mansell on his own equipment, for which he was paid a deferred fee. The rest of the money for music went toward rights for festival entries. There was a separate budget for film and lab for post production for the blow-up release print, which cost roughly $25,571. Another $3,000 went to the 35mm optical soundtrack.\n\nThe production cost a total of $60,927, and post-production costs amounted to $68,183. Along with other expenses, including insurance, the film cost a total of $134,815.<ref name=\"budget\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Mathematics===\n''Pi'' features multiple references to mathematics and mathematical theories.{{efn|Much, and even most (if not all) of the mathematical imagery consists of graphical matter to be found in \"Jahnke and Emde.\" That is the Dover Edition of ''Tables of Functions'' by Eugene Jahnke and Fritz Emde.}} For instance, Max finds the [[golden spiral]] occurring everywhere, including the stock market. Max's belief that diverse systems embodying highly [[dynamical system|nonlinear dynamics]] share a unifying pattern bears much similarity to results in [[chaos theory]], which provides machinery for describing certain [[phenomena]] of [[nonlinear systems]], which might be thought of as patterns. During the climactic drill scene, a pattern resembling a [[bifurcation diagram]] is apparent on Max's shattered mirror.\n\n===The game of Go===\nIn the film, Max periodically plays [[Go (game)|Go]] with his mentor, Sol.<ref name=\"PiGo\">{{citation |title= The Game of Go |url= http://www.pithemovie.com/go.html |publisher= PiTheMovie.com |access-date= July 12, 2008 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222005937/http://www.pithemovie.com/go.html |archive-date= February 22, 2014}}</ref> This game has historically stimulated the study of mathematics<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/special/gomath.html |magazine= MindZine |title= Go and Mathematics |last= Fairbairn |first= John |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110608021213/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/special/gomath.html |archive-date= June 8, 2011}}</ref> and features a simple set of rules that results in a [[Go and mathematics|complex game strategy]]. Each character uses the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of an extremely [[complex system|complex and chaotic world]], while Max asserts its [[complexity]] gradually converges toward patterns that can be found.<ref name=\"PiGo\"/>{{efn|'''SOL''': Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board a microcosm of the universe. When it is empty it appears simple and ordered, but the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern.<br>\n'''MAX''': But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable.<br>\n'''SOL''': So?<br>\n'''MAX''': So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order... a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.}}\n\nBoth Gullette and Margolis spent many hours learning the game at the [[Brooklyn]] Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant, Dan Weiner, for the film.<ref name=\"PiGo\"/> The film credits list Barbara Calhoun, Michael Solomon, and Dan Wiener as Go consultants.\n\n===Kabbalah===\nEarly in the film, when Lenny begins talking with Max about his work, he asks if Max is familiar with [[kabbalah]]. The numerological interpretation of the Torah and the 216-letter name of God, known as the [[Shem HaMephorash|Shem HaMeforash]], are important concepts in traditional Jewish mysticism.\n\n===Quran===\nAnother religious reference comes when Max is in the market looking for that day's newspaper, when a recitation from the [[Quran]] can be heard in the background, which cites Quran 2:140: \"Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are you more knowing or is Allah?' And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do.\"\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = \u03c0 - Music For The Motion Picture\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = [[Clint Mansell]]\n| cover        = Pi Music For The Motion Picture.jpg\n| alt          = \n| released     = July 21, 1998\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]s<br/>[[Electronica]]\n| length       = 1:10:03\n| label        = [[Sire Records|Sire]] <small>90506-2</small>\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = ''[[AllMusic]]''\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}\n}}\n''Pi'' launched the film scoring career of [[Clint Mansell]].
