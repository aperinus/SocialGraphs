The screenplay concerns a gay [[Taiwan]]ese immigrant man who marries a [[Mainland China|mainland Chinese]] woman to placate his parents and get her a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]]. His plan backfires when his parents arrive in the United States to plan his wedding banquet and he has to hide the truth of his gay partner.\n\n''The Wedding Banquet'' is a [[International co-production|co-production]] between [[Taiwan]] and the United States.\n\nTogether with ''[[Pushing Hands (film)|Pushing Hands]]'' and ''[[Eat Drink Man Woman]]'', all made in Taiwan, all showing the Confucian family at risk, and all starring the Taiwanese actor Sihung Lung, it forms what has been called Lee's \"Father Knows Best\" trilogy.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Wei Ming| last1=Dariotis| first2=Eileen| last2=Fung| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-JEtlBzDUEC&q=hsiao-peng+father+knows+best+trilogy&pg=PA212| chapter=Breaking the Soy Sauce Jar: Diaspora and Displacement in the Films of Ang Lee| editor1-first=Hsiao-peng| editor1-last=Lu| editor2-first=Sheldon H.| editor2-last=Lu| title=[[Transnational Chinese Cinemas: Identity, Nationhood, Gender]]| location=Honolulu| publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]| date=January 1, 1997| page=212| isbn=978-0824818456| access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWai-Tung Gao and Simon are a happy [[same-sex couple|gay couple]] living in [[Manhattan]]. Wai-Tung is in his late 20s, so his traditionally minded parents are eager to see him get married and have a child in order to continue the family line. At the time two men could not get legally married to one another in New York State. When Wai-Tung's parents hire a dating service, he and Simon stall for time by inventing numerous impossible demands. They demand an opera singer and add that she must be 5'9\", have two PhDs, and speak five languages. The service actually locates a 5'8\" Chinese woman who sings Western opera, speaks five languages and has a single PhD. She is very gracious when Wai-Tung explains his dilemma, as she too is hiding a relationship (with a white man). At Simon's insistence, Wai-Tung decides to marry one of his tenants, Wei-Wei, a penniless artist from [[mainland China]] in need of a green card. Besides helping Wei-Wei, Simon and Wai-Tung hope that this will placate Wai-Tung's parents. Before Wai-Tung's parents arrive, Simon tells Wei-Wei everything she needs to know about Wai-Tung's habits, body, and lifestyle; and the three take down all homosexual-related content from their house and replace it with traditional Chinese scrolls.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gao announce they will visit from Taiwan, bringing gifts and US$30,000 to hold an extravagant wedding for their son; believing he is involved with a high-class rich woman. Wai-Tung dares not tell his parents the truth, because his father (a retired officer in the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Nationalist Army]]) has just recovered from a stroke. As a part of the lie, Wai-Tung introduces Simon as his landlord. A day after Wai-Tung's parents arrive, he announces that Wei-Wei and he was planning to get their marriage certificate at city hall. However, the heartbreak his mother experiences at the courthouse wedding (both at the arrangement and at the discovery of her son's relation with an underclass woman) prepares the story for a shift to drama. The only way to atone for the disgraceful wedding is a magnificent wedding banquet, offered by Mr. Gao's former driver in the army who now owns a restaurant and reception hall. After the banquet, several relatives come up to their hotel room for an unsolicited after-party and they demand that the newlyweds get in bed naked before they all leave. This leads to a drunk Wai-Tung being taken advantage of by an also drunk Wei-Wei who becomes pregnant. Simon is extremely upset when he finds out and his relationship with Wai-Tung begins to deteriorate.\n\nShortly after, Mr. Gao has another stroke, and in a moment of anger, after a fight with both Simon and Wei-Wei, Wai-Tung admits the truth to his mother. She is shocked and insists that he not tell his father. However, the perceptive Mr. Gao has seen more than he is letting on; he secretly tells Simon that he knows about their relationships and, appreciating the considerable sacrifices he made for his biological son, takes Simon as his son as well. Simon accepts the ''[[Red envelope|Hongbao]]'' from Wai-Tung's father, a symbolic admission of their relationship. Mr. Gao seeks and receives Simon's promise not to tell his secret for (as he points out) without the sham marriage, he'd never have a grandchild.\n\nWhile en route to an appointment for an abortion, Wei-Wei decides to keep the baby, and asks Simon to stay together with Wai-Tung and be the baby's second father. In the final parting scene, as Wai-Tung's parents prepare to fly home, Mrs. Gao has forged an emotional bond to daughter-in-law Wei-Wei. Mr. Gao accepts Simon and warmly shakes his hand. In the end, both derive some happiness from the situation, and they walk off to board the aircraft, leaving the unconventional family to figure themselves out.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Winston Chao]] (\u8d99\u6587\u7444) as Wai-Tung Gao<!--Film uses \"Wai-Tung\"--> ({{zh|t=\u9ad8\u5049\u540c|s=\u9ad8\u4f1f\u540c|p=G\u0101o W\u011bit\u00f3ng|w=Kao Wei-t'ung}})\n* [[Gua Ah-leh]] (\u6b78\u4e9e\u857e) as Mrs. Gao, Wai-Tung's mother\n* [[Sihung Lung]] (\u90ce\u96c4) as Mr. Gao, Wai-Tung's father\n* [[Kao Chin Su-mei|May Chin]] (\u9ad8\u91d1\u7d20\u6885) as Wei-Wei Gu ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9867\u8473\u8473|s=\u987e\u8473\u8473|p=G\u00f9 W\u0113iw\u0113i|w=Ku Wei-wei|labels=no}})\n* [[Mitchell Lichtenstein]] as Simon ({{zh|first=t|t=\u8cfd\u9580|s=\u8d5b\u95e8|p=S\u00e0im\u00e9n|labels=no}})\n** Simon is a tall American with blue eyes and blonde hair.
