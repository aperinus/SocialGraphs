Caruso]], written by [[Christopher Landon (filmmaker)|Christopher Landon]] and [[Carl Ellsworth]], and starring [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Sarah Roemer]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. The film follows a teenager who is placed on house arrest for assaulting his school teacher and begins to spy on his neighbors, believing one of them is a possible [[serial killer]].\n\nPartially inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&subsec=disturbia |title=Disturbia reviewed on ''Ebert & Roeper'' |author=Richard Roeper |author2=A.O. Scott |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]] }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the film released on April 13, 2007. It received generally positive reviews, and grossed $118 million against a budget of $20 million.\n\n==Plot==\nTroubled by the sudden death of his father in a car accident, outcast teenager Kale Brecht punches his teacher who invokes his father while reprimanding him at school. For the assault, Kale is sentenced by a sympathetic judge to three months under [[house arrest]], with an [[ankle monitor]] and a [[proximity sensor]].\n\nKale is initially happy with his punishment, watching television and playing video games, until his frustrated mother Julie cuts his TV cable and internet access. Kale's boredom leads him to watch his neighborhood using binoculars, including his new next-door neighbor Ashley Carlson, whom Kale is attracted to, and his other next-door neighbor Robert Turner, a single man living alone. Upon observing his neighbors, he learns things about them, and one night Kale becomes suspicious of Turner after he returns home in a 1960s [[Ford Mustang]] with a dented fender, which matches the description of a car given on a news report of a [[serial killer]] at large.\n\nKale befriends Ashley, and the pair begin to spy on Turner together, along with Kale's best friend Ronnie. They observe Turner arrive home with a woman; she is seen running around his house in a panic, but later appears to leave in her car.\n\nHis anger is exacerbated by Ashley throwing a party at her house next-door, where Kale observes Ashley flirting with people and socializing with popular groups from school, accusing her of being a conformist. As a petty act of jealousy, Kale moves his speakers out onto the roof and blasts [[Minnie Riperton]] in order to spoil the party. Ashley furiously comes into the house to turn off the music, and Kale reveals he has been observing her since she moved in and is romantically interested in her. The pair share their first kiss.\n\nThe following day, Kale asks Ashley to follow Turner to the supermarket so that Ronnie can break into Turner's car to get the code of the garage controller. Ashley agrees, but is caught in the parking lot by Turner, who then intimidates her. She tells Kale she doesn't want to take part anymore, shaken by her encounter with Turner.\n\nRonnie realizes he left his phone in Turner's car and breaks into Turner's house to retrieve it, with Kale watching at a distance. While inside, Ronnie gets trapped when the garage door closes; Kale attempts to rescue him but alerts the police upon leaving his property with the ankle monitor. The police arrive and search the garage, as Kale angrily accuses Turner of murder, but they find nothing but a bag containing a roadkill deer.\n\nIn an attempt to ask Turner not to press charges for Kale's breaking and entering, Julie goes across the street to talk to Turner. Ronnie reveals that he has escaped from Turner's house. Kale watches the video Ronnie made while running through Turner's house and he notices something strange behind a vent, something wrapped in plastic. Upon freezing the frame and zooming in, Kale discovers it to be the corpse of the woman from earlier; proving that he was right all along. Meanwhile, next door, Turner incapacitates Julie and holds her captive. Turner then enters Kale's house, knocking out Ronnie and binding and gagging Kale. He reveals his plan to frame Kale for the murders and make it appear that Kale then killed himself.\n\nAshley arrives, giving Kale a chance to attack Turner. He throws him from the top of the stairs before Ashley frees him from his bindings. They then jump out of the window into the pool as Turner resurfaces. Kale's ankle monitor again alerts the police, and he enters Turner's home to search for his mother. In a hidden room, Kale finds ample evidence of Turner's previous murders, including a woman's dress and wig, indicating Turner pretended to be the woman leaving the house the night Kale and Ashley were watching.\n\nThe officer who monitors Kale's escapes arrives at the scene but Turner breaks his neck. Meanwhile, Kale stumbles upon the decaying remains of murder victims, as well as their driver's licenses and belongings, and finds his mother bound and gagged in the cellar. Turner appears, slashes Kale in the back and pins him to a wall, but before Turner can kill Kale, Julie stabs him in the leg with a dagger, allowing Kale to grab a pair of gardening shears and impale Turner in the chest with them, finally killing him.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kale is shown having his ankle bracelet removed by the authorities for good behavior. Later he gets revenge on his young neighbors, the Greenwood boys, who had pulled pranks on Kale previously. After that he kisses Ashley on his sofa, while Ronnie playfully video tapes them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Kale Brecht, a 17-year-old high school student who is under house arrest and begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.\n* [[David Morse]] as Robert Turner, Kale's neighbor whom the three teens suspect of being a serial killer.\n* [[Sarah Roemer]] as Ashley Carlson, Kale's neighbor and love interest who assists in Kale's mission to get to the truth.\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Julie Brecht, Kale's mother who begins to develop a more authoritative attitude towards him.\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Ronald \"Ronnie\" Chu, Kale's best friend who helps him spy on the neighbors.\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Detective Parker, the detective in charge of Kale's case.\n* [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Officer Gutierrez, a police officer who is in charge of Kale\u2019s case and likes to torment him.\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Daniel \"Danny\" Brecht, Kale's father.\n* Luciano Rauso and Brandon and Daniel Caruso as the Greenwood boys.\n* Kevin Quinn as Mr. Carlson.\n* Elyse Mirto as Mrs. Carlson.\n* Suzanne Rico and [[Kent Shocknek]] as news anchors.\n* Rene Rivera as Se\u00f1or Gutierrez, Officer Gutierrez's cousin and Kale's Spanish teacher whom he assaults, resulting in Kale\u2019s house arrest.\n* [[Amanda Walsh]] as Minnie Tyco.\n* Charles Carroll as Judge.\n* Gillian Shure as Turner's Club Girl.\n* Dominic Daniel as Policeman.\n* Lisa Robin as Big Wheel Mom.\n* Cindy Lou Adkins as Mrs. Greenwood.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nThe script was written in the 1990s and was optioned. The original studio let the option expire after hearing about [[Christopher Reeve]]'s remake of ''Rear Window''. It was not until 2004 that the script was rewritten and sold.\n\nExecutive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] arranged for LaBeouf to be on the casting shortlist for this film because he was impressed by LaBeouf's work on ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]''. Caruso auditioned over a hundred males for the role in five weeks before settling on LaBeouf as he was looking for someone \"who guys would really like and respond to, because he wasn't going to be such a pretty boy\". LaBeouf was attracted to the role because of the director's 2002 film ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]'', which he complimented as one of his favorite films. Before filming started, the two watched the thriller films ''[[Rear Window]]'' starring [[James Stewart]], ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]], and ''[[The Conversation]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. They also viewed the 1989 [[romantic film]] ''[[Say Anything...]]'' and \"mixed all the movies together.\"<ref name=\"Biggie\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Shia LaBeouf\u2013 Disturbia|url=http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|work=Biggie|access-date=November 22, 2013|year=2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223415/http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|archive-date=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> LaBeouf says he spoke to people on house arrest and locked himself in a room with the bracelet to feel what the confinement of house arrest is like.<ref name=\"Biggie\" /> He commented in an interview, \"...it's hard.

(Ownership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story \"It Had to Be Murder\" and its use as the basis for the movie ''Rear Window'' was previously litigated before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Stewart v.

Contrary to some media reports, the claim was based on the original Woolrich short story, not the movie ''Rear Window''.\n\nThis claim was rejected by the U.S. District Court in ''Abend v. Spielberg'', 748 F.Supp.2d 200 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), on the basis that the original Woolrich short story and ''Disturbia'' are only similar at a high level of generality and abstraction. \"Their similarities derive entirely from unprotectible elements and the total look and feel of the works is so distinct that no reasonable trier of fact could find the works substantially similar within the meaning of copyright law.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Abend v.
