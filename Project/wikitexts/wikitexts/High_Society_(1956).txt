The film was produced by [[Sol C. Siegel]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and shot in [[VistaVision]] and [[Technicolor]], with music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]].\n\nThe film is a musical [[remake]] of the 1940 film ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' which was based on the 1939 play ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' by [[Philip Barry]]. ''High Society'''s screenplay was written by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]] and involves a successful popular jazz musician (Crosby) who tries to win back the affections of his ex-wife (Kelly), who is preparing to marry another man. The cast also features [[Celeste Holm]], [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]], and [[Louis Calhern]], in his final film, with a musical contribution by [[Louis Armstrong]]. The film was Kelly's last professional appearance before she married [[Prince Rainier III]] and became [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess consort of Monaco]].\n\n==Plot==\nSuccessful singer-composer C.K. Dexter-Haven (the grandson of a Newport \"robber baron\") is divorced from wealthy [[Newport, Rhode Island]] socialite Tracy Samantha Lord. Dexter, who lives next door to the Lord estate, remains in love with her but she is now engaged to socially prominent and snobbish George Kittredge. As Tracy prepares for her upcoming wedding, Dexter is busily organizing elements of the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nMeanwhile, ''Spy'', a fictional [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper, possesses embarrassing information about Tracy's errant father, Seth Lord, and has coerced the family into allowing reporter Mike Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie to cover the nuptials. Tracy, resenting their forced presence, begins an elaborate charade, including introducing her Uncle Willy as her father, while Seth is passed off as \"wicked\" Uncle Willy.\n\nAs a wedding gift, Dexter gives Tracy a scale model of their former sailboat, \"True Love,\" which evokes her memories about their happy honeymoon aboard it. Tracy gradually realizes George knows little about her true self and has instead created an idealized image of her. When Tracy drives Mike around Newport, he notices some neglected mansions; Tracy explains many owners have been forced to board up or sell off their properties due to high taxes. Her Uncle Willy is selling his own estate. The two form a mutual attraction, leaving Tracy to choose from three very different men during a course of self-discovery. During the wedding-eve party at Uncle Willy's house, George catches a tipsy Tracy kissing Dexter on the patio. George leaves Tracy in an empty room to sober up but, still tipsy, she climbs out the window and runs into Mike. George finds her again after she and Mike have had a swim in the Lords' pool. The next day, Tracy has hazy memories of the previous night. She initially intends to go through with the wedding, then prods George into agreeing to call it off. While informing the waiting guests the wedding is canceled, Dexter suddenly proposes that he be the groom. Knowing she loves him, Tracy accepts. Liz and Mike, who now realize they love each other, tell Tracy and Dexter that they are not writing a story about the wedding or other events to protect the family's privacy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as C.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed: \"''High Society'' should spell high finance business all over. It's a solid entertainment every minute of its footage. Fortified with a strong Cole Porter score, film is a pleasant romp for cast toppers Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra who, tactfully, get alphabetical top billing. Their impact is almost equally consistent. Although Sinatra has the top pop tune opportunities, the Crooner makes his specialties stand up and out on showmanship and delivery, and Miss Kelly impresses as the femme lead with pleasantly comedienne overtones. This is perhaps her most relaxed performance ...\"<ref>{{Cite journal |date=July 18, 1956 |title=Variety}}</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"flimsy as a gossip-columnist's word\", missing \"the snap and the crackle that its un-musical predecessor had.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bosley Crowther |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=August 10, 1956 |title=No ''Philadelphia Story'', This: 'High Society' Lacks Hepburn Sparkle |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E2DD113FE03BBC4852DFBE66838D649EDE |access-date=August 5, 2011 |website=The New York Times}}</ref> According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', in spite of its \"Who's Who cast\" the film is \"simply not top-drawer\"; a \"good deal of the screenplay seems as dated today as the idle rich ...

It was one of the [[1956 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|10 highest grossing films of 1956]] in the US and Canada earning $5,602,000, and $2,656,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,148,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\" />\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n''High Society'' received two [[Academy Award]] nominations, and nearly received a third. The film was initially nominated in the 1956 Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Motion Picture Story]], even though it was based on the 1940 film ''The Philadelphia Story'' and thus was not eligible in that category.
