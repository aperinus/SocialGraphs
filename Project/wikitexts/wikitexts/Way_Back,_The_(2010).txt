The film is inspired by ''The Long Walk'' (1956), the memoir by former Polish [[prisoner of war]] [[S\u0142awomir Rawicz]], who claimed to have escaped from a Soviet [[Gulag]] and walked {{convert|4,000|mi|km}} to freedom in World War II. The film stars [[Jim Sturgess]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Saoirse Ronan]], with [[Alexandru Potocean]], [[Sebastian Urzendowsky]], [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Drago\u0219 Bucur]] and [[Mark Strong]].\n\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], but lost to ''[[The Wolfman (2010 film)|The Wolfman]].'' The nomination was received by [[Gregory Funk]], [[Edouard F. Henriques]] and [[Yolanda Toussieng]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2011|title=The 83rd Academy Awards (2011) Nominees and Winners|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring World War II, after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], young Polish army officer Janusz Wieszczek is held as a prisoner and interrogated by the [[NKVD]]. The Soviets, unable to get him to admit that he is a spy, take his wife into custody as well and severely torture her; from her they extort a statement condemning him. He is sentenced to 20 years in a [[Gulag]] labour camp deep in [[Siberia]].\n\nThere he meets those with whom he later plans an escape: Mr. Smith, an American engineer; Khabarov, an actor; Valka, a hardened Russian criminal; Tomasz, a Polish artist; Voss, a [[Latvians|Latvian]] priest; Kazik, a Pole suffering from [[night blindness]]; and Zoran, a [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] accountant. Khabarov secretly tells Janusz that he is planning to escape south to [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], passing [[Lake Baikal]]. Smith cautions Janusz that it is Khabarov's way to discuss escape plans with newcomers, to maintain his morale, but nothing will come of it. At times Janusz seems to hallucinate the front door of a country home and adjoining window ledge, which holds plants and a rock he attempts to reach for. Janusz follows through with the escape with Smith, Valka, Voss, Tomasz, Zoran and Kazik during a severe snowstorm that covers their tracks.\n\nKazik freezes to death the second night of the trek, after losing his way back to the campsite while looking for wood, and the group buries him. After many days of travelling across the snows of Siberia, the group reaches [[Lake Baikal]]. There they meet Irena, a young Polish girl, who tells them that Russian soldiers murdered her parents and sent her to a [[collective farm]] near [[Warsaw]], where they treated her cruelly, so she escaped. Smith realises the inaccuracies in her story, as Warsaw is [[German-occupied Poland|occupied by the Germans]]; nevertheless, despite his misgivings that she'll slow them down and tax their meager food supply, he agrees with the group to let her in. Smith eventually cautions her about the lie and says he will not tolerate any more, in response to which she admits that her parents were communists but the communist rulers killed them anyway and sent her to an orphanage.\n\nWhen the group reaches an unpatrolled border between the Soviet Union and Mongolia, Valka, who idolizes [[Joseph Stalin]] and does not know what he would do elsewhere, decides to stay. The rest continue to [[Ulaanbaatar]], but soon they see images of Stalin, [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] and a red star. Janusz realises that [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia is under communist control]] and since [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]] is at [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war with Japan]], tells the group they should take refuge in [[British Raj|British India]]. As they continue south across the [[Gobi Desert]], lack of water, sandstorms, sunburn, blisters and sunstroke weaken the group. They find a well, which provides temporary relief. However, shortly after departing, they are hit by a sandstorm and lose the majority of their water supply. Realizing they could never find the well again, the group carries on. Irena collapses several times and soon dies. A few days later Tomasz collapses and dies. Smith is on the verge of death, but after being motivated by Janusz, Zoran and Voss, decides to rejoin the group and the severely dehydrated four find a much-needed water source. Soon after, they reach China by passing through the [[Great Wall]].\n\nAs they reach the [[Himalayas]], all of them on the verge of death, they are rescued by a Tibetan monk who takes them to a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery where they regain their strength. Smith decides to go to [[Lhasa]] with the help of one of the monk's contacts, who will smuggle him out through China. Once there, he anticipates he will be able to connect with the US military, his return to America ensured. The remaining three continue to trek through the [[Himalayas]] and soon reach India and get assistance from villagers. The Indian government helps them reach their home peacefully.\n\nAt the end of the film, Janusz keeps walking around the world until 1989, when the communist regime in Poland is [[Revolutions of 1989#Poland|ousted from power]]. The final scene of the film shows Janusz, 50 years after being taken captive, again envisioning the door and reaching for the rock; this time he takes a key hidden beneath the rock to open the door and reconcile with his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Janusz Wieszczek, a young Polish inmate made a prisoner of war during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Mr. Smith, an American inmate and former engineer\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Irena Zieli\u0144ska, an orphaned teenage Polish girl trying to escape from the Soviet Union, who meets up with the fugitives near [[Lake Baikal]]\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Valka, a tough Russian inmate and gambler whose most prized possession is a knife he calls \"Wolf\"\n* [[Drago\u0219 Bucur]] as Zoran, a Yugoslavian inmate who used to be an accountant and is considered a funny man\n* [[Alexandru Potocean]] as Tomasz Horodinsky, a Polish inmate and former pastry chef who dreams of becoming an artist\n* [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Andrejs Voss, a Latvian inmate and former priest\n* [[Sebastian Urzendowsky]] as Kazik, a young Polish inmate suffering from night blindness\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Andrei Timofeyevich Khabarov, a Russian inmate and actor who was imprisoned when the play he was in was deemed [[Subversion|subversive]] by Soviet authorities\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nThe film is loosely based on ''The Long Walk'' (1956), [[S\u0142awomir Rawicz]]'s memoir depicting his alleged escape from a Siberian Gulag and subsequent 4,000-mile walk to freedom in India. The book sold over 500,000 copies and is credited with inspiring many explorers. In 2006 the [[BBC]] unearthed records (including some written by Rawicz himself) which showed that, rather than having escaped from the gulag, he had in fact been released by the [[USSR]] in 1942.<ref name=\"bbcdec3\">{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11900920| title=How The Long Walk became The Way Back|work=BBC|access-date= 2010-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Levinson|first=Hugh|title=Walking the Talk?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6098218.stm|publisher=BBC|access-date=7 August 2011|date=2006-10-30}}</ref> Nevertheless, there is some circumstantial evidence that some sort of trek to freedom occurred, via the route outlined in the book and film.  Captain Rupert Mayne, a British intelligence officer in Calcutta in 1942, interviewed three emaciated men, who claimed to have escaped from Siberia. Mayne always believed their story was the same as that of ''The Long Walk''. So the possibility remains that someone \u2013 even if not Rawicz \u2013 achieved this extraordinary feat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6098218.stm|title=Walking the talk?|date=30 October 2006|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Though the director Peter Weir continues to claim that the so-called long walk happened, he himself now describes ''The Way Back'' as \"essentially a fictional film\".<ref name=\"bbcdec3\"/><ref name=\"weir1\">{{YouTube|tJz9PeAXsFE|Peter Weir 16 February 2011 Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, part 1}} Retrieved 2011-02-19.</ref><ref name=\"weir2\">{{YouTube|ZR-Cr4OZ2Z4|Peter Weir February 16, 2011 Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview, part 2}} Retrieved 2011-02-19.</ref>\n\n[[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Herbert Wilcox]] announced plans to make a film from ''The Long Walk'' in 1957.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Harvey Will Produce 'Long Walk;' Hayden Top Star in 'Hard as Nails'|author=Schallert, Edwin|date=July 15, 1957|work=Los Angeles Times|page=C9}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography took place in [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and India.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1023114/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt | work=IMDb |title=The Way Back (2010): Filming & Production}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Way Back'' received generally positive reviews.
