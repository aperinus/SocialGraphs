It is the fourth and final installment in the ''[[3 Ninjas]]'' franchise.\n\nDirected by Sean McNamara, the film stars only three of the original actors. None of the child actors from the previous films returned for this installment. Victor Wong is the only cast member to appear in all four films. It is also his final film before his death in 2001. It was filmed in Denver, Colorado at Elitch Gardens Theme Park.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring their summer vacation with their grandfather Mori, 14-year-old Rocky, 13-year-old Colt and 9-year-old Tum-Tum take a test on an [[obstacle course]] in pitch blackness. They manage to complete the course, yet fail to learn how to use their other senses, in place of sight. Later that night, Mori overhears Rocky and Colt planning on not returning the next year due to them growing older, leaving Tum-Tum for himself. Mori becomes depressed at this.\n\nReturning home, Tum-Tum also becomes depressed after learning that his favorite TV show, ''Dave Dragon & the Star Force 5'', is going off the air soon from cancellation and not even his favorite sandwich was made to cheer him up, which confuses his mother, Jessica. The next day, they meet a new neighbor, Amanda, who accidentally crashes her [[remote controlled]] helicopter into their house's window. To recompense, Jessica invites her for breakfast and to attend Tum-Tum's birthday party at Mega Mountain, an amusement park modeled after [[Six Flags]]. Once they arrive at Mega Mountain, Rocky goes to spend time with his girlfriend, Jennifer and her few friends, Veronica, Eric and Doyle while Tum-Tum convinces Colt to join him to watch the performance. While the kids are enjoying themselves, a master criminal named Mary Ann \"Medusa\" Rogers and her henchmen sneaks in and commandeers the park, disabling many rides and shutting the place down to hold the patrons hostage. Medusa and rest of her men infiltrate the park's command center operations as their secret base and she threatens the park's owner, Harry Jacobsons to pay the $10 Million dollar ransom in exchange for the park's guests safety. Meanwhile, Tum-Tum and Colt want to get an autograph from Dave until they witness and save him from being captured by Medusa's henchmen. Rocky rejoins his brothers and Amanda fending off the men after spotting them on the [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance camera monitors]]. The boys and Amanda realize the park has been compromised and report Dave about it, who went into action. The boys and Amanda notice a [[Walkie-talkie|radio]] to make contact with the emergency services, and the police and firefighters units are sent to investigate the park. However, Medusa and her men spots and ambush them, which causes the [[FBI]] to arrive at the park for backup. In retaliation, Medusa orders her Jamaican sidekick C.J., to increase the [[Top Spin (ride)|Avalanche]] ride's speed level. The boys and Amanda rescue the riders by fighting some of the few men with Amanda's special arsenals that she possesses while she overrides the ride control with her [[laptop]].\n\nKnowing that they will interfere with her plans, Medusa sends her three dim-witted nephews Carl, Buelow and Zed to capture them, but they are taken down by the boys, who uses the park's carnival game items and a ride with their ninja skills. Meanwhile, Dave sneaks into the command center, but is quickly discovered and captured by Medusa and her henchmen. The [[SWAT]] team arrives and attempts to enter the park, but are stopped by the mercenaries with their electrical fence trap. In the meantime, Amanda utilizes the park\u2019s main control systems with her laptop to lock the ride access down with C.J. trying to wrestle the controls from her, but not before Medusa quickly accesses the Zinger roller coaster's emergency brake that stops the ride on the inversion. Dave tries to attack Medusa, but she stops and her men imprisons him in the middle of the roller coaster bottom with several guests.\n\nRecognizing the picture of Rocky and Jennifer on the [[On-ride camera|ride monitors]], Medusa\u2019s nephews capture and tie her to the bottom of the Zinger roller coaster loop tracks, at which Medusa threatens to crush her if they don\u2019t cooperate. Rocky goes off on his own to rescue Jennifer. Medusa sends her second-in-command, Lothar Zogg out to capture the boys so they don't interfere. Afterwards, Dave, regaining his confidence, fights off the guards and liberates the hostages from the roller coaster bottom. Rocky arrives to rescue Jennifer, but he gets attacked by Lothar. After a fight that leads to both Rocky and Lothar ending up at the top of the roller coaster loop, Rocky knocks Lothar off with a yo-yo around his ankle to make him literally bounce out of the park and into the hands of the authorities that are stationed outside of the park. Rocky then manages to free Jennifer before Medusa releases the roller coaster that can crush both of them. Jacobson arrives via helicopter with the several bags of money to pay the ransom for Medusa, but Amanda manages to destroy the last bag with her remote-controlled helicopter, causing the money to rain down onto the park and with the guests snatches it all.\n \nAmanda is quickly captured by Medusa, who escapes underground with the remainder of the money. When Dave fends off Medusa's ninjas, she knocks him out unconscious. The boys successfully manage to defeat some of Medusa's ninjas until she shoots all of the lights out on sight. After she darkens the halls, Medusa's ninjas fight the boys with their [[Night-vision device|night vision goggles]]. Despite the disadvantage, the boys overcome their weakness in the dark with Mori's advice about using their senses. The boys successfully defeat Medusa's ninjas, in order to rescue Amanda, who is handcuffed next to a bomb that Medusa activates to destroy the park. They manage to free her, but they are unable to disarm the bomb, due to the short circuited power supply. They attach the bomb to a few oxygen tanks with Dave's help to knock off the tank's valves and send it off like a torpedo down to Medusa's escape ship where she and her remaining men dives from the ship before her ship explodes on impact. Alerted to the explosion, the Police arrives to arrest Medusa at the beach shore, who resigns herself to defeat.\n\nNow hailed and commemorated as heroes, the boys give the credit to Dave Dragon, hailing him as the real hero, to the press media. After reuniting with their parents and grandfather, Rocky and Colt assure Mori that they will not be leaving their training. They also extend the offer to Amanda to come train with them on the following year and she gladly accepts. The film and series end with them all celebrating Tum-Tum's birthday.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* Mathew Botuchis as Samuel \"Rocky\" Douglas Jr.\n* Michael O'Laskey II as Jeffrey \"Colt\" Douglas\n* James Paul Roeske ll as Michael \"Tum-Tum\" Douglas\n* [[Hulk Hogan]] as Dave Dragon\n* Emily Roeske as Little Girl\n* [[Lindsay Felton]] as Jennifer\n* Chelsey Earlywine as Amanda\n* Alan McRae as FBI Agent Sam Douglas\n* Margarita Franco as Jessica Douglas\n* [[Victor Wong (actor, born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Grandpa Mori Tanaka\n* [[Loni Anderson]] as Mary Ann \"Medusa\" Rogers\n* [[Jim Varney]] as Lothar Zogg\n* [[Kirk Baily]] as Carl\n* [[Brendan O'Brien (voice actor)|Brendan O'Brien]] as Zed\n* Travis McKenna as Buelow\n* Dwayne Carrington as C.J.\n* Pat Mahoney as Harry Jacobson\n}}\n\n==Development==\nFilming began in 1996. Hulk Hogan, wrestling in [[World Championship Wrestling]] at the time, wore a wig for the film which resulted in him having a different hairstyle than his traditional bald look. As a result, he is seen in [[Halloween Havoc (1996)|Halloween Havoc '96]] with a similar hairstyle as he had in the film. [[Elitch Gardens Theme Park]], the park at which it was filmed, underwent a complete remodel, with all the signs for the park and rides being changed and renamed for the film. However, there are a few times when the real ones are seen in the background.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had universally negative reviews and is generally considered to be the worst of the four in the series.<ref>{{cite news |title= MOVIE REVIEW : '3 Ninjas: High Noon' a Lively Action Adventure |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/10/entertainment/ca-37770 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151016203142/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/10/entertainment/ca-37770 |archive-date= 2015-10-16 |access-date= 2019-03-02}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 0%, based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{rottentomatoes|3_ninjas_high_noon_at_mega_mountain}}</ref>\n\nJoe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Only small children with limited attention spans will be impressed by the lackluster kung-foolishness\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/3-ninjas-high-noon-on-mega-mountain-1200453425/|title=3 Ninjas: High Noon on Mega Mountain|first1=Joe|last1=Leydon|date=April 9, 1998}}</ref>\nAnita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' says \"things are sad when Hulk Hogan gives the most touching performance in the film\".
