''[[Box Office Mojo]]''. [[Amazon.com]]. Retrieved 2012-01-27.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Finding Neverland''''' is a 2004 [[biographical film|biographical]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[David Magee]], based on the 1998 play ''The Man Who Was Peter Pan'' by [[Allan Knee]]. The film is about playwright [[J. M. Barrie]] and his relationship with a family who inspired him to create ''[[Peter Pan]]''. The film earned seven nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for [[Johnny Depp]], and won for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. The film was the inspiration for the stage musical [[Finding Neverland (musical)|of the same name]] in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1903, following the dismal reception of his latest play, ''Little Mary'', Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons (George, Jack, Peter and Michael) in [[Kensington Gardens]], and a strong, close friendship develops among them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]]. \n\nAlthough Barrie sees this family as wonderful and inspirational, people question his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family. Sylvia was a widow: her husband died from cancer and left her with four boys to bring up on her own. Barrie's wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness. \n\nAlong the way, Barrie goes on adventures with Sylvia and her boys. He too is a boy at heart and spending time with the family is special. Barrie takes those adventures he has with the boys and makes them into a play called ''Peter Pan''.\n\n[[Theatre producer|Producer]] [[Charles Frohman]] skeptically agrees to mount ''Peter Pan'', despite his belief that it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby [[orphan]]age, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. \n\nThe play proves to be a huge success. Barrie is all set for his play, but when Peter arrives alone to the play, he goes to Sylvia's house to check up on her, and misses the show. Peter attends the play and realises the play is about his brothers and Barrie.\n\nSylvia is too ill to attend the premiere, so Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. He gets the actors, props and musicians together in the Llewelyn Davies house. At the end of the play, Peter Pan points to the back doors and implies that Sylvia should go off to Neverland. She takes the hands of her boys and slowly walks out into Neverland. The living room and back garden transform into Neverland and Sylvia continues to walk on her own.\n\nIn the next scene, everyone is at Sylvia's funeral. Barrie discovers that her will says that he and her mother should look after the boys, an arrangement agreeable to both. The film ends with J. M. Barrie comforting Peter on the bench in the park where they first met.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Johnny Depp]] as [[J.M.

Hoffman had appeared a dozen years earlier in the title role of the Peter Pan sequel ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991). The original screenplay for this film included a scene in which his character &ndash; the play's sceptical producer &ndash; was to put on the [[Captain Hook]] costume and read some of his lines to point out how silly he found it. Hoffman objected to this, so the scene was rewritten for him to simply read aloud and ridicule character names from the play.\n\nThe [[Llewelyn Davies boys]] are portrayed by [[Freddie Highmore]] ([[Peter Llewelyn Davies|Peter]]), Nick Roud ([[George Llewelyn Davies|George]]), Joe Prospero ([[Jack Llewelyn Davies|Jack]]) and Luke Spill ([[Michael Llewelyn Davies|Michael]]). Highmore's performance in this film led Johnny Depp to suggest him to [[Tim Burton]] for ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', in which Highmore played Charlie Bucket and Depp played [[Willy Wonka]].<ref>Karger, Dave (2005-01-05).

[[Mackenzie Crook]] plays Mr. Jaspers, the theatre usher. [[Paul Whitehouse]] plays the stage manager. [[Eileen Essell]], 82 years old at the time, makes one of her first feature film appearances, as Mrs. Snow, an elderly friend and fan of Barrie's. Like Highmore, she also followed Depp to a role in ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''. [[Jimmy Gardner (actor)|Jimmy Gardner]] plays her husband.\n\n==Production==\n''Finding Neverland'' was originally scheduled to be released in the autumn of 2003. [[Universal Pictures]], which owned the film rights to Barrie's original play and was [[Peter Pan (2003 film)|adapting it for cinema release the same year]], refused to allow [[Miramax]] to use scenes from the play in ''Finding Neverland'' if it were released during the same year. Miramax agreed to delay the release in exchange for the rights to reproduce scenes from the stage production within the film.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mohr|first=Ian|date=2005-07-17|title=Escape from limbo-land|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/features/escape-from-limbo-land-1117926042/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Finding Neverland'' opened in 2004, 100 years after Barrie's play opened.\n\n[[Richmond Theatre]] in [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]] doubled as the ''[[Duke of York's Theatre]]'' \u2013 the venue in which ''Peter Pan'' was first presented.

It could appeal to everyone from preteens to pensioners, or it could appeal to no one at all. Ultimately this unconventionality is probably one of the film\u2019s main strengths. And if the tone veers a little haphazardly between fantasy and cold, hard reality, well, perhaps that is the most effective way of taking us into the mind of the film's mercurial [[protagonist]].\"<ref>Ide, Wendy (2004-10-28).

Winslet's no-nonsense strength is especially appreciated\u2026 Another actress would have followed Depp into the quicksand of faux-poetic self-indulgence.
