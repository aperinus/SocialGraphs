The screenplay was an adaptation by [[Morton S. Fine]] and [[David Friedkin]] from the [[The Pawnbroker|novel of the same name]] by [[Edward Lewis Wallant]].\n\nThe film was the first produced entirely in the United States to deal with [[the Holocaust]] from the viewpoint of a survivor.<ref name='Imaginarywitness'/> It earned international acclaim for Steiger, launching his career as an A-list actor.<ref name='TCMoverview'/> It was among the first American films to feature a [[homosexual]] character and [[Nudity in film|nudity]] during the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], and was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. Although it was publicly announced to be a special exception, the controversy proved to be first of similar major challenges to the Code that ultimately led to its abrogation.<ref name='Leff'/>\n\nIn 2008, ''The Pawnbroker'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-08-237/2008-entries-to-national-film-registry-announced/2008-12-30/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Nazi Germany]], Sol Nazerman, a [[German-Jewish]] university professor, is sent to a [[concentration camp]] along with his family. He witnesses his two children die and his wife [[rape]]d by [[Nazi]] officers before she is killed.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Nazerman is haunted by his memories. He operates a [[pawnshop]] in an [[East Harlem]] slum while living in an anonymous [[Long Island]] housing tract with his sister-in-law, who is also a [[Holocaust]] survivor, and her husband. Numbed and alienated by his experiences, he has trained himself not to show emotion. He describes himself as beyond bitter, viewing the poor people around him as \"scum\" and \"rejects.\" He acts uninterested and cynical towards his desperate customers and gives them much less than their pawned goods are worth.\n\nNazerman is idolized by Jesus Ortiz, an ambitious young [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] who lives with his mother and works for Nazerman as his shop assistant. Ortiz's girlfriend is a prostitute who works for Rodriguez, a [[racketeering|racketeer]] who uses the pawnshop as a front. After hours, Nazerman teaches Ortiz about [[precious metal]] appraisal and money, the only thing he still values. Ortiz refers to Nazerman as his \"teacher\" but his attempts at friendship are rebuffed. Nazerman is also pursued by Marilyn Birchfield, a neighborhood [[social work]]er who wants to get to know him better, but he keeps her at arm's length. When his father-in-law dies, he offers his wife no sympathy.\n\nOrtiz's girlfriend tries to pawn jewelry to help fund his plan to open a shop; she offers her body to Nazerman to make more money, but he rejects her. When she tells him she works for Rodriguez, he realizes that Rodriguez owes much of his wealth to the [[brothels]] he owns and runs. Nazerman recalls his wife's degradation and tells Rodriguez he no longer wants to do business with him. He also tells Ortiz that he means nothing to him. Crushed by the comment, Ortiz arranges for the pawnshop to be robbed by a neighborhood gang led by Tangee. Meanwhile, Rodriguez and a henchman visit the pawnshop, beating and threatening to kill Nazerman when he refuses to cooperate. In his suicidal despair, he tells them to kill him. Rodriguez promises him that he will die soon.\n\nDuring the robbery by Tangee's gang, Nazerman refuses to hand over his money. A member of the gang pulls a gun and, in trying to save Nazerman, Ortiz is shot. The gang flees and Ortiz drags himself out onto the street. Nazerman stumbles out of his shop and silently sobs while Ortiz dies. Ortiz's body is taken away by ambulance and Nazerman goes back inside. He impales his hand on a receipt spike before wandering away from the shop.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Rod steiger in the pawnbroker.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Rod Steiger]] in ''The Pawnbroker]]\n* [[Rod Steiger]] \u2013 Sol Nazerman\n* [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] \u2013 Marilyn Birchfield\n* [[Brock Peters]] \u2013 Rodriguez\n* [[Jaime S\u00e1nchez (actor)|Jaime S\u00e1nchez]] \u2013 Jesus Ortiz\n* [[Thelma Oliver]] \u2013 Ortiz's girl\n* [[Eusebia Cosme]] - Mrs. Ortiz (Jesus' mother)<ref>{{cite book |last=Lopez |first=Antonio |title=Unbecoming Blackness: The Diaspora Cultures of Afro-Cuban America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVsTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA107 |year=2012 |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-8147-6549-4|page=107}}</ref>\n* [[Marketa Kimbrell]] \u2013 Tessie\n* [[Baruch Lumet]] \u2013 Mendel\n* [[Juano Hern\u00e1ndez]] \u2013 Mr. Smith\n* [[Linda Geiser]] \u2013 Ruth Nazerman\n* Nancy R.

Lumet told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in an interview during the filming that, \"The irony of the film is that he finds more life here than anywhere. It's outside [[Harlem]], in [[housing project]]s, office buildings, even the [[Long Island]] suburbs, everywhere we show on the screen\u2014that everything is conformist, sterile, dead.\"<ref name='Timescrowds'/>\n\nThe film used [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to reveal Nazerman's [[backstory]]. According to a review on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] website, it has some similarities to two films of [[Alain Resnais]]: ''[[Night and Fog (1955 film)|Night and Fog]]'' (1955) and ''[[Hiroshima mon Amour]]'' (1959). A recent commentator observed that the film \"is uniquely American, with its harsh, unforgiving depiction of New York City, all of it brought to vivid life by [[Boris Kaufman]]'s black and white cinematography and a dynamic cast highlighted by Rod Steiger's searing portrayal of the title role.\"<ref name='TCMoverview'/>\n\n''New York Times'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote that Sol Nazerman \"is very much a person of today\u2014a survivor of Nazi persecution who has become detached and remote in the modern world\u2014he casts, as it were, the somber shadow of the legendary, ageless [[Wandering Jew]]. That is the mythical [[Judea]]n who taunted [[Jesus]] on the way to [[Calvary]] and was condemned to roam the world a lonely outcast until Jesus should come again.\"<ref name='Timesreview'/>\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Development===\nThe film initially was considered for production in [[London]], in order to take advantage of financial incentives then available for filmmakers.<ref name='Leff'/>\n\nDirectors [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Karel Reisz]] and [[Franco Zeffirelli]] turned down the project. Kubrick said he thought Steiger was not \"all that exciting.\" Reisz, whose parents were murdered in the Holocaust, said that for \"deep, personal\" reasons he \"could not objectively associate himself with any subject which has a background of concentration camps.\" Zeffirelli, then a stage director, was anxious to direct a film, but said that ''The Pawnbroker'' was \"not the kind of subject [he] would wish to direct, certainly not as his first Anglo-American venture.\"<ref name='Leff'/>\n\n===Casting===\nSteiger became involved in the project in 1962, a year after the Wallant novel was published, and was involved in an early reworking of the film's script.<ref name='Leff'/> He received $50,000 for his performance, far lower than his usual rate, because he trusted Lumet, with whom he had worked on television in the series ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]''.<ref name='TCMoverview'/>\n\nLumet, who took over the film after [[Arthur Hiller]] was fired, initially had misgivings about Steiger being cast in the lead role. He felt that Steiger \"was a rather tasteless actor\u2014awfully talented, but completely tasteless in his choices.\" Lumet preferred [[James Mason]] for the role, and the comedian [[Groucho Marx]] was among the performers who had wanted to play Nazerman.<ref name='Leff'/> However, Steiger pleasantly surprised Lumet when he agreed with him during rehearsals on the repression of the character's feelings. Lumet felt that ultimately Steiger \"worked out fine.\"<ref name='Pictures'>{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Mark | title = Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood | publisher = Penguin Group | year = 2008 | pages = 173\u2013176 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_T9tCvzIFrcC&q=The+PAwnbroker+steiger&pg=PA174 | isbn = 978-1-59420-152-3 }}</ref>\n\nIn a 1999 television interview, [[Rod Steiger]] revealed an inspiration he took from an unlikely source of art. Over a quarter of a century after artist [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1937 ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', the painting inspired emotional artistic depth again when, in 1964, Steiger borrowed the silent anguish of the skyward cry of the suffering female subject, seen at the right of the canvas. The scene in the film was in the last minutes of ''The Pawnbroker''.\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' considered Brock Peters the first actor to portray a confirmed [[homosexual]] character in an American film.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 9, 1967|page=7|title=Homo Theme 'Breakthrough'|last=Byron|first=Stuart}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in New York City, mainly on location and with minimal sets, in the fall of 1963.<ref name='Leff'/> Much of the filming took place on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in Harlem, where the pawnbroker shop was set at 1642 Park Avenue, near the intersection of Park Ave. and 116th Street.

The scene with Oliver, who played a prostitute, was intercut with a flashback to the concentration camp, in which Nazerman is forced to watch his wife (Geiser) and other women raped by Nazi officers. The nudity resulted in a \"C\" (condemned) rating from the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]].<ref name='TCMoverview'/><ref name='Leff'/> The Legion felt \"that a condemnation is necessary in order to put a very definite halt to the effort by producers to introduce nudity into American films.\"<ref name='Leff'/> The Legion of Decency's stance was opposed by some Catholic groups, and the National Council of Churches gave the film an award for best picture of the year.<ref name='Pictures'/>\n\nThe scenes resulted in conflict with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which administered the [[Hays Code|Motion Picture Production Code]]. The Association initially rejected the scenes showing bare breasts and a sex scene between Sanchez and Oliver, which it described as \"unacceptably sex suggestive and lustful.\" Despite the rejection, Landau arranged for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] to release the film without the Production Code seal, and New York censors licensed ''The Pawnbroker'' without the cuts demanded by Code administrators. On a 6-3 vote, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] granted the film an \"exception\" conditional on \"reduction in the length of the scenes which the Production Code Administration found unapprovable.\" The exception to the code was granted as a \"special and unique case,\" and was described by ''The New York Times'' at the time as \"an unprecedented move that will not, however, set a precedent.\"<ref name='Pictures'/> The requested reductions of nudity were minimal, and the outcome was viewed in the media as a victory for the film's producers.<ref name='Leff'/>\n\n==Critical reaction==\nThe film, and Steiger's performance in particular, was greeted by widespread critical acclaim.<ref name='Leff'/> ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine praised Steiger's \"endless versatility.\" [[Brendan Gill]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': \"By a magic more mysterious. . . than his always clever makeup, he manages to convince me at once that he is whoever he pretends to be.\"<ref name='Pictures'/>\n\n''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] called it a \"remarkable picture\" that was \"a dark and haunting drama of a man who has reasonably eschewed a role of involvement and compassion in a brutal and bitter world and has found his life barren and rootless as a consequence. It is further a drama of discovery of the need of man to try to do something for his fellow human sufferers in the troubled world of today.\" He praised the performances in the film, including the supporting cast.<ref name='Timesreview'>{{cite news | first=Bosley | last=Crowther |author-link= Bosley Crowther | title=The Pawnbroker | date=April 21, 1965 | url =https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF1739E773BC4951DFB266838E679EDE&scp=3&sq=The%20Pawnbroker&st=cse | work =The New York Times | access-date = March 10, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nOne negative review came from [[Pauline Kael]], who called it \"trite\", but said: \"You can see the big pushes for powerful effects, yet it isn't negligible. It wrenches audiences, making them fear that they, too, could become like this man. And when events strip off his armor, he doesn't discover a new, warm humanity, he discovers sharper suffering\u2014just what his armor had protected him from. Most of the intensity comes from Steiger's performance.\"<ref name='TCMoverview'/>\n\nSome Jewish groups urged a boycott of the film, in the view that its presentation of a Jewish pawnbroker encouraged [[anti-Semitism]]. Black groups felt it encouraged [[racial stereotype]]s of the inner city residents as pimps, prostitutes or drug addicts. <ref name=\"TCMoverview\" /> \n\n==Legacy==\nThe film has become known as the first major American film that even tried to recreate the horrors of the camps of the Jewish [[Holocaust]].

''The Pawnbroker'' was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval.
