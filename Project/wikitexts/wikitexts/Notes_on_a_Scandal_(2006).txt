Adapted from the [[Notes on a Scandal|2003 novel of the same name]] by [[Zo\u00eb Heller]], the screenplay was written by [[Patrick Marber]]. The film stars [[Judi Dench]] and [[Cate Blanchett]] and centres on a lonely veteran teacher who uncovers a fellow teacher's illicit affair with an underage student.\n\nIt was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] \u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nBarbara Covett is a history teacher at a [[comprehensive school]] in [[London]]. Having never married and nearing retirement, she has contempt for her students and fellow teachers. Her only comfort is her diary. When a new art teacher, Sheba Hart, joins the staff, Barbara is immediately attracted to her and they strike up a friendship. In Barbara, this friendship quickly turns into infatuation and obsession. Sheba is married to the much older Richard, and is just re-entering the work force after devoting herself to her [[special needs]] son.\n\nBarbara later witnesses Sheba in a sexual encounter with a 15-year-old student named Steven Connolly at the school. When Barbara confronts her, she recounts all the details of her involvement with the boy, but Sheba asks her not to tell the school administration until after Christmas, as she wants to be with her family. Barbara claims she has no intention of reporting her, providing Sheba ends the illicit relationship immediately, but Barbara secretly plans to use the affair as a means of manipulating Sheba. Over the Christmas break, Barbara visits her sister, who asks her about another young teacher Barbara befriended. Barbara stiffly says that the young teacher moved away. Barbara's sister asks if she has any other female \"friends\", strongly implying Barbara is a  lesbian; Barbara insists she has no idea what her sister is talking about.\n\nSheba tells Steven that the affair is over yet finds herself unable to stop seeing him. However, when she refuses to give in to Barbara's increasing demands on her time and attention, Barbara reveals the secret to a male teacher who has told her that he is attracted to Sheba. The teacher informs the student's parents and the school. After the affair becomes public, the headteacher accuses Barbara of knowing about the affair and not notifying the authorities. He also learns that a former teacher at the school, the young lady Barbara mentioned at Christmas, had taken out a restraining order against Barbara for stalking her and her fianc\u00e9. Both Sheba and Barbara are fired.\n\nSheba's husband asks her to move out of their home, so she moves into Barbara's house, unaware that Barbara is the reason she was found out and believing the affair became known because Steven confessed it to his mother.  When Sheba discovers Barbara's diary and learns it was Barbara who leaked the story of the affair, she confronts Barbara and strikes her in anger. A row ensues, and Sheba runs outside to a crowd of reporters and photographers. When she becomes hemmed in by them, Barbara rescues her.\n\nSheba's emotions spent, she quietly tells Barbara that she had initiated the friendship with her because she liked her and that they could have been friends. Barbara says, \"I need more than a friend\". Sheba leaves Barbara, placing the journal on the table as a mute reminder that she had kept its contents secret, and returns to her husband. Sheba is subsequently sentenced to 10 months in prison, however, it is strongly implied she reconciled with her family.\n\nLater, Barbara meets another younger woman who is reading a newspaper about the Sheba Hart affair. Barbara says she was acquainted with Sheba but says they hardly knew each other. Barbara introduces herself, invites the other woman to a concert, and the pair continue to talk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Barbara Covett\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Sheba Hart\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Richard Hart\n* [[Andrew Simpson (actor)|Andrew Simpson]] as Steven Connolly\n* [[Tom Georgeson]] as Ted Mawson\n* [[Michael Maloney]] as Sandy Pabblem\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Sue Hodge\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Bill Rumer\n* [[Emma Kennedy|Emma Williams]] as Linda\n* [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as Brian Bangs\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Polly Hart\n* Max Lewis as Ben Hart\n* [[Anne-Marie Duff]] as Annabel\n* [[Julia McKenzie]] as Marjorie\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Filming==\nFilming took place in August and September 2005.
