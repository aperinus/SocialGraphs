Butterfly''''' is a 1993  [[Americans|American]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[David Cronenberg]]. The screenplay was written by [[David Henry Hwang]] based on his [[M. Butterfly|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[John Lone]], with [[Ian Richardson]], [[Barbara Sukowa]], and [[Annabel Leventon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107468/|title=M. Butterfly (1993)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLoosely based on true events (see [[Bernard Boursicot]] and [[Shi Pei Pu]]), the film concerns Ren\u00e9 Gallimard ([[Jeremy Irons]]), a [[French people|French]] diplomat assigned to [[Beijing]], [[China]], in the 1960s. He becomes infatuated with a [[Peking opera]] performer, Song Liling ([[John Lone]]), who [[Espionage|spies]] on him for the Government of the People's Republic of China. Their affair lasts for 20 years and they subsequently marry, with Gallimard all the while apparently unaware (or willfully ignorant) of the fact that in Peking opera, ''[[Dan (Chinese opera)|Dan]]'' roles are traditionally performed by men. At the end of the film Gallimard kills himself (although the man he is based on, [[Bernard Boursicot]], did not do this in real life.)\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Ren\u00e9 Gallimard\n* [[John Lone]] as Song Liling\n* [[Ian Richardson]] as Ambassador Toulon\n* [[Barbara Sukowa]] as Jeanne Gallimard\n* [[Annabel Leventon]] as Frau Baden\n* [[Shizuko Hoshi]] as Comrade Chin\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Agent Entacelin\n\n==Themes==\nOne theme of the film (as with the play) is [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] stereotypes, but Cronenberg removed many of the political overtones from the story{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} in order to focus more intensely on the relationship between Gallimard and Song.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} A key line in the film is \"Only a man knows how a woman is supposed to act.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''M. Butterfly'' grossed  $1,500,000 in the domestic box office.<ref>{{mojo title|mbutterfly|M. Butterfly}}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 43%, based on 21 reviews, and an average rating of 5.60/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"David Cronenberg reins in his provocative sensibility and handles delicate material with restraint, yielding a disappointing adaptation that flattens ''M. Butterfly'' into a tedious soap opera.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|m_butterfly|M. Butterfly}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=M.
