It stars [[Michael Douglas]] as a mentally ill man who thinks he has discovered buried treasure, and [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as his weary daughter.\n\n==Plot==\n16-year-old Miranda has been abandoned by her mother, and has dropped out of school. She supports herself working at [[McDonald's]] while her father, Charlie, is in a [[mental institution]].\n\nWhen Charlie is released, Miranda finds the relatively peaceful existence she's built for herself disrupted. Charlie is supposed to have recovered, but he rambles on with strange theories. For example, he tells her that naked Chinese men are swimming ashore so they can live in California. He is also obsessed with the idea that the long-lost treasure of [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried near their suburban [[California]] house in the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. Armed with a metal detector and a stack of treasure-hunting books, he finds reason to believe that the gold is underneath the local [[Costco]], and encourages Miranda to get a job there so they can plan a way to excavate it.\n\nInitially skeptical, Miranda finds herself joining in Charlie's questionable antics to give him one last shot at accomplishing his dreams. She starts working at Costco and ingratiates herself with the manager and his \"swingers\" group, giving her a chance to steal a master key. She, Charlie, and their friend Pepper use the key to enter the Costco after hours, setting off an alarm\u2014but Pepper quickly reprograms it to make it seem it was triggered by a propane leak. They hide inside until firefighters have come and gone, then begin drilling through the floor, where they find a smelly underground river. Charlie dons scuba gear, dives into the river, then emerges, claims it is indeed where the treasure is buried. Meanwhile, Pepper, standing watch outside, is spotted by a police patrol. Worried that they will notice lights inside the store, he speeds off to divert them. When they catch up with him and arrest him, they find the walkie-talkie he was using to communicate with Miranda and Charlie, and deduce that a robbery is taking place at the store.\n\nCharlie emerges from the river. He gives Miranda a tag and tells her not to lose it. When the police arrive at the Costco, Charlie is seen carrying a small, heavy chest, hiding from the police. He jumps into the river again, swims farther, and sees a bright light and swims towards it. Miranda's off-screen voice says that Charlie's body was never found, although he is seen still alive, swimming in the river.\n\nThe next day, Miranda visits Costco and finds the product the tag belongs to, a dishwasher different than the one which she had previously admired. Using a credit card Charlie obtained for her, she buys it and takes it to the beach in her old car. When she opens it, she is seen bathed in a golden glow and a slow smile spreads across her face, implying that Charlie has cached the gold inside it. Hearing a commotion on the beach, she finds naked Chinese men coming ashore.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Charlie\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Miranda\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as young Miranda\n* [[Willis Burks II]] as Pepper\n* Laura Kachergus as Rita\n* [[Paul Lieber]] as Doug\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Kelly\n* Greg Davis Jr. as Chuchu\n* [[Angel Oquendo]] as Younger cop\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as McDonald's customer\n* [[Will Rothhaar]] as Security guard\n* Jason Auer as Costco Employee\n\n==Production==\nDirector-screenwriter Mike Cahill wrote a draft of the script in the mid-1980s, but wasn't pleased with it and put it away, focusing instead on writing novels. He turned down an offer to finance the film because he refused to shoot it in [[Albuquerque]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lytal|first=Cristy|title=With a little help from his friends|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/11/entertainment/et-cahill11|accessdate=29 March 2011|date=11 September 2007|quote=At least two deals fell apart, one because Cahill didn't want to substitute Albuquerque for Southern California.
