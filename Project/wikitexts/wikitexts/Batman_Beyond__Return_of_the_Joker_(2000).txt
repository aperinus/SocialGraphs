Animation]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]]. It is the third film in the [[DC Animated Universe]] and is based on the animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' while also serving as a continuation of and resolving plot points from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.\n\n''Return of the Joker'' features the [[DC Comics]] superheroes [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] ([[Kevin Conroy]]) and [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] ([[Will Friedle]]), as they try and unravel the mysterious return of the former's archenemy, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]). Following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the film received heavy edits that delayed its release from a Halloween 2000 to December 12, 2000. An uncut version was subsequently released on DVD in 2002, to generally positive reviews. The film takes place during the third and final season of ''Batman Beyond''.\n\n==Plot==\nA new faction of the [[Jokerz]] gang\u2014consisting of Bonk, Woof, Ghoul, Chucko and the Dee-Dee twins\u2014attempts to steal high-tech electronic equipment, but they are intercepted by [[Batman]] ([[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]]), the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Bruce Wayne]]. The gang reports back to their leader, revealed to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], who was Bruce's nemesis and has mysteriously reappeared in Gotham following his presumed death years ago. The Joker kills Bonk for defiance and to intimidate the other members.\n\nLater, the Jokerz attack a [[press conference]] commemorating Bruce's return to [[Wayne Enterprises]] and the Joker reveals himself to Bruce, who insists that it cannot be him despite evidence to the contrary. After fending off the attack, Terry demands information from Bruce and [[Gotham City Police Department]]'s Commissioner [[Barbara Gordon]], the former [[Batgirl]], but neither gives him answers. Eventually, Bruce orders Terry to return the Batsuit so he can investigate and confront the Joker on his own despite the limitations of his age. However, the Jokerz attack Terry, nearly killing his girlfriend [[Dana Tan]], while the Joker poisons Bruce and his [[Great Dane]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]\u2014revealing he knows Bruce was Batman and that Terry is his successor.\n\nAfter Terry saves Bruce's life with an antidote, Barbara finally explains the Joker's disappearance albeit reluctantly; [[The New Batman Adventures|Four decades ago]], sometime following [[Dick Grayson]]'s departure from Gotham City to [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]], the Joker and [[Harley Quinn]] kidnapped his successor [[Tim Drake]], then [[Robin (character)|Robin]], while he was on patrol, inflicting three weeks of torture and brainwashing on him at the abandoned [[Arkham Asylum]] to learn Batman's secrets. When Batman and Batgirl found Tim, he was altered by the Joker's chemicals to match him, albeit as a miniature version. A fight ensued, during which Tim turned on and killed the Joker, suffering a complete [[nervous breakdown]], while Harley fell down a ravine and was presumed dead. After he recovered a year later with help from Wayne family friend, Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]], Tim was forced into retirement by Bruce who blamed himself for the whole ordeal, severing his ties with the latter and left to make it on his own in life.\n\nTerry visits Tim, who voices bitterness towards his past as Robin but denies any involvement in the Joker's return. Terry's next suspect is Jordan Pryce, a Wayne Enterprises executive who hates Bruce for ruining his chance to take over Wayne Enterprises, but he only finds Pryce guilty of conspiring with the Jokerz to have Bruce killed. When the beam of a [[directed-energy weapon]] strikes Pryce's yacht from above, Terry rescues Pryce before turning him in to the police. In the Batcave, after realizing the Joker only destroyed the Robin costume, Terry recalls Tim's grudge against his old persona and deduces he must be involved; cross-referencing Tim's expertise as a telecommunications engineer with the Jokerz' thefts, Terry and Bruce discover the stolen equipment can create a jamming system to seize control of a laser-armed [[military satellite]].\n\nWhen Terry goes to face Tim, he triggers a trap set by the Joker, who he then follows to an abandoned candy factory after surviving further attacks from the satellite. Subduing the Jokerz with Ace's help, Terry confronts the Joker, who gloats he encoded himself into a microchip built with genetic technology hidden behind Tim's ear\u2014allowing him to survive his death by turning Tim into the Joker's host, who is on the verge of completely taking over Tim. With the satellite, the Joker plans to kill Bruce and Terry's loved ones before destroying [[Gotham City]]. As they battle, Terry uses one of the Joker's joy buzzers to destroy both the weapon and the microchip, saving the city and freeing Tim as the Joker finally meets his end.\n\nFollowing the Jokerz' arrests, Barbara hides Tim's unwitting involvement to protect him with the Joker declared dead in the factory's explosion, while the Dee-Dee twins are bailed out by their grandmother\u2014an elderly Harley Quinn, who survived her fall and reformed. Bruce makes amends with Tim and Barbara while Tim recovers in the hospital, during which Bruce and Tim acknowledge Terry as worthy to carry the mantle of the Bat.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Will Friedle]] as [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis / Batman]]\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (character)|Joker]] & Jordan Pryce\n* [[Angie Harmon]] as [[Barbara Gordon|Commissioner Barbara Gordon]]\n** [[Tara Strong]] as Young Barbara Gordon / Batgirl\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as [[Tim Drake]]\n** [[Mathew Valencia]] as  Young Tim Drake / Robin\n** [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] as Joker Jr. / J.J (credited as \"Laughing Boy\")\n* [[Arleen Sorkin]] as [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]] & Amy\n* [[Melissa Joan Hart]] as Delia and Deidre Dennis / Dee Dee\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Stewart Carter Winthrop III / Ghoul\n* [[Don Patrick Harvey]] as Charles Buntz / Chucko\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as Benjamin Knox / Bonk\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Woof the Hyena-Man / <br>[[Ace the Bat-Hound]]\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Dana Tan\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Chelsea Cunningham\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Mary McGinnis\n* [[Ryan O'Donohue]] as Matthew \"Matt\" McGinnis\n* [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]] as Ms. Joyce Carr\n* [[Mary Scheer]] as Mrs. Drake\n* [[Jason Stanford (actor)|Jason Stanford]] as a Gangster\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production and release ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Jokerdeath.jpg\n | image2    = Joker death (edited).jpg\n | footer    = The Joker's death in the unedited version of the film (top) compared to his death in the edited version (bottom)\n}}\nThe film was initially put into production after the cancellation of [[Boyd Kirkland]]'s ''Batman: Arkham'', the intended sequel to ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Backstage - Rejected/Unproduced Series & Movie Pitches |url=https://dcanimated.com//WF/sections/backstage/abandoned/ |website=The World's Finest |publisher=popgeeks.com |access-date=5 February 2021}}</ref> When [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Glen Murakami]] were given the [[green-light]] to produce a ''Batman Beyond'' feature-length film, they decided to use the extra time to answer questions pertaining to the time period between ''Beyond'' and the rest of the [[DC Animated Universe]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dini |first1=Paul |title=Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, The Official Screenplay |date=4 February 2021 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-8230-7717-5 |page=6 |url=https://archive.org/details/batmanbeyondretu00dini |access-date=5 February 2021}}</ref> [[Will Friedle]], [[Kevin Conroy]], and [[Mark Hamill]] reprised their roles as Terry McGinnis, Bruce Wayne, and the Joker, respectively, while [[Dean Stockwell]] and [[Angie Harmon]] joined the voice cast as Tim Drake and Barbara Gordon respectively while [[Mathew Valencia]] and [[Tara Strong]] reprised their younger versions from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.

The most dramatic change was the method of the Joker's death: rather than being shot and killed by Tim Drake, he is instead [[Electrocution|electrocuted]] after becoming tangled in water tubing.
