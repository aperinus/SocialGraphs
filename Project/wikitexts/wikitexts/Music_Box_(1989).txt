The plot revolves around his daughter, an [[Lawyer|attorney]], who defends him, and her struggle to uncover the truth.\n\nThe film was written by [[Joe Eszterhas]] and directed by [[Costa-Gavras]]. It stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]], [[Frederic Forrest]], [[Donald Moffat]] and [[Lukas Haas]]. The film won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/03_preistr_ger_1990/03_Preistraeger_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Prize Winners |access-date=2011-03-20 |website=Berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nIt is loosely based on the real life case of [[John Demjanjuk]] and also on [[Joe Eszterhas]]' own life. Eszterhas learned at age 45 that his father, Count Istv\u00e1n Esterh\u00e1zy, had concealed his wartime involvement in Hungary's [[Fascist]] and militantly [[racist]] [[Arrow Cross Party]]. According to Eszterhas, his father \"organized [[book burning]]s and had cranked out the vilest [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] propaganda imaginable.\"<ref name=\"Crossbearer\">{{cite book |title=Crossbearer: a memoir of faith |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2008 |author=Joe Esztherhas |isbn=978-0-312-38596-5 |oclc=213300974 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/crossbearermemoi00eszt }}</ref>{{rp|201}} After this discovery, he severed all contact with his father, never reconciling before Istv\u00e1n's death.\n\nAccording to Joe Eszterhas's book, \"Hollywood Animal\", he wrote the screenplay for the Music Box almost ten years before finding out the truth about his father.  He even gave his father a copy of the script to read before the movie was made, never thinking that his life would soon reflect his art.\n\n==Plot==\nHungarian immigrant Michael J. Laszlo faces having his [[U.S. citizenship|US citizenship]] revoked after being accused of [[war crimes]] during [[Second World War|WWII]]. Laszlo insists it is mistaken identity. His daughter, Ann Talbot, a [[Chicago]] defence attorney, resolves to defend her father in court.\n\nProsecuting attorney Jack Burke of the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]] claims that the supposedly upstanding and affable family man, Laszlo, is \"Mishka,\" the former commander of an Arrow Cross [[death squad]]. During the [[Siege of Budapest]], Mishka's unit sadistically tortured, raped, and murdered scores of [[Hungarian Jews]], [[Hungarian Gypsies|Roma]], and their Gentile protectors. Meanwhile, Laszlo's bank accounts reveal large payments to Tibor Zoldan, a fellow Hungarian immigrant. Laszlo claims these were unpaid loans to a destitute friend who had been recently killed in a hit-and-run car accident.\n\nAt the hearing the few survivors give grisly testimony describing the crimes committed by Mishka's unit. All identify Laszlo as their torturer. Equally damning is an authenticated Arrow Cross identification card bearing Laszlo's photograph and the name, \"Laszlo Miklos.\" Laszlo claims it is a frame-up by [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary's then Communist government]] and its [[secret police]], the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VO]]. He further claims it is retaliation for his protest against the US tour of a Hungarian dance troupe several years earlier.\n\nAnn locates a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[defector]] who testifies about the [[KGB]]'s program of flawlessly forging documents to frame anti-Communists in the West. The defector further explains that this technique was shared with every [[secret police]] service in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. He says that the Hungarian \u00c1VO was interested in this tactic. This revelation, combined with Ann's questioning the reliability of witnesses still living under a [[police state]], throws Burke's case into serious doubt.\n\nBurke announces a witness will testify that Michael Laszlo is \"Mishka.\" The infirm witness is unable to leave [[Budapest]], so Ann, Burke, and Judge Irwin Silver travel to Hungary. Laszlo refuses to go, claiming Communists will assassinate him if he returns. Before Ann's departure her legal assistant provides more details about Tibor Zoldan and believes he was [[blackmail]]ing Laszlo.\n\nIn Budapest a mysterious man claiming to be Laszlo's friend visits Ann at her hotel and leaves her a folder of documents. The next day, after hearing the witnesses' damning testimony, Ann produces the documents \u2014 signed past affidavits in which witnesses identified three different men as \"Mishka.\"\n\nJudge Silver then dismisses the prosecution's case. A dejected Burke says that, while it is too late to save the victims, it is important to remember what happened to them, and claims Ann is denying the truth. He urges her to visit the bridge where Mishka threw his victims into the [[Danube River]]. During that time, the [[Red Army]] was [[Battle of Berlin|storming Berlin]] and the war was effectively over, yet Hungarians were still massacring Jews. Ann reacts angrily to his suggestion.\n\nAs Ann is driven back to her hotel, the taxi crosses the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Sz\u00e9chenyi L\u00e1nch\u00edd]] bridge where Mishka's executions took place. Ann asks the driver to stop, then gets out to view the site. Later, she visits Magda Zoldan, Tibor's sister, who lives in Budapest. Magda mentions that the [[Chicago Police Department]] sent her Tibor's wallet. She produces a [[pawn shop]] ticket taken from it and implores Ann to retrieve whatever Tibor pawned and send it to her. Before leaving, Ann notices a photo of young Tibor with a characteristic scar on his left face; she realises he was Mischka's Arrow Cross partner in the atrocities that the witnesses described.\n\nBack in Chicago, Ann goes to the pawn shop to redeem Tibor's music box. Ann switches it on and, as it plays, old black-and-white photographs slowly emerge from the mechanism. The photos depict a youthful Michael Laszlo in an Arrow Cross uniform\u2014sadistically torturing and murdering Jews. Ann, visibly sickened by her father's guilt, accuses him of being Mishka and killing Tibor Zoldan. Laszlo claims the Communists have poisoned Ann against him.\n\nIn the film's climax, Ann tells her father that she never wants herself or her son, Mikey, to see him again. Laszlo says Mikey will never believe her, then goes outside to play with his grandson. Ann composes a letter to Jack Burke and encloses Tibor Zoldan's photographs and the negatives in the envelope. When the news of Laszlo's suspected war crimes is reported in the news, Ann talks to Mikey about his beloved grandfather.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits plus Magda Zoldan character prominent in outcome, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Ann Talbot\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Mike Laszlo\n* [[Frederic Forrest]] as Jack Burke\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Harry Talbot\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Karchy Laszlo\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Mikey Talbot\n* [[James Zagel]] (credited as J.S.

Both [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] were in talks with Costa-Gavras to play the part of Mike Laszlo. Ultimately Gavras selected Armin Mueller-Stahl, who had wanted to work with Gavras since being impressed by his craft after seeing ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]''. Mueller-Stahl, an East-German defector, had difficulty obtaining a U.S. visa, as he was suspected of ties to the [[Stasi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/features/article_1253866.php/An_Evening_with_Costa-Gavras |title=An Evening with Costa-Gavras - Monsters and Critics |access-date=2009-05-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927032418/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/features/article_1253866.php/An_Evening_with_Costa-Gavras |archive-date=2012-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nJessica Lange, who is usually a devot\u00e9e of [[method acting]], whereby you live as the character you're playing, chose to approach her character in ''Music Box'' differently because \"there was nothing in my own experiences of betrayal, disappointment and heartbreak that could compare to the character's.\" Instead she \"tried to approach it as a child approaches a game of make-believe.

Among his complaints were that the film was \"not about guilt or innocence; it is a courtroom thriller, with all of the usual automatic devices like last-minute evidence and surprise witnesses\" and that \"Nazism is used only as a plot device, as a convenient way to make a man into a monster without having to spend much time convincing us of it.\" Foremost was his frustration that little attempt was made to understand Mike Laszlo, and that \"the old man, who should be the central character if this movie took itself seriously, is only a pawn.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Music Box movie review |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/music-box-1990 |website=RogerEbert.com |language=en |date=January 19, 1990}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was even more critical of the film, doubting it existed for any purpose other than to get Jessica Lange an Oscar nomination, bluntly stating \"real-life tragedy has been used to hype cheap melodrama.
