The story follows two friends, [[Mikey Waters|Mike Waters]] and Scott Favor, played by [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] respectively, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from [[Portland, Oregon]], to Mike's hometown in [[Idaho]], and then to [[Rome]] in search of Mike's mother.\n\nVan Sant wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 novel ''[[City of Night]]'' and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of [[Male prostitution|street hustlers]] was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as an update of the ''Henry IV'' plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After he sent his script to Reeves, and Reeves showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film.\n\n''My Own Private Idaho'' had its premiere at the [[48th Venice International Film Festival]], and received largely positive reviews from critics, including [[Roger Ebert]] and those of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over $6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of $2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the [[Venice Film Festival#Volpi Cup best actor|Volpi Cup for Best Actor]] at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead|Best Male Lead]] from the [[Independent Spirit Awards]], and [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] from the [[National Society of Film Critics]].\n\n''My Own Private Idaho'' is considered a landmark film in [[New Queer Cinema]], an early 1990s movement in [[queer]]-themed [[independent film]]making.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Nathan |title=Twenty-five years of New Queer Cinema |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |date=February 5, 2015 |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/culture/twenty-five-years-of-new-queer-cinema/2018251.article |access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> Since its release, it has grown in popularity and been deemed a [[cult film|cult classic]], especially among LGBT audiences.

He starts talking to himself and notices that the road looks \"like someone's face, like a fucked-up face.\" He then experiences a [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as home movies of his childhood play in his mind.\n\nLater, after being [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a client in [[Seattle]], Mike returns to his favorite spots to pick up clients. He is picked up by a wealthy older woman who takes him to her mansion, where he finds two fellow hustlers she also hired. One of them is Scott Favor, Mike's best friend, and the other is Gary. While preparing to have sex with the woman, Mike has another narcoleptic episode and awakens the next day with Scott in [[Portland, Oregon]].\n\nMike and Scott are soon reunited with Bob Pigeon, a middle-aged mentor to a gang of street kids and hustlers who live in an abandoned apartment building. Scott, the son of the mayor of Portland, confides to Bob that when he turns 21, he will inherit his father's fortune and retire from street hustling. Meanwhile, Mike yearns to find his mother, so he and Scott leave for Idaho to visit Mike's older brother, Richard. Along this journey Mike confesses to Scott that he is in love with him, and Scott gently reminds Mike he only sleeps with men for money. Richard tells a story of a man he claims is Mike's father, but Mike says that he knows it is Richard. Richard informs Mike that their mother works as a hotel maid; when Mike and Scott visit her workplace, they learn she went to Italy in search of her own family. At the hotel, they meet Hans, the man who drove them to Portland, and prostitute themselves to him.\n\nWith the money they receive from Hans, Mike and Scott travel to Italy. They find the country farmhouse where Mike's mother worked as a maid and English tutor. Carmela, a young woman who lives there, tells Mike that his mother returned to the United States months ago. Carmela and Scott fall in love and return to the US, leaving a brokenhearted Mike to return on his own. Scott's father dies, and Scott inherits his fortune.\n\nBack in Portland, Bob and his gang confront a reformed Scott at a fashionable restaurant, but he rejects them. That night Bob has a fatal heart attack. The next day the hustlers hold a rowdy funeral for Bob, while in the same cemetery, a few yards away, Scott attends a solemn funeral for his father. At the end of the film, Mike is back on the deserted stretch of Idaho highway. After he falls into another narcoleptic stupor, two strangers pull up in a truck, take his backpack and shoes, and drive away. Moments later, an unidentified figure pulls up in a car, picks the unconscious Mike up, places him in the vehicle, and drives away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[River Phoenix]] as [[Mikey Waters|Michael \"Mikey\" Waters]]\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Scott Favor\n* [[James Russo]] as Richard Waters\n* [[William Richert]] as Bob Pigeon\n* [[Chiara Caselli]] as Carmela\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Hans\n* [[Rodney Harvey]] as Gary\n* Michael Parker as Digger\n* Jessie Thomas as Denise\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Alena\n* [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] as Budd\n* [[Tom Troupe]] as Mayor Jack Favor\n* Vana O'Brien as Sharon Waters, Mike's mother\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as Airline Clerk\n* Wade Evans as Wade\n}}\n\n==Development==\n''My Own Private Idaho'' originated from [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 novel ''[[City of Night]]'', which featured street hustlers who did not admit to being gay.<ref name= \"Fuller\">{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=Graham|title=[[Gus Van Sant]]: Swimming Against the Current|work=Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and My Own Private Idaho|pages=xxi|publisher=[[Faber & Faber]]|year=1993}}</ref> Van Sant's original screenplay was written in the 1970s, when he was living in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].<ref name=\"Fuller2\">Fuller 1993, p. xxiii.</ref> After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant felt it was considerably better than what he was writing, and shelved the script for years.

The idea to combine the two scenarios occurred to Van Sant after seeing [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''.<ref name= \"Lyons, Donald\"/> He has said, \"I thought that the ''Henry IV'' plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of [[Sir John Falstaff|Falstaff]] and who was crazy about hustler boys\". Van Sant realized that [[Prince Hal]] in the plays resembled Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up as a restructuring of the ''Henry IV'' plays.<ref name=\"Fuller3\">Fuller 1993, p. xxv.</ref> Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film and who always looked like he was about to fall asleep.<ref name= \"Bowen, Peter\">{{cite news|last=Bowen|first=Peter|title=His Own Private Idaho|work = Off-Hollywood Report|date=Fall 1991}}</ref> The film's title is derived from the song \"[[Private Idaho (song)|Private Idaho]]\" by [[the B-52's]] that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.<ref name= \"Greenberg, Harvey\">{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Harvey|title=''My Own Private Idaho''|work=Film Quarterly|date=Fall 1992}}</ref>\n\nVan Sant showed the script to a [[20th Century Fox]] executive who liked Shakespeare.<ref name= \"Fuller3\" /> Eventually, he toned down the Shakespearean elements and modernized the language. Van Sant was also working on a \"My Own Private Idaho\" short story that he intended to film.

One falls in love with a girl and leaves the other behind.<ref name=\"Fuller3\">Fuller 1993, p. xxv.</ref> Van Sant had another script, ''The Boys of Storytown'', containing the Mike and Scott characters, as well as Hans and Bob; Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt the script was unfinished.<ref name=\"Fuller4\">Fuller 1993, p. xxvi.</ref> Ultimately, while editing ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'', he combined the scripts for ''Modern Days'' and ''Storytown'' with the \"Idaho\" short story.<ref name= \"Fuller4\" />\n\nInitially, no studio would finance the film because of its controversial and offbeat subject matter. After ''Drugstore Cowboy'' received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest,<ref name= \"Greenberg, Harvey\"/> but they all wanted revisions.
