It is loosely based on the [[Art School Confidential (comic)|comic of the same name]] by [[Daniel Clowes]]. The film is Zwigoff's second collaboration with Clowes, the first being 2001's ''[[Ghost World (film)|Ghost World]]'' (which was also released by [[United Artists]]).\n\nThe film was partially shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] in [[Los Angeles]] and at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California. Otis Foundation Professor Gary Garaths worked as a consultant on the film.\n\n==Plot==\nInspired by his longtime love of drawing, and hoping to meet girls, Jerome enrolls at the Strathmore School of Art. His roommates are aspiring filmmaker Vince and closeted-gay fashion major Matthew. Jerome looks for love amongst the female students, but is unsuccessful until he falls for art model Audrey, the daughter of a famous pop artist.\n\nJerome forms a friendship with classmate and perennial loser, Bardo, a four-time dropout, who guides him through the college scene and introduces him to Jimmy, a Strathmore graduate who is now a failed artist and belligerent drunk.\n\nAs Jerome learns how the art world really works, he finds that he must adapt his vision to reality. Jerome slowly loses his idealism at art school and finds himself in competition with a mysterious student named Jonah for both Audrey's affection and artistic recognition. At the same time, a serial killer known as the Strathmore Strangler is on the loose near the campus, confounding the police and inspiring Vince to create a documentary about the murders.\n\nIn a wild attempt to win a prestigious art competition, Jerome asks for, and gets, Jimmy's paintings, unbeknownst to him are the Strangler's victims. Accidentally dropping a lit cigarette in Jimmy's apartment, he causes a fire that destroys the building, leaving Jimmy and all the other residents dead. The police arrest Jerome as the Strangler (who in fact was Jimmy).\n\nAudrey realizes Jerome is her true love and that she was stupid to be interested in Jonah, who turns out to be an undercover police officer with a wife and baby at home. Jerome is sent to prison, but his paintings, particularly one of Audrey, become prized by collectors.\n\nVince scores a huge hit with his documentary about the Strangler called ''My Roommate: The Murderer''. In prison, Jerome continues to paint and sells his works at high prices, not caring that people think he is the killer as it has brought him financial success and recognition. Audrey comes to visit him in prison, and they share a kiss through the protective glass.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Jerome\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as Audrey\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Professor Sandiford\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Art History Teacher\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Jimmy\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Jonah\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Vince\n* [[Joel David Moore|Joel Moore]] as Bardo\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Matthew\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Marvin Bushmiller\n* [[Ezra Buzzington]] as Leslie\n* [[Katherine Moennig]] as Candace\n* [[Bob Golub]] as Hector\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Army-Jacket\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] (''uncredited'') as Broadway Bob D'Annunzio\n* [[Ozman Sirgood]] as Dad Platz\n* Charlie Talbert as Vince's Editor\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Stoob\n* [[Michael Shamus Wiles]] as Donald Baumgarten\n* [[Shelly Cole]] as Filthy-Haired Girl\n\n==Production==\nSophia Myles was terrified about her nude scene (the first in her career) but finally she did it. \"If there is going to be nudity in a film, I would rather do it myself than use my body double.

Everybody hated that film. I didn't think it was so bad. At least compared to all that other shit out there, anyway. It was certainly just as good as any film in the marketplace.

Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 35% of 136 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.40/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"''Art School [Confidential]''s misanthropy is too sour, its targets too flat and clich\u00e9d, and Clowes and Zwigoff stumble when trying to build a story around the premise.\"<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|art_school_confidential}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 54 based on 42 reviews.<ref>{{Metacritic film}}</ref>\n\n== Artwork in the film ==\nMuch of the artwork featured in the film was produced by practicing visual artists with art careers independent of the film.
