It stars [[Robert Forster]], [[Robin Riker]] and [[Michael V. Gazzo]]. It also includes an appearance by actress [[Sue Lyon]] in her last screen role. Set in [[Chicago]], the film follows a police officer and a reptile expert who track a giant murderous [[sewer alligator]], flushed down the toilet years earlier, that is attacking residents after escaping from the sewers.\n\nThe film received praise from critics for its intentional [[satirizing]] of genre clich\u00e9s. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel was released in 1991, entitled ''[[Alligator II: The Mutation]]''. Despite the title, ''Alligator II'' shared no characters or actors with the original.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wingrove |first=David |title=[[Science Fiction Film Source Book]] |location=Harlow |publisher=Longman |year=1985 |isbn=0-582-89310-0 }}</ref> A [[tabletop game]] based on ''Alligator'' was distributed by the [[Ideal Toy Company]] in 1980.<ref>[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29509/alligator-game \"Alligator Game (1980)\"].

''blog.mondotees.com''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1968, a teenage girl purchases a baby [[American alligator]] while on vacation with her family at a [[tourist trap]] in [[Florida]]. After the family returns home to [[Chicago]], the girl's surly, animal-phobic father promptly flushes the alligator, whom the girl had named Ram\u00f3n, down the family's toilet and into the city's [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]].\n\nTwelve years later in 1980, the alligator survives by feeding on covertly discarded pet carcasses. These animals had been used as test subjects for an experimental growth formula intended to increase agricultural livestock meat production. However, the project was abandoned because the formula unintentionally massively increased the animals' [[metabolism]], causing them to develop an insatiable appetite. During the years, the baby alligator accumulated concentrated amounts of this formula from feeding on these carcasses, causing it to mutate, and grow into a {{convert|36|foot|m}} monster resembling a ''[[Deinosuchus]]''-''[[Purussaurus]]'' hybrid, as well as having an almost-impenetrable hide.\n\nThe alligator begins ambushing and devouring sewer workers it encounters in the sewer, and the resulting flow of body parts draws in world-weary police officer David Madison who, after a horribly botched case in [[St. Louis]], has gained a reputation for being lethally unlucky for his assigned partners. As David works on this new case, his boss Chief Clark introduces him to [[reptile]]s expert Marisa Kendall, the woman who, as a teenager, bought the alligator years earlier, unaware that this alligator is her former pet. The two of them edge into a prickly romantic relationship, and during a visit to Marisa's house, David bonds with her motor-mouthed mother.\n\nDavid's reputation as a partner-killer is confirmed when the alligator snags a young cop, Kelly, who accompanies David into the sewer searching for clues. No one believes David's story, due to a lack of a body, and partly because of Slade, the influential local [[Business magnate|tycoon]] who sponsored the illegal growth experiments and therefore wants the truth concealed. This changes when obnoxious [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter Thomas Kemp, one of the banes of David's existence, goes snooping in the sewers and supplies graphic and indisputable photographic evidence of the beast at the cost of his own life. The story quickly garners public attention, and a citywide hunt for the monster is called for.\n\nAfter the police unsuccessfully attempt to flush out the alligator, David is put on suspension. The alligator escapes from the sewers and comes to the surface, first killing a police officer and later a young boy who, during a party, is tossed into a swimming pool in which the alligator is residing.\n\nThe ensuing hunt continues, including the hiring of pompous [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]] Colonel Brock to track the animal. Once again, the effort fails: Brock is killed, the police trip over each other confusedly, and the alligator goes on a rampage through a high-society wedding party hosted at Slade's mansion; among its victims are Slade himself, the Mayor, and Slade's chief scientist for the hormone experiments and intended son-in-law. Marisa and David finally lure the alligator into the sewers before setting off explosives on the alligator, killing it. As David and Marisa walk away, a drain in the sewer spits out another baby alligator, thus potentially repeating the cycle all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Detective David Madison\n* [[Robin Riker]] as Marisa Kendall\n* [[Michael V.

This release features an optional DTS sound mix, includes the sequel ''Alligator II: The Mutation'' (1991) on a second disc, and includes the same Teague-Forster commentary found on the recent Lions Gate U.S. release. The [[Shout! Factory]] released a collectors edition of ''Alligator'' in the two-disc 4K Ultra HD and Blu-Ray set on February 22, 2022 under their Scream!
