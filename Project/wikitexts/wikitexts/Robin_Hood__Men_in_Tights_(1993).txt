The film was produced and directed by [[Mel Brooks]], co-written by Brooks, [[Evan Chandler]], and [[J.D. Shapiro|J. David Shapiro]] based on a story by Chandler and Shapiro, and stars [[Cary Elwes]], [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]], and [[Dave Chappelle]] in his film debut. It includes frequent comedic references to previous ''Robin Hood'' films, particularly ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves|Prince of Thieves]]'' (upon which the plot is loosely structured), and the 1938 [[Errol Flynn]] adaptation ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.\n\nThe film also features Brooks in a minor role \u2013 the first time he had appeared in one of his own films in which he does not receive top billing or play the lead role since ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''. In addition to Brooks, it features cameos from Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Dick Van Patten]], and [[Rudy De Luca]].\n\n==Plot==\nRobin of Loxley is captured during the [[Crusades]] and is imprisoned in [[Jerusalem]]. With the help of fellow inmate Asneeze, he escapes and frees the other inmates. Upon returning to England, Robin finds Asneeze's son, Ahchoo, and discovers that Prince John has assumed control while [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] is away fighting in the Crusades. Unbeknownst to Richard, the prince is abusing his power. Robin returns to his family home, Loxley Hall, only to find it being repossessed by John's men. His family's blind servant, Blinkin, informs Robin that his family is dead, and his father left him a key which opens \"the greatest treasure in all the land.\"\n\nRobin recruits Little John and Will Scarlet O'Hara to help regain his father's land and oust Prince John from the throne. On his quest, Robin attracts the attention of Maid Marian of Bagelle, who wants to find the man who has the key to her [[Everlast (brand)|Everlast]] [[chastity belt]]. They are also joined by Rabbi Tuckman, who shares with them his sacramental wine and bargain [[circumcision]]s.\n\nWhile Robin is training his band of tights-clad [[Merry Men]], the [[spoonerism]]-spouting Sheriff of Rottingham hires the mafioso Don Giovanni to assassinate Robin at the Spring Festival. They plan to hold an archery tournament to attract Robin. Maid Marian hears of the plot, and sneaks out of her castle to warn Robin, accompanied by her heavyset, [[Germany|German]] lady-in-waiting, Broomhilde.\n\nAt the archery tournament, a disguised Robin makes it to the final round, but loses after his arrow is split in two by his opponent. Confused that he lost, Robin reviews the movie's script to discover that he gets another shot. Giovanni's assassin attempts to kill Robin by shooting at him with a scoped crossbow, but Blinkin catches the arrow in midair. Robin then takes the second shot, this time using a special \"[[MIM-104 Patriot|PATRIOT]] arrow\", hitting the target. Robin is arrested, with Marian promising to marry the Sheriff to spare his life.\n\nRobin and the Merry Men interrupt the wedding between the Sheriff and Maid Marian. She is carried off to the tower by the Sheriff, who wants to [[deflower]] her but cannot open her chastity belt. Robin arrives and duels the sheriff, during which Robin's key falls into the lock of Marian's chastity belt.\n\nAfter winning the fight Robin spares the Sheriff's life only to miss his sheath and accidentally run the Sheriff through. The witch Latrine, Prince John's cook and adviser, saves him by giving him a magical [[Life Savers|Life Saver]] in exchange for marriage. Before Robin and Marian can attempt to open the lock, Broomhilde arrives, insisting they get married first. Rabbi Tuckman conducts the ceremony, but they are suddenly interrupted by King Richard, recently returned from the Crusades, who orders Prince John to be taken away to the [[Tower of London]] and made part of the tour.\n\nRobin and Marian are married, and Ahchoo is made the new sheriff of Rottingham. That night, Robin and Maid Marian attempt to open the chastity belt, only to discover that even with the key, the lock won't open. The film ends with Robin calling for a locksmith.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as [[Robin Hood]]<ref>{{cite news|title= Men in Tights': A See-Through Laugh|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-07-28|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-28/entertainment/ca-17556_1_mel-brooks|access-date=2010-10-02|first=Peter|last=Rainer}}</ref>\n* [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as [[John, King of England|Prince John]]\n* [[Roger Rees]] as [[Sheriff of Nottingham|Sheriff of Rottingham]]\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as [[Maid Marian]]\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Ahchoo\n* [[Mark Blankfield]] as Blinkin\n* [[Eric Allan Kramer]] as [[Little John]]\n* [[Matthew Porretta]] as [[Will Scarlet]] [[Scarlett O'Hara|O'Hara]]\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as Asneeze\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Latrine\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Richard I of England|King Richard]]\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as [[Don Juan|Don Giovanni]]\n* Steve Tancora as Filthy Luca\n* Joe Dimmick as Dirty Ezio\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as The Abbot\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as [[Friar Tuck|Rabbi Tuckman]]\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as Broomhilde\n* [[Avery Schreiber]] as Tax Assessor\n* [[Chuck McCann]] as Villager\n* [[Brian George]] as Dungeon Maitre D'\n* Zitto Kazann as Head Saracen Guard\n* Richard Assad as Assistant Saracen Guard\n* Herman Poppe as Sheriff's Guard\n* [[Clive Revill]] as Fire Marshall\n* Joe Baker as Angry Villager\n* [[Carol Arthur]] as Complaining Villager\n* Kelly Jones as Buxom Lass\n* [[Clement von Franckenstein]] as Royal Announcer\n*[[Robert Ridgely]] as The Hangman\n* [[Corbin Allred]] as Young Lad\n* [[Chase Masterson]] as Giggling Court Lady\n* Don Lewis as Mime\n* Roger Owens as Peanut Vendor\n* [[Patrick Valenzuela]] as Lead Camel Jockey\n* Steffon as Sherwood Forest Rapper\n* [[David DeLuise]] as Villager\n* Marc Ian Sklar as Merry Man <small>(uncredited)</small>\n* [[Tim Storms]] as Merry Man <small>(uncredited)</small>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"What's missing is the kind of densely packed comic screenplay that helped to make ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[High Anxiety]]'' two of the most delectable movie parodies of the last 20 years.
