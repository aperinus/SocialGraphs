The film stars [[Margaret Sheridan (actress)|Margaret Sheridan]], [[Kenneth Tobey]], [[Robert Cornthwaite (actor)|Robert Cornthwaite]], and Douglas Spencer. [[James Arness]] plays The Thing; he is difficult to recognize in costume and makeup due to both low lighting and other effects used to obscure his features. ''The Thing from Another World'' is based on the 1938 [[novella]] \"[[Who Goes There?]]\" by [[John W. Campbell]] (writing under the pseudonym of Don A. Stuart).<ref name=\"Warren\">Warren 1982, pp. 151\u2013163.</ref>\n\nThe film's storyline concerns a [[U.S. Air Force]] crew and scientists who find, frozen in the Arctic ice, a crashed [[flying saucer]] and a [[humanoid]] body nearby. Returning to their remote research outpost with the body still in a block of ice, they are forced to defend themselves against the still alive and malevolent plant-based alien when it is accidentally defrosted.<ref>Hamilton 2007, pp. 8\u201311.</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], journalist Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer), looking for a story, visits the [[Alaskan Air Command]] [[Military officers' club|officer's club]], where he meets Captain Pat Hendry ([[Kenneth Tobey]]), his co-pilot Lieutenant Eddie Dykes, (a friend of Scott's), and flight navigator Ken \"Mac\" MacPherson. General Fogarty orders Hendry to fly to Polar Expedition Six at the [[North Pole]], per a request from its lead scientist, [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] laureate Dr. Arthur Carrington ([[Robert Cornthwaite (actor)|Robert Cornthwaite]]); Carrington has radioed that an unusual aircraft has crashed nearby. With Scott, Corporal Barnes, crew chief Bob, and a pack of sled dogs, Hendry pilots a [[Douglas C-47]] transport aircraft to the remote outpost.\n\nUpon arrival, Scott and the airmen meet radio operator Tex, Dr. Chapman, his wife Mrs. Chapman, a man named Lee, who is one of two cooks, and the [[Inuit]] dog handlers. Also present are scientists Vorhees, Stern, Redding, Stone, Laurence, Wilson, Ambrose, Auerbach, Olson, and Carrington. Hendry later rekindles his romance with Nikki Nicholson ([[Margaret Sheridan (actress)|Margaret Sheridan]]), Carrington's secretary. Several scientists fly with the airmen to the crash site, finding a large object buried beneath the ice. As they spread out to determine the object's shape, they realize that they are standing in a circle; they have discovered a [[flying saucer]]. The team attempts to melt the ice covering the saucer with [[thermite]], but a violent reaction with the craft's metal alloy completely destroys it. Their [[Geiger counter]], however, detects a frozen body buried nearby; it is excavated in a large block of ice and loaded aboard the C-47 transport. They fly out as an Arctic storm closes in on their site.\n\nHendry assumes command of the outpost and, pending radio instructions from General Fogarty, denies Scott permission to send out his story; he also denies the scientists' demands to examine the body. Tex sends an update to Fogarty, and the airmen settle in as the storm arrives. A watch is posted; Barnes relieves McPherson and, disturbed by the creature's appearance in the clearing ice, covers it with an [[electric blanket]], which he does not realize is plugged in. The block slowly thaws and the creature, still alive, escapes into the storm and is attacked by the sled dogs. The airmen recover the creature's severed arm after the attack.\n\nThe scientists examine the arm, concluding that the alien is an advanced form of plant life. Carrington is convinced of its superiority to humans and becomes intent on communicating with it. The airmen begin a search, which leads to the outpost's [[greenhouse]]. Carrington stays behind with Vorhees, Stern, and Laurence, having noticed evidence of alien activity. They discover a third sled dog hidden away, which has had all of its blood drained; the [[carnivorous plant]] creature feeds on blood. Carrington and the scientists post a secret watch of their own, hoping to encounter the alien before the airmen find it.\n\nThe next morning, the airmen continue their search. Tex informs them that Fogarty is aware of their discovery and demands further information, now prevented by the fierce storm. Stern appears, badly injured, and tells the group that the creature has killed Auerbach and Olson. When the airmen investigate, the alien attacks them; they manage to barricade it inside the greenhouse. Hendry confronts Carrington and orders him to remain in his lab and quarters.\n\nCarrington, obsessed with the alien, shows Nicholson and the other scientists his experiment: using seeds taken from the severed arm, he has been growing small alien plants by feeding them from the [[blood plasma]] supply at the base. Hendry finds the plasma missing when it is needed to treat Stern, which leads him to Carrington. Fogarty transmits orders to keep the creature alive, but it escapes from the greenhouse and attacks the airmen in their quarters. They douse it with buckets of kerosene and set it afire, forcing it to retreat into the storm. After regrouping, they realize that their building's temperature is falling rapidly; the furnaces have stopped working, sabotaged by the alien. They retreat to the station's generator room to keep warm, and rig an electrical \"fly trap\". The alien continues to stalk them, but at the last moment, Carrington attempts to communicate, pleading with the creature. It knocks him aside, walks into the trap, and is electrocuted. On Hendry's order, it is reduced to a pile of ash.\n\nWhen the weather clears, Scotty is finally able to file his \"story of a lifetime\" by radio to a roomful of reporters in Anchorage. He ends his broadcast with a warning: \"Tell the world. Tell this to everybody, wherever they are. Watch the skies everywhere. Keep looking. Keep watching the skies...\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Margaret Sheridan (actress)|Margaret Sheridan]] as Nikki Nicholson\n* [[Kenneth Tobey]] as Captain Patrick Hendry\n* [[Robert O.

The cost ended up being $1,250.<ref name=\"Astounding\">[[Alec Nevala-Lee]], ''Astounding: John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, L.

The film reflected a post-[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] skepticism about science and prevailing negative views of scientists who meddle with things better left alone. In the end it is American servicemen and several sensible scientists who win the day over the alien invader.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe film was loosely adapted by [[Charles Lederer]], with uncredited rewrites from [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Ben Hecht]], from the 1938 novella \"[[Who Goes There?]]\" by [[John W. Campbell]]. The story was first published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' under Campbell's pseudonym [[Don A. Stuart]]. (Campbell had just become ''Astounding''{{'}}s managing editor when his novella appeared in its pages.)<ref name=\"Warren\"/> Science fiction author [[A. E. van Vogt]], who had been inspired to write from reading \"Who Goes There?\" and who had been a prolific contributor to ''Astounding'', had wanted to write the script.<ref name=\"Astounding\"/>\n\nThe screenplay changes the fundamental nature of the alien. Lederer's \"Thing\" is a humanoid life form whose cellular structure is closer to vegetation, although it must feed on blood to survive; reporter Scott even refers to it in the film as a \"super carrot\". The internal, plant-like structure of the creature makes it impervious to bullets (but not to other destructive forces). Campbell's \"Thing\" is a life form capable of assuming the physical and mental characteristics of any living thing it encounters; this characteristic was later realized in [[John Carpenter]]'s adaptation of the novella, the 1982 film ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Director===\nThere is debate as to whether the film was directed by Howard Hawks, with [[Christian Nyby]] receiving the credit so that Nyby could obtain his [[Directors Guild of America|Director's Guild]] membership<ref>Weaver 2003, p. 346.</ref><ref>Carpenter, John (speaker).
