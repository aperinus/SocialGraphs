Directed by [[John Huston]], it was produced by [[Gottfried Reinhardt]] with [[Dore Schary]] as executive producer. The screenplay is by John Huston, adapted by [[Albert Band]] from [[Stephen Crane]]'s 1895 [[The Red Badge of Courage|novel of the same name]]. The cinematography is by [[Harold Rosson]], and the music score by [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper|Bronislau Kaper]]. The making of this film is the subject of [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]]'s 1952 book ''Picture'', originally in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. \n  \nThe [[American Civil War]] film is a sparse but faithful retelling of the story, incorporating narration from the text to move the plot forward. [[Audie Murphy]], a hero of [[World War II]] who later went into acting, played the lead role of Henry Fleming. Other actors include cartoonist [[Bill Mauldin]], [[Andy Devine]], [[Arthur Hunnicutt]] and [[Royal Dano]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1862, a regiment of the Union Army is encamped near the [[Rappahannock River]] in Virginia.  Orders direct the regiment to move up river to engage the enemy. Private Henry Fleming tells his comrades he is not afraid. On patrol, Henry exchanges words with an unseen Confederate soldier stationed across the river who tells Henry to watch out for the \"red badge,\" meaning a battle wound. The regiment confidently sets out, but Henry is pensive. As the regiment engages in battle, Henry's buddy, Tom Wilson, tells Henry to give his watch to his parents if he is killed. During the battle, Henry deserts his regiment. He learns his outfit won the battle, but he fears derision if he returns. Henry sees his wounded comrades coming from battle, and wishes he, too, had a \"red badge of courage.\" Henry slips back into the regiment as they march. One of his comrades, Jim Conklin, is delusional from his injuries and dies. Henry sees another Union regiment retreating and he is knocked unconscious by a soldier who refuses to tell Henry the reason for the retreat. Regaining consciousness, Henry meets a soldier who escorts him to his regiment. Henry falsely tells Tom his head injury was received in battle. Henry tells Tom about Jim's death. Tom tells Henry his absence was not noticed due to the heavy casualties suffered. The next day, Henry talks as if he, too, engaged in the battle.\n\nThe regiment faces another battle. This time, Henry wildly charges toward the enemy with passion until he is ordered back into ranks. Henry and Tom fetch water at a creek and overhear the General planning an attack. They report the news to the regiment. The regiment attacks. As some of his comrades fall, Henry charges forward yelling for his outfit to keep moving as he carries the flag. Henry meets the flag bearer for the Confederate troops, who falls dead. Henry briefly holds both flags as the regiment secures the defeated rebels. A soldier tells Henry and the regiment that he overheard their commanding officers lauding Henry's bravery. Henry admits to Tom that he deserted the day before, and that his shame made him return. Tom admits he deserted, too, but was caught and forced back into the battle. The regiment marches on as Henry contemplates the hope of a peaceful future.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Audie Murphy]] as Henry Fleming (aka The Youth)  \n* [[Bill Mauldin]] as Tom Wilson (aka The Loud Soldier)  \n* [[Douglas Dick]] as The Lieutenant  \n* [[Royal Dano]] as The Tattered Man  \n* [[John Dierkes]] as Jim Conklin (aka The Tall Soldier)  \n* [[Arthur Hunnicutt]] as Bill Porter  \n* Tim Durant as The General\n* [[Andy Devine]] as The Cheery Soldier\n* [[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] as Thompson\n* [[John Huston]] as Grizzled Union Veteran (uncredited)\n* [[William Edward Phipps|William Phipps]] as Union Soldier (uncredited) \n* [[William Schallert]] as Union Soldier (uncredited)   \n* [[James Whitmore]] as Narrator (voice, uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nDirector John Huston used unusual compositions and camera angles drawn from [[film noir]] to create an alienating battlefield environment. He became frustrated when the studio cut the film's length to 70 minutes and added narration taken from the original novel following supposedly poor audience test screenings.<ref name=ross>Ross, Lillian. ''Picture'', 1952.</ref>\n \nMuch of the history of the making of this film, considered by some a mutilated masterpiece, is found in Lillian Ross' critically acclaimed book ''Picture''.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2011/03/17/133619932/three-books-explore-the-minds-behind-movie-magic Three Books Explore The Minds Behind Movie Magic\u00a0: NPR]</ref> Of the stars who appear in the film, three served in World War II: [[Bill Mauldin]] the editorial cartoonist who created \"Up Front\", [[Audie Murphy]] served with the [[U.S. Army]] in Europe, and narrator [[James Whitmore]] served with the [[U.S. Marine Corps]].<ref name=ross/>\n\nJohn Huston had high hopes for this movie, even considered the original two-hour cut of the film as the best he had ever made as a director. After a power struggle at the top of MGM management, the film was cut from a two-hour epic to the 69-minute version released to theaters in response to its alleged universally disastrous previews. It never was released as an \"A\" feature but was shown as a second-feature \"B\" picture. Both Huston and star Audie Murphy tried unsuccessfully to purchase the film so that it could be re-edited to its original length. Huston did not waste any time fighting over it because he was focused on the pre-production of his next picture, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]''. The studio claimed that the cut footage was destroyed, probably in the [[1965 MGM vault fire]]. Huston later was asked by MGM in 1975 if he had an original cut because the studio wanted to release it. Huston told them he didn't have one, that it didn't exist. However, after this he instructed his agent Paul Kohner to include in all his future contracts a stipulation that he receive a 16 mm print of the first cut of any film he made.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Houston |first=John |title=An Open Book |publisher=Alfred A.

This made it one of the studio's least successful films of the year although it did not lose as much money as ''[[Calling Bulldog Drummond]]'', ''[[Mr Imperium]]'' or ''[[Inside Straight (film)|Inside Straight]]''.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n==Comic book adaptation==\n* [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] Motion Picture Comics #105 (July 1951)<ref>{{gcdb issue|id=248917|title=Fawcett Motion Picture Comics #105}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]''\n* [[List of films cut over the director's opposition]]\n* [[List of incomplete or partially lost films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0043961|title=The Red Badge of Courage }}\n* {{amg movie|id=40655|title=The Red Badge of Courage}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=389|title=The Red Badge of Courage}}\n* {{AFI film|id=50262|title=The Red Badge of Courage}}\n* [http://www.audiemurphy.com/movies07.htm ''The Red Badge of Courage''] at Audie Murphy Memorial Site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225054416/http://www.redbadgeofcourage.org/ ''The Red Badge of Courage'' (novel) site]\n\n{{John Huston}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Badge Of Courage (Film)}}\n[[Category:1951 films]]\n[[Category:1950s lost films]]\n[[Category:1950s war drama films]]\n[[Category:American Civil War films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Huston]]\n[[Category:Lost American films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Audie Murphy]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Huston]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]]\n[[Category:Lost war drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
