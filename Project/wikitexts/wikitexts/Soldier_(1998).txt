S. Anderson]], written by [[David Peoples|David Webb Peoples]], and starring [[Kurt Russell]], [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Jason Isaacs]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Sean Pertwee]] and [[Gary Busey]]. The film tells the story of a highly skilled and emotionally distant soldier who is left for dead, befriends a group of refugees, then faces his former superiors who are determined to eliminate them.\n\nThe film was released worldwide on October 23, 1998. Upon its release, ''Soldier'' received generally negative reviews, although many praised the action sequences and Russell's performance. The film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $14 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn 1996, as part of a new military training program, a group of orphaned infants are selected at birth and raised as highly disciplined soldiers with no understanding of anything but military routine. They are trained to be ruthless professionals, and anyone considered physically or mentally unworthy is executed. The survivors are turned into ultimate fighting machines, but have no understanding of the outside world.\n\nIn 2036, Sgt. Todd 3465 is a hardened veteran and one of the original 1996 infants, but his unit is about to be replaced by a superior one, with the original unit likely to be deactivated. Colonel Mekum, leader of the original project, introduces a new group of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except complete aggression.\n\nCaptain Church, the commander of Todd's unit, insists on testing the new soldiers' abilities against his own. One new soldier, Caine 607, easily defeats three of the original soldiers, but Todd gouges out Caine's eye before falling from a great height; the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is knocked unconscious. Mekum orders their bodies disposed of like garbage, declaring them obsolete, while the remaining older soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.\n\nDumped on Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet, Todd limps toward a colony whose residents crash-landed there years earlier; as they were believed dead, no rescue missions have been attempted. Todd is sheltered by Mace and his wife Sandra. Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their conflict-free lives. While Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized by a snakebite as an infant, he soon begins to experience [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the colonists for an enemy, nearly killing him. To make matters worse, in a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd forces Nathan to face it down and strike back to protect himself. His parents disapprove of the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.\n\nFearful, the colonists expel Todd from the community. Experiencing strong emotion for the first time, Todd appears confused when he is overcome by loss and cries for the first time. A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by a snake while they sleep, but they are saved by Nathan, who uses Todd's technique. Now understanding the value of Todd's lesson, they seek him to reintegrate him into the community, but the others resist.\n\nThe new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet, and, since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides to use the colonists' community as the target in a training exercise. The soldiers spot Mace and kill him just after he finds Todd. Though out-manned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad. Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]], Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, whom he defeats in vicious hand-to-hand combat.\n\nPanicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable [[doomsday device]] powerful enough to destroy the planet. He orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind. When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades silently side with him over the army that has discarded them, and take over the ship. They leave Mekum and his aides on the planet and evacuate the remaining colonists. In an attempt to disarm the device, Mekum accidentally sets it off, killing him and his aides. Todd pilots the ship from Arcadia just ahead of the shockwave and sets course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination. He picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Sergeant Todd \"3465\"\n** Jesse Littlejohn as 8-year-old Todd\n** [[Wyatt Russell]] as 11-year-old Todd\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]] as Caine 607\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Colonel Mekum\n* [[Connie Nielsen]] as Sandra\n* [[Sean Pertwee]] as Mace\n* Jared & Taylor Thorne as Nathan\n* Mark Bringelson as Lieutenant  Rubrick\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Captain Church\n* [[K.
