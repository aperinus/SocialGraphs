Developed from a story by Antonioni with co-writers [[Elio Bartolini]] and [[Tonino Guerra]], the film is about the disappearance of a young woman ([[Lea Massari]]) during a boating trip in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and the subsequent search for her by her lover ([[Gabriele Ferzetti]]) and her best friend ([[Monica Vitti]]). It was filmed on location in Rome, the [[Aeolian Islands]], and [[Sicily]] in 1959 under difficult financial and physical conditions. The film is noted for its unusual pacing, which emphasizes [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], mood, and character over traditional narrative development.\n\n''L'Avventura'' was nominated for numerous awards and was awarded the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]].

They drive into Rome to [[Isola Tiberina]] near the [[Pons Fabricius]] to meet Anna's boyfriend, Sandro ([[Gabriele Ferzetti]]). While Claudia waits downstairs, Anna and Sandro make love in his house. Afterwards, Sandro drives the two women to the coast where they join two wealthy couples and set sail south along the coast.\n\nThe next morning the yacht reaches the [[Aeolian Islands]] north of Sicily. After they pass [[Basiluzzo]], Anna impulsively jumps into the water for a swim, and Sandro jumps in after her. When Anna yells that she's seen a shark, Sandro comes to her side protectively. Later onboard Anna confesses to Claudia that the \"whole shark thing was a lie,\" apparently to get Sandro's attention. After noticing Claudia admiring her blouse, she tells her to put it on, that it looks better on her, and that she should keep it. At one of the smaller islands, {{ill|Lisca Bianca|it}}, the party comes ashore. Anna and Sandro go off alone and talk about their relationship. Anna is unhappy with his long business trips. Sandro dismisses her complaints and takes a nap on the rocks.\n\nSometime later, Corrado (James Addams) decides to leave the small island, concerned about the weather and rough seas. They hear a boat nearby. Claudia searches for Anna, but she is gone without a trace. Sandro is annoyed, saying this type of behavior is typical. They explore the island and find nothing. Sandro and Corrado decide to continue their search on the island while sending the others off to notify the authorities. Claudia decides to stay as well. Sandro, Corrado, and Claudia continue their search and end up at a shack where they stay the night. As they talk, Sandro takes offense at Claudia's suggestion that Anna's disappearance is somehow due to his neglect.\n\nIn the morning, Claudia wakes before the others and watches the sunrise. After finding Anna's blouse in her bag, she meets Sandro out near the cliffs, and they talk about Anna, but Sandro now seems attracted to Claudia. The police arrive and conduct a thorough search, but find nothing. Anna's father, a former diplomat, also arrives in a high-speed [[hydrofoil]]. When he sees the books his daughter has been reading\u2014''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and ''The Holy Bible''\u2014he feels confident that she hasn't committed suicide. The police announce that smugglers were arrested nearby and are being held in [[Milazzo]]. Sandro decides to investigate, but before leaving, he finds Claudia alone on the yacht and kisses her. Claudia rushes off, startled by his actions. She decides to search the other islands on her own. They all agree to meet up at Corrado's Villa Montaldo in [[Palermo]].\n\nAt the Milazzo police station, Sandro realizes the smugglers know nothing about Anna's disappearance. When he discovers that Claudia has arrived from the islands, he meets her at the train station where their mutual attraction is evident, but Claudia urges him not to complicate matters and begs him to leave. She boards a train to Palermo, and as the train pulls away, Sandro runs after it and jumps aboard. On the train Claudia is annoyed, saying \"I don't want you with me.\" She says it would be easier if they sacrifice now and deny their attraction, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing anything. Still focused on her friend's disappearance, Claudia is troubled by the thought that it \"takes so little to change.\" Sandro relents and gets off the train at [[Castroreale]].\n\nIn [[Messina]], Sandro tracks down the journalist Zuria, who wrote an article about Anna's disappearance. Their meeting is interrupted by crowds of excited men following a beautiful 19-year-old \"writer\" and aspiring actress named Gloria Perkins (Dorothy De Poliolo) who is actually an expensive prostitute. Sandro stops to admire her beauty. Zuria says he heard stories that Anna was spotted by a chemist in Troina. After bribing Zuria to run another story on Anna, Sandro heads to [[Troina]]. Meanwhile, Claudia meets her boating companions at Corrado's Villa Montaldo in Palermo. No one seems to take Anna's disappearance seriously except Claudia. Even Corrado's young wife Giulia openly flirts with the young prince in front of her husband. After reading Zuria's follow-up story, Claudia leaves the villa for Troina to continue her search.\n\nIn Troina, Sandro questions the chemist who claimed to have sold tranquilizers to Anna. Claudia arrives, and they learn that the woman identified by the chemist left on a bus to [[Noto]] in southern Sicily. Sandro and Claudia resume their search together and drive south. Outside Noto, they stop at a deserted village, and then find a hill overlooking the town where they make love while a train goes by. Later in town, they go to the Trinacria Hotel where they believe Anna is staying. Claudia asks Sandro to go in alone. While Claudia waits outside, a crowd of men gather around her. When she thinks she sees Sandro and Anna coming down the stairs she runs into a paint store, but Sandro follows and confirms that Anna is not there. Claudia remains torn between her feelings for Sandro and her friendship with Anna.\n\nAt the Chiesa del Collegio, a nun shows them the view from the roof. Sandro talks about his disappointments with his work, far removed from his youthful ambitions as an architect. Suddenly he asks Claudia to marry him, but she says no\u2014things are too complicated. She accidentally tugs on a rope that rings the church bells, which are answered by connected church bells at another church. Claudia is delighted by the sounds. The next morning, she wakes in a joyful mood, dancing and singing in the room while Sandro looks on amused. They both seem passionately in love. Sandro goes for a walk to the Piazza Municipio, where he notices an ink sketch left by one of the students. With his keychain he \"accidentally\" knocks over the ink onto the sketch. The student notices and confronts Sandro, who denies he did it on purpose. Sandro returns to the hotel and tries to make love to Claudia, but she resists, telling him they should leave.\n\nAt [[Taormina]], they check into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's employer Ettore and his wife Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party, Sandro checks out the women\u2014recognizing Gloria Perkins. Back in the room, Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro embracing Gloria on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she enigmatically places her hand on his head while looking out at the snow-covered image of [[Mount Etna]] on the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Gabriele Ferzetti]] as Sandro\n* [[Monica Vitti]] as Claudia\n* [[Lea Massari]] as Anna\n* [[Dominique Blanchar]] as Giulia\n* Renzo Ricci as Anna's Father\n* James Addams as Corrado\n* Dorothy de Poliolo as Gloria Perkins\n* [[Lelio Luttazzi]] as Raimondo\n* Giovanni Petrucci as Prince Goffredo\n* Esmeralda Ruspoli as Patrizia\n* Jack O'Connell as Old Man on the Island\n* Angela Tomasi di Lampedusa as The Princess\n* Prof. Cucco as Ettore\n* Renato Pinciroli as Zuria, the journalist\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nShooting began in August 1959 and lasted until 15 January 1960. Antonioni began filming the island sequence with the scenes immediately after Anna disappears. The majority of shooting on the island was filmed on the island Lisca Bianca (''white fish bone'') with a cast and crew of 50 people. Other locations for the island sequence included Panarea (which was the production's headquarters), Mondello and Palermo. Filming the island sequence was intended to take three weeks, but ended up lasting for four months. Difficulties included the islands being infested with rats, mosquitoes and reptiles; also, the weather was unexpectedly cold, and the navy ship hired to transport the cast and crew to the island every day never appeared. In order to carry personal items and equipment to the island, the crew had to build small rafts out of empty gas canisters and wooden planks; these were towed by a launching tug every morning.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\">Criterion. Youngblood.</ref>\n\nOne week after shooting began, the film's production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies of food and water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and managed to get the cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca, and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually, the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his assistant director shot the film themselves.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/> Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he \"woke up every morning at 3 o'clock in order to be alone and reflect on what I was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all.\"<ref>''L'avventura'' DVD. The Criterion Collection. Special Features. ''L'avventura: A Moral Adventure''. 2001.</ref> After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/>\n\nWhilst shooting on the 40-foot yacht for scenes early in the film, the cast and crew totaled 23 people. Antonioni had wanted to shoot the film chronologically, but the yacht was not available until November. Owing to the cold weather, actress Lea Massari developed a cardiac condition after spending several days swimming in the Mediterranean Sea during filming, and spent several days in a coma after being rushed to Rome for medical treatment.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/>\n\nAfter completing the island sequence, filming continued throughout Sicily and Italy. The sequence on the train from Castroreale to Cefal\u00f9 took two days to shoot instead of the intended three hours. The scene in Messina where Sandro encounters Gloria Perkins took two days to shoot; Antonioni initially wanted 400 extras for it. Only 100 turned up, so crew members recruited passers-by on the street to appear in the scene.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/> The sequence where Sandro and Claudia visit a deserted town was shot in Santa Panagia, near Catania in Sicily; buildings there were commissioned by [[Benito Mussolini]], and were examples of [[fascist architecture]] of the ''[[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]]''. The scene where Sandro and Claudia first have sex took 10 days to shoot, owing to the crew having to wait for a train to pass by every morning.<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/>\n\nAntonioni wrote that the film was \"expressed through images in which I hope to show not the birth of an erroneous sentiment, but rather the way in which we go astray in our sentiments. Because as I have said, our moral values are old. Our myths and conventions are old. And everyone knows that they are indeed old and outmoded. Yet we respect them.\"<ref>Criterion. ''L'avventura: A Moral Adventure''.</ref>\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[American-International Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] refused the US distribution rights, so Antonioni sold the project to [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n===Filming locations===\n''L'Avventura'' was filmed on location in Rome, the Aeolian Islands, and Sicily.<ref name=\"wwguide\">{{cite web |title=L'Avventura film locations |publisher=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations |url=http://movie-locations.com/movies/a/Avventura.php |access-date=9 May 2012 |archive-date=23 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023121404/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/Avventura.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"castroreale\">{{cite book|last=Rao |first=Ennio Italo |title=Sicilian Palimpsest: The Language of Castroreale and Its Territory |publisher=Legas |location=Ottawa |year=2009 |page=50 |isbn=978-1881901709 }}</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=40em|\n* [[Rome]]\n** [[Pons Fabricius]] (outside Sandro's house)\n** [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (opening scene from Anna's father's villa)\n** [[Tiber Island]] (where Sandro's house is located)\n** [[Tiber River]] (near Sandro's house)\n* [[Sicily]]\n** [[Metropolitan City of Messina]]\n*** [[Aeolian Islands]]\n**** [[Basiluzzo]] (where Anna jumps from the yacht)\n**** [[Lipari]]\n**** Lisca Bianca (the island from which Anna disappears)\n**** [[Panarea]]\n*** [[Castroreale]] (where Sandro alights from the train)\n*** [[Messina]] (where Sandro meets Zuria and encounters the \"writer\" Gloria Perkins)\n*** [[Milazzo]]\n**** [[Capo di Milazzo]]\n*** [[Taormina]]\n**** Church of San Domenico\n**** Piazza San Domenico 5\n**** San Domenico Palace Hotel (the terrace in the final scene)\n** [[Metropolitan City of Palermo]]\n*** [[Bagheria]]\n**** Corso Umberto\n**** Piazza Garibaldi\n**** [[Villa Palagonia]] (the Customs House in Milazzo)\n*** [[Cefal\u00f9]] (the platform after Sandro leaves the train)\n*** [[Palermo]]\n**** [[Mondello]]\n**** Palermo Town Hall\n**** [[Villa Niscemi]] (Villa Montaldo where Giulia is seduced by the Princess' grandson)\n** [[Province of Catania]]\n*** [[Mount Etna]]\n*** [[Plain of Catania]] (where Sandro questions the pharmacist)\n** [[Province of Syracuse]]\n*** [[Noto]]\n**** Chiesa del Collegio (where Claudia rings the church bells)\n**** Church of San Francesca\n**** Museo Civico, [[Santissimo Salvatore, Noto|Santissimo Salvatore]] (which is closed to Sandro)\n**** [[Noto Cathedral]]\n**** Piazza Immacolata\n**** Piazza Municipo (where Sandro \"accidentally\" spills the ink)\n*** Santa Panagia (where Sandro and Claudia make love on a hill while a train goes by)\n*** [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]\n}}\n\n===Music===\nThe film's musical score was composed by [[Giovanni Fusco]], who had scored all of Antonioni's films up to that time. Antonioni usually only used [[diegetic music]] in his films and this was one of the latter times that he (briefly) included a musical score for scenes other than during the credits. For ''L'Avventura'', Antonioni asked Fusco to compose \"jazz as though it had been written in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic era]].\"<ref name=\"Criterion.

It is one of the festival's more notorious reactions. According to Vitti, \"the screening of Cannes was a real-life drama.\" From the opening titles, despite the film's serious tone, laughs erupted in a dark theater packed with critics and photographers. Laughs continued through the runtime, joined by boos. [[Gene Youngblood]] stated that audience members usually booed during long sequences where nothing happened to further the film's plot, but has asserted that \"quite a lot is happening in these scenes.\"<ref name=\"Criterion. Youngblood\"/> Antonioni and Vitti, who claimed she was sobbing, fled the theater.\n\nThe next day, however, the filmmakers were sent a list of signatures from established filmmakers and writers who declared that ''L'Avventura'' was the best movie screened at Cannes.
