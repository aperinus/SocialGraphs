Chechik|Jeremiah Chechik]], an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1961\u20131969 [[The Avengers (TV series)|British television series of the same name]]. It stars [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Uma Thurman]] as secret agents [[John Steed]] and [[Emma Peel]], and [[Sean Connery]] as Sir August de Wynter, a [[mad scientist]] bent on controlling the world's weather. [[Patrick Macnee]], Steed in the original series, makes a vocal cameo as the voice of Invisible Jones.\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], only grossing $55 million against its $60 million budget, and was universally panned by critics, with some considering it [[List of films considered the worst#The Avengers (1998)|one of the worst films ever made]].\n\n==Plot==\nSecret agent [[John Steed]] and meteorologist Dr. [[Emma Peel]] are summoned to The Ministry. They meet the spymaster, codenamed [[Mother (The Avengers)|Mother]], who informs them that the Prospero project \u2014 an attempt to influence the weather \u2014 was apparently sabotaged by Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's second-in-command, Father, claims that Peel suffers from a mental disease. The duo visits Sir August de Wynter, a former Ministry scientist. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather.\n\nSteed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather, a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine, where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organization, led by de Wynter, all don teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears.\n\nSteed and Emma go off to visit de Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. An elderly Ministry agent, Alice, helps them to flee; nevertheless, de Wynter captures and hypnotizes Emma. When de Wynter is later distracted, Emma tries to escape but feels faint and finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. Becoming desperate, she smashes her way through the wall where Steed then finds her unconscious and rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, Emma wakes up and is given boots by Steed. However, Emma is arrested by Father, while Steed visits Invisible Jones, a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map found at Wonderland Weather.\n\nAfter viewing photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working alongside de Wynter. Father and the Emma clone gas Peel unconscious but are confronted by Mother, who they incapacitate. de Wynter, controlling the weather using Prospero, confronts the world leaders, boasting that he controls the weather and they will have to buy the weather from him at great expense. He gives them a midnight ultimatum.\n\nFather and the clone take Peel to a hot air balloon, where she regains consciousness and escapes during a snowstorm. Father and the clone perish when the balloon collides with the Wonderland Weather sign. Once reunited, Steed and Peel share a kiss. Jones determines de Wynter is using the Prospero instruments on a secret island, and Peel and Steed travel there to stop him. Peel defuses the Prospero device just as a hurricane forms over London. Steed duels de Wynter and impales him with his own cane, causing de Wynter to be disintegrated by a powerful bolt of lightning. The duo escapes just as the base self-destructs, and rendezvous with Mother on the roof of a building.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[John Steed]], a British Ministry agent\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as [[Emma Peel]], Scientist, Ministry agent\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Sir August de Wynter, a weather scientist and a terrorist \n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[Mother (The Avengers)|Mother]], Director of the Ministry\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Father, Deputy Director of the Ministry, an ally of Sir August\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as Bailey, Sir August's henchman\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Alice, a Ministry Agent\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Brenda, a Ministry Agent, Mother's aide\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Trubshaw, Steed's tailor\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] as Tamara, Agent of Sir August\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] (voice) as Invisible Jones, a Ministry Agent\n\n==Release==\n[[Warner Bros.]], the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press screenings for movie reviewers. Such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative.<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite magazine|first=Godfrey |last= Cheshire III|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117913229.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=The Avengers - Sputtering Spies: Steed and Peel Lack Appeal|magazine= Variety|date= August 17, 1998|access-date= September 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=NYTreview>{{cite news|first= Janet|last= Maslin|url= https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/081598avengers-film-review.html|title= 'The Avengers': Shh!

Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ''The Avengers'' a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked.<ref name=SFgateReview /></blockquote>\n\nDue to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 89 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which Mrs. Peel's evil clone infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words \"How now brown cow\" in a false telephone box to gain admittance; these words are later used in the film when Steed and Peel use them to enter de Wynter's island fortress in another telephone box. The movie was originally scored by composer [[Michael Kamen]], who included the original Avengers theme; however, he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by [[Joel McNeely]]. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite the fact that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free.\n\nThe rock band [[Radiohead]] recorded a version of their song \"[[Man of War (song)|Man of War]]\" for the ''Avengers'' soundtrack but abandoned it after a failed studio session.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Radiohead's 'Man of War': Everything You Need to Know About the 'OK Computer' Bonus Tracks|url=http://diffuser.fm/radiohead-man-of-war/|access-date=2017-07-29|website=Diffuser.fm|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film ranked third in its opening weekend, with $10,305,957.
