The film has been credited with popularizing giallo, an Italian genre of thriller developed in the 1960s.<ref name=Lucas2>{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Lucas|title=Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark |publisher=Video Watchdog |year=2007 |pages=810\u20132 |isbn=978-0-9633756-1-2}}</ref> It is the first in what has been called the \"Animal Trilogy\", along with Argento's next two gialli, ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1971) and ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1972) (though the three films are connected only by their titles).{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=87}}\n\nWritten by Argento, the film borrowed liberally from [[Fredric Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Screaming Mimi (novel)|The Screaming Mimi]]''.<ref name=Lucas2/>\n\nThe film was an international commercial and critical success.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Dalmas is an American writer vacationing in [[Rome]] with his English model girlfriend, Julia. Suffering from writer's block, Sam is on the verge of returning to America but witnesses the attack of a woman in an art gallery by a mysterious black-gloved assailant dressed in a raincoat.\n\nAttempting to reach her, Sam is trapped between two mechanically-operated glass doors and can only watch as the villain makes his escape. The woman, Monica Ranieri (the wife of the gallery's owner Alberto Ranieri), survives the attack and the local police confiscate Sam's passport to stop him from leaving the country. The assailant is believed to be a [[serial killer]] who is killing young women across the city, and Sam is an important witness.\n\nSam is haunted by what he saw that night, feeling sure that some vital clue is evading him, and he decides to help Inspector Morosini in his investigation. He interviews the pimp of a murdered prostitute and visits a shop where one of the victims worked. There, Sam finds that the last thing she sold on the day of her death was a painting of a stark landscape featuring a man in a raincoat assaulting a young woman. He visits the artist but finds only another dead end. As he makes his way back to his apartment, a black-gloved figure attacks Julia, but Sam arrives home just in time to save her, and the assailant escapes.\n\nSam starts to receive threatening phone calls from the killer. The police manage to isolate an odd cricketing noise in the background, which is later revealed to be the call of a rare breed of bird from [[Siberia]] called \"[[Grey crowned crane|The Bird with Crystal Plumage]]\" due to the translucent glint of its feathers. This clue proves crucial since the only one of its kind in Rome is kept in the Italian capital's zoo, allowing Sam and the police to identify the killer's abode. They once again find Monica Ranieri struggling with her husband Alberto, who is wielding a knife. After a short struggle, Alberto drops from six stories onto a concrete sidewalk below. As he dies, he confesses to the murders and tells them he loves his wife.\n\nFinding that Julia and Monica have run off, Sam goes after them, eventually coming to a darkened building. He finds his friend Carlo murdered and Julia bound, gagged, and wounded. The assailant emerges and is revealed as Monica Ranieri. Sam suddenly realizes that he didn't miss anything during the first attack; Sam misinterpreted what he saw: the attack he witnessed in the gallery was not Monica being assaulted but Monica attacking her husband, who was wearing the raincoat. She flees, and he pursues Monica to her art gallery. There he is trapped, pinned to the floor by the release of a wall-sized sculpture of wire and metal. Unable to free himself, he is teased by the knife-wielding Monica as she prepares to kill him. As she raises her knife, the police (who were notified by Julia, who escaped) burst in and apprehend her. Sam is freed, and Monica is taken to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIt is revealed through an interview with a psychiatrist that Monica was the victim of a traumatic attack ten years before. Seeing the painting of the attack drove her mad, causing her to identify with the assailant and not the victim. Alberto likewise suffered from an induced psychosis, helping her cover up the murders and committing some himself. Sam and Julia are reunited and return to America.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tony Musante]] as Sam Dalmas\n* [[Suzy Kendall]] as Julia\n* [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] as Inspector Morosini\n* [[Eva Renzi]] as Monica Ranieri\n* [[Umberto Raho]] as Alberto Ranieri\n* Renato Romano as Professor Carlo Dover\n* [[Giuseppe Castellano]] as Monti\n* [[Mario Adorf]] as Berto Consalvi\n* Pino Patti as Faiena\n* [[Gildo Di Marco]] as Garullo\n* Rosita Torosh as 4th Victim\n* Omar Bonaro as Police Detective\n* [[Fulvio Mingozzi]] as Police Detective\n* [[Werner Peters]] as Antique Dealer\n* Karen Valenti as Tina, 5th Victim\n* [[Carla Mancini]] as Girl watching TV\n* [[Reggie Nalder]] as Needles\n}}\n\n==Influences==\n[[File:L'uccello dalle piume di cristallo (1970) Rosita Torosh 2.png|thumb|The killer's shiny black raincoat and gloves were borrowed from Mario Bava's ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964).

Argento was initially exposed to the book by director [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], who was considering purchasing the film rights. Among the changes Argento made to Brown's story were a change of location from Chicago to Rome, making the killer the wife of an art dealer rather than an exotic dancer, and having the artwork that triggers her be a painting rather than a statuette.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|pp=54-58}} Brown's novel had previously been made into a [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] film, ''[[Screaming Mimi (film)|Screaming Mimi]]'' (1958), directed by [[Gerd Oswald]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01E6DB1F3AE73ABC4E51DFB0668383649EDE |last=Nason |first=Richard W |work=The New York Times |title=This Angry Age |date=June 26, 1958 |access-date=January 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe story is thought to have been influenced by the early [[Mario Bava]] giallo ''[[The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963), which also involves a witness to a murder later realizing that the person they took to be the victim was actually the perpetrator.{{sfn|McDonagh|2010|p=59}} The killer's outfit of a black raincoat, hat and gloves, which would go on to become a standard giallo trope, was introduced in Bava's ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964).{{sfn|Koven|2006|p=16}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'' was released in Berlin, Germany with a 94-minute running time at the Gloria-Palast on 24 June 1970.<ref name=filmportal /> In Germany it was marketed as an adaptation of a [[Bryan Edgar Wallace]] story.<ref name=Lucas2/> It was released in the United Kingdom under the title ''The Gallery Murders''.{{sfn|Koven|2006|p=52}}\n\nUpon its release the film was a huge [[box office]] hit, grossing 1,650,000,000 [[Italian Lira]].

Later pressings fixed it. [[Blue Underground]] later obtained the rights and re-released the film completely uncut, adding an extra shot of violence previously unseen. The picture was completely restored and the sound was remixed into both [[5.1 surround sound|5.1 audio]] for both Italian and English tracks, but contained another soundtrack remixed into [[DTS-ES]] 6.1 Discrete in English.\n\nBlue Underground released the film on Blu-ray Disc on 24 February 2009.
