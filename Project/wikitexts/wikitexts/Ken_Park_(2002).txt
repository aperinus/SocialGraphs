The film was directed and shot by Clark and [[Edward Lachman]]. The film is an [[international co-production]] of [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], [[Cinema of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], and [[Cinema of France|France]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[title character]] Ken Park (nicknamed \"Krap Nek\": his name spelled and pronounced backward), is a teenager skateboarding across [[Visalia, California]]. He arrives at a skate park, where he casually sets up a [[camcorder]], smiles, and shoots himself in the temple with a handgun. His death is used to bookend the film, which follows the lives of four other teenagers who knew him.\n\nShawn is the most stable of the four main characters. He is polite and caring. Throughout the story, he has an ongoing sexual relationship with his girlfriend's mother Rhonda, whom he tells that he fantasizes that he is with her when having sex with her daughter Hannah. He casually socializes with their family, the rest of whom are completely unaware of the affair.\n\nClaude fends off physical and emotional abuse from his alcoholic father while he tries to take care of his neglectful pregnant mother, who never does anything to defend him. Claude's father detests him for not being masculine enough. However, after coming home drunk one night, he attempts to perform [[oral sex]] on Claude, which prompts the boy to run away from home.\n\nPeaches is a girl who lives alone with her obsessive and highly-religious father, who fixates on her as the innocent embodiment of her deceased mother. When he catches her having sex with her boyfriend Curtis \u2013 whom she has playfully tied to her bed \u2013 he beats the boy and savagely disciplines her, then forces her to participate in a quasi-[[incestuous]] wedding ritual with him.\n\nTate is an unstable and sadistic adolescent living with his grandparents, whom he resents and abuses verbally. He engages in [[erotic asphyxiation|autoerotic asphyxiation]] while masturbating to a video of a woman playing tennis. He eventually kills his grandparents, in retaliation for petty grievances, and finds that it arouses him sexually. He records himself on his tape recorder so that the police will know how and why he did it, puts his grandfather's dentures in his mouth, lies naked in his bed, and falls asleep. He is later arrested.\n\nThe film cuts frequently between these subplots, with no overlap of characters or events until the end, when Shawn, Claude, and Peaches meet and have a [[threesome]]. In a game of \"who am I?\" afterward, they refer to an unnamed person they know who is now dead. The film cuts to a [[title screen]], followed by a flashback to before the opening scene. Ken has impregnated his girlfriend and taken a menial job. At the skate park, they discuss whether to abort the pregnancy, and she asks Ken rhetorically if he's glad his mother didn't abort him; he does not answer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tiffany Limos]] as \"Peaches\"\n* James Bullard as Shawn\n* Stephen Jasso as Claude\n* [[James Ransone]] as Tate\n* Adam Chubbuck as Ken Park\n* [[Maeve Quinlan]] as Rhonda\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Bob\n* Eddie Daniels as Shawn's Mother\n* Seth Gray as Shawn's Brother\n* Patricia Place as Tate's Grandmother\n* [[Harrison Young]] as Tate's Grandfather\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Claude's Pregnant Mother\n* [[Wade Williams]] as Claude's Father\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Peaches' Father\n* Zara McDowell as Zoe\n* Mike Apaletegui as Curtis\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as \"Murph\" Murphy\n* [[Larry Clark]] as Hot Dog Vendor\n\n==Production==\nClark attempted to write the first script for ''Ken Park'', basing it on personal experiences and people with whom he had grown up. Dissatisfied with his own draft, he hired [[Harmony Korine]] to pen the screenplay. Clark ultimately used most of Korine's script, but rewrote the ending.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The film was given a $1.3 million budget. The arrangement was to film using digital video, but Clark and Lachman used 35mm film instead.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macnab|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Swart|first2=Sharon|title=FilmCraft: Producing|date=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781136071171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6-TumR2s-YC|access-date=25 January 2016|language=en|format=Ebook}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ken Park (2002) Technical Specifications|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209077/technical|website=IMDB|access-date=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nAlthough it was sold for distribution to some 30 countries,<ref name=\"aus\">''[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/03/1057179099732.html Police quiz critic after raid]'' By Kirsty Needham, The Age, July 4, 2003.
