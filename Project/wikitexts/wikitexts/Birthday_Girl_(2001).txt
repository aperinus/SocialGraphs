The plot focuses on English bank clerk John Buckingham, who orders a [[Russians|Russian]] [[mail-order bride]], Nadia. It becomes clear upon her arrival that Nadia cannot speak English, and early into her stay, two mysterious men come to the house claiming to be her cousin and cousin's friend. The film features [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Ben Chaplin]], [[Mathieu Kassovitz]], and [[Vincent Cassel]]. English and Russian are spoken interchangeably in the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nJohn Buckingham ([[Ben Chaplin]]), a introverted, lonely [[St Albans]] bank clerk, orders a [[mail-order bride]] Nadia ([[Nicole Kidman]]) from Russia on the Internet. John is uncomfortable and shy, but Nadia is sexually bold.\n\nAlthough Nadia cannot speak English and John cannot speak Russian, they soon bond. Later on, a man she introduces as her cousin Yuri ([[Mathieu Kassovitz]]) and his friend Alexei ([[Vincent Cassel]]) turn up to celebrate her birthday. Alexei soon shows that he has a temper.\n\nAfter a violent altercation, Alexei holds Nadia hostage and demands a ransom from John. As he has grown to care for Nadia, he is forced to steal from the bank where he has worked for ten years. After the ransom is paid, he realises that he has been the victim of an elaborate con.  Nadia, Yuri, and Alexei are criminals, and Alexei is actually Nadia's boyfriend.\n\nThe trio have carried out the same scam on men from Switzerland, Greece and Germany. They take John prisoner, strip him down to his underpants, and tie him to a toilet in a motel. He eventually frees himself and quickly learns that Nadia has been left behind after Alexei discovered she was pregnant. John gets dressed and subsequently fights with her, who later reveals that she can indeed speak English and that her name is not Nadia.\n\nJohn takes Nadia to turn her in to the police, hoping to clear his name as a wanted bank robber. Ultimately however, he sympathises with her and decides against it. He leaves her at the airport, where she is kidnapped by Alexei, who now wants Nadia to have the baby. John rescues her, tying Alexei to a chair. They work together against the two Russian men. Nadia tells John that her real name is Sophia. John, disguised as Alexei, leaves for Russia with her.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Sophia/Nadia\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as John Buckingham\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Alexei\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Yuri\n* Kate Evans as Clare\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Bank Manager\n* [[Alexander Armstrong|Xander Armstrong]] as Robert Moseley\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Karen\n* Jo McInnes as Waitress\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Concierge\n* [[Jonathan Aris]] as D.I.
