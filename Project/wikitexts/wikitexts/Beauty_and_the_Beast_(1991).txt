Following the success of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale, which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical period drama. After seeing a test reel, Disney chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] scrapped Purdum's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to ''The Little Mermaid'' instead.<ref name=\"Beauty and the Beast\"/> Lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]] wrote the film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as the film's executive producer, died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-related complications six months before the film's release, and the film is thus dedicated to his memory.\n\n''Beauty and the Beast'' premiered as an unfinished film at the [[New York Film Festival]] on September 29, 1991, followed by its theatrical release as a completed film at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on November 13. The film grossed $331&nbsp;million at the box office worldwide on a $25&nbsp;million budget and received widespread critical acclaim for its romantic narrative, animation (particularly the ballroom scene), characters and musical numbers. ''Beauty and the Beast'' won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], the first animated film to ever win that category. It also became the first animated film to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] at the [[64th Academy Awards]], where it won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for its [[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|title song]] and received additional nominations for Best Original Song and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. In April 1994, ''Beauty and the Beast'' became Disney's first animated film to be adapted into a [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Broadway musical]], which ran until 2007.\n\nAn [[IMAX]] version of the film was released in 2002, and included the new song \"[[Human Again (Beauty and the Beast)|Human Again]]\", originally an eight-minute storyboarded musical sequence ultimately replaced with ''Something There'', but later revised in the 1994 musical as a five-minute piece. That same year, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=February 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205102818/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|url-status=live}}</ref> After the success of the 3D re-release of ''[[The Lion King]]'', the film was reissued in 3D in 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine|title='Beauty and the Beast', 'The Little Mermaid', 'Finding Nemo', 'Monsters, Inc.' get 3-D re-releases|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/04/disney-3d-beauty-beast-mermaid|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=October 27, 2011|date=October 4, 2011|first=Grady|last=Smith|archive-date=March 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326184249/http://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/04/disney-3d-beauty-beast-mermaid|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the film directed by [[Bill Condon]] was released on March 17, 2017.

When he refuses, she reveals her identity and, for the prince's arrogance, she transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another and be loved in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSeveral years later, in a nearby village, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an eccentric inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She frequently tries avoiding Gaston, a narcissistic hunter who wants to marry her because of her beauty. On his way to a fair to showcase his latest invention, an automatic wood-chopper, Maurice gets lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for trespassing. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out searching for him and finds him locked in the castle [[dungeon]]. The Beast agrees to free Maurice if she takes his place as prisoner.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants: Lumi\u00e8re the [[candelabra]], Cogsworth the [[clock]], Mrs. Potts the [[teapot]], and her son Chip, the teacup; they serve her a dinner through song. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast catches her and angrily forces her to flee the castle. In the woods, she is ambushed by a pack of [[wolves]], but the Beast rescues her and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his injuries, a rapport develops between them and as time passes, they begin to fall in love.\n\nMeanwhile, Maurice returns to the village and fails to convince the townsfolk of Belle's predicament. Hearing Maurice's statements about the Beast, Gaston hatches a plan: He bribes Monsieur D'Arque, the warden of the town's insane asylum, to have Maurice locked up as a lunatic. With no one to support her, Belle would have no choice but to marry Gaston. Before they can act, however, Maurice leaves for the castle to attempt a rescue alone.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle uses the Beast's magic mirror to check on her father and sees him collapsing in the woods. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror as a souvenir. After Belle takes her father to the village, a band of villagers led by Gaston arrives to detain Maurice. Belle uses the mirror to show the Beast to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston has her and her father locked in the basement and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast. With the help of Chip, who arrived at their house as a stowaway, and Maurice's wood-chopping machine, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, the Beast's servants fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed from Belle's departure to fight back but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally stabs the Beast with a knife and falls to his death.{{refn|Speaking together, with some crosstalk, [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]], [[Don Hahn]], and [[Alan Menken]] confirmed on the audio commentary that Gaston died after he fell off the rooftops.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\"/>|group=lower-alpha}} The Beast dies in Belle's arms before the last petal falls. Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, and the spell is undone, reviving the Beast and restoring his human form along with all his servants and his castle.

A few months after starting anew, Purdum resigned as director. The studio had approached [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] to direct the film, but they turned down the offer, saying they were \"tired\" after just having finished directing Disney's recent success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''. Katzenberg then hired first-time feature directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]]. Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of ''[[Cranium Command]]'', a short film for a Disney [[EPCOT]] theme park attraction. In addition, wanting another musical film, Katzenberg asked songwriters [[Howard Ashman]] and [[Alan Menken]], who had written the song score for ''The Little Mermaid'', to turn ''Beauty and the Beast'' into a Broadway-style musical film in the same vein as ''Mermaid''. Ashman, who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS, had been working with Disney on a pet project of his, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team. To accommodate Ashman's failing health, pre-production of ''Beauty and the Beast'' was moved from London to the [[Residence Inn by Marriott|Residence Inn]] in [[Fishkill, New York]], close to Ashman's New York City home.<ref name=\"wakingsleepingbeauty\" /> Here, Ashman and Menken joined Wise, Trousdale, Hahn, and Woolverton in retooling the film's script.<ref name=\"makingof\" /><ref name=\"story\" /> Since the original story had only two major characters, the filmmakers enhanced them, added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who \"add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story\" and guide the audience through the film, and added a \"real villain\" in the form of Gaston.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nThese ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of ''Beauty and the Beast'', which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston,<ref>{{cite book |first=Jerome |last=Griswold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecQuvwSSgzEC&q=%22gaston%22%22beauty%20and%20the%20beast%22%22avenant%22&pg=RA1-PA249 |title=The Meanings of 'Beauty and the Beast': A Handbook |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2004 |page=249 |isbn=1-55111-563-8 |access-date=October 14, 2020 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726183847/https://books.google.com/books?id=ecQuvwSSgzEC&pg=RA1-PA249&q=%22gaston%22%22beauty%20and%20the%20beast%22%22avenant%22 |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast's castle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.wcsu.edu/mccarneyh/fva/c/La_Belle_et_la_Bete_780.html |title=La Belle et la Bete |first=Kim |last=Humphreville |work=WCSU |access-date=July 15, 2010 |archive-date=November 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109215237/http://people.wcsu.edu/mccarneyh/fva/c/La_Belle_et_la_Bete_780.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version.

Other songs included \"[[Be Our Guest]]\", sung (in its original version) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade, \"[[Gaston (song)|Gaston]]\", a solo for the swaggering villain and his bumbling sidekick, \"Human Again\", a song describing Belle and Beast's growing love from the objects' perspective, the love ballad \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast (Tale as Old as Time)]]\" and the climactic \"[[The Mob Song]]\". As story and song development came to a close, full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> The ''Beauty'' songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than [[overdub]]bed separately, in order to give the songs a [[cast album]]-like \"energy\" the filmmakers and songwriters desired.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\" />\n\nDuring the course of production, many changes were made to the structure of the film, necessitating the replacement and re-purposing of songs. After screening a mostly animated version of the \"Be Our Guest\" sequence, story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father. Wise and Trousdale agreed, and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle. The film's title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production. Originally conceived as a rock-oriented song, it was changed to a slow, romantic ballad. Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song, but she did not think her voice was suited for the melody. When she voiced her doubts, Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take and told her to perform the song as she saw fit. Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition, nailing the song in the one take asked of her. This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song. \"Human Again\" was dropped from the film before animation began, as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place. \"[[Something There]]\", in which Belle and Beast sing (via voiceover) of their growing fondness for each other, was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of \"Human Again\".<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\" />\n\nMenken would later revise \"Human Again\" for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film's Special Edition re-release in 2002.<ref name=\"dvdcommentary\" /><ref name=\"makingof\" /> Ashman died of AIDS-related complications at the age of 40 on March 14, 1991, eight months before the film's release. He never saw the finished film, though he did get to see it in its unfinished format. Ashman's work on ''Aladdin'' was completed by another lyricist, [[Tim Rice]]. Before Ashman's death, members of the film's production team visited him after the film's well-received first screening, with Don Hahn commenting that \"the film would be a great success. Who'd have thought it?\", to which Ashman replied with \"I would.\" A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl: \"To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice, and a beast his soul. We will be forever grateful. Howard Ashman: 1950\u20131991.\"<ref name=\"wakingsleepingbeauty\" /> A pop version of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" theme, performed by [[C\u00e9line Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]] over the end credits, was released as a commercial single from the film's [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 soundtrack)|soundtrack]], supported with a music video. The Dion/Bryson version of \"Beauty and the Beast\" became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world.

In [[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|the first game]], the world has been destroyed and Belle kidnapped by the Heartless, led by [[Maleficent]], but the Beast travels to Maleficent's stronghold and works with [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] to defeat Maleficent and rescue Belle and the other captured princesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/kingdom-hearts-ii/Part_1_-_Beast%27s_Castle |title=Part 1 - Beast's Castle - Kingdom Hearts 2 Wiki Guide |website=IGN |date=March 28, 2006 |access-date=March 18, 2014 |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729041015/https://www.ign.com/wikis/kingdom-hearts-ii/Part_1_-_Beast%27s_Castle |url-status=live }}</ref> In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', the world has since been restored following Ansem's defeat, but Beast and Belle are having difficulties due to the enigmatic Xaldin of [[Organization XIII]] attempting to bring out the Beast's darker side in order to turn him into a Heartless and a Nobody, but the Beast eventually comes to his senses and works with Sora once again to defeat Xaldin once and for all. In the game's ending credits, the Beast turns back into the Prince. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days]]'', the world is featured as a playable level but the story is not essential to the main plot. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts \u03c7]]'', the world is featured again, this time as a hallucination that follows the plot of the movie more closely. The characters featured in the series are Beast, Belle, Lumiere, Gaston, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Maurice, and the Wardrobe. After Gaston is defeated, the Beast transforms back into the Prince. Gaston does not appear in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', the world's primary antagonist being Xaldin, an original character created for the series, but who shares several traits with Forte, the main antagonist of ''Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas''.<ref name=\"autogeneratedii\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/wikis/kingdom-hearts-ii/Part_2_-_Beast%27s_Castle |title=Part 2 - Beast's Castle - Kingdom Hearts 2 Wiki Guide |website=IGN |date=March 28, 2006 |access-date=March 18, 2014 |archive-date=October 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028064241/https://www.ign.com/wikis/kingdom-hearts-ii/Part_2_-_Beast%27s_Castle |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nThe success of the film spawned three [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]]'' (1997) and ''[[Belle's Magical World|Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World]]'' (1998), and ''[[Belle's Tales of Friendship]]'' (1999), all of which take place in the timeline of the original.
