He does not admit his identity or reveal the entire story to the nurse who cares for him and the man who suspects him until the end of the film. This form of exposition is very different from the book, where, under the influence of morphine, the patient talks about his past. The film ends with a definitive onscreen statement that it is a highly fictionalized account of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] (died 1951) and other historical figures and events.\n\nThe film received 12 nominations at the [[69th Academy Awards]], winning nine, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Minghella, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Juliette Binoche]]. It was also the first to receive a [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]] Oscar for a [[Non-linear editing system|digitally edited]] film. [[Ralph Fiennes]], playing the titular character, and [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] were Oscar-nominated for their performances. The film also won five [[BAFTA Awards]] and two [[Golden Globes]]. The [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''The English Patient'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|55th greatest British film of the 20th century]].<ref>[http://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films''] (1999). Retrieved August 27, 2016</ref>\n\nAs of August 2021, the novel is currently in early development for a new [[BBC]] television series, co-produced by [[Miramax Television]] and [[Paramount Television Studios]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Anna |title=The English Patient \u2013 is it time to revive the epic romance? |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20210924-the-english-patient-is-it-time-to-revive-the-epic-romance |access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='The English Patient' TV Series Adaptation In Works At BBC From Emily Ballou & Miramax TV |url=https://deadline.com/2021/08/the-english-patient-tv-adaptation-bbc-emily-ballou-miramax-1234817054/ |access-date=27 September 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn [[Interwar period|interwar vintage]] British [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|biplane]], flying across a sea of desert, is shot down by [[Nazi Germany|German gunners]]. The badly burned pilot is pulled from the wreckage and rescued by a group of [[Bedouin]].\n\nHana, a [[French-Canadian]] combat nurse of the [[Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps]] during WWII, learns from a wounded soldier that her boyfriend has been killed in action.\n\nIn [[Italian campaign (World War II)|October 1944 Italy]], Hana is caring for a dying, scarred-from-burns [[England|English-accented]] patient who says he cannot remember his name. His only possession is a copy of [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], with personal notes, pictures, and mementos stored inside. When a nurse friend is killed in front of her, Hana decides she is a curse to those who love her. She gains permission to settle in a bombed-out monastery with her patient, as he suffers extra during relocations of her hospital unit.\n\nThey are soon joined by Lt. Kip, a [[Sikh]] [[sapper]] in the [[British Indian Army]] posted with Sgt. Hardy to clear German mines and booby traps. David Caravaggio, a [[Canadian Intelligence Corps]] operative who was tortured during a German interrogation, also arrives at the monastery. Caravaggio questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past through a series of flashbacks. Over the days of Alm\u00e1sy relating his story, Hana and Kip begin a shy love affair.\n\nThe patient reveals that in the late 1930s he was exploring a region of the Sahara. He is, in fact, Hungarian cartographer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]], who was part of a [[Royal Geographical Society]] archeological and surveying expedition with a group including his good friend, Englishman Peter Madox, and British couple Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who own a plane and contribute with aerial surveys.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy learns information from a Bedouin which helps the group discover the [[Cave of Swimmers]], an ancient site of cave paintings. The group begins to document their find, during which time Alm\u00e1sy and Katharine fall in love. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which Katharine discovers when Alm\u00e1sy awkwardly accepts her offer of two watercolours she has painted of the cave imagery and asks her to paste them into the book.\n\nThe two begin an affair on their return to Cairo, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Alm\u00e1sy buys her a silver thimble as a gift. Some months later, Katharine abruptly ends their affair from fear Geoffrey will discover it. Shortly afterward the archaeological projects are halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his [[De Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]] aeroplane at [[Kufra|Kufra Oasis]] before his intended return to Britain.\n\nCaravaggio reveals that he has been seeking revenge for his injuries, and has killed the German interrogator who cut off his thumbs and the spy who identified him, but has been searching for the man who provided maps to the Germans, allowing them to infiltrate Cairo. He suspects the patient is Alm\u00e1sy, asking \"Did you kill the Cliftons?\", to which Alm\u00e1sy concedes \"Maybe... I did\".\n\nReminiscing for Caravaggio, with Hana listening in from an adjoining room, Alm\u00e1sy recalls packing camp [[Capture of Kufra|in 1941]] when Geoffrey arrives overhead. He dives straight for Alm\u00e1sy, who jumps out of the way. Scrambling over to the wreckage, he finds Geoffrey dead at the controls and Katharine badly injured in the front seat. She tells him Geoffrey knew, and was attempting a double murder-suicide. Alm\u00e1sy carries her to the Cave of Swimmers. He notices she is wearing a chain bearing his gift, and she declares she has always loved him.\n\nLeaving her in the cave with provisions and his book, Alm\u00e1sy walks three days cross-desert. Arriving at British-held [[El Tag]], he explains the desperate situation and asks for help, but a young officer detains Alm\u00e1sy on suspicion of being a spy. Transported away by train, Alm\u00e1sy escapes and eventually comes into contact with a German army unit. They take him to the Kufra Oasis, where Madox has hidden his plane. Exchanging maps for fuel, Alm\u00e1sy takes to the air and finally reaches the cave, where he confirms that Katharine has died. He carries her body to the plane, and he is burned when shot down, connecting to the start of the film. After hearing the story, Caravaggio gives up his quest for revenge.\n\nKip is reposted once he has cleared the area of explosives; he and Hana agree they will meet again. Later, pushing several vials of morphine toward Hana, Alm\u00e1sy tells her he has had enough. Though visibly upset, she grants his wish and administers a lethal dose. As he drifts to sleep, she reads him Katharine's final letter, written to Alm\u00e1sy while she was alone in the cave. The next morning Caravaggio returns with a friend, and they get a lift to Florence. Hana holds Alm\u00e1sy's book tight as they ride away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy|Alm\u00e1sy]]\n*[[Juliette Binoche]] as Hana\n*[[Willem Dafoe]] as Caravaggio\n*[[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Katharine Clifton\n*[[Naveen Andrews]] as Kip\n*[[Colin Firth]] as Geoffrey Clifton\n*[[Julian Wadham]] as Madox\n*[[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Major Muller\n*[[Kevin Whately]] as Hardy\n*[[Clive Merrison]] as Fenelon-Barnes\n*[[Nino Castelnuovo]] as D'Agostino\n*[[Hichem Rostom]] as Fouad\n*Peter R\u00fchring as Bermann\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Torri Higginson]] plays Mary and [[Liisa Repo-Martell]] plays the soon-killed Jan, appearing briefly as Hana's nursing corps colleagues.\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Triumph 3HW 350cc motorcycle.jpg|thumb|right|Triumph 3HW 350cc motorcycle specified in the novel as Kip's choice of transport and used in the film]]\n\n[[Saul Zaentz]] was interested in working with [[Anthony Minghella]] after he saw the director's film ''[[Truly, Madly, Deeply]]'' (1990); Minghella brought this project to the producer's attention.

Once he began, the possibilities became apparent, some of which took him away from the order of the original script. A reel without sound was made so scene change visuals would be consistent with the quality of the aural aspect between the two. The final cut features over 40 temporal transitions. It was during this time that Murch met Ondaatje and they were able to exchange thoughts about editing the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_31.html |title=The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film by Michael Ondaatje |first=Chris |last=Bolton |work=Powell's Books |date=31 August 2002 |access-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530052328/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_08_31.html |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTwo types of aircraft are used in the film,<ref name=\"impdb.org\">{{cite web |url= http://www.impdb.org/index.php?title=The_English_Patient |title=The English Patient |work=The Internet Movie Plane Database |year=2015 |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref> a [[De Havilland D.H.82 Tiger Moth]] and a [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75]].

The double-tape release is much harder to come by and has a slightly different sleeve design on both the tapes and case. The double tape has the cover art on the front of the case slightly cropped more to the right than the single-tape release and has the 'Recommend this Hit to Friends!' disclaimer on the tape sleeve, indicating a slightly older release. It also has a '--Part 1--' or '--Part 2--' disclaimer. Neither of these gimmicks are present on the single-tape release of the movie.\n\nAlso to note is the previews on each version of the original release: the two-tape version has several previews (including previews for [[The Horse Whisperer (film)|''The Horse Whisperer'']], [[Evita (1996 film)|''Evita'']], and [[...First Do No Harm|''First Do No Harm'']]) plus a promo for the movie's soundtrack. The single-tape version has no previews, aside from a promo for the book ''The English Patient''.\n\nIn 1998, the film was re-released on a single VHS tape in widescreen. The cover has a widescreen banner and has the image cropped properly, unlike the two earlier releases. This was also the first DVD release of the movie.\n\nOver the next several years, it would be re-released in America on VHS, DVD, and Blu-Ray.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
