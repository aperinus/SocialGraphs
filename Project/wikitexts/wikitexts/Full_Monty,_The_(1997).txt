The screenplay was written by [[Simon Beaufoy]]. The film is set in [[Sheffield]], England during the 1990s, and tells the story of six unemployed men, four of them former steel workers, who decide to form a male [[striptease]] act (\u00e0 la the [[Chippendales|Chippendale dancers]]) in order to make some money and for the main character, Gaz, to be able to see his son. Gaz declares that their show will be much better than the renowned Chippendales dancers because they will go \"[[the full monty]]\"\u2014[[Striptease|strip]] all the way\u2014hence the film's title.\n\nDespite being a comedy, the film also touches on serious subjects such as [[unemployment]], [[fathers' rights]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[impotence]], [[homosexuality]], [[body image]], [[working class culture]] and [[suicide]]. ''The Full Monty'' was a major critical success upon release and an international commercial success, grossing over $250&nbsp;million from a budget of only $3.5&nbsp;million. It was the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United Kingdom|highest-grossing film in the UK]] until it was outsold by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. It won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award]] and [[European Film Award for Best Film]], and was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]], winning the last.\n\nThe [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''The Full Monty'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|25th best British film of the 20th century]]. The film was adapted into a [[The Full Monty (musical)|musical in 2000]], a [[The Full Monty (play)|play in 2013]] and a planned television series.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1990s, the once-successful steel mills of [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]] have shut down and most of the staff have been made redundant. Former steelworkers Gary \"Gaz\" Schofield and Dave Horsefall have resorted to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills to sell in order to make some cash, taking Gaz's son Nathan with them for assistance, but a security guard keeps surprising them and locking them inside the steel mill.\n\nGaz is facing trouble from his former wife Mandy and her boyfriend Barry over [[child support]] payments that he has been unable to pay since losing his job. Nathan lives with Mandy and Barry but Gaz has joint custody of him with Mandy. Nathan wishes he and his father Gaz could do more \"normal stuff\" together. Mandy is seeking a court ruling giving her sole custody of Nathan, whom Gaz loves dearly. Gaz is desperate for money and for Nathan\u2019s love.\n\nOne day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a local club to see a [[Chippendales|Chippendales']] [[striptease]] act, and is inspired to form his own striptease group using local men, hoping to make enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Gaz once worked, whose suicide attempt they interrupt. Next, they recruit Gerald Cooper, their former foreman, who is hiding his unemployment from his wife. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class, and recruit him to teach them some actual dance moves.\n\nLooking for more recruits, the four men hold an open audition and settle on Horse, an older man who is nevertheless a good dancer, and Guy, who can't dance at all but proves to be unusually well-endowed. The six men begin to practise their act. Gaz then learns that he has to pay a \u00a3100 deposit in order to secure the club for the night. He cannot afford this, but Nathan gets the money out of his savings, saying he trusts Gaz to repay him. When they are greeted by two local women while putting up posters for the show, Gaz boasts that they are better than the real Chippendales because they go \"the [[Full monty (phrase)|full monty]]\". Dave, struggling with his body image, drops out and finds a job as a security guard at [[Asda]]. The others publicly rehearse at the mill for some female relatives of Horse, but a passing policeman catches them mid-show, and Gaz, Gerald and Horse are arrested for indecent exposure, costing Gaz the right to see Nathan. Lomper and Guy manage to escape to Lomper's house, where they look lovingly at each other, starting a relationship.\n\nGerald is thrown out by Linda after [[bailiff]]s arrive at their house and seize their belongings to pay Gerald's debts, resulting in him having to stay with Gaz. Later Gaz goes to Asda and asks Dave if he could \"borrow\" a jacket for Lomper's mother's funeral. Dave agrees and also decides to quit his security job. They steal two suit jackets and go to the funeral together.\n\nSoon, the group find the act and their arrest has popularised them. They agree to forgo the plan, until Gaz learns that the show is sold out. He convinces the others to do it just for one night only. Gerald is unsure as he has now got the job that Gaz and Dave earlier tried to sabotage his interview for, but agrees to do it just once. Initially Dave still refuses, but regains his confidence after encouragement from his wife, Jean, and joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. Nathan also arrives with Dave, having secretly come along, and tells Gaz that Mandy is there, but she would not let Barry go with her.\n\nGaz refuses to do the act because there are men in the audience (including the police officers who watched the footage of the security camera's recording of them earlier), when the posters were supposed to say it was for women only. The other five are starting the act when Nathan orders his father to go out on stage. Gaz, proud of his son, joins the others and performs in front of the audience and Mandy, who seems to see him in a new light. The film finishes with the group performing on stage in front of an enthusiastic packed house, stripping to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' version of \"[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]\" (their hats being the final item removed) with astounding success.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Gary \"Gaz\" Schofield\n* [[Mark Addy]] as Dave Horsefall\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Gerald Arthur Cooper\n* [[Steve Huison]] as Lomper\n* [[Paul Barber (actor)|Paul Barber]] as Barrington \"Horse\" Mitchell\n* [[Hugo Speer]] as Guy\n* William Snape as Nathan Schofield\n* [[Lesley Sharp]] as Jean Horsefall\n* [[Emily Woof]] as Mandy\n* [[Deirdre Costello]] as Linda Cooper\n* Paul Butterworth as Barry\n* [[Dave Hill (actor)|Dave Hill]] as Alan\n* [[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]] as Reg\n* Andrew Livingston as Terry\n* Vinny Dhillon as Sharon\n* [[Kate Rutter]] as Dole Clerk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Film4 Productions|Channel 4 Films]] paid for the screenplay to be written but then declined to invest any equity in the film.

''City on the Move'' was produced and directed by Jim and Marie-Luise Coulthard and showed a modern thriving city that was rapidly developing thanks to the successful steel industry in Sheffield. However, the film went virtually unnoticed until the Coulthards were approached about some of the footage being included in ''The Full Monty'' for a payment of \u00a3400, which they accepted. In 2008, ''City on the Move'' was released on DVD under the new name ''The Reel Monty.''<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 8, 2008 |title=See Sheffield reel time in 1969 - VIDEO |work=Sheffield Star |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/video/See-Sheffield-reel-time-in.4568255.jp |url-status=dead |access-date=October 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202053114/http://www.thestar.co.uk/video/See-Sheffield-reel-time-in.4568255.jp |archive-date=December 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Full monty (phrase)}}\nThe film features frequent use of British [[slang]], and in particular [[Sheffielder]] dialect.\n\nThe film's title is a phrase generally used in the United Kingdom to mean \"the whole lot\", or \"the whole hog\"; in the film, the characters use it to refer to full nudity&nbsp;\u2014 as Horse says, \"No one said anything to me about the full monty!\" The phrase, whose origin is obscure, gained a renewed prominence in British culture following the film.\n\nOther dialect words are used in the film; some such as ''[[nesh]]'' (meaning a person unusually susceptible to cold) are widespread across the [[North Midlands]] region.

The funniest moments are frequently the most subtle, like when five of the strippers, standing in the dole line, find themselves unable to resist dancing in place when Donna Summers's \"Hot Stuff\" comes on the radio. There's surprisingly little raunch, in part because the film can't stop thinking of women as enemies of a sort (at least ''Monty'' is less offensive than ''[[Brassed Off]]'' in that department). And refreshingly, its definition of male bonding is broad enough to let two of the lads find love in each other's arms.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=14 August 1997|title=The Full Monty|journal=Time Out New York}}</ref>\n\nReview aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively reports that 96% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 50 reviews, with an average score of 7.50/10.

It also opened at number one in Australia where it remained for five weeks.
