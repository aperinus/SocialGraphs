Toole]], the pen name of fight manager and [[cutman]] Jerry Boyd. It also stars [[Hilary Swank]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The film follows Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald (Swank), an underdog amateur boxer who is helped by an underappreciated boxing trainer (Eastwood) to achieve her dream of becoming a professional.\n\n''Million Dollar Baby'' was theatrically released on December 15, 2004, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It received critical acclaim and grossed $216.8 million worldwide. The film garnered seven nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] and won four: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Swank), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (for Freeman).\n\n==Plot==\nMargaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a waitress from the [[Ozarks]], shows up at the Hit Pit, a rundown [[Los Angeles]] gym owned and operated by Frankie Dunn. Dunn is a cantankerous [[Irish-American]] trainer, revealed to be estranged from his own daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses as he does not train women and she is too old to begin a boxing career. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee\u2014the film's narrator\u2014encourages and helps Maggie. \nFrankie's prize prospect, \"Big Willie\" Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. Frankie then reluctantly agrees to train Maggie.\n\nMaggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching. Since she has earned a reputation for quick [[Knockout|KOs]], Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mickey Mack but, out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a [[Irish language|Gaelic]] nickname, embroidered on her boxing robe, [[Macushla|''Mo Chuisle'']] (misspelled in the film as \"mo cuishle\"), but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but her mother berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.\n\nFrankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in [[Las Vegas]] against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as an unpunished dirty fighter. Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell rings to end the round. Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].\n\nWhile in the hospital, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family. They arrive only after first touring [[Disneyland]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]. Accompanied by an attorney, their sole concern is to get Maggie's assets transferred to them. Disgusted, she orders them to leave and threatens to report their [[welfare fraud]] if they try to contact her again.\n\nMaggie soon develops [[bedsore]]s and undergoes an [[amputation]] for an infected leg. She then asks Frankie to [[Euthanasia|help her die]], declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life.  A horrified Frankie refuses, so Maggie later bites off her own tongue in an attempt to bleed to death. Knowing the fatherly affection Frankie has developed for Maggie, Frankie's priest warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's request. Frankie then sneaks into the hospital one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], he tells Maggie the meaning of \"mo chuisle\": \"my darling, and my blood.\" He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's actual true character.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Frankie Dunn, a gruff but well-meaning elderly boxing trainer.\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer trained up by Frankie Dunn.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant and former boxer.\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Dangerous Dillard Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch or \"Danger\", a simpleton would-be boxer.\n* [[Mike Colter]] as \"Big\" Willie Little, a boxer whom Dunn has trained for years.\n* [[Lucia Rijker]] as Billie \"The Blue Bear\" Osterman, a former prostitute and vicious boxer.\n* [[Br\u00edan F.

Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a $30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest.

The Disability Rights Education Fund released a statement about the film in February 2005 that included the following: \"Perhaps the most central stereotype fueling disability prejudice is the mistaken assumption inherent in the message of the movie that the quality of life of individuals with disabilities is unquestionably not worth living. This stereotype is contradicted by the personal experience of many thousands of people with significant disabilities in this country and around the world who view our own lives as ordinary and normal. It is further contradicted by plenty of hard data.
