The [[screenplay]] by Schachter and [[William H. Macy]] is based on the 1991 novel of the same title by [[Peter Lefcourt]]. Macy and [[Meg Ryan]] co-star.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Cape Town]] and other [[South Africa]]n locations. It premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] and was the opening night attraction at the [[Sarasota Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article432550.ece \"Here's ''The Deal'', at last,\" ''St. Petersburg Times'', March 28, 2008]</ref> It also was shown at the [[Philadelphia Film Festival]], the [[Hawaii International Film Festival|Maui Film Festival]], and the [[Traverse City Film Festival]], among others, but never was given a theatrical release in the United States. It was released on Region 1 DVD on January 20, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nStruggling Hollywood [[film producer]] Charlie Berns is on the verge of [[suicide]] when his aspiring [[screenwriter]] nephew Lionel arrives from [[New Jersey]] with a script about 19th century British statesman [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. Charlie agrees to make the film, but only when he converts the literate [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]-style script (that he didn't read) into an [[Action film|action adventure]] [[Middle East]]ern [[espionage]] film, ''Ben Disraeli: Freedom Fighter''.\n\nHe casts power-star [[African American]] Bobby Mason, a recent convert to [[Judaism]], in the title role and, after some creative wrangling with studio big-wigs and feisty project developer Deidre Hearn, whom he is instantly attracted to, he proceeds to set up production in South Africa. Charlie then lies to the studio, saying Bobby insists Deidre, who has purposely avoided Charlie, be sent to South Africa to assist on the production. She arrives, and she and Charlie eventually '[[Casual relationship|hook-up]]'. After Bobby is kidnapped by terrorists during the shoot, and the film is shut down, Deidre hatches a scheme to produce Lionel's original script '[[wikt:on the Q.T.|on the Q.T.]]'. Using financing that must stay in [[Prague]], Charlie and Deidre manage to film Lionel's original movie there, which goes on to receive seven [[Golden Globe]] nominations, making Charlie and Deidre the newest [[power couple]] producers in Hollywood.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William H. Macy]] as Charlie Berns\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Deidre Hearn\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Bobby Mason\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Rabbi Seth Gutterman\n* [[Jason Ritter]] as Lionel Travitz\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Fiona Hicks\n* [[John Carson (actor)|John Carson]] as Nigel Bland\n* David Hunt as Grier Clark\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Peter Debruge said, \"The characters seem to be doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan - hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success . . . Elliott Gould gets laughs as the credit-hungry [[rabbi]] pulled in to consult on the film, although a few [[A-list]] celebrity [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] in the movie-star roles would have gone a long way toward completing the illusion.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=review&id=2471&reviewid=VE1117935918&cs=1 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nAlthough Matt Prigge of the ''[[Philadelphia Weekly]]'' felt there was \"nothing remotely original\" about the film, he thought it \"just happens to be sprightlier than most, zipping along from one familiar but well-deployed yuk to the next and anchored by the surprisingly winning team of Macy and Meg Ryan.\"<ref>[http://festphanatic.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/what-i-peeped-day-three/ ''Philadelphia Weekly'' review]</ref>\n\nMichael Atkinson of the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'' called the film a \"bouncy, sharp-edged farce . . . [whose] target audience is, to some degree, its own cast and crew. Yet it\u2019s difficult to resist when the purely idiotic is openly mocked by a sure-footed cast of line readers led by William H. Macy . . .  Meg Ryan gets a somewhat thankless role . . . but the dialogue is fast, and of course the target is a fat, awful, patronizing goldfish in a small bowl begging to be shot.\"<ref>[http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Movies/71508-Ends-of-the-earth/?page=2#TOPCONTENT ''Boston Phoenix'' review]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0848281|The Deal}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1190825_deal}}\n\n{{Steven Schachter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deal, The}}\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steven Schachter]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jeff Beal]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Africa]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
