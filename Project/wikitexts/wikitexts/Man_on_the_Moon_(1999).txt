The film was directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] and also features [[Danny DeVito]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[Paul Giamatti]].\n\nThe story traces Kaufman's steps from childhood through the [[comedy club]]s and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', and his role as [[Latka Gravas]] on the sitcom ''[[Taxi (sitcom)|Taxi]]'', which was popular among viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various [[In-joke|inside jokes]], [[confidence trick|scams]], put-ons, and [[happening]]s for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running \"feud\" with wrestler [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]] and his portrayal of the character of bawdy [[lounge music|lounge singer]] [[Tony Clifton]].\n\nIt was released on December 22, 1999, in the United States and May 5, 2000, in the United Kingdom by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in some markets. Although the film was unsuccessful commercially and received mixed reviews, Carrey received critical acclaim for his performance and won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]], his second in a row after his award for ''[[The Truman Show]]''. His win was in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Musical or Comedy]] category.\n\nThe documentary ''[[Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond]]'' was released in 2017 and chronicles Carrey's performance as Kaufman in the film, a performance he maintained during much of the film's production.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Andy Kaufman]] is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \"foreign man\" character puts on a [[rhinestone]] jacket and does a dead-on [[Elvis impersonation]]. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them.\n\nKaufman catches the eye of talent agent [[George Shapiro]], who signs him as a client and immediately lands him a network television series, ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'', much to Kaufman's dismay, since he didn't like [[sitcom]]s. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named [[Latka Gravas]]. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit.\n\nInvited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, [[Tony Clifton]], whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on ''Taxi''. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \"villain character\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, [[Bob Zmuda]]. Once again, the gag is on the audience.\n\nKaufman's profile increases with appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange [[anti-humor]] and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' aloud from start to finish. Kaufman shows up on the ''Taxi'' set as Clifton and proceeds to cause chaos until he is removed from the set. He relates to Shapiro that he never knows exactly how to entertain an audience \"short of faking my own death or setting the theater on fire.\"\n\nKaufman decides to become a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] \u2014 but to emphasize the \"villain\" angle, he will wrestle only women (hired actresses) and then berate them after winning, declaring himself \"Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion.\" He becomes smitten with one woman he wrestles, Lynne Margulies, and they begin a romantic relationship. His professional issues are deepened when, during an appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s live television comedy show ''Fridays'', Kaufman refuses to speak his lines.\n\nKaufman feuds publicly with [[Jerry Lawler]], a male professional star wrestler, who challenges him to a \"real wrestling match\", which Kaufman accepts. Lawler easily overpowers and appears to seriously injure Kaufman. Lawler and an injured Kaufman (wearing a neck brace) appear on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', ostensibly to call a truce, but instead the feud escalates and they trade insults. Lawler hits Kaufman, who spews a vicious profanity tirade and throws coffee at Lawler.\n\nKaufman pays the price when he is voted off from ''SNL'' following a vote of audience members, weary and bored of his wrestling antics. Shapiro advises Kaufman and Lawler, who are actually the best of friends and have staged the whole feud as a joke, that he thinks they should never work together again. Shapiro later calls Kaufman to inform him that ''Taxi'' has been canceled. Shapiro is despondent, but Kaufman is not at all bothered.\n\nAfter a show at a comedy club, Kaufman calls together Lynne, Zmuda, and Shapiro to disclose that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of [[lung cancer]] and may die soon. Initially they are not sure whether to believe this, thinking it could be yet another of Kaufman's jokes, with Zmuda actually believing a fake death would be a fantastic [[practical joke|prank]]. With little time to live, Kaufman arranges a booking at [[Carnegie Hall]], his dream venue. The performance is a memorable success, culminating with Kaufman inviting the entire audience out for milk and cookies. As his health deteriorates rapidly, a desperate Kaufman heads to the [[Philippines]] to seek a medical miracle through [[psychic surgery]] only to find it a hoax, laughing at the irony. He dies soon after. At Kaufman's funeral, friends and loved ones sing along to \"[[This Friendly World]]\" with a video of Kaufman. One year later, in 1985, Tony Clifton appears at Kaufman's tribute at [[The Comedy Store]]'s main stage, performing \"[[I Will Survive]]\". Zmuda watches in the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Andy Kaufman]] / [[Tony Clifton]] / [[Latka Gravas]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as [[George Shapiro]]\n* [[Courtney Love]] as Lynne Margulies\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Bob Zmuda]] / Tony Clifton\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Stanley Kaufman\n* [[Leslie Lyles]] as Janice Kaufman\n* [[George Shapiro]] as Mr. Besserman\n* [[Richard Belzer]] as Himself\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Blue Collar Guy\n* Melanie Vesey as Carol Kaufman\n* [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as Michael Kaufman\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Maynard Smith\n* [[Peter Bonerz]] as [[Ed Weinberger]]\n* Michael Villani as [[Merv Griffin]]\n* [[Bob Zmuda]] as Jack Burns\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as National Enquirer Editor\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral original members of the cast of ''Taxi'', including [[Marilu Henner]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Carol Kane]], and [[Jeff Conaway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2003/apr/29/actor-conaway-sues-mandalay-bay/ |title=Actor Conaway sues Mandalay Bay|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|last=Lawson|first=Jen|date=April 29, 2003|access-date=September 20, 2018|quote=[...] Most recently, Conaway reprised his \"Taxi\" character and also played himself in the 1999 Jim Carrey movie \"Man on the Moon.}}</ref> make cameos, playing themselves.

Carrey's adherence to the role reached the extent where he would develop unscripted tics and habits that were previously characteristic of Kaufman himself. Among other examples, Courtney Love noted how Carrey would stuff his clothing with [[Limburger cheese]] on the set when playing Kaufman's [[Tony Clifton]] character in the film, something Kaufman had done in his own performances of the character.<ref name=stern/>\n\nA documentary, ''[[Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond]]'', was released in November 2017. Using behind-the-scenes footage, the documentary covers the production of ''Man on the Moon'' with a particular focus on Carrey's method-acting as Kaufman.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Man on the Moon (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Man on the Moon (soundtrack)|soundtrack for the film]] was written by [[rock music|rock]] band [[R.E.M.]], whose 1992 song \"[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man on the Moon]]\" (originally written in honor of Kaufman) gave the film its title. The soundtrack also included the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated song \"[[The Great Beyond]]\", which remains the band's highest-charting single in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/man-on-the-moon-mw0000255991|work=AllMusic|title=Man on the Moon - Original Soundtrack|access-date=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nThe film makes a few changes to Kaufman's life story. As Kaufman (played by Carrey) explains in the film's prologue, \"All the most important things in my life are changed around and mixed up for dramatic purposes.\"\n\nThe famous [[Carnegie Hall]] \"milk and cookies\" [[Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall|performance]], portrayed in the film as one of his last performances after being diagnosed with cancer, had in fact occurred in 1979, five years before Kaufman's death and well before his diagnosis. Also, the film is deliberately ambiguous over whether Kaufman actually died or if this was a hoax as some fans believe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/kaufman.asp |title=Andy Kaufman Is Still Alive? |publisher=snopes.com |date=2014-09-29 |access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe film implies that [[Carol Kane]] was a member of the ''Taxi'' cast during the show's first season, which in real life was 1978\u201379. In actuality, Kane did not make her first appearance on the series until the episode \"Guess Who's Coming for Brefnish\", which first aired on ABC in January 1980 during the show's second season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/taxi-guess-whos-coming-for-brefnish-319871 |title=Taxi: Guess Who's Coming for Brefnish (1980) | work=AllMovie | publisher=RhythmOne | access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref> The film implies that ''Taxi'' was canceled only once. However, the show went on for one more season on NBC.\n\nOther inaccuracies include scenes supposedly drawn from ''SNL'', specifically the first episode's host, who is depicted as having been [[Richard Belzer]] but was [[George Carlin]] in real life. Belzer also erroneously refers to the show as \"Saturday Night Live\" during the sequence, but that title wasn't adopted until season two.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/3426553/saturday-night-live-history/ |last=Rothman |first=Lily |title=The Surprising Story Behind Saturday Night Live's Most Famous Line |magazine=Time |date=September 26, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2022}}</ref> The scene where [[Lorne Michaels]] asks the home viewing audience to vote Kaufman off the show happened in 1982, two years after Michaels left the show as executive producer and [[Dick Ebersol]] took over.<ref>Shales, Tom, and James Andrew Miller.

[[Max Allan Collins]] maintained that the filmmakers did not understand Kaufman, and that the film \"does not give Kaufman the credit for his genius, that he had a complete intellectual grasp of what he was up to and a showman's instincts for how to play an audience.\"<ref>[http://www.hollywood.com/news/COMMENTARY_Man_on_the_Moon_Misses_Kaufman/311826 'Man on the Moon' Misses Kaufman] by Max Allan Collins. 6 January 2000.
