The film chronicles an unlikely friendship between aspiring actors [[Tommy Wiseau]] and Sestero that results in the production of Wiseau's 2003 film ''[[The Room]]'', widely considered one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. ''The Disaster Artist'' stars brothers James and [[Dave Franco]] as Wiseau and Sestero, respectively, alongside a supporting cast featuring [[Alison Brie]], [[Ari Graynor]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Jacki Weaver]], and [[Seth Rogen]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on December 8, 2015.

See WP:FILMPLOT -->In [[San Francisco]] in 1998, 19-year-old Greg Sestero befriends Tommy Wiseau in [[Shelton Studios|Jean Shelton]]'s [[Drama school|acting class]] after Tommy gives a protracted and bizarre interpretation of a scene from ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. Greg is impressed by Tommy's fearlessness, though Tommy also exhibits unusual habits and mannerisms; for instance, he can afford apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, but he will not discuss his personal life or the source of his wealth. Tommy also insists he is from [[New Orleans]], despite his pronounced European accent. At Tommy's suggestion, the two move to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue acting careers.\n\nGreg signs with talent agent [[Iris Burton]] and regularly attends auditions. At the same time, Tommy is consistently rejected by agencies, acting teachers, casting directors, and producers. He also seems to think that Amber, Greg's new girlfriend, is sabotaging his friendship with Greg. When Greg's auditions begin to dry up, he shares his frustrations with Tommy, who decides to make a film for them to star in. Tommy writes the screenplay for ''The Room'', a [[melodrama]] about a [[love triangle]] between banker Johnny (played by Tommy), his fianc\u00e9e Lisa, and his best friend Mark (played by Greg, who is also given a [[line producer]] credit). They rent production space from Birns & Sawyer, from whom Tommy insists on buying, rather than renting, all of the production equipment he will need. He also decides to shoot the film on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] and [[Digital cinematography|HD Digital]] simultaneously, which is another costly and unnecessary measure. The production house employees introduce Tommy to Raphael Smadja and Sandy Schklair, who are hired as cinematographer and script supervisor, respectively. Actress [[Juliette Danielle]] is cast as Lisa.\n\nProduction starts relatively smoothly, but Tommy's controlling behavior and inexperience cause the situation to deteriorate. He forgets his lines, arrives late, and refuses to supply his crew with basic needs, such as drinking water and air conditioning. No one receives a full script, and the cast and crew are baffled by the film's nonsensical plot and Tommy's inexplicable directorial and acting choices. During preparation for a sex scene, which is being filmed shortly after Greg has told Tommy that he is moving in with Amber, Tommy refuses to film on a closed set, doesn't put on a robe between scenes, and humiliates Juliette by pointing out the acne on her shoulder to the entire crew. When confronted about this, Tommy responds by revealing that he regularly watches the extensive behind-the-scenes footage of the production, so he knows what the cast and crew members have been saying about him behind his back, and he accuses everyone, including Greg, of not supporting his vision.\n\nWhile ''The Room'' is still filming, Greg and Amber run into [[Bryan Cranston]], who is in the same Pilates class as Amber, at a cafe. He says he is directing an upcoming episode of the TV show he is on, ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', and invites Greg to play a lumberjack, mainly because Greg has a beard. Greg is scheduled to shave his beard soon for ''The Room'', so he begs Tommy to delay shooting those scenes, but Tommy refuses. Greg reluctantly chooses to finish the film and give up the opportunity to be on ''Malcolm''. On the last day of shooting, which is on location back in San Francisco, a frustrated Greg accuses Tommy of selfishness and duplicity throughout their friendship and questions his actual age and origins. The two fight, and Greg storms off.\n\nBy June 2003, Amber and Greg have split up, and Greg has started working in theatre. Tommy has finished work on ''The Room'' in the eight months since their falling out, and he invites Greg to the premiere. Greg initially is reluctant, but Tommy convinces him to come and, to his surprise, the entire cast and crew also attend. The capacity audience reacts with bemused silence and then, increasingly, with laughter to Tommy's poor performance, script, and film making techniques. A devastated Tommy storms out of the theater, but Greg brings him back and points out that the audience's enthusiastic response is something to be proud of while reconciling their friendship. With renewed optimism, Tommy takes the stage as ''The Room'' ends and expresses his appreciation of the warm reception for his \"comedic\" film. He invites Greg to join him, and the pair receive a standing ovation.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tommy meets Henry, a partygoer (played by the actual Tommy Wiseau) who asks Tommy if he wants to hang out. He refuses, though he does recognize Henry's familiar \"New Orleans\" accent.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n<!--Per film billing.-->\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Tommy Wiseau]], the writer, director, producer, and actor who portrays Johnny in ''The Room''\n* [[Dave Franco]] as [[Greg Sestero]], the line producer and actor who portrays Mark in ''The Room''\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Sandy Schklair, the [[script supervisor]] and ''de facto'' [[first assistant director]] of ''The Room''\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as [[Juliette Danielle]], the actress who portrays Lisa in ''The Room''\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Amber, Greg Sestero's girlfriend<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alison-brie-joining-james-francos-847852|title=Alison Brie Joining James Franco's 'The Disaster Artist'|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=December 10, 2015|access-date=December 12, 2015|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213164644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alison-brie-joining-james-francos-847852|archive-date=December 13, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Carolyn Minnott, the actress who portrays Claudette in ''The Room''\n* [[Paul Scheer]] as Raphael Smadja, the first [[Director of Photography|DP]] of ''The Room''\n* [[Zac Efron]] as [[Dan Janjigian]], the actor who portrays Chris-R in ''The Room''\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Philip Haldiman, the actor who portrays Denny in ''The Room''\n* [[June Diane Raphael]] as Robyn Paris, the actress who portrays Michelle in ''The Room''\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Mrs. Sestero, Greg Sestero's mother<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fearon|first1=Alana|title=Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally bring their Summer of 69: No Apostrphe tour to Dublin|url=http://www.dublinlive.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/nick-offerman-megan-mullally-bring-11440370|website=dublinlive.ie|publisher=MGN Limited|access-date=December 21, 2016|date=June 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918234703/http://www.dublinlive.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/nick-offerman-megan-mullally-bring-11440370|archive-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Peter Anway, the representative of Birns & Sawyer\n* [[Andrew Santino]] as Scott Holmes, the actor who portrays Mike in ''The Room''\n* [[Nathan Fielder]] as Kyle Vogt, the actor who portrays Peter in ''The Room''\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as [[Iris Burton]], Greg Sestero's agent\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as [[Shelton Studios|Jean Shelton]], the teacher of an acting class attended by Wiseau and Sestero<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.browzer.co.uk/shu/the-disaster-artist-a-night-with-greg-sestero_22774|work=Browzer|title=The Disaster Artist: A Night with Greg Sestero|last=Browzer|first=Sam|date=August 11, 2016|access-date=August 21, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821230550/https://www.browzer.co.uk/shu/the-disaster-artist-a-night-with-greg-sestero_22774|archive-date=August 21, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Bill Meurer, the owner of Birns & Sawyer, a film equipment and production space rental firm\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Wiseau's [[method acting]] teacher\n* [[James Dean]] as Jim Stark (archive footage)\n* [[Judd Apatow]] as a film producer accosted by Wiseau{{refn|name=Credits|group=N|Apatow's name appears in the title credits, but not in the ending credits.}}\n}}\n\n[[Kristen Bell]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Danny McBride]] and [[J.

Megan Mullally's portrayal of his mother does not have a distinct accent.\n* While the turmoil on set is depicted in the film, the real-life production had a much higher turnover rate, going through three different sets of crew (opposed to just the two members fired in the film).\n* At the time ''The Disaster Artist'' is set, Greg had never met Bryan Cranston in real life, and was not forced to choose between ''The Room'' and shooting an episode of ''Malcolm in the Middle''. He was reluctant to shave his beard due to wanting to dissociate himself from ''The Room''.\n* While the film depicts the premiere of ''The Room'' being met with laughter and applause, the real initial screening was received poorly and many audience members walked out in the first five minutes; it took time for its cult status to develop.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n*{{IMDb title}}\n*{{tcmdb title|2086127}}\n*{{AllMovie title|2086127}}\n*[http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/the-disaster-artist/ ''The Disaster Artist''] at ''[[History vs. Hollywood]]''\n*[http://dailyscript.com/scripts/The_Disaster_Artist_Script.pdf Official Screenplay]\n\n{{James Franco}}\n{{Golden Shell}}\n{{Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg}}\n{{The Room film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Disaster Artist, The}}\n[[Category:2017 films]]\n[[Category:2010s biographical films]]\n[[Category:American biographical films]]\n[[Category:A24 (company) films]]\n[[Category:2017 independent films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about film directors and producers]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films about films]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Franco]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Scott Neustadter and Michael H.
