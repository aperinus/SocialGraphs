Written by [[Lorene Scafaria]] and based on the [[Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Rachel Cohn]] and [[David Levithan]], the story tells of teenagers Nick (Cera) and Norah (Dennings), who meet when Norah asks Nick to pretend to be her boyfriend for five minutes. Over the course of the night, they try to find their favorite band's secret show and search for Norah's drunken best friend.\n\nThe film came into development in 2003 when producer [[Kerry Kohansky Roberts]] found Cohn and Levithan's novel and decided to [[Film adaptation|adapt it for film]]. Scafaria was hired to write the script in 2005, and Sollett signed on to direct the film in 2006. Principal photography took place over 29 days from October to December 2007, primarily in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nThe film premiered on September 6, 2008, at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically on October 3, 2008. It tripled its US$10{{nbsp}}million budget with a total gross of US$33.5{{nbsp}}million. An accompanying soundtrack was released on September 23, 2008, and the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on February 3, 2009. It attracted generally positive reviews from critics and received nominations for three [[Satellite Award]]s, one [[GLAAD Media Awards|GLAAD Media Award]], one [[MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] and one [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Golden Reel Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nNew Jersey teenager Nick O'Leary is a straight [[bass player]] in a [[queercore]] band that tentatively calls themselves The Jerk-Offs. Nick is heartbroken after his girlfriend Tris dumps him and continues to make \"breakup\" [[mix tape|mix CDs]] for her. Bandmates Thom and Dev convince Nick to perform at a club and search for a secret show that legendary [[Independent music|indie]] band Where's Fluffy? is performing in New York City that night.\n\nNorah Silverberg attends [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]], along with Tris and their mutual friend Caroline, and admires Nick's taste in music when retrieving Nick's CDs after Tris throws them out. The three girls end up at [[Arlene's Grocery]] on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]], where The Jerk-Offs are playing. Norah asks Nick to pretend to be her boyfriend after Tris teases her about her lack of a boyfriend. Norah kisses him, unaware that he is Tris' ex-boyfriend. Caroline gets drunk and Norah wants to take her home, but Nick's bandmates (who see Norah as a potential new girlfriend for him) offer to take Caroline home so Norah and Nick can spend time together and find the \"Where's Fluffy?\" show.\n\nWhen Thom and Dev stop at [[Gray's Papaya]] for hot dogs, a confused Caroline escapes from Thom's van, believing they plan to sexually assault her. Nick and Norah meet up with Thom and Dev to try to find her. A confusing phone call leads them to look for her at a club where Where's Fluffy? is rumored to be playing, but with no success in finding Caroline or the band. They finally locate Caroline when she gives them clues in another phone call. A jealous Tris catches up with the group, and Nick leaves them to talk to her.\n\nAn upset Norah meets up at a club with her on-again-off-again boyfriend Tal but soon realizes that he has an ulterior motive and hopes to get a record deal with Norah's father, a famous producer, and leaves him. Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she pleads for a ride home and flirts with him in the car. They stop, and while Tris seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind.\n\nNick calls Norah, apologizing for leaving, and she agrees to meet him again. They go to [[Electric Lady Studios]], a music studio owned by Norah's father. Norah gets Nick to play something he wrote in the studio then joins him in the recording room. They both kiss, and Nick gives Norah her first [[Orgasm|orgasm.]] Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her she learned the location of the Where's Fluffy? show. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend Lethario steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, cameos order and all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Michael Cera]] plays Nick, the \"straight bass player in a gay band\" teenager who is heartbroken after his girlfriend breaks up with him.
