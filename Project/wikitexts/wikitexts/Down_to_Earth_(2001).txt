The film stars Chris Rock as Lance Barton, a [[comedian]] who is killed before his time on Earth is through. He is given another chance to continue his life, but in the body of a rich middle-aged white man.\n\nThe film was released on 16 February 2001, and grossed $71 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nLance Barton is a struggling comedian who is quite funny and confident in his personality, but is unable to bring his talent across in front of an audience. After being [[booing|booed]] off stage one night, he hears about an opportunity from his manager, Whitney Daniels at the [[Apollo Theater]], which is having a farewell show due to its imminent closing. He is hoping to get a chance to prove himself in front of a real audience, when on his way home riding a bike, Lance is distracted by Sontee Jenkins. He is hit by a truck and is instantly killed.\n\nLance is brought up to [[Heaven]], where he meets the angels, King and Keyes, who reveal that Lance has been taken before his time, and  though his body had been destroyed by the truck, they can help Lance return to Earth. After sorting through many bodies, they find Charles Wellington III, an extremely rich businessman freshly drowned in his tub by his wife and assistant, Winston Sklar. Lance is reluctant until he discovers that Sontee, the woman he saw before his death, is [[protesting]] Charles by handcuffing herself to a coffee table in his penthouse, demanding Charles' presence. Seeing this as a chance to get to know her, Lance makes a deal with King to temporarily lend Charles' body until a more suitable body is found. Soon after, Charles returns from death, but with the witty soul of Lance inside him. Everyone except for the angels and him sees him as the middle-aged, rich, white Charles.\n\nAlthough Charles was unpopular in the past, the public and those closest to Charles start to notice a change in his personality. He transforms from a snobbish billionaire to a [[philanthropist]], including giving the maid Wanda a raise. Despite recent events, Lance continues to follow his comedy dreams through Charles, contacting his old manager Whitney and convincing him that he is Lance reincarnated. Through many humorous moments and issues, he gets Sontee to fall in love with him.\n\nAll too soon, Charles is murdered by a hired assassin. Fulfilling the deal Lance and King set up earlier, King and Keyes then send Lance to return yet again to Earth as Joe Guy, a great comedian and more acceptable candidate, who will die in a car accident. Joe returns from this accident unscathed, now with Lance's soul.\n\nAfter pulling off a successful performance at the Apollo and reconnecting with Whitney, King and Keyes inform Lance that after their current conversation, he will not remember them or his past lives, but his personality will remain. After they leave, he reconnects with Whitney again, and proceeds to get Sontee to fall in love with him again, after meeting her in the theater for the first time as Joe Guy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Lance Barton\n* [[Regina King]] as Sontee Jenkins\n* [[Mark Addy]] as Cisco\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Keyes\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Whitney Daniels\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Winston Sklar\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Mrs. Wellington\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as King\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Wanda\n* [[John Cho]] as Phil Quon\n* [[Mario Joyner]] as Apollo M.C.\n* [[Arnold Pinnock]] as Joe Guy\n* Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington III\n* [[Saul Medina]] as Background Extra\n* [[Telma Hopkins]] as Woman in Audience (uncredited)\n* [[Mustafa Shakir]] as Doorman (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a score of 20% based on reviews from 96 critics, with the consensus: \"A toned down Chris Rock fails to bring a limp script to life as the movie moves from one gag to the next.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1104813-down_to_earth/ |title=Down to Earth |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 34 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/down-to-earth |title=Down to Earth |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film grossed $64.2 million in the United States, plus $7 million outside the US, for a combined gross of $71.2 million.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Down to Earth (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released on 20 February 2001 by [[Sony Music Entertainment]].
