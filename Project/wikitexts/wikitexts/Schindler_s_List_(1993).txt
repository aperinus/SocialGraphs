It is based on the 1982 novel, ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', by Australian novelist [[Thomas Keneally]]. The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a German industrialist who saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' premiered on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States.

It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], and won seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. The film won numerous other awards, including seven [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]] and three [[Golden Globe Awards]]. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The film was designated as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] in 2004 and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] force local [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], a German member of the [[Nazi Party]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials, acquiring [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[Vitreous enamel|enamelware]]. Schindler hires [[Itzhak Stern]], a Jewish official with contacts among [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\".\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of the [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to P\u0142asz\u00f3w, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. G\u00f6th brutalizes his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th for permission to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town of [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th reluctantly agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of 850 people to be transferred to Br\u00fcnnlitz instead of Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Br\u00fcnnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them to \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers\". Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' awaken the next morning, a Soviet soldier announces that they have been liberated. The Jews then walk to a nearby town.\n\nAn epilogue reveals that G\u00f6th was [[Capital punishment|executed]] via [[hanging]], and Schindler had failed in both business and marriage following the war. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave), with Liam Neeson laying two roses.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* Albert Misak as Mordecai Wulkan\n* Michael Gordon as\tMr. Nussbaum\n* Aldona Grochal as\tMrs. Nussbaum\n* Uri Avrahami\tas Chaim Nowak\n* Michael Schneider as Juda Dresner\n* [[Miri Fabian]] as Chaja Dresner\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* Jacek W\u00f3jcicki as\tHenry Rosner\n* Beata Paluch as Manci Rosner\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* Bettina Kupfer as Regina Perlman\n* Grzegorz Kwas as [[Mietek Pemper]]\n* Kamil Krawiec as Olek Rosner\n* [[Henryk Bista]] as Mr. L\u00f6wenstein\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as\tRabbi Menasha Levartov\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Krzysztof Luft as\tHerman Toffel\n* Harry Nehring\tas Leo John\n* [[Wojciech Klata]] as Lisiek\n* [[Pawe\u0142 Del\u0105g]] as Dolek Horowitz\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann\tas [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder \n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* Adam Siemion as Adam Levy \n* [[Jochen Nickel]] as Wilhelm Kunde\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still|access-date=August 7, 2018|last=Hughes|first=Katie|publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308052156/https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nPoldek Pfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a [[Biographical film|biopic]] of Oskar Schindler with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1963, with [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]] writing, but the deal fell through.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=425}}{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=557}} In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=6}} [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] president [[Sidney Sheinberg|Sid Sheinberg]] sent director Steven Spielberg a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], but he refused Spielberg's offer. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as  \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also refused an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22&nbsp;million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed it would fail.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous instead of a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He also extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as somewhat na\u00efve. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to [[Holocaust survivors]] who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the [[Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles]] describe G\u00f6th's character in the film as a classic [[psychopath]].{{sfn|Leistedt|Linkowski|2014}} Fiennes looked so much like G\u00f6th in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.{{sfn|Corliss|1994}}\n\nThe character of [[Itzhak Stern]] (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager [[Abraham Bankier]], and G\u00f6th's personal secretary, [[Mietek Pemper]].{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=102}} The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=225}} [[Dustin Hoffman]] was offered the role but he refused it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/14/dustin-hoffman-interview-simon-hattenstone|title=Dustin Hoffman: Facing down my demons|date=December 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/video/dustin-hoffman-on-fear-of-success-why-he-turned-down-schindlers-list-609043011893|title=Dustin Hoffman on 'fear of success,' why he turned down 'Schindler's List'}}</ref>\n\nOverall, there are 126 speaking parts in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the ''Schindlerjuden'' and fly them in to film the scene.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 1, 1993, in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=48}} The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}}{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=14}} Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in [[Olkusz]], while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=109, 111}} The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the [[World Jewish Congress]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | work=The New York Times | agency=Reuters | title=Jews Try To Halt Auschwitz Filming | date=January 17, 1993 | access-date=April 12, 2020 | archive-date=April 12, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412212753/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | url-status=live }}</ref> To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=62}}\n\nThere were some [[antisemitic]] incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him: \"The Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted the Israeli actor Michael Schneider.{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}} Nonetheless, Spielberg said that, at [[Passover]], \"all the German actors showed up. They put on [[Kippah|yarmulkes]] and opened up [[Haggadah|Haggadas]], and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.\"{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\n{{Blockquote|quote=I was hit in the face with my personal life. My upbringing.

I cried all the time.|source=Spielberg on his emotional state during the shoot{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=414}}}}\n\nShooting ''Schindler's List'' was deeply emotional for Spielberg, as the subject matter forced him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead, he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during the shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used German and Polish language dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nSpielberg decided to use [[black and white]] to match the feel of documentary footage of the era. Cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared the effect to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\"{{sfn|Gangel|2005}} [[Itzhak Perlman]] performs the theme on the violin.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song ''[[Oyfn Pripetshik]]'' ({{lang-yi|\u05d0\u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05d9\u05e7}}, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.{{sfn|Rubin|2001|pp=73\u201374}} The [[clarinet]] solos heard in the film were recorded by [[Klezmer]] virtuoso [[Giora Feidman]].{{sfn|Medien|2011}} Williams won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for ''Schindler's List'', his fifth win.{{sfn|66th Academy Awards|1994}} Selections from the score were released on a [[Schindler's List (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].{{sfn|AllMusic listing}}\n\n== Themes and symbolism ==\nThe film explores the theme of [[good and evil]], using as its main protagonist a \"good German\", a popular characterization in American cinema.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} While G\u00f6th is characterized as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=428}} Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|p=43}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=436}}\n\n=== The girl in red ===\n[[File:Schindlers list red dress.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Schindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.]]\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. He said: \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry. So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of ''[[IGN]]'' notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance\".{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolizes \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust\".{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} [[Roma Ligocka]], who says she was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat, feels the character might have been based on her. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} Alternatively, according to her relatives who were interviewed in 2014, the girl may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins\".{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth through color. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally, the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film, it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[Slavery|slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust trains|Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\n''Schindler's List'' opened in theatres on December 15, 1993 in the United States and December 25 in Canada.

The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Sara Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the false impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\".

Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1994 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust?

Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse\". He said: \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand.

Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovaks|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''The Night Overtakes Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song \"Yerushalayim Shel Zahav{{-\"}} (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film, the song was replaced with \"Halikha LeKesariya{{-\"}} (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\nFor the 1997 American television showing, the film was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\n==Effect on Krak\u00f3w==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|Television|Australia|Poland|Military history of Germany |1990s|1980s}}\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of
