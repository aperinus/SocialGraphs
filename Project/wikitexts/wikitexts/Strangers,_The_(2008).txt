The plot follows Kristen ([[Liv Tyler]]) and James ([[Scott Speedman]]) whose stay at a vacation home is disrupted by three masked criminals who infiltrate the home. The screenplay was inspired by two real-life events: the multiple-homicide [[Manson family]] [[Tate murders]] and a series of [[Burglary|break-ins]] that occurred in Bertino's neighborhood as a child. Some journalists noted similarities between the film and the [[Keddie murders|Keddie cabin murders]] that occurred in [[Keddie, California]] in 1981, though Bertino did not cite this as a reference.\n\nMade on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural [[South Carolina]] in the fall of 2006. Originally slated for a theatrical release in November 2007, it was postponed before a theatrical release on May 30, 2008. The film became a [[sleeper hit]], grossing $82 million at the box office worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters.\n\nIn the years since its release, it has become a [[cult following|cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|url=https://www.etonline.com/why-the-strangers-is-still-terrifying-10-years-later-97777|title=Why 'The Strangers' Is Still Terrifying 10 Years Later|last=Iaboni|first=Randi|date=March 8, 2018|url-status=live|archive-date=February 23, 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210223025226/https://www.etonline.com/why-the-strangers-is-still-terrifying-10-years-later-97777|access-date=February 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-strangers-prey-at-night-an-homage-to-cheese-ball-horror-falls-victim-to-laziness/2018/03/06/d3eb8c94-1caa-11e8-ae5a-16e60e4605f3_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title='The Strangers: Prey at Night': An homage to cheese-ball horror falls victim to laziness|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=March 7, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210223025541/https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-strangers-prey-at-night-an-homage-to-cheese-ball-horror-falls-victim-to-laziness/2018/03/06/d3eb8c94-1caa-11e8-ae5a-16e60e4605f3_story.html|archive-date=February 23, 2021|access-date=February 23, 2021}}</ref> It successfully launched a [[The Strangers (film series)|film series]], including a [[sequel]] titled ''[[The Strangers: Prey at Night]]'' which was released on March 9, 2018.

Tension abounds between the couple, as Kristen rejected James' marriage proposal to her after the reception. James calls his friend Mike and asks him to pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4:00&nbsp;a.m., there is a loud knock at the door. A young blonde woman, whose face is obstructed by poor lighting, asks the couple \"Is Tamara here?\" but is turned away by James. James goes for a drive to purchase a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. While waiting for him to return, Kristen hears another knock on the door, but doesn't open it. Upon asking who it is, she learns it is the same girl from earlier, asking for Tamara; Kristen reminds her that she already came by and locks the door as the mysterious girl walks away. Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door and drops the alarm on the floor, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. Kristen returns to the kitchen, where, unbeknownst to her, an intruder watches her, lingering in the adjacent hallway.\n\nKristen notices the smoke alarm she left on the floor is now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone has been in the house. Upon going to retrieve her cell phone from the charger, she finds it is missing and begins to panic. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find the masked man staring at her. Screaming, she stumbles into the hallway and watches as the front door is forced ajar. When she goes to push the door closed, the blonde woman, now in a doll-like mask, peers inside. After locking the door, Kristen retreats to the bedroom, where she hears a loud crash, before James returns. After she explains what has happened, he goes outside to the car to obtain his phone, whereupon he finds the car ransacked and vandalized, and sees the masked blonde woman watching him from afar. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but another masked brunette woman rear-ends them in a pickup truck, forcing them to flee.\n\nBack inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun and wait for the thugs in a bedroom. Mike arrives and realizes something is wrong after seeing James' vandalized car. He enters the house, and James, mistaking him for one of the intruders, shoots him dead. Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in a barn on the property. He leaves and encounters the brunette woman, searching the backyard with a flashlight. When James tries to shoot her, the masked man ambushes him and knocks him unconscious, inadvertently discharging the rifle. Kristen hears the shot and runs to the barn. She finds the radio, but the brunette woman smashes it with an axe. Kristen rushes back to the house where she encounters the blonde woman, who taunts her with a knife. She tries to escape but is incapacitated by the masked man. At dawn, the couple awaken to find themselves tied to chairs in the living room with the intruders standing before them. Kristen attempts to reason with the strangers, before demanding an explanation, to which the blonde woman replies, \"Because you were home.\"\n\nThe offenders unmask themselves to Kristen and James before taking turns stabbing them in the chest and abdomen. Afterwards, the thugs drive away in their truck and come across two young boys on bicycles distributing [[Tract (literature)|religious tracts]]. The blonde woman steps out of the truck and asks if she can have one of their tract cards. One of the boys asks her, \"Are you a sinner?\" to which she responds, \"Sometimes.\" The boy gives her one, and the strangers drive away as the brunette woman states, \"It'll be easier next time.\" The two boys come upon the house, where they discover the bloodied bodies of Kristen, James, and Mike inside. One of the boys approaches Kristen's body and attempts to touch it. As he reaches out to her, Kristen, still alive, startles him by grabbing his hand and screaming.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Kristen McKey\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as James Hoyt\n* [[Gemma Ward]] as Dollface\n* Kip Weeks as Man in Mask\n* [[Laura Margolis]] as Pin-Up Girl\n* [[Glenn Howerton]] as Mike\n\n==Themes==\nFilm scholar Kevin Wetmore noted the film's portrayal of violence as a reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: \"Death is a random act in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] horror\u2014the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the clich\u00e9 goes.

One might call the narrative sensibility informing ''The Strangers'' 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by [[Louis Wirth]].\"{{Sfn|Simpson|2013|pages=192\u2013193}}\n\nIn his book ''Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film'' (2014), scholar Tony Williams notes the film's setting within a 1970s-era home as representative of an \"American tradition of violence that is random and without any coherent explanation.\" Additionally, Williams reads the three masked assailants as metaphors for the \"repressed and unresolved tensions affecting the couple inside the house.\"{{Sfn|Williams|2014|p=294}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay and inspiration===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=cornsilk|quote=I was thinking about the [[Tate murders]] and realizing that these detailed descriptions had painted a story of what it was like in the house with the victims.
