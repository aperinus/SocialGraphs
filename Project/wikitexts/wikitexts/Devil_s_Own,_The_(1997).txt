It was the final film directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]], who died the next year, and the final film photographed by [[Gordon Willis]], who retired soon after. The film was written by [[Vincent Patrick]], David Aaron Cohen, and [[Kevin Jarre]]. The plot revolves around a member of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (Pitt) who comes to the United States to obtain [[contraband|black market]] anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down British helicopters in [[Northern Ireland]]. The plan is complicated by an [[Irish-American]] policeman (Ford), whom the IRA member has come to regard as family.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-devils-own-1997| author=Roger Ebert| title=The Devil's Own| publisher=RogerEbert.com| date=March 28, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2022}}\nDuring the year 1972, eight-year-old Frankie McGuire witnesses a masked man shoot his father dead for [[Irish republican]] sympathies. Twenty years later in [[Belfast]], Frankie and three other [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] members engage in a shootout with the [[British Army]] and undercover agents from the [[Special Reconnaissance Unit]]. One gunman is killed and another, Desmond, is mortally wounded; Frankie and his close friend Sean Phelan flee. Frankie's commander Martin MacDuff, seeing a British Army helicopter circling above, decides that the IRA needs [[Stinger missiles]] to fight back.\n\nFrankie soon travels to [[New York City]] with an alias of \"Rory Devaney\" to buy these missiles. American [[Judge]] Peter Fitzsimmons, a longtime supporter of the IRA, provides him with a temporary job as a construction worker and arranges for him to stay with [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Sergeant Tom O'Meara, his wife Sheila, and their three daughters on [[Staten Island]]. Thinking that \"Rory\" is an Irish immigrant who needs a place to live while he finds work, the O'Meara family warmly welcome Frankie into their household and he soon becomes a trusted member of the family.\n\nMeanwhile, Sean also arrives in New York City and meets up with Frankie. Before long, Sean acquires an old fishing boat for him and Frankie to smuggle the missiles. Frankie meets with [[black market]] arms dealer and [[Irish Mob|Irish mobster]] Billy Burke, and they cut a deal to exchange the missiles for payment in six to eight weeks. Judge Fitzsimmons obtains the money from his usual connections and has Megan Doherty, another IRA operative posing as his family's nanny, deliver it to Frankie. Megan later calls Frankie to warn him that MacDuff was killed by British authorities and that they must postpone the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom's partner, Eddie Diaz, fatally shoots an unarmed thief in the back as he runs away. Torn between his duty to protect his partner and his moral obligation to tell the truth, Tom decides to retire from the force. After a meal where Tom tells Sheila about his decision, the two of them drive home only to be confronted by masked intruders. As Tom fights the intruders, Sheila rushes to call 911. Just then, Frankie arrives and tries to help Tom, but the intruders have guns and force Frankie and Tom to stop resisting. As police sirens approach, the intruders decide to leave the men and make their escape.\n\nFrankie leaves and proceeds to a bar that Burke owns. He confronts Burke for ordering the attack and shoots one of his men in the knee. Burke is uncowed and demands that Frankie pay him for the missiles, revealing that he has Sean as a hostage. Realizing he has no choice, Frankie returns to the O'Meara house, where he hid the money that he got from Megan.\n\nWhile Frankie is away meeting with Burke, Tom has gone down to the basement where Frankie had been staying. Seeing that the couch pillows had been sliced, Tom realizes that the masked intruders must have been looking for something related to Frankie. As he walks around the basement, he accidentally discovers an empty space under the bathroom floorboards. When he checks it, he discovers a duffel bag containing wads of cash.\n\nWhen Frankie returns, he is confronted by Tom with the money. Frankie decides to reveal his true identity and ask Tom to give him the money and let him leave. Tom refuses and, when Eddie arrives, the two of them arrest Frankie. En route to the police station, they get stuck in a traffic jam. While Eddie goes to talk to a driver of a stalled vehicle, Frankie slips his cuffed arms over his legs, grabs Tom's gun, and jumps out of the car. Eddie tries to shoot him and Frankie is forced to shoot Eddie in self-defense. This altercation gives Tom enough time to clamber out of the car and break off the key in the trunk lock, preventing Frankie from getting the duffel bag of money. Frankie runs off.\n\nAfter Eddie's death, Tom meets with the [[FBI]] and their British counterparts, who ask him questions about Frankie. Tom realizes that the government agents intend to not just find and arrest Frankie, but to kill him.\n\nFrankie arrives at the warehouse where Burke said they would do the exchange. Burke and his henchmen are waiting for Frankie, who walks nonchalantly, his duffel bag swung over his shoulder. One of the henchmen pats Frankie down and confirms that he is unarmed. Frankie asks Burke if he has the weapons and Burke shows him a bunch of boxes containing missiles. Then Burke has another henchmen pull something out of the trunk and toss it at Frankie's feet. With horror, Frankie realizes that it is Sean's severed head. With guns pointed at him, Frankie releases the duffel bag, which Burke assumes contains the money. Instead, it contains a bomb rigged to the zipper. When the bomb goes off, Frankie uses the confusion to grab one of the henchmen's guns and use his military skills to kill Burke and his henchmen. He then jumps in the van containing the missiles and drives off.\n\nAt the Fitzsimmons' residence, Frankie has Megan alert his comrades in Ireland that he will be leaving right away to deliver the missiles. While Frankie is upstairs with Megan, Tom crashes the Fitzsimmons' cocktail party and confronts the judge. He then recognizes Megan from a photo in Frankie's bag. Tom runs after Megan upstairs just in time to see Frankie escaping onto the roof. Tom persuades Megan to reveal where Frankie is going by convincing her that the authorities are trying to kill Frankie and he is the only one who can save Frankie's life.\n\nPulling up to the boat dock out of Frankie's line of sight, Tom sneaks up as Frankie gets the boat ready to sail. Jumping onto the boat as it leaves the dock, Tom has a final standoff with Frankie. The two men shoot at each other through the glass of the bridge. Tom falls down, wounded, and looks up as Frankie steps out onto the deck. Frankie points his gun at Tom but then his hand begins to shake. Realizing that he too has been shot, Frankie drops the gun and collapses onto the deck. Tom pulls himself close to Frankie and they embrace each other, recognizing that both were fighting for causes they believe in. Frankie dies, and Tom, though badly wounded, steers the boat back to shore.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Sergeant Tom O'Meara\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Francis \"Frankie\" McGuire / Rory Devaney\n** Shane Dunne as Young Frankie\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Sheila O'Meara\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as Edwin Diaz\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Billy Burke\n* [[George Hearn]] as [[Judge]] Peter Fitzsimmons\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Deputy Chief Jim Kelly\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Megan Doherty\n* [[Paul Ronan]] as Sean Phelan\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Martin MacDuff\n* [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Harry Sloan\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Bridget O'Meara\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's origins date back to the 1980s, it began as a pitch by producers [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] and [[Robert F.

In the ensuing years interest in the project was renewed thanks to Pitt's performances in ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'', ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'', and ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', but the studio was of the opinion that Pitt could not carry a major film alone. Pitt visited Belfast in preparation for the role and suffered bruises after he was attacked on the city's [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] after being mistaken for a protestant.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Joe |date=4 July 2008|title=You can't beat Belfast... even if Belfast beat me! |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/you-cant-beat-belfast-even-if-belfast-beat-me-28193435.html |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |location= |access-date=24 August 2022}}</ref>\n\nFor the role of Tom O'Meara, both [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Sean Connery]] had been considered at various points, but at Pitt's suggestion, [[Harrison Ford]] was approached for the role, which at that time was more of a [[character actor|character role]]. Ford agreed, though that meant the script had to be rewritten to create a fuller role for Ford and a more complicated relationship between the characters played by the two men. To expand Ford's role, producers brought in David Aaron Cohen and [[Vincent Patrick]] to rewrite Jarre's script, as Patrick stated \"There was no way they were going to shoot the original script. It had to become a two-hero piece with equal action heroes. Supporting two stars is what this was about\"<ref name=\"nytfisher\" /> It was Ford's suggestion to bring Pakula in as director. [[Principal photography]] started in February 1996, with the script \"still in flux\"; according to ''The New York Times'', \"ego clashes, budget overruns and long delays plagued the project.\"<ref name=\"nytfisher\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/04/11/dealing-devils-own/|title=Dealing with 'The Devil's Own'|date=1997-04-11|newspaper=EW.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref><ref name=\"eppc.org\"/><ref name=\"Pfeiffer\"/> Pitt \"threatened to quit early in the shoot, complaining that the script was incomplete and incoherent\" and later \"denounced the movie as 'the most irresponsible bit of film making \u2013 if you can even call it that \u2013 that I've ever seen.'\"<ref name=\"nytfisher\" /> The producers hired screenwriter [[Terry George]] to help further develop Pitt's character. In March 1996, Pakula hired screenwriter [[Robert Mark Kamen]] to provide rewrites during production, Kamen noted the difficulties on set as he recalled \"They were running out of script to shoot. They had a script that wasn't acceptable to either actor, Alan [Pakula] didn't start with a script that everyone had signed off on, we were flying blind....It was scary\". Kamen met with both Ford and Pitt to discuss their ideas about improving the script, contrary to the rumors, Kamen insisted that both actors were agreeable to each other, \"It wasn't the tension between them that made things tense. It was the tension each had with their own parts.\"\n\nAccording to Pakula, one problem was that the film's plot did not fall along conventionally simple Hollywood lines, as Ford and Pitt were both playing \"good guys\" according to each of their own distinct moral codes. ''The New York Times'' characterized Ford's character as \"the upright American cop who deplores violence\" and Pitt's as \"an I.R.A. gunman for whom violence is a reasonable solution to his people's 300 years of troubles.\"<ref name=\"nytfisher\" /> Pakula compared his intent with the two characters to that depicted in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', a 1948 western in which [[John Wayne]]'s character is defied by his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, played by [[Montgomery Clift]].<ref name=\"nytfisher\" />\n\n''The Devil's Own'' was filmed on location and at the [[Chelsea Piers]] studios in [[New York City]], as well as in Newark, Hoboken, Jersey City, Bayonne, Sandy Hook and [[Montclair, New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themaldiveshotels.com/njfilmorg/|title=New Jersey Motion Picture & Television Commission|website=Themaldiveshotels.com|access-date=31 October 2021}}</ref>  and [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport, New York]] on Long Island. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The opening scenes were filmed at [[Clogherhead|Port Oriel, Clogherhead]], County Louth, Republic of Ireland.

Two months before it opened, the film was still unfinished:  Pakula was unhappy with the final scene (\"a showdown on a boat with a cargo of [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]]\"), so in early February the scene was \"rewritten and reshot over two days in a studio in California.\"<ref name=\"nytfisher\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Devil's Own'' received mixed reviews from critics.

Certain plot elements (including many of the details surrounding the missile deal) border on preposterous, but that often goes with the territory in films of this genre. The best parts of ''The Devil's Own'' are the quiet moments, such as when Frankie and Tom are talking, or when Tom is spending time with his family. There's also an effective subplot that forces Tom to examine his moral outlook on life when his partner (Ruben Blades) accidentally shoots a fleeing suspect in the back. Unfortunately, ''The Devil's Own'' goes downhill fast in the final half-hour. Suddenly, it's as if every significant character in the film has undergone a frontal lobotomy. Otherwise-intelligent men start doing extremely stupid things, and the entire \"dumbing-down\" process becomes frustrating to observe.
