Set in a small Sicilian town, the film centers on the friendship between a young boy and an aging projectionist who works at the titular movie theatre. This Italian-French [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] stars [[Philippe Noiret]], [[Jacques Perrin]], [[Leopoldo Trieste]], [[Marco Leonardi]], [[Agnese Nano]] and [[Salvatore Cascio]]. The film score was composed by [[Ennio Morricone]] and his son, [[Andrea Morricone|Andrea]], marking the beginning of a collaboration between Tornatore and Morricone that lasted until Morricone's death in 2020.\n\nCredited with revitalizing Italy's film industry, ''Cinema Paradiso'' has been cited by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine as one of the greatest films of all time.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a commercial success, and won several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]<ref name=\"Oscars1990\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1990|title=The 62nd Academy Awards (1990) Nominees and Winners|accessdate=3 July 2021|work=oscars.org}}</ref> and the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. It was nominated for 11 [[BAFTA Award]]s and won five; including [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]] for Philippe Noiret, [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actor]] for Salvatore Cascio, [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[Rome]], Salvatore Di Vita, a famous [[film director]], returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, [[Sicily]] in thirty years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo was, Salvatore is not able to fall asleep and flashes back to his childhood.\n\nA few years after [[World War II]], eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the local [[movie house]], named Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing because there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing scenes with romantic kisses or embraces. The local priest, owner of the cinema, had ordered these sections to be censored, and the deleted scenes are cut from the film reels by Alfredo and piled on the projection room floor, where Alfredo keeps them until he can splice them back in for the film to be sent to the next town.\n\nAlfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector. One day, Cinema Paradiso catches fire as Alfredo is projecting ''[[The Firemen of Viggi\u00f9]]'' after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before a reel of [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] explodes in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The movie house is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio Spaccafico, who invests a big football lottery winning. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines.\n\nAbout a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the \"Nuovo Cinema Paradiso\". His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help \u2013 advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with filming, using a home movie camera; doing this he has met, and captured on film, a girl named Elena Mendola, daughter of a wealthy banker, and has fallen in love with her. Salvatore woos \u2013 and wins \u2013 Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval.\n\nAs Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for [[conscription|compulsory military service]] (even if, as a war orphan, he should be exempted from it). His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves town to pursue his future as a filmmaker.\n\nOnce back in present time, Salvatore realizes that he is very satisfied with his life from a professional point of view but not from a personal one, so decides to return home to attend Alfredo's funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo's widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore's successes with pride and he left him something: an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist.\n\nSalvatore comes back to Rome, watches Alfredo's reel and discovers it comprises all the romantic scenes that the priest had ordered Alfredo to cut from the movies; Alfredo had spliced the sequences together to form a single unreduced film of aching desire and lustful frenzy. In the final scenes, Salvatore makes peace with his past with tears in his eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Philippe Noiret]] as Alfredo\n*[[Salvatore Cascio]] as child Salvatore Di Vita \n**[[Marco Leonardi]] as teenage Salvatore\n**[[Jacques Perrin]] as adult Salvatore\n*[[Agnese Nano]] as Elena Mendola \n**[[Brigitte Fossey]] as adult Elena (e''xtended cut only'')\n*[[Antonella Attili]] as Maria Di Vita\n**[[Pupella Maggio]] as old Maria\n*[[Enzo Cannavale]] as Spaccafico\n*[[Isa Danieli]] as Anna\n*[[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Father Adelfio\n*Roberta Lena as Lia\n*[[Nino Terzo]] as Peppino's father\n*[[Leo Gullotta]] as the Usher\n*[[Tano Cimarosa]] as the Blacksmith\n*[[Nicola Di Pinto]] as the Village Idiot\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Cinema Paradiso'' was shot in director Tornatore's hometown [[Bagheria]], Sicily, as well as [[Cefal\u00f9]] on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Darwin|author2=Danforth Prince|title=Frommer's Sicily |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZDLw0nOnfsC&q=%22Cinema+Paradiso%22&pg=PA132|year=2009|publisher=Frommer's|isbn=978-0-470-39899-9|page=132}}</ref> The town square in the film is Piazza Umberto I in the village of Palazzo Adriano, about 30 miles to the south of Palermo. The \u2018Paradiso\u2019 cinema was built here, at Via Nino Bixio, overlooking the octagonal Baroque fountain, which dates from 1608.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/c/Cinema-Paradiso.html#.U2qkafldUto|title=Cinema Paradiso film locations (1988)|work=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations|accessdate=7 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508031042/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/c/Cinema-Paradiso.html#.U2qkafldUto|archivedate=8 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTold largely in [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] of a successful film director Salvatore to his childhood years, it also tells the story of the return to his native [[Sicily|Sicilian]] village for the funeral of his old friend Alfredo, the projectionist at the local \"Cinema Paradiso\". Ultimately, Alfredo serves as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process.\n\nSeen as an example of \"nostalgic postmodernism\",<ref>[[#Ma|Marcus, p. 99]]</ref> the film intertwines [[sentimentality]] with [[comedy]], and nostalgia with [[pragmaticism]]. It explores issues of [[youth]], [[coming of age]], and reflections (in [[adulthood]]) about the past. The imagery in the scenes can be said to reflect Salvatore's idealised memories of his [[childhood]]. ''Cinema Paradiso'' is also a celebration of films; as a projectionist, young Salvatore (a.k.a. Tot\u00f2) develops a passion for films that shapes his life path in adulthood.\n\n== Releases ==\nThe film exists in multiple versions. It was originally released in Italy at 155 minutes, but poor [[box office]] performance in its native country led to its being shortened to 124 minutes for international release; it was an instant success.<ref>[[#Bo|Bondanella, p. 454]]</ref> This international version won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Special Jury Prize]] at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/236/year/1989.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Cinema Paradiso |access-date=2009-08-01|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and the 1989 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. In 2002, the [[director's cut]] 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as '''''Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'''''), although this was the original version and was the film's premiere at the Europa Cinema Festival, 29 September 1988, in Bari.\n\n===Director's cut===\nIn the 173-minute version of the film, after the funeral, Salvatore notices an adolescent girl who resembles the teenage Elena. He follows the teen as she rides her scooter to her home, which allows Salvatore to contact his long-lost love Elena, who is revealed to be the girl's mother. Salvatore calls her in hopes of rekindling their romance; she initially rejects him, but later reconsiders and goes to see Salvatore, who was contemplating his rejection at a favorite location from their early years. Their meeting ultimately leads to a lovemaking session in her car. He learns that she had married an acquaintance from his school years, who became a local politician of modest means. Afterwards, feeling cheated, he strives to rekindle their romance, and while she clearly wishes it were possible, she rejects his entreaties, choosing to remain with her family and leave their romance in the past.\n\nDuring their evening together, a frustrated Salvatore asks Elena why she never contacted him or left word of where her family was moving to. He learns that the reason they lost touch was because Alfredo asked her not to see him again, fearing that Salvatore's romantic fulfillment would only destroy what Alfredo sees as Salvatore's destiny \u2013 to be successful in the cinema world. Alfredo tried to convince her that if she loved Salvatore, she should leave him for his own good. Elena explains to Salvatore that, against Alfredo's instruction, she had secretly left a note with an address where she could be reached and a promise of undying love and loyalty. Salvatore realizes that he never found that note, and thus lost his true love for more than thirty years. The next morning, Salvatore returns to the decaying Cinema Paradiso and frantically searches through the piles of old film invoices pinned to the wall of the projection booth. There, on the reverse side of one of the dockets, he finds the handwritten note Elena had left thirty years earlier.\n\nThe film ends with Salvatore returning to Rome and, with teary eyes, viewing the film reel that Alfredo left.\n\n==Home media==\nA special edition of ''Cinema Paradiso'' was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in September 2006.
