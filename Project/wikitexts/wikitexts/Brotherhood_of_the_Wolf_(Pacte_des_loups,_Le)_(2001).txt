The story takes place in 18th-century France, where the Chevalier de Fronsac and Mani of the [[Iroquois]] tribe are sent to investigate the mysterious slaughter of hundreds by an unknown creature in the province of [[G\u00e9vaudan]].\n\nThe plot is loosely based on a real-life series of killings that took place in [[France]] in the 18th century and the famous legend of the [[beast of G\u00e9vaudan]]; parts of the film were shot at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Roquetaillade]]. The film has several extended [[swashbuckling]] fight scenes, with martial arts performances by the cast mixed in, making it unusual for a historical drama. The special effects for the creature are a combination of [[computer generated imagery]], as well as puppetry and animatronics designed by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].\n\nThe film received generally positive critical reviews, highlighting its high production values, cinematography, performances and Gans' atmospheric direction. At a $29 million budget, it was a commercial success, grossing over $70 million in worldwide theatrical release.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> The film also became the sixth-highest-grossing [[French language|French-language]] film of all time in the United States,<ref name=\"Genre Keyword, Foreign Language\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genre/sg4208980225/?ref_=bo_gs_table_195|title=Genre Keyword, Foreign Language|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=18 April 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"D'Alessandro 16\">{{cite magazine |last=D'Alessandro  |first=Anthony |title=ALL-TIME FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILMS IN NORTH AMERICA |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|location=|date=February 21, 2000 |page=16}}</ref> and it also became one of the biggest international successes for French-language films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Masters  |first=Charles |title=French Dip |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |volume=|issue=|date=January 20, 2004 |pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe film's 4K restored version premiered in the Official Selection of [[2022 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Marquis d'Apcher writes his memoirs in his castle. He recounts to 1764, when a [[Beast of G\u00e9vaudan|mysterious beast]] terrorized the province of [[G\u00e9vaudan]]. Gr\u00e9goire de Fronsac, a knight and the royal naturalist of King [[Louis XV of France]], and his [[Iroquois]] companion Mani, arrive to capture the beast. Fronsac becomes interested in Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveller, whose arm was mangled and rendered useless while overseas. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an [[Italians|Italian]] courtesan at the local [[brothel]].\n\nWhile investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel. A traumatized child witness swears that the beast is controlled by what seems to be a human master. As the investigation proves unfruitful, the king's weapons master, [[Fran\u00e7ois Antoine|Lord de Beauterne]], arrives to put an end to the beast, and Fronsac is sent back in Paris. He realizes that the beast is actually an instrument of a secret society: The Brotherhood of the Wolf, which is working to undermine public confidence in the king and ultimately take over the country. Back in G\u00e9vaudan, the attacks by the real beast continue, and Fronsac returns to put an end to the beast's killings. At a secret rendezvous with Marianne, they are attacked by the beast, where it mysteriously refrains from attacking her.\n\nFronsac, Mani, and a young Marquis set out into the forest and set up an array of traps to capture the beast; it is severely injured but escapes. Mani sets off alone in pursuit, where he finds a [[catacomb]] used as the beast's holding pen, inhabited by the Brotherhood. Outnumbered, Mani is shot and killed. Fronsac discovers Mani's body and performs an [[autopsy]], finding a [[silver bullet]]\u2014Jean-Fran\u00e7ois' signature choice of ammunition. In a fit of rage, a vengeful Fronsac goes to the catacombs and slaughters many members, but is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned.\n\nSylvia visits him in jail and reveals that she is a spy for the [[Holy See]]. She explains that Henri Sardis, the local priest and leader of the Brotherhood, believes that he is restoring worship of God to France. [[Pope Clement XIII]] has decided that Sardis is insane, and has sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, saying that he knows too much. Meanwhile, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois comes to Marianne's room and reveals to her that he is the beast's master; it recognized his scent on her when it came near her, which is why it did not attack. He then [[rapes]] her when she rejects his advances.\n\nSylvia's agents [[Exhumation|exhume]] Fronsac, who had not been killed but merely put into a temporary [[coma]], and he appears at one of the Brotherhood's sermons. He kills several members, including Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, who reveals that he had regained use of his supposedly mangled arm. Sardis escapes into the mountains, but is mauled to death by a pack of wolves. Fronsac and Marquis go to the beast's lair, where it lies severely wounded. It turns out that the beast was a lion that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois brought back from Africa as a cub that was tortured into becoming vicious and trained to wear spiked metal armor. Fronsac takes pity and kills the beast in an act of mercy.\n\nMarquis finishes writing his account just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary [[Angry mob|mob]]. He states that he doesn't know what happened to Fronsac and Marianne after the death of the beast; but he hopes that somewhere, they are happy together. A final scene shows Fronsac and Marianne sailing on a ship named Fr\u00e8re Loup\u2014Brother Wolf.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Knight Gr\u00e9goire de Fronsac\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Morangias\n*[[\u00c9milie Dequenne]] as Marianne de Morangias\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as Sylvia\n*[[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier]] as Marquis Thomas d'Apcher\n**[[Jacques Perrin]] as older Thomas d'Apcher / Narrator\n*[[Mark Dacascos]] as Mani\n*[[Jean Yanne]] as Count de Morangias\n*[[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois St\u00e9venin]] as Father Henri Sardis\n*[[\u00c9dith Scob]] as Countess Genevi\u00e8ve de Morangias\n*[[Johan Leysen]] as [[Antoine de Beauterne]]\n*[[Bernard Farcy]] as Intendant Pi\u00e8rre-Jean Laffont\n*[[Hans Meyer (actor)|Hans Meyer]] as Marquis d'Apcher\n*[[Philippe Nahon]] as [[Jean Chastel]]\n*[[Gaspard Ulliel]] as Louis\n*[[Nicolas Vaude]] as Maxime des For\u00eats\n*Virginie Darmon as La Bavarde\n*Eric Prat as Captain Duhamel\n*Jean-Loup Wolff as Duke Gontrand de Moncan\n*[[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Beast vocal effects\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Brotherhood of the Wolf'' garnered mostly positive reviews, with a 72% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 119 reviews with the consensus stating: \"''Brotherhood of the Wolf'' mixes its genres with little logic, but the end result is wildly entertaining.\"<ref>{{cite web |title = The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2002) |url = https://rottentomatoes.com/m/brotherhood_of_the_wolf/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date = 19 April 2016 }}</ref> whereas on [[Metacritic]] it accumulated a score of 57 from mixed reviews.
