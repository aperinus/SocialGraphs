Directed by [[Fritz Kiersch]], the film's cast consists of [[Peter Horton]], [[Linda Hamilton]], [[John Franklin (actor)|John Franklin]], [[Courtney Gains]], Robby Kiger, [[Anne Marie McEvoy]], [[Julie Maddalena]], and [[R. G. Armstrong]]. Set in the fictitious rural town of Gatlin, [[Nebraska]], the film tells the story of a malevolent entity referred to as \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\" which entices the town's children to ritually murder all the town's adults, and a couple driving across the country, to ensure a successful [[corn]] harvest.\n\nKing wrote the original draft of the screenplay, which focused more on the characters of Burt and Vicky and depicted more history on the uprising of the children in Gatlin. This script was disregarded in favor of George Goldsmith's screenplay, which featured more violence and a more conventional narrative structure. Filming took place mainly in [[Iowa]], but also in [[California]]. It spawned a [[Children of the Corn (film series)|franchise]] of films, and it has gained a [[cult following]], inspiring [[Children of the Corn (group)|the rap group with the same name]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, an agricultural community surrounded by huge cornfields. When the corn crop fails one year, the townsfolk turn to prayer to ensure a successful harvest. However, 11-year-old Isaac Chroner takes all of the children in Gatlin into the cornfields and indoctrinates them into a religious cult based around a bloodthirsty deity called \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\". Isaac and his subordinate Malachai lead the children in a revolution, murdering all of the adults in town as human sacrifices. Children Job and his sister Sarah are uninvolved in the sacrifices, having not attended the meetings in the cornfield with the other children. Sarah has visions portrayed through drawings.\n\nThree years later, Vicky and her boyfriend Burt travel through rural Nebraska on their way to Seattle, where Burt will start working as a physician. Elsewhere, a young boy named Joseph tries to flee Gatlin, but is attacked in the corn; he stumbles out into the road and Burt accidentally runs over him. However, Burt discovers that his throat was cut beforehand. Burt and Vicky place Joseph's body and his suitcase in their trunk and search for a phone to call for help. They find Diehl, an elderly mechanic and the last adult in Gatlin, but he refuses them service, as he has agreed to supply the children with fuel in exchange for his life. However, Malachai breaks the pact and murders him against Isaac's wishes after Diehl tries to steer the couple away from Gatlin.\n\nVicky and Burt explore the abandoned town and find Sarah alone in a house. While Vicky stays with her, Burt searches the town. Malachai and his followers appear, capture Vicky, and take her to the cornfield, where they place her on a cross to be sacrificed. Burt enters the church, where a congregation of children led by a girl named Rachel are performing a cultural birthday ritual for Amos by drinking his blood from a [[pentagram]]-shaped cut on his body. Amos has turned 19, so is considered old enough for his \"passing\"\u2014joining their god in the cornfield. Burt scolds the children for participating in a blood ritual. Rachel stabs Burt, then Malachai and the others chase him. Job rescues Burt and they hide in a fallout shelter with Sarah, where they learn Vicky was captured.\n\nThe zealous Isaac scolds Malachai for his treachery in killing Diehl, their only source of fuel. Malachai takes over, tired of Isaac's preaching, and orders Isaac to be sacrificed instead of Vicky. Isaac warns Malachai that sacrificing him will break their pact with He Who Walks Behind the Rows and the children will be severely punished. That night, Burt sneaks into the cornfield to rescue Vicky. During Isaac's sacrifice, a supernatural light appears and devours him. Burt emerges and overpowers Malachai, then convinces the children to abandon the cult and run for safety. Isaac suddenly reappears, revived by He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Informing Malachai that the deity is angered over him being sacrificed and that He Who Walks Behind the Rows wants Malachai sacrificed as well for his betrayal, Isaac kills Malachai.\n\nA storm appears over the cornfield, and Burt and Vicky shelter the children in a barn. Burt reads a passage in the Bible Job gives him. Job also reveals that the police officer tried to set up the [[gasohol]] to stop He Who Walks Behind The Rows, but Malachai murdered him before he could finish. Vicky rereads the passage and realizes that the cornfield must be destroyed by fire in order to stop the false god. Burt sprays the cornfield with gasohol and tosses a [[Molotov cocktail]] into the field, setting it alight and destroying the demon along with Isaac. Vicky, Burt, Job, and Sarah return to the car to leave Gatlin, but find it disabled. Rachel attacks Burt, but Vicky knocks her out with the car door. Burt worries about leaving her there, but Vicky quips that they will send her a get-well card from Seattle, and they depart with the children.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Adults ===\n* [[Peter Horton]] as Burt Stanton\n* [[Linda Hamilton]] as Vicky Baxter\n* [[R.

Hal Roach executives did not want to use King's script and George Goldsmith was hired to rewrite it. Goldsmith said that King's script started with 35 pages of Burt and Vicky arguing in a car, so he decided to tell the story visually through the eyes of two new characters, children Job and Sarah. King was unhappy with the changes but Hal Roach went with Goldsmith. King and Goldsmith debated Goldsmith's approach during a phone conversation during which King argued that Goldsmith did not understand the horror genre and Goldsmith countered that King did not recognize that film is a visual, \"external\" experience unlike novels and short stories, which are \"internal\" and only visual in the reader's mind.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Hornick, Iowa]], [[Whiting, Iowa]], [[Salix, Iowa]], and [[Sergeant Bluff, Iowa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57053-STEPHEN-KINGSCHILDRENOFTHECORN?sid=9a0419d6-e0b2-488f-9608-1a8ea5fe0b86&sr=13.837068&cp=1&pos=0|access-date=2021-07-25|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGoldsmith credited King with being extremely gracious when asked about the film in media interviews, stating in diplomatic ways he felt the new approach to be lacking. Hal Roach eventually sold the project to New World Pictures, which decided to go with Goldsmith's script, although it tried unsuccessfully to remove his name from the credits in favor of King's. After release of the highly successful film, Goldsmith revealed that much of the story was a metaphor for the [[Iranian Revolution]], with the takeover of the town by quasi-religious zealots acting for an evil \"God\" based on the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] and his revolutionary guard taking over Iran. Burt and Vicky became analogous to the [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] and Goldsmith was using a horror film to expose the dangers and evils of religious fundamentalism, something few critics recognized.<ref name=\"film\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXrpDAAAQBAJ&q=blood%20frenzy%201987&pg=PA3|title=It Came from the 80s!: Interviews with 124 Cult Filmmakers|first=Francesco|last=Borseti|year=2016|publisher=McFarland|pages=20\u201339|isbn=9781476666044}} reference refers to Blood Frenzy</ref>\n\nDuring an interview on [[The Ghost of Hollywood]], [[Fritz Kiersch]] explained how [[Courtney Gains]] won the role of [[Children of the Corn|Malachai]] by using a prop knife to hold a casting assistant hostage at the audition. Gains claims that one of the great honors of his career is having hundreds of people, even his son's friends, recognize him as Malachai and confess they found him terrifying, some having admitted his performance gave them nightmares. Apparently, even his own parents were greatly unnerved by him in this film.<ref name=\":1\">{{citation|title=Children of the Corn (1984) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087050/trivia/ |access-date=2021-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Season One|url=https://theghostofhollywood.com/season-one-1|access-date=2021-11-18|website=The Ghost of Hollywood|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|date=2021-06-01|title=Season Finale: Episode Twelve|url=https://kboo.fm/media/103055-season-finale-episode-twelve|access-date=2021-11-18|website=KBOO}}</ref>\n\nBecause of seasonal changes, cornstalks had to be propped up and painted green to appear living.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nSome of the local townspeople also performed as minor roles or acted as extras in the film.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Critical response===\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Children of the Corn'' holds a 39% approval rating based on 31 critic reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.2/10.
