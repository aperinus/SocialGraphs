[[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]], comic star of numerous [[French New Wave]] films including [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' and Godard's earlier ''[[Masculin F\u00e9minin]]'', appeared in two roles. [[Raoul Coutard]] served as [[cinematographer]]; ''Weekend'' was his last collaboration with Godard for over a decade.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nRoland and Corinne Durand are a bourgeois couple. Each has a secret lover and conspires to murder the other. They drive out to Corinne's parents' home in the country to secure her inheritance from her dying father, resolving to resort to murder if necessary. The trip becomes a chaotically [[picaresque]] journey through a French countryside populated by bizarre characters and punctuated by violent car accidents. After their own [[Facel-Vega]] is destroyed in a collision, they wander through a series of vignettes involving class struggle and figures from literature and history, such as [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]].\n\nWhen Corinne and Roland eventually arrive at her parents' place, they discover that her father has died and her mother refuses to give them a share of the spoils. They kill her and hit the road again, only to fall into the hands of a group of [[hippies|hippie]] revolutionaries (calling themselves the [[Seine-et-Oise|Seine and Oise]] Liberation Front) that support themselves through theft and [[cannibal]]ism. Killed during an escape attempt, Roland is chopped up and cooked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mireille Darc]] as Corinne\n* [[Jean Yanne]] as Roland\n* [[Paul G\u00e9gauff]] as pianist\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] and man in phone booth\n* Blandine Jeanson as [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] and page-turner for pianist\n* [[Yves Afonso]] as [[Tom Thumb]]\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as the leader of Front de Lib\u00e9ration de la Seine et Oise\n* [[Juliet Berto]] as a member of FLSO and a bourgeoise in a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]]\n* [[Jean Eustache]] as a hitchhiker\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (actor)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3]] as an Arab garbage collector and revolutionary\n* Omar Diop as an African garbage collector and revolutionary\n* [[Anne Wiazemsky]] as an audience member in the piano recital\n* [[Michel Cournot]] as an audience member in the piano recital\n\n== Themes and style ==\n''Weekend'' has been compared to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', the ''[[James Bond]]'' series, and the works of [[Marquis de Sade]].<ref name=\"Hoberman\">{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/weekend-when-godard-burned-the-movie-house-down-6433180|title=Weekend: When Godard Burned the Movie House Down|last=Hoberman|first=J.|author-link=J.
