Directed by [[Arthur Hiller]], written by [[John Fusco]], it was released in the United States on April 17, 1992, to mixed reviews. The somewhat fictionalized account of Ruth's life begins in Maryland with his childhood. The film covers his personal life and rise as a ball player with the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]], trade to [[New York Yankees|New York]], and decline in health and career that ends with his walking away after being a \"name only\" manager to boost ticket sales.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1902 where seven-year-old George Herman Ruth Jr. is sent to the St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a [[reformatory]] and [[orphanage]]. Ruth is sent by his father, George Herman Ruth Sr., who cannot handle raising the boy on his own.  At the school, Ruth is schooled by Catholic missionaries and ridiculed by the other children for his large size.  Brother Matthias Boutlier, the Head of Discipline at St. Mary's, first introduces Ruth to the game of baseball.  During a session of batting practice, Ruth hits several towering home runs. Matthias and others are stunned by Ruth's amazing power to drive the ball.\n\nThe film then flashes forward to 1914, where a 19-year-old Ruth excels on St. Mary's baseball team, both as a powerful hitter and a great pitcher.  Ruth's amazing skills come to the attention of manager [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn]]. Since Ruth is underage, Dunn decides to adopt Ruth and sign him to a contract with the [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]].  In the middle of the [[1914 Major League Baseball season|1914 baseball season]], Ruth is sold to the [[1914 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].  Ruth begins to gain wide attention for his home runs and becomes popular in Boston. However, he angers Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] during a party, and following the 1919 season, Ruth demands a raise and a suite for road games. Instead of meeting his demands, Frazee sells him to the [[1920 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] to finance his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, which have lost money.\n\nRuth becomes very popular in New York, helping the Yankees win the 1923 World Series. Later he hits two home runs for [[Johnny Sylvester]], a sick boy whom he had recently visited in hospital. Two years later, after divorcing his first wife, Helen Woodford, Ruth starts to go into a slump. His teammate [[Lou Gehrig]] begins to steal his spotlight, becoming known as the \"Iron Horse\" and \"[[The Pride of the Yankees]]\". After getting pelted with lemons during a game, Ruth gets angry and storms onto the dugout, yelling at the crowd and further tarnishing his failing public image with the team.\n\nHowever in 1927, Ruth returns to his old self and hits 60 home runs, breaking his old record of 59. During game three of the 1932 [[1932 World Series|World Series]] against the [[1932 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]], he [[Babe Ruth's called shot|\"calls his shot\"]] by pointing to center field, then hits a towering home run,\n\nBy 1934, Ruth's career is well on the decline. He wants to pursue his post-career ambition of managing a baseball team, but Yankees owner [[Jacob Ruppert|Colonel Jacob Ruppert]] decides to release him instead.  Under the promise of becoming a manager, Ruth signs with the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]], but his presence on the team is more comedic than anything else.  Before a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Ruth overhears the Boston owners saying he's only good for drawing a gate.  He responds by hitting three home runs in the game\u2014then dramatically shuns the owner's proffered handshake of congratulations and drops his Braves cap on the ground, indicating that he is quitting the team.\n\nThe film ends with Ruth broken, trudging alone through the entrance tunnel. He is confronted by John, now a grown man, who tell Ruth that he is still his hero and returns the signed ball that Ruth gifted him during his hospital visit when Johnny was sick. Ruth remarks, \"I'm gone, Johnny. I'm solid gone\" and begins to leave, but Johnny calls after him \"You're the best... you're the best there's ever been!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[John Goodman]] \u2013 [[Babe Ruth]]\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] \u2013 [[Claire Merritt Hodgson|Claire Hodgson Ruth]]\n* [[Trini Alvarado]] \u2013 Helen Woodford Ruth\n* [[Bruce Boxleitner]] \u2013 Jumpin' [[Joe Dugan]]\n* [[Peter Donat]] \u2013 [[Harry Frazee]]\n* [[James Cromwell]] \u2013 Brother Mathias\n* J.

While the sick child story is a long-standing Ruth myth, the Called Shot's authenticity is still debated to this day. Nevertheless, the dramatic scene portrayed in the movie is mostly fabrication. The film also takes license with Ruth's first and final career homers. In the film, Ruth hits his first homer as a newcomer to the Red Sox in 1914. Ruth actually played sporadically for the Sox in 1914 and did not homer until 1915. His three final home runs did indeed come at [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Forbes Field]] in one afternoon; however, he did not retire following (or during) the game as seen in the film nor did he take a seat in the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] dugout.  Furthermore, Ruth did not have a \"courtesy runner\" who would take over for Ruth upon reaching first base. Ruth appeared in five more games that year before injuring his knee and hanging it up.\n\nChicago's [[Wrigley Field]] stood in for [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] during filming. Temporary walls were placed over the ivy-covered brick for the New York scenes. The ivy is depicted during the 1932 World Series scenes, where the action is taking place at Wrigley Field, although in 1932, the ivy had not yet been planted. Similarly, in a scene during Ruth's career with the Yankees, in a 1925 game vs. the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[Fenway Park]], he hits a home run and the [[Green Monster]] is depicted. The Green Monster at that time was actually covered with advertisements; it was not painted solid green until 1947.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on May 13, 1991, and wrapped on July 30, 1991.\n\n[[Danville Stadium]] in [[Danville, Illinois]], was where the scenes for Fenway Park and Forbes Field were filmed, as well as the black/white news footage.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was also not a financial success.<ref>{{cite news|title= No Easter Basket for Box Office : Movies: 'Basic Instinct' winds up in first place over the holiday weekend, but business so far this year is down about 9%.|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-20/entertainment/ca-349_1_basic-instinct|access-date=2012-06-09}}</ref> It grossed over $19.9 million worldwide at the [[box-office]] and was pulled from theatres after five weeks.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly mixed reviews from critics.
