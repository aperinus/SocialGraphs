It is based on [[Cornelia Funke]]'s 2003 [[Inkheart|novel of the same name]].\n\nProduced by [[New Line Cinema]], the film was released theatrically on December 12, 2008, in the UK and January 23, 2009, in the US by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. ''Inkheart'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $62,450,361 on a $60 million budget.<ref name=\"bomojo\"/><ref name=\"the-num\"/>\n\n''Inkheart'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in the United Kingdom on April 13, 2009.<ref name=\"Inkheart DVD 2008\" /> On January 12, 2009, a video game based on the film was released for the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref name=\"gamefaqs\" />\n\n==Plot==\nParents Mortimer \"Mo\" Folchart ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and his wife Teresa \"Resa\" Folchart ([[Sienna Guillory]]) read the [[fairy tale]] \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\" to their baby daughter Meggie, as a red velvet hood appears out of thin air. Twelve years later, Meggie ([[Eliza Bennett]]) visits an old book shop in Europe with her father, unaware that he is secretly looking for a copy of the book ''Inkheart''. Shortly after Mo finds the book, Meggie encounters a horned [[marten]] outside the shop and it tries to bite her fingers. A man ([[Paul Bettany]]) suddenly appears from the shadows, claiming to be an old friend. Mo comes out of the shop, recognizing the man as Dustfinger, who quickly asks him to \"read him back into the book\". Mo flees with Meggie.\n\nMo takes Meggie to visit her great-aunt Elinor ([[Helen Mirren]]) in Italy. There he tells Meggie that nine years ago, while reading to her from ''Inkheart'', he inadvertently brought Dustfinger out of the world of the book and into the world Mo and Meggie live in, through a gift he possessed from birth. Unfortunately, the book's villain, Capricorn ([[Andy Serkis]]), and one of his henchmen, Basta ([[Jamie Foreman]]), were also brought out of the book. Fleeing with his infant daughter, Mo realizes his wife Resa has been taken into the book. Capricorn arrives with Basta, who captures the group, destroys Elinor's library and takes ''Inkheart''. Mo, Meggie, and Elinor are taken to Capricorn's new castle in the \"real\" world.\n\nDuring their imprisonment, Mo explains his gift to Meggie and Elinor, stating that when he reads a person or an object out of a book, someone from the real world is sent into it, hence his wife's disappearance. Capricorn forces Mo to use his gift, acquiring treasure from one of the stories in ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'', and imprisoning Farid ([[Rafi Gavron]]), one of the [[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves|40 Thieves]]. Dustfinger, who was promised a return into the book, is betrayed by Capricorn. The group escapes using the [[tornado]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\nElinor leaves to recover what is left of her library as the others head for [[Alassio]], the town of ''Inkheart''{{'}}s author Fenoglio, who may have another copy. Dustfinger is initially afraid of learning his fate in the book, but eventually joins them. When they meet Fenoglio ([[Jim Broadbent]]), the author's ecstatic reaction to seeing his creation alive leads Dustfinger to learn he dies at the end of the book while trying to save his marten, Gwin. Angry, he berates Fenoglio before eventually telling Mo that Resa is trapped in the castle and has lost her voice.\n\nMo and Dustfinger take Fenoglio's car and Farid stows away in the trunk. At Fenoglio's house, Meggie begins reading out loud, bringing [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] from ''The Wizard of Oz''. Basta bursts in with his men and takes the group to Capricorn. Elinor, having decided to stay, realizes something is amiss and pursues them. At the castle, Capricorn orders Meggie to bring a monster called the Shadow out of ''Inkheart'' and threatens to harm her mother if she does not comply. Mo sneaks into the castle. Dustfinger is captured, but escapes after Meggie informs him of Capricorn's intentions.\n\nMo attempts to free Meggie and the others, as Capricorn forces her to read the Shadow out of the book. Dustfinger returns to the castle with Farid and sets it on fire. The distraction allows Fenoglio to give Meggie a rewrite of part of ''Inkheart'' that he wrote to help Meggie stop Capricorn's plan. As Elinor arrives with the creatures Capricorn imprisoned, Meggie writes out the story on her arm. As she reads out her creation, Capricorn turns into ashes as the Shadow devours him, his henchmen vanish, the Shadow explodes, and all the read-out creatures back are returned where they belong, including Toto. In addition, she grants Fenoglio's wish to live in the world he created, while reuniting her and Mo with her mother and restoring her voice. Dustfinger is also safely read back into ''Inkheart'', where he is reunited with his wife Roxanne. In the real world, Farid reveals he kept Gwin with him, thus allowing Dustfinger to avoid his own death. As Mo and his family leave with Farid, Meggie agrees to teach him how to read and Farid agrees to teach her how to use the dragon breath, the fire breathing ability of Dustfinger's which Farid learned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Mortimer \"Mo\" Folchart (\"Silvertongue\")\n* [[Eliza Bennett]] as Meggie Folchart\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Dustfinger\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Elinor Loredan\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as Capricorn\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Fenoglio\n* [[Rafi Gavron]] as Farid\n* [[Sienna Guillory]] as Teresa \"Resa\" Folchart\n* [[Lesley Sharp]] as Mortola\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as Basta\n* [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]] as Cockerell\n* [[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] as Darius\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Roxane\n* [[Marnix Van Den Broeke]] as The Shadow\n* [[Steve Speirs]] as Flatnose\n* [[Jessie Cave]] as [[Nymph]]\n* [[Adam Bond]] as [[Prince Charming]]\n* [[Tereza Srbova]] as [[Rapunzel]]\n* Emily Eby as Guinevere\n* [[Roger Allam]] as Narrator\n* [[Paul Kasey]] as [[Minotaur]]\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Fulvio\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nShortly after the novel was published, author [[Cornelia Funke]] sent a copy of ''Inkheart'' along with a note to [[Brendan Fraser]], explaining that he was her inspiration for the character of Mo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/inkheart/a/brendan-fraser.htm |title=Inkheart - Brendan Fraser on Inkheart and Inspiring Author Cornelia Funke |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=June 17, 2010 |access-date=August 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>So I get this book. It shows up in the mail. 'Dear Brendan,' it's inscribed, 'Thank you for inspiring this character.' I can feel my leg getting pulled already. 'What? Where's [[Ashton Kutcher]]?' 'I hope that you get a chance to read this aloud to your kids one day. Best wishes, Cornelia Funke.' I had no idea from a bar of soap who she was, so I [[Google]]d her. Wow, so much work, she's prolific. I think part of the story is that a little girl who was bilingual, I think she was a Brit but she spoke German fluently, had discovered a copy of Tintenherz which she loved and read, and wrote to either it was Cornelia or the publisher and asked why isn't this published in English? And I think Cornelia probably wanted to know the answer to that question too. So once it was, it just became a snowballing thing and then that really got her out there and led to the acclaim and popularity of her work.</blockquote>\n\nIt was this that motivated director [[Iain Softley]] and the casting department to consider Fraser first for the role in the film. Fraser told Softley that if it was determined that he was not right for the role, not to feel obligated to use him on the project.
