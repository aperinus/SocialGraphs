The story takes place between 1619 and 1630 during the [[Edo period]] and the rule of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. It tells the story of the ''[[r\u014dnin]]'' Hanshir\u014d Tsugumo,<ref name=\"Berra2012\">{{cite book|author=John Berra|title=Japan 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZBtqGMr8T4C&pg=PA151|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-551-0|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> who requests to commit [[seppuku]] ''(harakiri)'' within the manor of a local [[feudal]] lord, using the opportunity to explain the events that drove him to ask for death before an audience of samurai. The film continues to receive critical acclaim, often considered one of the best samurai pictures ever made.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in [[Edo]] in the year 1630. Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d arrives at the estate of the [[Ii clan|Iyi clan]] and says that he wishes to commit [[seppuku]] within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him, Sait\u014d Kageyu ([[Rentar\u014d Mikuni]]), the [[daimy\u014d]]'s senior counselor, tells Hanshir\u014d the story of another r\u014dnin, Chijiiwa Motome\u2014formerly of the same clan as Hanshir\u014d.\n\nSait\u014d scornfully recalls the practice of r\u014dnin requesting the chance to commit seppuku on the clan's land, but in fact  hoping to be turned away and given [[alms]]. Motome had arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as Hanshir\u014d. Infuriated by the rising number of \"suicide bluffs\", the three most senior samurai of the clan\u2014Yazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuro\u2014persuaded Sait\u014d to force Motome to follow through and kill himself, ignoring his request for a couple of days delay. Upon examining Motome's swords, his blades were found to be made of [[bamboo]]. Enraged that any samurai would \"pawn his soul\", the House of Iyi forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating.\n\nDespite this warning, Hanshir\u014d insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he is sincere in wanting to commit seppuku. Just as the ceremony is about to begin, Hanshir\u014d is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of Sait\u014d and the Iyi retainers, Hanshir\u014d successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro \u2014 the three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, with each claiming to be too ill to attend.\n\nAfter provoking their laughter by calling the samurai moral code [[bushido]] a facade, Hanshir\u014d recounts his life story to the assembled samurai, starting with the admission that he did know Motome. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the [[Sh\u014dgun]]. His lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, Hanshir\u014d planned to [[Junshi|die alongside him]]. To prevent this, Hanshir\u014d's closest friend took his place instead, leaving Hanshir\u014d responsible for his teenage son, Motome. In order to support Motome and his own daughter Miho, Hanshir\u014d rented a hovel in the slums of Edo, taking up work as a fan and umbrella craftsman while Motome became a teacher. Realizing the love between Motome and Miho, Hanshir\u014d arranged for them to marry. Soon after, they had a son, Kingo.\n\nWhen Miho became ill with [[tuberculosis]], Motome could not bear the thought of losing her and did everything to raise money to hire a doctor. When Kingo also fell ill, Motome left one morning, saying he planned to take out a loan from a [[loan shark|moneylender]]. Later that evening, Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuro brought home Motome's mutilated body, and described and mocked his death before leaving. It is now clear that Motome had requested a delay so he could visit his family and put his affairs in order. A few days later, Kingo died, and Miho lost the will to live and died, leaving Hanshir\u014d with nothing. Finishing his story, Hanshir\u014d explains that his sole desire is to join Motome, Miho, and Kingo in death. He explains, however, that they have every right to ask him whether justice has been exacted for their deaths. Therefore, Hanshir\u014d asks Sait\u014d if he has any statement of regret to convey to Motome, Miho, and Kingo. He explains that, if Sait\u014d does so, he will die without saying another word. Sait\u014d refuses, calling Motome an \"extortionist\" who deserved to die.\n\nHanshir\u014d reveals the last part of his story. Before coming to the Iyi estate, he tracked down Hayato and Umenosuke and cut off their [[chonmage|topknots]]. Hikokuro then visited Hanshir\u014d's hovel and, with great respect, challenged him to a duel. After a brief but tense sword fight, Hikokuro suffers a double disgrace: his sword is broken and his topknot is taken as well. As proof, Hanshir\u014d removes their labelled topknots from his kimono and casts them upon the palace courtyard. He mocks the Iyi clan, saying that if the men he humiliated were true samurai, they would not be hiding out of shame. He also questions the clan's honor and bushido, pointing out that they should not have ignored Motome\u2019s request for a delay to his seppuku without investigating the reason why he asked.\n\nHaving badly [[face (sociological concept)|lost face]], an enraged Sait\u014d calls Hanshir\u014d a madman and orders the retainers to kill him. In a fierce battle, Hanshir\u014d kills four samurai, wounds eight, and contemptuously smashes into pieces the antique suit of armor which symbolizes the glorious history of the House of Iyi. Finally, the clan corners Hanshir\u014d and prepares to kill him not with swords, but with three [[matchlock]] guns. As Hanshir\u014d commits seppuku, he is simultaneously shot by all three gunmen.\n\nTerrified that the Iyi clan will be abolished if word gets out that \"a half starved r\u014dnin\" killed so many of their retainers, Sait\u014d announces that all deaths caused by Hanshir\u014d shall be explained by \"illness\". At the same time, a messenger returns reporting that Hikokuro had killed himself the day before, while Hayato and Umenosuke are both faking illness. Sait\u014d angrily orders that Hayato and Umenosuke are to be forced to commit seppuku as atonement for losing their topknots. Those three deaths shall be also attributed to \u201cillness\u201d.\n\nAs the suit of armor is cleaned and re-erected, a new entry in the official records of the House of Iyi is read by a [[voiceover]]. Hanshir\u014d is declared to have been mentally unstable, and he and Motome are both listed as having died through harakiri. The Sh\u014dgun is said to have issued a personal commendation to the lord of the Iyi clan for how his councilors handled the suicide bluffs of Motome and Hanshir\u014d. At the end of his letter, the Sh\u014dgun praises the House of Iyi and their samurai as exemplars of bushido. As workers scrub the blood from the ground of the clan's estate, one of them finds a severed topknot and places it in his work bucket.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] - {{nihongo|Tsugumo Hanshir\u014d|\u6d25\u96f2 \u534a\u56db\u90ce}}\n* [[Rentar\u014d Mikuni]] - {{nihongo|Sait\u014d Kageyu|\u658e\u85e4 \u52d8\u89e3\u7531}}\n* [[Akira Ishihama]] - {{nihongo|Chijiiwa Motome|\u5343\u3005\u5ca9 \u6c42\u5973}}\n* [[Shima Iwashita]] - {{nihongo|Tsugumo Miho|\u6d25\u96f2 \u7f8e\u4fdd}}\n* [[Tetsur\u014d Tamba]] - {{nihongo|Omodaka Hikokuro|\u6ca2\u6f5f \u5f66\u4e5d\u90ce}}\n* [[Ichir\u014d Nakatani]] - {{nihongo|Yazaki Hayato|\u77e2\u5d0e \u96bc\u4eba}}\n* Masao Mishima - {{nihongo|Inaba Tango|\u7a32\u8449 \u4e39\u5f8c}}\n* [[Kei Sat\u014d]] - {{nihongo|Fukushima Masakatsu|\u798f\u5cf6 \u6b63\u52dd}}\n* [[Yoshio Inaba]] - {{nihongo|Chijiiwa Jinai|\u5343\u3005\u5ca9 \u9663\u5185}}\n* Yoshiro Aoki - {{nihongo|Kawabe Umenosuke|\u5ddd\u8fba \u53f3\u99ac\u4ecb}}\n\n==Themes==\nWhen asked about the theme of his film, Kobayashi said: \"All of my pictures\u2026 are concerned with resisting an entrenched power. That\u2019s what ''Harakiri'' is about, of course, and ''[[Samurai Rebellion|Rebellion]]'' as well. I suppose I've always challenged authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hoaglund|first1=Linda|date=1994-05-01|title=A Conversation with Kobayashi Masaki|journal=Positions|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=393|doi=10.1215/10679847-2-2-382|issn=1067-9847}}</ref>\n\n[[Audie Bock]] describes the theme of ''Harakiri'' as \"the inhumanity of this requirement for those who dutifully adhered to it, and the hypocrisy of those who enforced this practice\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Japanese film directors|last1=Bock|first1=Audie|publisher=Kodansha International|year=1985|isbn=0-87011-714-9|location=Tokyo|pages=254|oclc=12250480}}</ref> The movie doesn't so much challenge the practice of seppuku; rather, it highlights an instance when it occurred in a punitive and hypocritical environment. The notions of honor and bravery associated with it can be a false front, as the protagonist puts it, serving more as a means of preserving reputations than of actually atoning for a crime or misdeed.\n\nThe empty suit of armor, shown in the beginning, symbolizes the past glory of the Iyi clan, and is treated by them with reverence. However, the samurai of the Iyi house behave like cowards in the fight with Tsugumo, who mockingly tries to use the armor as a shield before smashing it on the ground. Kobayashi makes a point here that this symbol of military prowess turns out to be an empty one.<ref>Bock, p. 256</ref>\n\nKobayashi also attacks two other important attributes of the samurai rank: the sword and the topknot. Motome finds out that his swords are of no use to him if he cannot provide for his family and so he sells them to pay for his son's medical care. When Tsugumo takes his revenge on the three men complicit in Motome's death, he prefers divesting them of their topknots rather than killing them. At the time, losing one's topknot was the same as losing one's sword, and death would be preferable to such dishonor. However, only one of the three samurai, Omodaka, actually commits seppuku, with the other two being forced by the clan to take their own lives at sword point. Thus, the way Tsugumo takes revenge is very subtle: he makes the clan live by the rules they claim to uphold and which they used to punish Motome.<ref>Bock, pp. 257-258</ref>\n\nThe daily record book of the clan that appears in the beginning and the end of the film \"represents the recorded lies of history\". Tsugumo's death is falsely labeled as suicide, the three samurai and the men he killed are said to have died of natural causes rather than violence, and the entire story of his challenge to the clan is swept under the rug to protect the fa\u00e7ade of \"the unjust power structure\" that the Iyi clan represents.<ref>Bock, p. 257</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Harakiri'' was released in Japan in 1962.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=207}} The film was released by Shochiku Film of America with English subtitles in the United States in December 1963.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=207}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn a contemporary review, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' stated that [[Masaki Kobayashi]]'s \"slow, measured cadence perfectly matches his subject\" and that the \"story itself is beautifully constructed\". The review praised [[Tatsuya Nakadai]]'s performance as a \"brilliant, [[Toshiro Mifune|Mifune]]-like performance\" and noted that the film was \"on occasion brutal, particularly in the young samurai's terrible agony with his bamboo sword\" and that although \"some critics have remarked [...] that being gory is not the best way to deplore wanton bloodshed, Harakiri still looks splendid with its measured tracking shots, its slow zooms, its reflective overhead shots of the courtyard, and its frequent poised immobility\".<ref name=\"mfb\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Seppuku (Harakiri), Japan, 1962|pages=71\u201372|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|volume=32|issue=372|year=1965|location=London}}</ref> The ''New York Times'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] was unimpressed with \"the tortured human drama in this film\" but added that \"Mr. Kobayashi does superb things with architectural compositions, moving forms and occasionally turbulent gyrations of struggling figures in the CinemaScope-size screen.

But none of Kobayashi's social protests is diminished in the film's construction - it's [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]-like circularity that bitterly denies any hope for human progress\".<ref>Bock, p. 258</ref> More recently [[Roger Ebert]] added ''Harakiri'' to his list of \"Great Movies\", writing in his 2012 review: \"Samurai films, like westerns, need not be familiar genre stories. They can expand to contain stories of ethical challenges and human tragedy. ''Harakiri'', one of the best of them, is about an older wandering samurai who takes his time to create an unanswerable dilemma for the elder of a powerful clan. By playing strictly within the rules of Bushido Code which governs the conduct of all samurai, he lures the powerful leader into a situation where sheer naked logic leaves him humiliated before his retainers\".<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120223/REVIEWS08/120229987/1004 | newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times | date= February 23, 2012 | last1= Ebert| first1= Roger| title=Honor, morality, and ritual suicide| access-date= March 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% rating]] based on nine critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.01/10.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harakiri | title=Harakiri (1962) | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was entered in the competition category at the [[1963 Cannes Film Festival]].
