It recounts the true story of the unexplained [[coma]] of socialite [[Sunny von B\u00fclow]], the subsequent [[attempted murder]] trial, and the eventual [[acquittal]] of her husband, [[Claus von B\u00fclow]], who had Dershowitz as his defense attorney.<ref>''State v. von Bulow'', 475 A.2d 995 (R.I. 1984).</ref> The film was directed by [[Barbet Schroeder]] and stars [[Jeremy Irons]] as Claus, [[Glenn Close]] as Sunny, and [[Ron Silver]] as Dershowitz. Screenwriter [[Nicholas Kazan|Nick Kazan]] originally envisioned Austrian actor [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] in the role of Claus von B\u00fclow, but was thrilled with Irons' performance. Irons earned the 1990 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is narrated by [[Sunny von B\u00fclow]], who is in a coma after falling into [[Diabetic coma|diabetic shock]] after a Christmas party. Her husband, the dissolute European aristocrat [[Claus von B\u00fclow]], is charged with attempting to murder the [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] Sunny by giving her an overdose of [[insulin]]. Claus's strained relationship with his wife and his cold and haughty personal demeanor led most people to conclude that he is guilty. In need of an innovative defense, Claus turns to law professor [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Dershowitz is initially convinced of Claus's guilt, but takes the case because von B\u00fclow agrees to fund Dershowitz's defense of two poor black boys accused of capital murder. Employing his law students as workers, Dershowitz proceeds to defend Claus, wrestling with his client's unnerving personal style and questions of von B\u00fclow's guilt or innocence.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Glenn Close]] as [[Sunny von B\u00fclow]]\n*[[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Claus von B\u00fclow]]\n*[[Ron Silver]] as [[Alan Dershowitz]]\n*[[Uta Hagen]] as Maria\n*[[Annabella Sciorra]] as Sarah\n*[[Fisher Stevens]] as David Marriott\n*[[Jack Gilpin]] as Peter MacIntosh\n*[[Christine Baranski]] as Andrea Reynolds\n*[[Stephen Mailer]] as Elon Dershowitz\n*[[Felicity Huffman]] as Minnie\n*[[Johann Carlo]] as Nancy\n*[[Keith Reddin]] as Dobbs\n*[[Mitchell Whitfield]] as Curly\n*[[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Jack\n*[[Michael Lord]] as Ed\n*[[Lisa Gay Hamilton]] as Mary\n*[[Julie Hagerty]] as [[Alexandra Isles]]\n*[[Bill Camp]] as Bill\n*Mano Singh as Raj\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in numerous estates in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New Jersey]], and the Knole house in [[Old Westbury, New York|Old Westbury]].
