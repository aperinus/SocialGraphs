She is working in a small restaurant and dreams of becoming an actress. When a wandering theatre company enters the city, she misses the theatrical performance and wanders for a while. She chances upon an aircraft pilot, Yassir, who pretends to be an actor and friend of a famous American actor. He promises to help her become an actress, but instead seduces her while she is in a dream-like fantasy. He leaves the village immediately afterwards.\n\nWhen she later discovers that she is pregnant, she has no idea how this happened and who the father is.  Determined to preserve hers and their honour, her eccentric family sets out on a comic journey in order to find the father of Mamlakat's unborn child and to force him to marry her. During this journey - in an old car loaded with rabbits - they travel through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.  The family meets various bandits and the charming impostor Alik, who poses as the seducer in the dark, and falls in love with Mamlakat.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chulpan Khamatova]] as Mamlakat\n*[[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Nasreddin\n*Ato Mukhamedzhanov as Safar\n*[[Merab Ninidze]] as Alik\n*Polina Rajkina as Khabibula (voice only)\n*[[Nikolay Fomenko]] as Yassir\n*[[Dinmukhamet Akhimov]] as the gynaecologist\n*Sherali Abdulkajsov as Akbar\n\n== Filming location ==\nThe film was shot in [[Guliston (Tajikistan)|Kairakum]], in north-western Tajikistan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.pandorafilm.com/filmography/luna-papa.html\n|title=PANDORA FILM Produktion - LUNA PAPA\n|accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film received the main prize \"Golden Rose\" at [[Kinotavr]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinotavr.ru/ru/history/winners/|publisher=[[Kinotavr]]|title=\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0435\u0440\u044b 1991-2005 \u0433\u0433.|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806033607/http://www.kinotavr.ru/ru/history/winners/|archive-date=2012-08-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Russian Guild of Film Critics|2000 Russian Guild of Film Critics Awards]] the picture was awarded the prizes for ''Best Film'' and ''Best Director'' ([[Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kinopressa.ru/white-elephant/httpkinopressa-rupage_id373|work=[[Russian Guild of Film Critics]]|title=2000}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Waiting for the Sea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0170259|title=Luna Papa}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Russian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about abortion]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov]]\n[[Category:Russian pregnancy films]]\n\n{{1990s-comedy-film-stub}}\n{{Russia-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
