Not on title screen.-->Texas.''''') is a 1986 American [[musical film|musical]] [[satirical film|satirical]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[David Byrne]], who stars alongside [[John Goodman]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]], and [[Spalding Gray]]. The majority of the film's music is supplied by [[Talking Heads]]. A soundtrack album, titled ''[[Sounds from True Stories]]'', featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen & The Panhandle Mystery Band]], and others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album titled ''[[True Stories (Talking Heads album)|True Stories]]'', composed of studio recordings of songs featured in the film.\n\n''True Stories'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Sweden in 1986, with limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture's direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads' 1984 concert film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''. The resulting film is replete with Byrne's eccentric and idiosyncratic observations of small-town life, exaggerated satirical imagery, and [[surreal humour|surrealist]] sense of humor.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is presented as a series of vignettes centered around Byrne as an unnamed, cowboy-hat-wearing stranger who visits the fictional Texas town of Virgil, where he observes the citizens as they prepare for the \"Celebration of Specialness\" to mark the 150th anniversary of Texas' independence. The event is being sponsored by the Varicorp Corporation, a local computer manufacturing plant.\n\nAmong the many characters the visitor meets and interacts with, the most prominent are:\n* Louis Fyne ([[John Goodman]]), a [[country music|country-western]]-singing [[clean room]] technician at Varicorp who is unlucky in love\n* Civic leader Earl Culver ([[Spalding Gray]]), who never speaks directly to his wife, Kay ([[Annie McEnroe]])\n* Miss Rollings ([[Swoosie Kurtz]]), who never leaves her bed\n* Mr. Tucker ([[Pops Staples]]), Miss Rollings' personal assistant, a kindly [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] practitioner whom Louis hires to help him find love\n* A conspiracy theorist preacher ([[John Ingle]]), whose [[shtick]] owes a great deal to the [[Church of the SubGenius]]\n* Ramon ([[Tito Larriva]]), a Tejano singer who claims to hear [[synesthesia|tones from people]]\n* \"The Lying Woman\" ([[Jo Harvey Allen]]), who recounts fantastic episodes from her life to anyone who will listen\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Byrne]] as The Narrator (also as the Lip-Syncher with mustache during the \"Wild Wild Life\" sequence)\n* [[John Goodman]] as Louis Fyne\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Earl Culver\n* [[Annie McEnroe]] as Kay Culver\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Miss Rollings, The Lazy Woman\n* [[Pops Staples]] as Mr. Tucker\n* [[John Ingle]] as The Preacher\n* [[Tito Larriva]] as Ramon\n* [[Jo Harvey Allen]] as The Lying Woman\n* [[Chris Frantz]], [[Tina Weymouth]] and [[Jerry Harrison]] as Lip-Synchers (Wild Wild Life sequence).\n\n==Production==\nStephen Tobolowsky recounts in an episode of his podcast ''The Tobolowsky Files'' that he and his girlfriend Beth Henley met David Byrne and Talking Heads when [[Jonathan Demme]] invited them to a preview screening of ''Stop Making Sense''. Shortly afterward, Byrne invited Henley and Tobolowsky over to his house and showed them a collection of hundreds of drawings he had made and put up on his wall. He explained they were based on clippings he had scrapbooked from tabloids as the band had been on tour. He had been intrigued by the idea of making a film based on the premise, \"What if all these stories were true?\" and wanted Henley and Tobolowsky to write the script based on those drawings.<ref name=\"slashfilm1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/tobolowsky-files-ep-44-the-voice-from-another-room/|title=The Tobolowsky Files, Episode 44: The Voice from Another Room|publisher=[[/Film]]|access-date=March 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTobolowsky was aware that Texas was coming up on its sesquicentennial celebration, and thought that would provide a good framework for the characters Byrne had invented. Henley and he wrote a draft and provided it to Byrne, then did not hear back from him for about a year. It later turned out that Byrne had rewritten their script almost entirely, keeping only a few lines and the sesquicentennial framework from the first draft. However, he asked Tobolowsky and Henley for permission to list their names ahead of his as scriptwriters so the film would seem less like a \"vanity project.\"<ref name=\"slashfilm1\"/>\n\nDuring Tobolowsky's early talks with Byrne, he related to Byrne the story of a series of psychic experiences he had during college, in which he had been able to hear \"tones\" that told him things about other people. Byrne incorporated this story into his rewrite, using it as the basis for Ramon's psychic powers and the song \"Radio Head.\"<ref name=\"slashfilm1\"/>\n\nAn early working title for the project (endorsed by bassist [[Tina Weymouth]]) was ''Wild Infancy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talking-heads.nl/index.php/talking-heads-archive/138-transcript-of-interview-picture-disk|title=1985 - Transcript of interview picture disk (BAK 2017)|date=July 16, 2011|access-date=May 19, 2014|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111036/http://www.talking-heads.nl/index.php/talking-heads-archive/138-transcript-of-interview-picture-disk|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref> Filming took place in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and its suburbs [[Allen, Texas|Allen]], [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]], [[Midlothian, Texas|Midlothian]] and [[Red Oak, Texas|Red Oak]].

On March 30, 1999, it was released onto [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Talking Heads - True Stories|url=https://www.discogs.com/Talking-Heads-True-Stories/release/6293994|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref> On November 27, 2018, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a DVD and [[Blu-ray]] of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Stories (1986)|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/29038-true-stories|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n''True Stories'' features a number of songs written by Byrne and performed by various members of the cast as well as by [[Talking Heads]] (the members of which make cameo appearances).\n\nTalking Heads released an album titled ''[[True Stories (Talking Heads album)|True Stories]]'' in which the band performs most of the songs from the film, including songs that were performed by the actors in the film. As such, the album is not generally considered a true soundtrack album, a fact Byrne points out in his liner notes on the release. Later, Byrne released an album containing primarily instrumental music from the soundtrack titled ''[[Sounds from True Stories]]''.\n\nWhile several of the cast performances were released as bonus tracks on [[12-inch single]] releases, no full album of cast performances was released until 2018 (see below). Prior to 2018, few of the original versions of songs from the film found official release. The St. Thomas Aquinas School Choir's version of \"Hey Now\" was released on the 1987 Talking Heads UK CD single, \"Radio Head\"; the Pops Staples version of \"Papa Legba\" and [[Tito Larriva]]'s version of \"Radio Head\" appear as extra tracks on the 2006 Rhino reissue of ''True Stories''; and John Goodman's version of \"People Like Us\" was initially released as the B-side to the single for \"[[Wild Wild Life]]\" and later was released on the 2006 digital compilation ''[[Bonus Rarities and Outtakes]]'', but the rest of the songs whose versions differ between the movie and album (John Ingle's \"Puzzling Evidence\" and Annie McEnroe's \"Dream Operator\") were not officially available. \"Cocktail Desperado\", recorded by Terry Allen and the Panhandle Mystery Band and featured in the film, is included on the ''Sounds from True Stories'' LP.\n\nThe music video version of \"Wild Wild Life\" that debuted on [[MTV]] is largely a scene taken from the film, in which many of the film's characters (including John Goodman) [[lip-synch]] to the music in a night club; the video version is more risque and features more pop music references/parodies than seen in the film; the [[Prince (singer)|Prince]] and [[Billy Idol]] parodies remain in the film version. Similarly, the video for \"Love for Sale\" is the same as that seen in the film (in which Kurtz's character is shown watching it on TV) except the video version has additional footage of Talking Heads, more references to recognizable TV commercials of the day, and no intercuts to any of the film characters.\n\nIn November 2018, ''True Stories, A Film by David Byrne: The Complete Soundtrack'', a comprehensive soundtrack album with 23 songs as they were recorded for the film, was released. This marked the first time that the complete ''True Stories'' soundtrack was made publicly available, 32 years after the movie's original release. The soundtrack was issued to coincide with Criterion's 2018 [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release of the film, the latter of which it was also packaged with. The new-edition soundtrack includes the three Talking Heads performances with David Byrne on lead vocals that are featured in the movie, \"Wild Wild Life,\" \"Love for Sale,\" and \"City of Dreams\", which are the same recordings included on the Talking Heads album [[True Stories (Talking Heads album)|True Stories]]; otherwise, the material does not overlap with the Talking Heads album. The new edition includes the first official commercial release of McEnroe's \"Dream Operator\" and Ingle's \"Puzzlin' Evidence\".\n\n==Legacy==\nIn January 2017, [[Red Letter Media]] published a video in its Re:View series where regular panelists Jay Bauman and Josh \"The Wizard\" Davis had a retrospective discussion of the film. They focused on the eccentricity of the characters, the performance of Byrne as the film's narrator, the way the film extensively incorporates music, and the observations the film makes about American culture. Both hosts praised it, and Davis said of the film, \"It never gets old for me, and I've shown it to so many people\".<ref>{{cite web|title=True Stories - re:View|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_vze4K-x5g |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/m_vze4K-x5g |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Red Letter Media]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nVirgil Texas, a podcaster known for formerly co-hosting the political podcasts ''[[Chapo Trap House]]'' and ''Bad Faith'', based his [[pseudonym]] on the name of the film's setting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bad Faith ep. 17: Bernie Would've Won|url=https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9iYWRmYWl0aC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw/episode/OTgxZjRiY2QtNjg3Mi00NTdjLWI3NmEtODBjM2M1NmY1ZTdk?sa=X&ved=0CAYQkfYCahcKEwjoy9bei-3sAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ|date = November 5, 2020|accessdate = May 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{AFI film|67091}}\n*{{IMDb title|0092117}}\n*{{Tcmdb title|94012}}\n*{{Allmovie title|51150}}\n*{{Mojo title|truestories}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|true_stories}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6068-true-stories-everybody-has-tones ''True Stories: Everybody Has Tones''] an essay by Rebecca Bengal at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Talking Heads}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:True Stories (Film)}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical films]]\n[[Category:1980s satirical films]]\n[[Category:American musical films]]\n[[Category:American rock music films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Byrne]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Beth Henley]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Byrne]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Stephen Tobolowsky]]\n[[Category:Talking Heads]]\n[[Category:1986 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
