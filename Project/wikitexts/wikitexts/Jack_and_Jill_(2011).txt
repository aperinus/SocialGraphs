Jack is constantly annoyed by his sister and is horrified to learn that Jill plans to stay after [[Hanukkah]] due to an open-ended plane ticket. However, when Jack is demanded by an agency for [[Dunkin' Donuts]] to get [[Al Pacino]] (as himself) for a commercial, Pacino becomes affectionate for Jill, making Jack try to convince her to date the actor despite her disinterest in him. Other stars include [[Katie Holmes]] as Jack's wife and [[Eugenio Derbez]] as another love interest for Jill.\n\n''Jack and Jill'' was panned by critics and audiences, although Pacino's performance received some praise.

He and his wife Erin have a daughter, Sofia. Also living with them is Gary, a [[Hindu]] boy who they adopted at birth, and who has a habit of compulsively taping various objects to his own body. Jack wants counseling for Gary to break the boy's addiction, but Erin won't hear of this; she views Gary's behavior as the very thing which makes him unique. \n\nJack's unemployed twin sister Jill has been living alone in their working-class [[New York City]] neighborhood, since the death of their mother. She visits Jack for [[Thanksgiving]], with plans to stay until after [[Hanukkah]], much to Jack's horror. Jill, who has an open-ended plane ticket, annoys her brother at Thanksgiving dinner, where she also embarrasses a homeless guest, as well as Erin's parents. \n\nThe Sadelstein twins attend a celebration given in their honor by the staff of Jack's advertising company. Jill disgraces herself, her brother, and his colleagues, until she is asked to leave her own party. A day later, Jill's obnoxious conduct gets Jack and his family banned from their local movie theater.\n\nJill goes through a list she has compiled of things to do in Southern California: being a contestant on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price is Right]]''; going horseback riding (she breaks the horse's back just by sitting on it), and touring a studio. Deciding that Jill needs a partner, Jack and the kids teach her how to use an online dating site. However, being Jill, she fails miserably in her efforts to find a boyfriend. One guy, calling himself \"Funbucket\", meets Jill at a swanky restaurant but sneaks out after only a few minutes with her.\nJack's agency client, meanwhile, wants him to get actor [[Al Pacino]] to appear in a [[Dunkin' Donuts]] commercial, thus promoting a new coffee called the \"Dunkaccino.\" Jack takes Jill to a [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] game with Pacino in attendance. Pacino ignores Jack but is infatuated with Jill; it turns out Pacino and Jill grew up on the same street in NYC. Pacino gives Jill his phone number and invites her to his home; yet, for some reason (being Jill), she has no interest in him whatsoever and promptly departs. \n\nJack's Mexican gardener Felipe, also smitten with Jill, takes her to meet his family at their annual fiesta. There she tries Mexican food for the first time, and comes down with severe [[diarrhea]], which makes her even more difficult to live with than usual.\n\nPacino refuses to do the Dunkaccino commercial unless Jack gets him another date with Jill; this forces Jack to invite Jill on a [[cruise ship|cruise]] which he was planning just for his immediate family. Jill insists on bringing her pet cockatoo Poopsie along for the trip, despite the cruise line's strict \"No Pets\" policy. Throughout the voyage, Jill and Poopsie continue to irritate and offend everybody except Sofia, Gary, and their mom.\nWhen Jill keeps refusing to give Pacino another chance with her, Jack disguises himself as his sister and meets the actor. Jill (hearing Pacino's voice in the background of a phone call with her brother) learns she was invited just so Pacino would do the commercial. Dejected, she returns home to NYC. Feeling guilty, Jack follows her along with Erin and the kids.\n\nJill arrives back in [[the Bronx]] on [[New Year's Eve]], only to discover that the bank has taken away her mother's house; this is because Jill kept throwing away numerous bills which she thought were junk mail. The now-homeless Jill encounters a group of former schoolmates, led by class bully Monica, at a restaurant. Jack, Erin, and their kids show up. The twin siblings reconciling by conversing in their made-up twin language. When Monica attacks Erin, she is cold-cocked by Jill. Pacino arrives in character as [[Don Quixote]], who he is currently portraying in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[Man of La Mancha]]. He tells Jill that while he has feelings for her, there is another man more worthy of her than himself. She goes home to find Felipe and his children, where they begin a relationship. The television commercial is made, with Pacino starring and singing a rap song, and he disapproves of it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as [[Jack and Jill|Jack and Jill Sadelstein]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsinfilm.com/2010/08/26/al-pacino-katie-holmes-join-jack-and-jill|title=Al Pacino, Katie Holmes Join 'Jack and Jill' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229232105/http://www.newsinfilm.com/2010/08/26/al-pacino-katie-holmes-join-jack-and-jill/|archive-date=December 29, 2010 |work=News in Film |access-date=December 6, 2010 }}</ref>\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Erin Sadelstein, Jack's wife and Jill's sister-in-law\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Himself\n* [[Eugenio Derbez]] as Felipe / Juangelina, Felipe's grandmother\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Ted\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as Eduardo\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Todd\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Otto: Covert reprises his role from ''[[Happy Gilmore]]''\n* [[Rohan Chand]] as Gary Sadelstein, Jack and Erin's adoptive son and Jill's nephew\n* Elodie Tougne as Sofia Sadelstein, Jack and Erin's daughter and Jill's niece\n* [[Geoff Pierson]] as Carter Simmons, Erin's father\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Bitsy Simmons, Erin's mother\n* [[Gad Elmaleh]] as Xavier\n* [[Gary Valentine]] as Dallas\n* [[Kristin Davis]] as Delilah\n* [[Norm Macdonald]] as \"Funbucket\", Jill's blind date\n* Julia Perri as Sally Cashier\n* [[Dana Carvey]] as Scrapply Puppeteer\n* [[David Spade]] as Monica\n}}\n\nThe film also features cameos from [[Johnny Depp]], [[Regis Philbin]], [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Drew Carey]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Bill Romanowski]], [[Michael Irvin]], [[Jared Fogle]], [[Billy Blanks]], [[Vince Offer]] and [[Caitlyn Jenner]] (the latter prior to her transition, as Bruce Jenner) as themselves.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in 3,438 theaters at #2 with $25,003,575, behind ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'', which debuted in the top spot with $32,206,425.<ref name=\"BoxWeekend\">{{cite web | url = https://www.deadline.com/2011/11/first-box-office-slump-continuing-immortals-1-jack-and-jill-2-puss-in-boots-3-j-edgar-4-tower-heist-5/ | title='Immortals' #1 With So-So $32M Domestic But $36M Foreign, 'Jack And Jill' $26M | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | publisher = [[PMC (company)|PMC]] | date = November 13, 2011| access-date = November 15, 2011 }}</ref> The film closed on February 26, 2012, with a total gross of $74,158,157 in North America.
