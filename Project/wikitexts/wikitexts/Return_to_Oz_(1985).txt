It stars [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Jean Marsh]], [[Piper Laurie]], and [[Fairuza Balk]] as [[Dorothy Gale]] in her first screen role. The film is an [[unofficial sequel]] to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]],'' and it is based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s early 20th century [[List of Oz books|''Oz'' novels]], mainly ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904) and ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (1907). In the plot, Dorothy returns to the [[Land of Oz]] to find it has been conquered by the [[Nome King]]; she must restore it with her new friends [[Billina]], [[Tik-Tok (Oz)|Tik-Tok]], [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], the [[The Gump|Gump]], and [[Princess Ozma]].\n\nIn 1954, Walt Disney Productions bought the film rights to Baum's remaining ''Oz'' books to use in the television series ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]];'' this led to the live-action film ''[[Rainbow Road to Oz]]'', which was never completed. Murch suggested making another ''Oz'' film in 1980. Disney approved the project as they were due to lose the film rights to the series. Though MGM was not involved in the production, Disney had to pay a large fee to use the [[ruby slippers]] created for the 1939 film. ''Return to Oz'' fell behind schedule during production, and, following a change of Disney management, Murch was briefly fired.\n\n''Return to Oz'' was released in theaters on June 21, 1985. It [[Box-office bomb|performed poorly at the box office]], grossing $11.1 million in the United States on a $28 million budget, and received mixed reviews, with critics praising the effects and performances but criticizing the dark content and twisted visuals with many deeming it inferior to the original film. However, it performed well outside the US, and has since acquired a [[cult film|cult following]] from fans of the Oz books for being more faithful to L. Frank Baum's works and those who saw the film at a young age.<ref name=\"Geraghty\">{{cite book | last =Geraghty | first =Lincoln | title =American Hollywood | publisher = Intellect Books | date =2011 | isbn =978-1-84150-415-5| page =187}}</ref> It received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--DO NOT EXPAND. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400-700 words only-->\nIn autumn of 1899, [[Dorothy Gale]]'s obsession with the [[Land of Oz]] troubles her [[Aunt Em]] and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]], who believe she is delusional. They take her to the sanitarium of Dr. Worley who, assisted by Nurse Wilson, plans to administer [[electrotherapy]] before lightning causes a power failure. Dorothy is freed by a mysterious girl who tells her that Worley's machines damage patients. Nurse Wilson chases the girls into a river, where Dorothy climbs aboard a floating chicken coop but is unable to save the other girl and floats away down stream.\n\nDorothy wakes up in Oz with her chicken [[Billina]], who can now talk. They follow a damaged Yellow Brick Road to the [[Emerald City]], now in ruins and its citizens turned to stone. They are attacked by the Wheelers, people with wheels instead of hands and feet, but are saved by [[Tik-Tok (Oz)|Tik-Tok]], a mechanical man who was told by [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], the king of Oz, to wait for Dorothy's return. Learning the Nome King is responsible for the devastation, Dorothy, Billina and Tik-Tok then travel to Princess [[Mombi]]'s castle with the hope of finding out where Scarecrow is.\n\nMombi, who has a collection of different heads she \"wears\", reveals that Scarecrow is being held by the Nome King at his mountain. Intending to take Dorothy's head for her collection, Mombi imprisons the group in a tower with [[Jack Pumpkinhead]], who explains he was brought to life by Mombi's [[Land of Oz#Powder of Life|Powder of Life]]. The four construct a flying creature out of furniture with the head of the [[List of Oz characters (created by Baum)#The Gump|Gump]], a moose-like animal, and Dorothy steals the powder from Mombi to bring it to life. The Gump flies them across the [[Deadly Desert]] to the Nome King's mountain, Mombi has the Wheelers take her in pursuit of Dorothy.\n\nThe Gump crashes on the Nome King's mountain, where Dorothy is briefly reunited with Scarecrow before he is turned into an ornament by the Nome King. He gives each of the group three attempts to identify which ornament in his large collection is Scarecrow; the Gump, Jack and Tik-Tok all fail and are turned into ornaments themselves. Before Dorothy begins her turn, The Nome King reveals to her he has her lost [[ruby slippers]], which he had used to conquer Oz, and offers to use them to send her home instead. Dorothy refuses and goes to find her companions while Mombi arrives at the mountain.\n\nWith her last guess, Dorothy turns a green gem into Scarecrow and realizes people from Oz turn into green objects. She proceeds to find and restore Jack and the Gump, enraging the Nome King who imprisons Mombi in a cage for allowing Dorothy's escape. He then grows to a gigantic size and prepares to eat Jack when Billina, hiding in Jack's head, lays an egg that falls into the Nome King's mouth, fatally poisoning him. Dorothy retrieves the ruby slippers and hurriedly puts them on as the ornament room and all of the subterranean Nome kingdom collapses. She wishes for the group to be returned to a restored Emerald City, where they find a green medal on Gump's antler that Dorothy restores into Tik-Tok.\n\nThe people of Oz ask Dorothy to be their Queen, but she expresses her desire to return home. [[Princess Ozma]] - the girl from the sanitarium and rightful ruler of Oz - is freed from the mirror Mombi imprisoned her in and ascends the throne. Ozma receives the ruby slippers from Dorothy and uses them to send Dorothy home, promising she can return if she ever wishes it, while Billina chooses to stay in Oz. Dorothy is found by her family on a riverbank in Kansas and Aunt Em tells her the clinic was struck by lightning and burned down; everyone survived except Worley, who died trying to save his machines. Dorothy returns home and sees Billina and Ozma through her bedroom mirror; she calls out for Aunt Em, but they signal for her to keep Oz a secret.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Nicol Williamson]] as Dr. J.B.

Murch told Wilhite he was interested in making an ''Oz'' film and Wilhite \"sort of straightened up in his chair\". Unbeknownst to Murch, Disney owned the rights to the ''Oz'' series and wanted to make a new film as the [[copyright]] was soon to expire.<ref name=\"murchinterview\">{{cite news|url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/ffc/2012/05/a-conversation-ffc-interviews-walter-murch.html|title=A Conversation with Walter Murch|last=Chambers|first=Bill|date=May 9, 2000|work=Film Freak Central|access-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> In September 1981, Disney president [[Ron W. Miller]] announced that the studio would be making the film, not as a sequel or continuation of the 1939 movie, but instead an entirely new story with a different look to the original film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3900AAAAIBAJ&pg=PA147&dq=return+to+oz&pg=4091,1500411&hl=en |title=Disney crews plan next 'Oz' film release |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |page=147 |date=18 September 1981}}</ref>\n\n''Return to Oz'' is based on the second and third ''Oz'' books, ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'' (1904) and ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (1907). The element about [[Tik-Tok (Oz)|Tik-Tok]] being \"The Royal Army of Oz\" derives from ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'' (1914), in which he is made the Royal Army of [[Oogaboo]] and also makes frequent cries of \"Pick me up!\" That book was itself based on a dramatic production, ''[[The Tik-Tok Man of Oz]]'' (1913). Murch also used the book ''[[Wisconsin Death Trip]]'' as a historical source for the film.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film | author=Ondaatje, Michael | year=2002 | page=6}}</ref> Murch co-wrote the screenplay with Gill Dennis, intentionally writing a film that was unlike the original to avoid accusations of blasphemy. Executive Producer [[Gary Kurtz]] noted, \"We're not trying to make a sequel, although technically the books are sequels to each other\", suggesting that the movie would be more faithful to the books than the 1939 film was.<ref name=\"thesun_28jul84\"/>\n\nMurch took a darker take on Baum's source material than the 1939 adaptation, which he knew would be a gamble. Between the development period and actual shooting, there was a change of leadership at the Walt Disney studios (with Wilhite replaced by Richard Berger), and the film's budget increased.<ref name=\"lakelandledger\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=rwEhk56xNqMC&dat=19850623&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search|website=News.google.com}}</ref> Despite an original $20 million budget, this eventually rose to $28 million.<ref name=\"hj21jun85\"/>\n\nThe film was developed and produced without the involvement of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], the studio behind the 1939 film. No approval was necessary because, by 1985, the ''Oz'' books on which it was based were in the [[public domain]], and the subsequent ''Oz'' books had been optioned to Disney many years earlier.{{sfn|Arnold|2013|p=537}} The [[ruby slippers]] were created by MGM specifically for the 1939 film to replace the [[Silver Shoes]] of the original stories{{sfn|Wolf|2016|p=186}} and, as the slippers remained MGM's [[intellectual property]], a fee was paid.{{sfn|Arnold|2013|p=537}} Another carry-over from the 1939 film was the framework in which real characters from Kansas reappeared in Oz, which Murch kept in order to keep harmony between the two films.<ref name=\"hj21jun85\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Fairuza Balk]] was one of 600 from Vancouver chosen to audition for the role of Dorothy.

There was a gap of several months between Ridley filming the Kansas scenes to the Oz scenes.{{sfn|Norman|2017|p=216}} Ridley, who was born in London, had her voice in the film dubbed by Beatrice Murch, daughter of Walter Murch, so that the character of Ozma would have an American-sounding voice.<ref name=\"ridley_interview_2015\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkMNzUtF4ds |title=Return to Oz - Emma Ridley \"Ozma\" Interview by Ryan Jay |website=[[YouTube]] |date=September 2015 |access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Leo McKern]] and [[Christopher Lloyd]] were each considered for the role of Dr. J.B.

Cages were tagged with the chicken's purpose, including perch, sit, carry and run to name a few, as well as chickens that would attack and others to run towards cast members. As Balk's small arms could not handle carrying a full-size chicken, a smaller one was used for those scenes.{{sfn|Orlean|1984|p=9}} A mechanical chicken was also used for certain scenes, at times behaving so similar to a real chicken that crew in the screening room were unable to tell the difference.{{sfn|Orlean|1984|p=10}} The dog playing the role of Toto was Tansy, a brown-eyed [[border terrier]] family pet.

Five weeks into production, Disney was unhappy with the footage.<ref name=\"murchinterview\" /> By then, mostly the Kansas scenes had been shot; however, Murch was looking unwell and was fired from the role without protestation. Murch later recalled the experience, saying \"had I fought back... they might have said OK, but I couldn't fight back. I felt what the soul feels after it's left the body after a car accident \u2014 pain but tremendous relief.\"<ref name=\"hj21jun85\"/> High-profile film-makers including [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] supported Murch in discussions with the studio, and Murch was reinstated and finished the film.<ref name=\"murchinterview\" /><ref name=\"lakelandledger\" /> Lucas guaranteed that he would step in as replacement if any further problems emerged.<ref name=\"murchinterview\" />\n\nBalk and Ridley, the only two child actors on set, had limited working hours per day.

When interviewed in 2020, director and animator Doug Aberle explained the process involved in animating the Nome King and other characters with clay, including the technical difficulties encountered. Each section, such as the outside rocks with faces on, was allocated to an animator. Nome King scenes in the throne room were animated progressively, with the character initially made entirely of clay, progressing gradually closer to human form until finally portrayed by Nicol Williamson in live action. Towards the end of the film when the Nome King crumbles, Aberle explains how it took him four attempts to animate this accurately.<ref name=\"aberle_interview_2020\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TB4JOyK0Ts |title=Return to Oz : I Killed The Nome King : Claymation Documentary 2020 Edition : Doug Aberle |website=[[YouTube]] |date=March 2020 |access-date=1 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Emerald City]] scenes towards the end of film had to be fully reshot, as the character of Ozma was originally dressed in a gold lace dress which was deemed unsuitable during post-production.
