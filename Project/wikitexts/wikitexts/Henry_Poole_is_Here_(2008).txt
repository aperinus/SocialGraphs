The screenplay by Albert Torres focuses on a dying man whose religious neighbor insists the water stain on the side wall of his house is an image of [[Jesus Christ]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] before going into limited release in the US on August 15.\n\n==Plot==\nHaving been diagnosed as [[terminal disease|terminally ill]], Henry Poole purchases a [[Tract housing|tract house]] in his hometown, a [[working class]] suburb of [[Los Angeles]], and awaits the inevitable, fortified with whiskey and frozen pizza. His peaceful solitude and self-imposed exile are disrupted by his meddling neighbor Esperanza Martinez, who insists she sees the face of [[Christ]] embedded in the stucco wall of his home and is convinced the image has miraculous powers when it begins to exude drops of blood. Before long, she is leading pilgrimages to his backyard and inviting Father Salazar from the local parish to bless the supposedly sacrosanct blemish.  To Henry the image is a water stain.\n\nIn addition to dealing with Esperanza, Henry finds himself interacting with Dawn and her taciturn six-year-old daughter Millie, who hasn't spoken a word since her father abandoned the family a year earlier. Dawn becomes convinced of the image's healing powers when Millie begins to talk after touching it. Another disciple is supermarket cashier Patience, who wears thick glasses and discovers her vision is perfect after she too comes in contact with the stain.\n\nWhen Henry learns that Millie has gone silent after learning of his terminal illness while eavesdropping on his conversation with her mother, he resolves to remove the stain and disabuse the faithful of what he believes to be misplaced belief. Henry destroys the image with an axe and in the process destroys his house. With the structure weakened, a corner of the house collapses on him.\n\nThe film ends with Henry recovering in the hospital. Upon awakening in his hospital bed, he is greeted by Esperanza, Dawn and a talking Millie, who inform him that he is no longer ill. Surprised and rejuvenated, he finds himself ready to accept hope and belief and even the possibility of miracles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Henry Poole\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Dawn Stupek\n* [[Adriana Barraza]] as Esperanza Martinez\n* [[George Lopez]] as Father Salazar\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] as Meg Wyatt\n* [[Richard Benjamin]] as Dr. Fancher\n* [[Morgan Lily]] as Millie Stupek - Age 8\n* Rachel Seiferth as Patience\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Josie\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[La Mirada, California]].\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] includes \"[[Not Dark Yet]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]], \"Song 2\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]], \"Promises\" by [[Badly Drawn Boy]] and \"All roads lead home\" by [[Golden State (band)|Golden State]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally negative reviews. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"traffics in the kind of inspirational [[kitsch]] that only a true believer could swallow\" and added, \"Mr. Wilson offers a credible portrait of an angry, despairing man fending off a cult. But the film\u2019s spiritual deck is stacked. In the mawkish tradition of movies like ''[[Simon Birch]]'', ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]'', ''[[August Rush]]'', and ''[[Hearts in Atlantis (film)|Hearts in Atlantis]]'', ''Henry Poole Is Here'' is insufferable hokum that takes itself very, very seriously.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/movies/15pool.html ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film 3\u00bd out of four stars and said it \"achieves something that is uncommonly difficult. It is a spiritual movie with the power to emotionally touch believers, [[agnosticism|agnostics]] and [[atheism|atheists]] - in that descending order, I suspect. It doesn't say that religious beliefs are real. It simply says that belief is real. And it's a warm-hearted love story . . . I fell for it.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080814/REVIEWS/808140303/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\nReyhan Harmanci of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it \"a strange and thoughtful little movie\" and added, \"The film manages to be successfully character-driven, but the characters ride on a flimsy plot.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/15/DDEF12943K.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nSteve Persall of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' graded the film C- and commented, \"''Henry Poole Is Here'' is aimed at the [[Bible]] bunch, who will be more tolerant of its oversimplification of theological mystery. They'll see Henry as a lost soul resisting [[Christianity|Christian]] power until that becomes impossible, then sing praises when it does. But that doesn't change the fact that Pellington's movie is draggy-dull and a bit annoying with its piety. Hollywood still does sin much better than salvation.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article768316.ece |title=''St. Petersburg Times'' review |access-date=2008-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302045103/http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/article768316.ece |archive-date=2012-03-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nJosh Rosenblatt of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' rated the film 1\u00bd stars and asserted \"good old disturbing Pellington has officially gone soft. Though his latest, ''Henry Poole Is Here'', is full of all his usual ultrastylized, ultradark visual experimentation \u2013 an aesthetic that makes viewers feel like they\u2019re drowning in an ocean of uncomfortable childhood memories \u2013 its story couldn\u2019t be more corny, redemptive, or inspirational . . . I don\u2019t know if Pellington found religion recently, but I do know you have to wonder about the artistic health and decision-making abilities of any filmmaker who looks for divinity in shots of sunlight pouring out from behind clouds. All that\u2019s missing from the director\u2019s new vision of the world is the pipe organ and the choir of angels.\"<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A660520 ''Austin Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nRobert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, \"Because it's billed as a more personal project for Mark Pellington after a string of interesting, idiosyncratic thrillers (''[[Arlington Road]]'', ''[[The Mothman Prophecies (film)|The Mothman Prophecies]]''), ''Henry Poole Is Here'' is all the more disappointing. [Its] tendency to lecture on the power of faith and religion and on the demerits of science seems to assume an almost childlike audience that needs to be spoon-fed [[Pablum]]. This tale . . . won't advance the profile of the always-likable Luke Wilson, and Christian moviegoers will have to show up in great numbers to keep the film from being doomed to something far less than [[Sleeper hit|sleeper]] status.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=review&id=2478&reviewid=VE1117935898&cs=1 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 39% based on 92 reviews; the average rating is 5.2.  The consensus reads: \"Full of Hallmark-truisms and pop songs presented with strained significance, this comic foible intends less to convert than to preach to the choir.\"<ref>{{Citation\n| url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/henry_poole_is_here\n| title = Henry Poole is Here\n| accessdate = 2017-02-09\n| publisher  = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Adriana Barraza]] won the [https://movieguideawards.com/2009-movieguide-awards-winners/ Grace Award for Movies] for her work on the film at the [https://movieguideawards.com/ 2009 Movieguide Awards].\n\n==DVD release==\n[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] released the film on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] on January 20, 2009.
