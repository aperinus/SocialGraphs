The story centers on a suburban family and the experiences they endure from a possessed dog that they innocently adopt. The film stars [[Richard Crenna]] as Mike Barry, the father; [[Yvette Mimieux]] as Betty, the mother; and [[Kim Richards]] and [[Ike Eisenmann]] as Bonnie and Charlie, their children. The two child actors previously played siblings in the ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Witch Mountain]]'' films from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe Barry family acquire a [[German Shepherd]] puppy after their old one dies in an accident. They buy the puppy from a seemingly friendly fruit vendor who is actually a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] who bred the dog during an evil ceremony, causing it to be [[Demonic possession|possessed]]. The satanic cult then gives away the dog's offspring in order to wreak havoc in the world in the hope that Satan will overcome good once and for all.\n\nThe dog acts very strangely when they bring it home, leading the father, Mike, and the family maid to believe that there is something wrong with it. Mike starts to believe so after the maid is killed in a [[fire]] while she was watching the dog and he is nearly forced to stick his arm into a lawnmower while it is running and the dog is present. Mike barely avoids having his arm cut off and soon the dog begins to exhibit mind control powers that allow it to kill, injure or mentally control many victims. Eventually, the family's souls are possessed by the dog causing them to act strangely, including Mike's son framing another student by stealing a watch and planting it in a classmate's locker, thus allowing him to win the student election.\n\nMike finally decides that the dog has overstayed its welcome when he finds a secret shrine to Satan in the attic. Mike tries to shoot the demonic beast to put an end to the hardships, but it is unharmed. Realizing that the dog is possessed, Mike finally makes a special trip to Ecuador to determine how to destroy the animal. Unfortunately, there is no way to kill it, but if you hold a holy symbol to its eye, you can imprison it in Hell for 1,000 years. He takes it to a showdown at his work plant, but there the dog turns into a demonic version of itself and begins to wreak havoc. When he is cornered by the beast, he holds the sign he made on his hand right up to the beast's eye. This causes the beast to be engulfed in fire and imprisoned, getting his family's souls back.\n\nThe final scene shows the family loading the family car for a vacation and Mike's son mentioning that there were 10 puppies that the vendor was selling and wondering where the other nine are, suggesting that there are more Satanic dogs out there somewhere and that it is not over yet.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Mike Barry\n* [[Yvette Mimieux]] as Betty Barry\n* [[Kim Richards]] as Bonnie Barry\n* [[Ike Eisenmann]] as Charlie Barry (as Ike Eisenman)\n* Tina Menard as Maria\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Shaman\n* [[Lou Frizzell]] as George\n* [[Ken Kercheval]] as Miles Amory\n* [[R.G.
