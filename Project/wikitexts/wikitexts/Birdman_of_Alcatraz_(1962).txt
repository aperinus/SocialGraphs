A [[federal prison]] [[inmate]], he became known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" because of his studies of birds, which had taken place when he was incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Prison]].

Gaddis]]. It was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] ([[Burt Lancaster]]), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] ([[Telly Savalas]]), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] ([[Thelma Ritter]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black-and-White]].\n\n==Plot==\nRobert Stroud is imprisoned as a young man for committing a murder in [[Alaska]]. He is shown as a rebellious inmate, fighting against a rigid prison system: while being transported with other prisoners by train, he breaks open the window to allow the suffocating inmates to breathe.\n\nHe comes into conflict with Harvey Shoemaker, warden of [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Prison]].\n\nWhile in jail, Stroud learns that his mother tried to visit him but was denied and told to return later in the week. Outraged, he attacks a guard, fatally stabbing him. Stroud is sentenced to death, but his mother runs a successful campaign to have his sentence commuted to [[life in prison]]. The sentence requires him to serve in [[solitary confinement]] for the rest of his life.\n\nWhile in the exercise yard during a heavy rainstorm, Stroud finds a downed nest holding an orphaned baby [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]. He takes care of the bird, and starts a trend. He and other convicts acquire and care for birds, such as [[Domestic Canary|canaries]], given from outside sources.\n\nStroud develops a collection of birds and cages. When the birds fall ill, he conducts experiments and comes up with a cure. As the years pass, Stroud becomes an expert on bird diseases and publishes a book on the subject. His writings are so impressive that a doctor describes him as a \"genius\".\n\nStroud is later visited by bird-lover Stella Johnson and agrees to go into business, marketing his bird remedies. He and Stella later marry, but his mother disapproves. This causes a permanent rift between mother and son and further disowns him by refusing to support his release petition. He is abruptly transferred to the federal [[Prison|penitentiary]] at [[Alcatraz]], a new maximum-security institution where he is not permitted to keep birds. Although growing elderly, he remains independent, writing a history of the U.S. penal system that is suppressed by Shoemaker, now warden of the Rock.\n\nStill at odds with authority, Stroud helps end a [[Battle of Alcatraz|prison rebellion in 1946]] by throwing out the two firearms acquired by the convicts. He assures the authorities that they can now re-enter the premises without risk of being shot. Shoemaker acknowledges Stroud never lied to him and takes him at his word.\n\nAfter a petition campaign by admirers, Stroud is eventually transferred to another prison in [[Missouri]]. During the move, he meets several reporters and displays a range of knowledge on more than just birds, such as the technical details of a passing jet aircraft. He meets author [[Thomas E. Gaddis]], who wrote a book based on his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as [[Robert Stroud]]\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Harvey Shoemaker\n* [[Thelma Ritter]] as Elizabeth McCartney Stroud\n* [[Neville Brand]] as Bull Ransom\n* [[Betty Field]] as Stella Johnson\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as Feto Gomez\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as [[Thomas E.

Bennett]], director of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. During a visit to Washington in July 1961, Gaddis was unsuccessful in trying to meet with Bennett, given Bennett's views on the film which he deplored because \"it is simply not our policy to glamorize criminals\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_tEiAAAAIBAJ&pg=3814,3335255&hl=en |title='Birdman' Needs Wings Of An Angel |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |page=8 |date=July 18, 1961}}</ref> Bennett approached [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], the studio which had optioned the book, and told them he did not want the film to be produced, in response to which the studio ended their involvement.

Lancaster advised that on some days, they would \"get a scene with the birds right off\", yet other times it may take an entire day, suggesting that the short concentration span of the birds would mean they could entirely forget what they needed to do and therefore had to be retrained.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L8UwAAAAIBAJ&pg=7454,513407&hl=en |title='Birdman of Alcatraz' Shown in N.Y. to Critics |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |page=16 |date=May 3, 1962}}</ref> Hollywood animal trainer Ray D.

When in [[San Francisco]] at the [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]], he invited questions from journalists about Robert Stroud. At the press conference, Lancaster made his views clear that he believed Stroud should be released, even offering to visit Washington to try and use his influence to help the cause. When asked by an interviewer if some of the film's profits would be used to help fund Stroud's release, Lancaster shouted at him, \"You're nothing but a ****, a ****.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bphlAAAAIBAJ&pg=2113,6024107&hl=en |title=Elvis Presley: Hollywood's Politest Heart-Throb |newspaper=The Sun |page=57 |date=February 23, 1963}}</ref>\n\nWarden James F. Maroney declined United Artists' invitation to show the film in Alcatraz to inmates, after a special screening was set up for him and three of his staff. In explaining his reasons, Maroney said that \"prison life is always fascinating to people who never have been confined in a prison.\" He went on to say that he and his staff \"found the film interesting and occasionally, but not always, realistic\", but suggested that the inmates would prefer to watch entertainment that distracts them from their environment, rather than one which reminds them of their current one.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ptRAAAAIBAJ&pg=4744,3642298&hl=en |title=Warden Bans Pen Showing Of 'Birdman' |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |page=6 |date=July 28, 1962}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical release==\nThe film opened at theaters on August 8, 1962.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T_9VAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA5&pg=6731,3558989 |title='Birdman' Film to open Aug 8 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |page=5 |date=July 20, 1962}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 91% of 23 surveyed critics, both contemporaneous and modern, gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.3/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birdman_of_alcatraz/|title=Birdman of Alcatraz (1962)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2021-12-28}}</ref> One of the first critic's reviews of the film by Philip K.
