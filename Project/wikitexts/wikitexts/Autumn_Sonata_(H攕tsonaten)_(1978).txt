Its plot follows a celebrated classical pianist and her neglected daughter who meet for the first time in years, and chronicles their painful discussions of how they have hurt each other. It was the first and only collaboration by Ingrid Bergman and Ingmar Bergman.\n\n''Autumn Sonata'' was the last of Ingmar Bergman's films to be made for theatrical exhibition; all of his films made after it, even those screened in theatres, were television productions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nehme|first1=Farran Smith|title=''Autumn Sonata'': Mothers, Daughters, and Monsters|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2900-autumn-sonata-mothers-daughters-and-monsters|website=The Criterion Collection|access-date=21 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEva ([[Liv Ullmann]]), wife of the village pastor, invites her mother Charlotte ([[Ingrid Bergman]]) for a visit to her village. She has not seen her for over seven years. Her mother is a world-renowned pianist, somewhat eccentric, aging, and has survived several husbands. Eva is not as talented as the mother (despite the fact that she has written two books and plays the piano passably). Eva's main concern is to be the mistress of her home, wife, mother, and loving sister. It is gradually learned through her dialogue with her mother that her life has had a large number of unfortunate setbacks: a husband Viktor ([[Halvar Bj\u00f6rk]]) she respects, but does not really have affection for, their son Erik who drowned when only 4 years old, and Charlotte never appears to have loved Eva as a mother normally loves a daughter. As part of her day-to-day life, Eva takes care of her disabled and paralyzed sister Helena (Lena Nyman), whom she has taken out of the hospital into her own home. She appears to be the only person who can understand her sister's limited speech ability.\n\nThe presence of Helena in Eva's house is shocking to the aging mother. She makes a gift of her own wrist watch to Helena, and listens to Eva playing Prelude No. 2 in A minor by Chopin. She immediately re-performs the same prelude after Eva finishes in her own preferred interpretation of the music. Before going to bed, Charlotte decides to make a gift of her own car to her daughter. She plans to take a flight home, and buy a new car for herself, as a measure of her altruism. At night, Charlotte wakes up from a nightmare: it seems that Eva is choking her. She gets up, goes into the living room followed by Eva, who had heard her mother screaming from the nightmare.\n\nMother and daughter begin an impassioned rediscovery and clarification of their past relationship. Eva's husband overhears this unexpectedly heightened exchange, but wisely decides not to participate and interfere. Hearing this impassioned exchange, her disabled younger sister painfully forces herself out of her bed and starts crawling up to the stairs to where Eva and Charlotte are arguing. Upon reaching the landing she starts shouting, \"Mama, come!\"\n\nIn the morning Charlotte prepares for her departure. Eva goes to the grave of her departed son, and her husband ineffectively tries to soothe her ailing sister. Charlotte asks for a friend to escort her away by train. While speaking to her agent Paul on the train, she begins to question the unfortunate fate of her disabled and paralyzed daughter, asking the unanswerable question: \"Why couldn't she die?\" Her older daughter sends her mother a letter starting with: \"I realize that I wronged you.\" The mother apparently reads the letter that concludes by leaving open the possibility of a future reconciliation, though the closing shot is of Viktor putting the letter in the envelope, leaving the possibility that he, or Eva, merely envisioned Charlotte reading the letter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Charlotte Andergast\n* [[Liv Ullmann]] as Eva\n* [[Lena Nyman]] as Helena\n* [[Halvar Bj\u00f6rk]] as Viktor\n* [[Marianne Aminoff]] as Charlotte's private secretary\n* [[Arne Bang-Hansen]] as Uncle Otto\n* [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] as Paul\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Josef\n* [[Georg L\u00f8kkeberg]] as Leonardo\n* [[Mimi Pollak]] as Piano instructor\n* [[Linn Ullmann]] as Eva as a child\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDue to his [[Ingmar Bergman#Tax evasion charges in 1976|battle with the Swedish tax authorities]] at the time,{{refn|''Autumn Sonata'' is the second of Bergman's three films produced during his exile from Sweden, after 1977's ''[[The Serpent's Egg (film)|The Serpent's Egg]]'' and before 1980's ''[[From the Life of the Marionettes]]''.|group=\"n\"}} Ingmar Bergman produced ''Autumn Sonata'' through his [[West Germany|West German]] company, Personafilm GmbH, with main financing from [[Lew Grade]]'s British [[ITC Entertainment|ITC Film]], and shot the film in an old film studio outside [[Oslo]] in [[Norway]].<ref>[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=DEFE2B4E-8969-46CA-B3DC-48FF87E90921&LanCD=EN Ingmar Bergman Face to Face: ''Autumn Sonata - Shooting the film''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929212624/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=DEFE2B4E-8969-46CA-B3DC-48FF87E90921&LanCD=EN |date=29 September 2011 }} Retrieved 2011-07-11</ref> Although formally a German production (with the German title, ''Herbstsonate'', being the official original title), the dialogue is in Swedish, most of the crew and actors were Swedish,<ref>[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/castcredits.asp?guid=4B2886FC-C3CE-49FA-AD3F-25A34A851547 Ingmar Bergman Face to Face: ''Autumn Sonata - Cast and credits''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929212715/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/castcredits.asp?guid=4B2886FC-C3CE-49FA-AD3F-25A34A851547 |date=29 September 2011 }} Retrieved 2011-07-11</ref> and the world premiere was in Stockholm.<ref>[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=F839483A-256D-4D65-8F60-7C5D34E273B1 Ingmar Bergman Face to Face: ''Autumn Sonata - Film facts''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929212809/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/page.asp?guid=F839483A-256D-4D65-8F60-7C5D34E273B1 |date=29 September 2011 }} Retrieved 2011-07-11</ref>\n\nPeter Cowie in the notes to the Criterion DVD edition of the film summarizes the production, stating: \"Shot in Norway, with British and American backing, and featuring Swedish dialogue, ''Autumn Sonata'' emerged from one of the darkest spells in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s life.
