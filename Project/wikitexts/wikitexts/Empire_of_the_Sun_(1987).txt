After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japan begins occupying the settlement. As the Graham family evacuate the city, Jamie is separated from his parents in the ensuing chaos. Jamie makes his way back to their house, assuming they will return. After a length of time alone and having eaten the little remaining food, he ventures back into the city.\n\nHungry, Jamie tries surrendering to Japanese soldiers, who ignore him. After being chased by a street [[Street children|urchin]], he is taken in by two American [[expatriate]]s and [[Con man|hustlers]], Basie and Frank. Unable to sell Jamie for money, they intend to abandon him in the streets, but Jamie offers to lead them to his [[neighbourhood]] to [[looting|loot]] the empty houses there. Jamie is surprised to see lights on in his family home and thinks his parents have returned, only to discover it is occupied by Japanese troops. The trio are taken prisoner, transported to the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre]] in Shanghai for processing, and ultimately sent to an [[internment camp]] in [[Suzhou]].\n\nIt is now 1945, nearing the end of the [[Pacific War]]. Despite the terror and poor living conditions of the camp, Jim survives by establishing a successful trading network\u2014which even involves the camp's commander, Sergeant Nagata. Dr Rawlins, the camp's British doctor, becomes a father figure and teacher to Jim. Jim also visits Basie in the American POW barracks, where he idolises the Americans and their culture. One night after a bombing raid, Nagata orders the destruction of the prisoners' infirmary as a reprisal, but stops when Jim eloquently begs forgiveness. Through the barbed wire fencing Jim befriends a Japanese teenager who is a trainee pilot.\n\nOne morning, at dawn, the base is suddenly attacked by a group of American [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighter aircraft. Jim is overjoyed and climbs the ruins of a nearby pagoda to better watch the action.\n\nDr Rawlins chases Jim up the pagoda to save him, whereupon the boy breaks down in tears\u2014saying he cannot remember what his parents look like. As a result of the attack the Japanese decide to evacuate the camp. Basie escapes during the confusion. As they leave, Jim's trainee pilot friend goes through the ritual kamikaze preparation and attempts to take off in a Japanese attack plane. The trainee is devastated when the engine sputters and dies.\n\nThe camp prisoners march through the wilderness, where many die from fatigue, starvation and disease. Arriving at a football stadium near [[Nantao]], where many of the Shanghai inhabitants' possessions have been stored by the Japanese, Jim recognises his parents' [[Packard]] car. He spends the night there with Mrs Victor, a fellow prisoner who dies shortly thereafter, and later witnesses flashes from the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] hundreds of miles away.\n\nJim wanders back to the Suzhou camp. Along the way he hears news of [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] and the war's end. He is reunited with the now-disillusioned Japanese teenager, who remembers Jim and offers him a mango, drawing his [[gunt\u014d]] to cut it. Basie re-appears with a group of armed Americans to loot the [[Red Cross]] containers being airdropped over the area. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Basie offers to help Jim find his parents but Jim\u2014infuriated over his friend's death\u2014chooses to stay behind.\n\nJim is eventually found by American soldiers and placed in an orphanage, where he is reunited with his mother and father, though he does not recognise them at first.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ch Bale 02.jpg|180px|[[Christian Bale]], pictured here in 1988, played Jamie \"Jim\" Graham.|thumb|right]]\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Jamie \"Jim\" Graham\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Basie\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Mrs. Victor\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Dr Rawlins\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Frank Demarest\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] as Maxton\n* [[Masat\u014d Ibu]] as Sergeant Nagata ([[Nihongo|Japanese]]: \u6c38\u7530\u8ecd\u66f9, ''Nagata Guns\u014d'') \n* [[Emily Richard]] as Mary Graham, Jim's Mother\n* [[Rupert Frazer]] as John Graham, Jim's Father\n* Peter Gale as Mr. Victor\n* Takatar\u00f4 Kataoka as Kamikaze Boy Pilot\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Dainty\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as Mr. Lockwood\n* [[Guts Ishimatsu]] as Sergeant Uchida ([[Nihongo|Japanese]]: \u5185\u7530\u8ecd\u66f9, ''Uchida Guns\u014d'')\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as Mr. Chen\n* [[Paul McGann]] as Lieutenant Price\n* [[Marc de Jonge]] as Mathieu\n* [[Eric Flynn]] as British Prisoner #1\n* [[James Greene (Northern Irish actor)|James Greene]] as British Prisoner #2\n* [[Paula Hamilton]] as British Prisoner #5\n* [[Tony Boncza]] as British Prisoner #7\n* [[Peter Copley]] as British Prisoner #10\n}}\nAuthor [[J.

One thing there was no doubt about, and that was that the Japanese were extremely brave. One had very complicated views about patriotism [and] loyalty to one's own nation. Jim is constantly identifying himself, first with the Japanese; then, when the Americans start flying over in their [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]], he's very drawn to the American.\"<ref name=\"faber\" />\n\nThe apocalyptic wartime setting and the [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] moment when Jim sees the distant white flash of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] gave Spielberg powerful visual metaphors \"to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy's innocence and the death of the innocence of the entire world\".<ref>[[#refMcBride1997|McBride 1997]], p. 393.</ref> Spielberg reflected he \"was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an [[attenuation]] of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody's impression of me is what my life has been. This was the opposite of [[Peter Pan]]. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly.\"<ref name=\"child\" /> Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in ''Empire of the Sun'', include a child being separated from his parents (''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''){{#tag:ref|Film historian and author Kowalski collectively links these films as Spielberg's \"family\" or conversely, as his \"displaced father\" films.<ref name=\"Kowalski\"/>|group=N}} and World War II (''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'').<ref name=\"Kowalski\">[[#refKowalski2008|Kowalski 2008]], pp. 35, 67.</ref> Spielberg explained \"My parents got a divorce when I was 14, 15.
