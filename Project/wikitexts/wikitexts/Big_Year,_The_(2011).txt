''The Big Year'' was directed by [[David Frankel]] and written by [[Howard Franklin]]. It was based on the 2004 nonfiction book ''The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl Obsession'' by Mark Obmascik. The book followed three men on a quest for a [[Big year|Big Year]] - a competition among [[birders]] to see who can see and identify the greatest number of species of birds in North America (north of Mexico) in a calendar year. The actual men were Sandy Komito, Al Levantin, and Greg Miller, who were chasing Komito's prior record.  The film uses the same premise with fictional characters.\n\nThe film was released on October 14, 2011, in the United States.<ref name=\"TBYRef1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/movie/the-big-year |title=The Big Year (2011) |access-date=March 3, 2011 |work=MovieWeb}}</ref> Filming took place from May to July 2010.<ref name=\"TBYRef2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=64108 |title=The Big Year - Movie Database |access-date=March 3, 2011 |work=CraveOnline Media}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on December 2, 2011.<ref name=\"TBYRef4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1053810/releaseinfo |title=The Big Year (2011) |access-date=March 3, 2010 |work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows three seasoned birders who each set out to achieve a Big Year. They are Brad Harris, a 36-year-old computer programmer based in [[Baltimore]]; Stu Preissler, founder and CEO of a [[New York City|New York]] company bearing his name; and a roofing contractor named Kenny Bostick, who holds the current Big Year record of 732 birds.\n\nBostick is obsessively possessive of his record, but his third wife Jessica is concerned; this was supposed to be the year they focused on conceiving a child. She also believes that Bostick's birding obsession is what destroyed his two previous marriages.<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/movies/the-big-year-with-owen-wilson-and-steve-martin-review.html|title=Movie review: 'The Big Year'|last=Scott|first=A. O.|date=October 13, 2011|work=New York Times|access-date=10 October 2013}}</ref> He is so competitive that the others use his name as a kind of expletive: \"Bostick!\"\n\nBrad is a skilled birder who can identify nearly any species solely by sound. He hates his job maintaining the operational software of a nuclear power plant in [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania]]. Living with his parents after a failed marriage, an aborted career at Dell, and dropping out of grad school, he hopes that doing a Big Year will give him a sense of purpose and possibly even make his father proud of him.<ref name = \"McCarthy\" />\n\nStu is the founder and CEO of an enormous Manhattan-based chemical conglomerate which he built from the ground up, starting in his garage. After decades of corporate success, he is ready to retire to Colorado with his architect wife. Fear of an empty schedule led him to come back from a previous retirement, but now he wants to leave his company in the hands of his two lieutenants. The company is in the middle of complicated negotiations to merge with a competitor, so his two anointed successors keep calling him back to New York for important meetings; to some extent he is a prisoner of his own success.<ref name = \"Scott\" /> A Big Year has been his lifelong dream and he's pursuing it with the full support of his wife.\n\nThe movie portrays various incidents that take place during the Big Year event, while the trio compete with each other and many other birders to achieve the world record of sighting the highest number of birds. Brad and Stu become friends and help each other in the competition, and Brad is attracted to a fellow birder, Ellie. Meanwhile, the highly competitive Bostick resorts to dirty tricks to boost his own count while undermining the others.\n\nAs the year draws to a close, Stu is happily retired and enjoying his newborn grandson; Brad develops a relationship with Ellie; and Bostick is alone, as his wife has left him. Stu and Brad, now close friends, congratulate each other on \"a very big year\", after each sighting 700+ bird species that year. When the Big Year results are published, Bostick won the competition with 755, a new record; Brad came in second; Stu was fourth. Brad opines that \"he (Bostick) got more birds, but we got more everything,\" as he looks at Ellie, who has come for a weekend visit. Stu smiles, looking at his wife.\n\nThe film ends with Brad and Ellie birding together on a rocky coastline, while Brad confesses that birding is no longer the biggest part of his life. Stu is hiking with his toddler grandson (already enamored by birds) in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. Bostick is on a birding adventure in China, alone and gazing wistfully at a happy couple walking with their newborn child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n\n*[[Steve Martin]] as Stu Preissler\n*[[Jack Black]] as Brad Harris\n*[[Owen Wilson]] as Kenny Bostick\n*[[Rashida Jones]] as Ellie\n*[[Anjelica Huston]] as Annie Auklet\n*[[Jim Parsons]] as Crane\n*[[Rosamund Pike]] as Jessica\n*[[JoBeth Williams]] as Edith\n*[[Brian Dennehy]] as Raymond\n*[[Dianne Wiest]] as Brenda\n*[[Anthony Anderson]] as Bill Clemont\n*[[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Phil\n*[[Joel McHale]] as Barry Loomis\n*[[Calum Worthy]] as Colin Debs\n*Veena Sood as Nurse Katie\n*[[Corbin Bernsen]] as Gil Gordon\n*Stacey Scowley as Vicki\n*[[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Darren\n*[[Kevin Pollak]] as Jim Gittelson\n*[[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Dr. Neil Kramer\n*[[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Mike Shin\n*[[Al Roker]] as New York weatherman\n*[[John Cleese]] as narrator\n*[[June Squibb]] as the Old Lady \n*[[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] as Rick\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] was done from May 3 to July 30, 2010 in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfilmcommission.com/about_us/film_list.php|title=BCFC Film List|publisher=British Columbia Film Commission|date=October 2, 2011|access-date=October 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928104002/http://www.bcfilmcommission.com/about_us/film_list.php|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jack Black's fall on [[Attu Island]] was unscripted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20120112/OUTDOORS/701129934/1010&parentprofile=1010|title=Jack Black's Unscripted Fall Makes It Into Final Cut|date=January 12, 2012|access-date=January 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126170101/http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20120112/OUTDOORS/701129934/1010%26parentprofile%3D1010|archive-date=January 26, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{dubious|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
