The two releases are not unrelated. ''The Wonderful, Horrible life of Leni Riefenstahl'' was born from an idea of Riefenstahl herself, who, motivated by her old age and already working on her memoirs, decided to commission a documentary about her life.\n\nConcerned about being associated with the 'Nazi director', eighteen filmmakers declined the project, before M\u00fcller agreed to portray Riefenstahl in what ended up being a three-hour-long documentary (three times its contract length).\n\nThe length of the film is therefore the result of a decision by the director: M\u00fcller justifies it as an attempt to give a fair representation of Riefenstahl's life, which cannot be reduced to the eight years she worked for the Nazi regime, but presents much more interesting stories and facts that are relevant to understand her personality. Showing more historical material about her life, according to M\u00fcller, also helps to compensate the strong image of herself that Riefenstahl tries to impose throughout the movie, giving the viewer a better chance to draw their own conclusions. ''The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl'' encapsulates a historical figure at the end of her life. Through this film, it is shown how Riefenstahl dealt with the repercussions of her early work.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=June 2013}}\nThe film garnered a strong critical response. It currently has a 95% rating amongst critics cited on the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] film review website.<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wonderful_horrible_life_of_leni_riefenstahl/ The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (1993)] Rotten Tomatoes</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"This movie is fascinating in so many different ways: As the story of an extraordinary life, as the reconstruction of the career of one of the greatest of film artists, as the record of an ideological debate, as a portrait of an amazing old woman.\"    [[Roger Ebert]], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940624/REVIEWS/406240302/1023 The Wonderful Horrible Life Of Leni Riefenstahl (review)] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. June 24, 1994</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Consistently fascinating documentary... This very significant film is the fablelike story of a woman whose search for the ideal, not unlike Ms. Riefenstahl's search in a very different world, leads to disaster.\"    [[Vincent Canby]], ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D00E7DD1E3AF937A25753C1A965958260 Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (review)] ''New York Times''. October 14, 1993</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"A fascinating if irritating and ultimately unsatisfactory 1993 German documentary[...] It\u2019s important to know that this film was made at Riefenstahl\u2019s own instigation, clearly designed to accompany her then recently published autobiography, and that she had veto power over who would be interviewed (don\u2019t expect to see Susan Sontag here). Consequently this is more often self-portrait than portrait [...] [If] artistic integrity has nothing to do with humanity, this is the movie you\u2019ve been waiting for. Incidentally, the film\u2019s stupid title was coined strictly for the Anglo-American market; the original German title translates as \u201cLeni Riefenstahl: The Power of Images.\u201d\"\n[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], ''[[Chicago Reader]]''\n<ref>\n[https://jonathanrosenbaum.net/2020/01/the-wonderful-horrible-life-of-leni-riefenstahl/ The Wonderful Horrible Life Of Leni Riefenstahl (review)]\n''Chicago Reader'' (July 1, 1994)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Release and awards==\nBelgian, British, and German production companies financed the film and it was distributed by American, Japanese, Canadian, and French companies. It premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Festival of Festivals]] in September 1993, followed shortly thereafter at several American film festivals.\n\nWhen broadcast in the United States, the film received a primetime slot of 8:00pm on stations like [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]]. When televised in Germany and Austria, the film met opposition and wasn't aired until 11:00pm. It won an [[Emmy Award]] at the International Emmy Awards in 1993, for Arts Documentary. Ray M\u00fcller won the Golden Space Needle Award for best documentary at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] in 1994. The film is consistently found on \u201cbest documentary\u201d lists. In Germany, the Emmy win was rarely mentioned.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Starkman, Ruth. \"Mother of All Spectacles: Ray Muller's 'The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl'\", ''Film Quarterly'', Vol. 51, No. 2 (Winter, 1997\u20131998), pp.&nbsp;21\u201331.\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0107472}}\n\n{{Leni Riefenstahl}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, The}}\n[[Category:Documentary films about film directors and producers]]\n[[Category:German documentary films]]\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Leni Riefenstahl]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
