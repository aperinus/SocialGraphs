The plot details a New York City detective investigating a series of mysterious deaths connected to a disturbing website. Director Malone's second feature for [[Warner Bros.]] after the release of ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1999), ''FeardotCom'' was an international co-production among companies based in the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The film was shot on location in Luxembourg and [[Montreal]], Canada.\n\n''FeardotCom'' was released in the United States on August 30, 2002. ''FeardotCom'' received overwhelmingly negative reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic\" /><ref name=\"ebert\" /><ref name=\"nyt\" /> ''FeardotCom'' was also one of 22 films to receive an 'F' rating from audiences polled at [[CinemaScore]].<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" /> It grossed $18.9 million worldwide against its $40 million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\nMike Reilly is an [[NYPD]] detective who is called to the scene of a mysterious death in the subway system. The victim, Polidori, exhibits bleeding from his eyes and other orifices and, by the frozen look on his face, appears to have seen something horrifying before being hit by a train. Department of Health researcher Terry Huston is intrigued by the find as well, particularly when several more victims show up with identical symptoms.\n\nWhen a contagious virus is ruled out, Terry and Mike team up to discover what might be killing these people. Initially they are unable to find anything to connect the deaths together; after some more digging for clues, they eventually discover that all of the victims' computers crashed shortly before their passings. They send each of the victims' hard drives to Mike's friend, Denise Stone, who is a forensic specialist.\n\nDenise discovers that all of the victims had visited a website called Feardotcom.com, which depicts [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]] [[torture murder]]. Upon looking at the site herself, Denise is subjected to various sights and sounds of torture that eventually drive her insane, resulting in her falling to her death from her apartment window.\n\nMike feels guilty, thinking that he should have never gotten Denise involved in the case. Terry figures out that people who visit the website die within 48 hours, apparently from what they feared most in their lives. Despite such dangerous knowledge, both she and Mike visit the site in order to figure out what is happening.\n\nAs they begin to experience paranoia and hallucinations (like the deceased), including that of a young girl and her inflatable ball, they race against time to figure out if any of it has any connection to an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair Pratt, who has been eluding Mike and the FBI for years.\n\nIt is revealed that Feardotcom is, in fact, a ghost site made by one of Pratt's first victims, who is seeking revenge because people watched her being tortured and murdered. She was tortured by Pratt for 48 hours before she begged him to kill her, which explains why the victims have 48 hours to live. Mike and Terry track down Pratt and release the spirit of the murdered girl from the website, which kills Pratt. However, Mike is also killed by Pratt.\n\nThe ending scene shows Terry lying in her bed with her cat.  The phone rings but she hears no one on the line, only online static.  She hangs up and hugs the cat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Detective Mike Reilly\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Terry Huston\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Alistair Pratt\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Polidori\n* [[Amelia Curtis]] as Denise Stone\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Detective Sykes\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as Turnbull\n* Gesine Cukrowski as Jeannie Richardson\n* [[Michael Sarrazin]] as Frank Bryant\n* [[Anna Thalbach]] as Kate\n* Siobhan Flynn as Thana Brinkman\n* Joan McBride as Mrs. Richardson\n* [[Elizabeth McKechnie]] as Alice Turnbull\n* Arnita Swanson as Barlow\n* [[Gordon Peters]] as Rooney\n* Nils Brunkhorst as Prisoner\n* [[Sven Pippig]] as Henry\n* Anja Van Greuningen as Ashley\n* Anjelika Khromova as Ashley's Mother\n* [[Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer]] as Dieter Schrader\n* [[Birthe Wolter]] as Nina Blank\n}}\n\n==Production==\nMalone stated that his goal when agreeing to direct was to make the entire film look \"basically like a nightmare.\"{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}} Stephen Dorff was cast as the lead in the film, while Stephen Rea was cast as the villain based on Malone's appreciation of him as one of his \"favorite actors.\"{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}} Natascha McElhone was cast as the lead female role, and Malone stated in retrospect that he felt she had been miscast: \"I mean, I love[d] having her in the film, don't get me wrong, but the film should have been rewritten for her, instead of being written for somebody who was showing off how good she is at her job.
