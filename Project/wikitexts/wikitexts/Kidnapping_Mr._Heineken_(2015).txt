Looking for easy money, they decide to kidnap the [[Heineken International|Heineken]] owner and tycoon [[Freddy Heineken]] to achieve a very high [[ransom]]. Although capturing Heineken and his driver Ab Doderer successfully, the group eventually face difficulties due to a lack of experience in crime. They fail to negotiate with the police and Cor feels it is his duty to take care of his pregnant wife, Sonja. After Heineken is finally released by the police, Willem and Cor flee to [[Paris]], where they plan to remain hidden. However, Cor experiences strong emotions to telephone Sonja, a dangerous action that could easily reveal their location to the police tracing. He is initially reluctant and has arguments with Willem, but ultimately gives in to his feelings and calls Sonja, resulting in Cor and Willem being arrested by the French police when leaving their apartment. According to the final headline Freddy Heineken died in 2003; he actually died in 2002.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Freddy Heineken]]\n*[[Sam Worthington]] as [[Willem Holleeder]]\n*[[Jim Sturgess]] as [[Cor van Hout]]\n*[[Ryan Kwanten]] as Jan Boellard\n*[[Jemima West]] as Sonja Holleeder\n*[[Thomas Cocquerel]] as [[Martin Erkamps]]\n*[[Mark van Eeuwen]] as [[Frans Meijer (criminal)|Frans Meijer]]\n*[[David Dencik]] as Ab Doderer\n*[[Billy Slaughter]] as Junior Officer\n*[[Eric Godon]] as The cop\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in Belgium in October 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/jim-sturgess-sam-worthington-ryan-kwanten-joining-freddy-heineken-1200706440/|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Jim Sturgess, Sam Worthington, Ryan Kwanten Joining 'Freddy Heineken'|work=Variety|date=8 October 2013|accessdate=18 March 2021}}</ref> Most of the outside action scenes were filmed on location in Amsterdam.\n\n==Reception==\n''Kidnapping Mr. Heineken'' received generally unfavourable reviews from critics.
