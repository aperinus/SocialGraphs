It is a meditation on the nature of human [[memory]], showing the inability to recall the context and nuances of memory, and how, as a result, the perception of personal and global histories is affected. The title ''Sans Soleil'' is from the song cycle ''[[Sunless (song cycle)|Sunless]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]], a brief fragment of which features in the film. ''Sans Soleil'' is composed of [[stock footage]], clips from Japanese movies and shows, excerpts from other films as well as documentary footage shot by Marker.\n\nIn a 2014 ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' poll, film critics voted ''Sans Soleil'' the third best documentary film of all time.\n\n==Description==\nExpanding the [[documentary film|documentary]] genre, this experimental essay-film is a composition of thoughts, images and scenes, mainly from [[Japan]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]], \"two extreme poles of survival\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/484|title=Personal Effects: The Guarded Intimacy of Sans Soleil|work=The Criterion Collection|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> Some other scenes were filmed in [[Cape Verde]], [[Iceland]], [[Paris]], and [[San Francisco]]. A female narrator reads from letters supposedly sent to her by the (fictitious) cameraman Sandor Krasna.\n\n''Sans Soleil'' is often labeled a documentary, travelogue, or essay-film. Despite the film's modest use of fictional content, it should not be confused with a [[mockumentary]]. The fictional content derived from the juxtaposition of narrative and image adds meaning to the film along with occasional nondescript movement between locations and lack of character-based narrative.\n\nChris Marker has said:  \"On a more matter-of-fact level, I could tell you that the film intended to be, and is nothing more than, a home movie. I really think that my main talent has been to find people to pay for my home movies. Were I born rich, I guess I would have made more or less the same films, at least the traveling kind, but nobody would have heard of them except my friends and visitors.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chrismarker.org/chris-marker/notes-to-theresa-on-sans-soleil-by-chris-marker|title=Letter to Theresa by Chris Marker \u2013 Behind the Veils of Sans Soleil {{!}} Chris Marker|work=Chris Marker|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Title and introductory quotations==\nThe title ''Sans Soleil'' is from the song cycle ''[[Sunless (song cycle)|Sunless]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]] \"although only a brief fragment of Mussorgsky's cycle of songs (a brief passage of 'Sur le fleuve', the last of the songs in the cycle, which concerns itself with death) is heard in the course of the film.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFLLBAAAQBAJ&q=sans+soleil+marker+moussorgski&pg=PA307|title=Thoughts on images: a philosophical evaluation by Jarmo Valkola|isbn=9786068266237|access-date=2020-05-24|language=en-US|last1=Valkola|first1=Jarmo|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nThe original French version of ''Sans Soleil'' opens with the following quotation by [[Jean Racine]] from the second preface to his tragedy ''[[Bajazet (play)|Bajazet]]'' (1672):\n<blockquote>\"L'\u00e9loignement des pays r\u00e9pare en quelque sorte la trop grande proximit\u00e9 des temps.\"<br />\n(The distance between the countries compensates somewhat for the excessive closeness of the times.)</blockquote>\n\nMarker replaced this quote with the following one by [[T. S. Eliot]] from ''[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]'' (1930) for the English version of the film:\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>\n\"Because I know that time is always time\nAnd place is always and only place\"...\n\n(And what is actual is actual only for one time\nAnd only for one place.)<ref>\"Racine/Eliot\" from booklet accompanying La Jet\u00e9e/Sans Soleil DVD produced by Criterion</ref></poem>}}\n\n==Production==\n''Sans Soleil'' contains some [[stock footage]], clips from Japanese films and television, and a few excerpts from other films. The original documentary footage was filmed by Marker with a 16mm [[Beaulieu (company)|Beaulieu]] silent film camera in conjunction with a non-sync portable tape recorder; the film contains no [[sync sound|synchronous sound]].<ref>\"Notes on Filmmaking\", essay by Chris Marker in booklet accompanying La Jet\u00e9e/Sans Soleil DVD produced by Criterion</ref> Some of the stock footage shots were colourized with an EMS Spectre [[video synthesizer]].  A number of sequences in ''Sans Soleil'' are borrowed from other filmmakers who are not mentioned until the film's credits, except the footage of the Icelandic volcano which is accredited in narration to [[Haroun Tazieff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lupton|first=Catherine|title=Chris Marker : memories of the future|url=https://archive.org/details/chrismarker00lupt|url-access=limited|year=2006|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1861892232|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chrismarker00lupt/page/n157 156]|edition=Repr.}}</ref>\n\nThe filmmakers whose footage was used who were not mentioned in the narration are [[Sana Na N'Hada]], Jean-Michel Humeau, Mario Marret, Eugenio Bentivoglio and Daniele Tessier. Pierre Camus was an assistant director; Anne-Marie L'Hote and Catherine Adda, assistant editors; Antoine Bonfanti and Paul Bertault, mixing.<ref>{{cite journal |id={{ProQuest|1438388986}} |title=Pictures: Sans Soleil |author=Len |journal=Variety |volume=310 |issue=11 |date=13 April 1983 |page=20 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was assembled largely in the 1970s, a period when Marker was part of a political commune and preferred to downplay his authorial signature, which may partly explain why he is represented in the film by Sandor Krasna's letters. The title \"Conception and editing: Chris Marker,\" at the end of the credits, is the only indication that ''Sans Soleil'' is his film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopate |first=Phillip |date=Winter 1992 |title=In Search of the Centaur: The Essay-Film |journal=The Threepenny Review |volume=48 |issue=48 |pages=19\u201322 |jstor=4384052}}</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nThe sequence in San Francisco references [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and Marker's own earlier film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]''. Marker's use of the name \"The Zone\" to describe the space in which Hayao Yamaneko's images are transformed is a homage to ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', a film by [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], as noted in one of the letters read in the film.\n\nEnglish rock band [[Kasabian]] used a sound clip from the documentary in their ''[[West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum]]'' album at the beginning of the song \"West Ryder Silver Bullet\".\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Sans Soleil'' is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest films ever made, appearing in many \"best films\" lists:\n* \"From ''Toy Story'' to ''Psycho'': the 100 greatest films of all time\" (''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2019): #62<ref>{{cite news |title=From Toy Story to Psycho: the 100 greatest films of all time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/100-greatest-films-time/62-sans-soleil/ |work=The Telegraph |date=8 September 2017 }}</ref>\n* \"Critics\u2019 50 Greatest Documentaries of All Time\" (''[[Sight & Sound]]'', 2014): #3<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-sound-magazine/greatest-docs|title=The Greatest Documentaries of All Time &#124; Sight & Sound|website=British Film Institute}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Silent film tops documentary poll |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-28602506 |work=BBC News |date=1 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all critics have been so positive. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] awarded it 3 stars out of 5, saying it was \"sometimes perplexing, often intriguing, occasionally redundant.
