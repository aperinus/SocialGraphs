Believed to be inspired by a passage from [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s 1868\u201369 novel ''[[The Idiot]]'', the film follows a donkey as he is given to various owners, most of whom treat him callously.\n\nNoted for Bresson's ascetic directorial style and regarded as a work of profound emotional effect, it is frequently listed as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the French countryside near the [[Pyrenees]], a baby donkey is adopted by young children - Jacques and his sisters, who live on a farm. They baptize the donkey (and christen it Balthazar) along with Marie, Jacques' childhood sweetheart, whose father is the teacher at the small school next door. When one of Jacques' sisters dies, his family vacates the farm, and Marie's family take it over in a loose arrangement. The donkey is given away to local farmhands who work it very hard. Years pass until Balthazar is involved in an accident and runs off, finding its way back to Marie, who is now a teenager. Marie's father gets involved in legal wrangles over the farm with Jacques\u2019s father, and the donkey is given away to a local bakery for delivery work.\n\nG\u00e9rard, leader of a young criminal gang, is the delivery boy at the bakery. He is jealous of Balthazar because Marie loves him, and takes charge of the donkey, treating it cruelly. Marie, driving a 2CV one day, sees the donkey at the roadside and stops to greet it. G\u00e9rard, who'd been sleeping nearby, gets into her car and refuses to leave when demanded. It is implied that G\u00e9rard sexually assaults her after she gives up on attempting to flee, and afterwards she drives home. Marie enters into an abusive relationship with the violent G\u00e9rard, leaving her parents. G\u00e9rard is summoned to the local police station and questioned about a murder along with Arnold, an alcoholic who is also a suspect. Neither is arrested. G\u00e9rard and his gang assault Arnold, calling him a murderer and a stool-pigeon. Balthazar becomes ill and is nearly euthanized, but Arnold interrupts and takes the donkey off their hands.\n\nBalthazar recovers and Arnold uses the donkey and another to guide tourists around the Pyrenees. When the season ends, Balthazar escapes and joins a circus. But when the donkey sees Arnold in the audience it goes berserk, and Arnold retrieves it. Arnold's uncle dies and he inherits a fortune. He throws a wild party at a bar, at which Marie and her mother talk and she is asked to come home, which Marie refuses. G\u00e9rard puts Arnold on Balthazar's back to ride home. However, he is so drunk he falls off, hits his head on the ground and dies. The police send Balthazar to market. An avaricious local miller buys the donkey, using (and abusing) it for pumping water and milling. One rainy night, Marie, soaking wet, knocks on the miller's door asking for shelter - she has run away from G\u00e9rard. The miller says he'll be her companion and help her to escape, as she confided in him that she wished to \"run away\" - but the next morning sees her parents and offers them the donkey, the implication being that Marie will follow. Marie goes back to her parents. Jacques visits, wanting to marry her, and when Marie tells him about the abuse she has suffered he does not change his mind. Jacques also says that his father does not want the money the court ordered Marie's father to pay him. Marie is conflicted and is not sure if she is angry with Jacques or if she wants to be with him. She says she wants to \"have it out\" with G\u00e9rard and goes to visit a barn where they used to meet. G\u00e9rard is there with his gang, and they strip her, beat her, then lock her in.\n\nMarie's father and Jacques find her and break a window to get in. They take her home, pulled in a cart by Balthazar. Later Jacques wants to see Marie, but her mother comes downstairs and says, \"She's gone and will never come back.\" Marie's father dies shortly after, when visited by a priest. While Marie's mother is grieving, G\u00e9rard turns up with his gang and asks if they can borrow Balthazar. Marie's mother refuses, as Balthazar is to carry the ashes of Marie's father in his funeral procession. In the dark of night G\u00e9rard abducts Balthazar to carry contraband over the Spanish border.\n\nWhen G\u00e9rard and his accomplice are supposed to meet their contact, they are instead shot at by customs guards and they flee, leaving Balthazar to his fate. In the morning, we see Balthazar has a gunshot wound. A shepherd and his flock come. The sheep gather around Balthazar, their bells jangling. He lies down and dies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Wiazemsky]]<ref name=Cunneen>{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Cunneen |chapter=The Donkey as Witness: ''Au hasard Balthasar''  |title=Robert Bresson: A Spiritual Style in Film |location=New York |publisher=Continuum |date=2003 |page=108 |quote=Against Bresson's wishes, Ms. Wiazemsky embarked on an acting career after ''Balthasar'', making films with directors like Godard [whom she married] and Pasolini. |oclc=50919950 |isbn=9780826416056}}</ref> as Marie\n* Walter Green as Jacques\n* Fran\u00e7ois Lafarge as G\u00e9rard\n* Philippe Asselin as Marie's father\n* Nathalie Joyaut as Marie's mother\n* Jean-Claude Guilbert as Arnold\n* [[Pierre Klossowski]] as the miller\n* [[Jean-Joel Barbier]] as the priest\n* Fran\u00e7ois Sullerot as the baker\n* Marie-Claire Fremont as the baker's wife\n* Jacques Sorbets as the gendarme\n* Jean R\u00e9mignard as the attorney\n\n==Production==\nAfter making several prison-themed films using his theory of \"pure cinematography\", Bresson stated that he wanted to move onto a different style of filmmaking.

Bresson later stated that the film was \"made up of many lines that intersect one another\" and that Balthazar was meant to be a symbol of Christian faith.

On location they stayed in adjoining rooms and Wiazemsky said that \"at first, he would content himself by holding my arm, or stroking my cheek. But then came the disagreeable moment when he would try to kiss me ... I would push him away and he wouldn't insist, but he looked so unhappy that I always felt guilty.\" Later Wiazemsky made love with a member of the film's crew, which she says gave her the courage to reject Bresson as a lover. Bresson was known to cast nonprofessional actors and use their inexperience to create a specific type of realism in his films. Wiazemsky states: \"It was not his intention to teach me how to be an actress. Almost against the grain, I felt the emotion the role provoked in me, and later, in other films, I learned how to use that emotion.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/12/biography |title=Anne Wiazemsky's relationship with Robert Bresson |work=The Guardian |last=Westley |first=Anne |date=October 12, 2007 |access-date=18 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Ghislain Cloquet]] was the cinematographer for ''Au Hasard Balthazar''; it was the first of three films Cloquet shot for Bresson. Bresson's long collaboration with [[L\u00e9once-Henri Burel]] had ended with Bresson's previous film, ''The Trial of Joan of Arc''.
