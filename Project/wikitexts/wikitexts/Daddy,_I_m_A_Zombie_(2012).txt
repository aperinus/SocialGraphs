Spanish actress [[Paula Rib\u00f3]] voiced the main character of Dixie and Kimberly Wharton voiced the character in its English adaptation.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film follows Dixie Grim, a thirteen-year-old gothic girl. Her father is a recently divorced mortician who tries to connect with his daughter, but she seems to want nothing to do with him. She has a giant crush on Ray, a boy in school who doesn't seem to know she exists. All goes wrong when she witnesses her best friend seemingly flirting with Ray. Heartbroken, she runs away from the scene. Shortly after, a tree falls in a forest and seemingly kills her. \n\nDixie wakes up in a graveyard and discovers that she has become a zombie. She befriends an Egyptian mummy named Isis and finds that she can wield the Azoth, a powerful magic amulet. The two are curious to try out and control its power, as it is capable of returning a zombie to the moment before their death, and decide to find another zombie to use as a test subject. Along the way they meet Gonner, a zombie pirate who charms Dixie and steals her necklace, breaking her heart and tearing apart her body in the process. She is also separated from Isis. Unbeknownst to Dixie and Isis, Gonner had only stolen the Azoth to protect her from the evil witch Nebulosa. \n\nDixie is put back together by a friendly zombie, who reluctantly takes her to Nebulosa. Reaching the witch requires that she go through a carnival funhouse where she must face her pain and fears, which Dixie manages to overcome. She also reconciles with and rescues Gonner after overhearing him admit that he truly loved her. Dixie also recovers the Azoth and with Gonner. They find Isis with Nebulosa, who is threatening to destroy her. Dixie manages to unintentionally open a portal that allows the three to escape Nebulosa's clutches. Dixie wakes up to find herself alive. She initially believes that everything was a dream, but thinks otherwise after learning that Isis and Gonner did actually exist. Isis managed to live and married [[King Tut]], while Gonner gave up piracy to become a poet.\n\n== Voice actors ==\n\n=== Spanish release ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Paula Rib\u00f3]] as Dixie Malasombra\n* [[N\u00faria Trifol]] as Isis, Julia\n* [[Ivan Labanda]] as Gonner\n* [[Luis Posada (voice actor)|Luis Posada]] as Ricardo Malasombra, Vitriol\n* [[Roser Batalla]] as Nigreda / Sof\u00eda Malasombra \n* [[Clara Schwarze]] as Brianna, Lilianna\n* [[Elisabeth Bergall\u00f3]] as Piroska\n* [[Albert Mieza]] as Fizcko\n* [[Manuel Osto]] as History Professor\n* [[Francesc Belda]] as Thorko\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== English release ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Kimberly Wharton]] as Dixie Grim\n* Ratana as Isis\n* [[MJ Lallo]] as Gonner, Sophia Grim\n* [[Doug Gochman]] as Phil Grim, Vitriol\n* [[Karen McCarthy (voice actress)|Karen McCarthy]] as Nebulosa\n* [[Liz Joseph (voice actress)|Liz Joseph]] as Piroska\n* Heather Downey as Allyssa\n* Tracey Charles as Melissa, Julia\n* [[Rick Zieff|Danny Katiana]] as Frizcko, Thorko\n* Josh Snyder as History Teacher\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Recognition==\n\n===Reception===\n''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Magazine]]'' panned the film overall, stating that although the film did have good music and cinematography, that overall it \"isn't funny, it isn't frightening and every set-piece action scene is a dismal failure.\"<ref name=\"Starburst Magazine\">{{cite news|last1=Knott|first1=John|title=DVD Review: ''Daddy,I'm a Zombie!''|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/3800-dvd-review-daddy-im-a-zombie|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Magazine]]|date=26 October 2012}}</ref> ''[[Common Sense Media]]'' was somewhat more positive, rating it at three out of five stars.<ref name=\"Common Sense Media\">{{cite web|last1=staff|title=review: ''Daddy, I'm a Zombie''|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/daddy-im-a-zombie|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=13 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n* 2012, won 'Enfants Terribles Award' at [[Gijon International Film Festival]]<ref name=\"20 Minutos\">{{cite news|last1=staff|title=\"Pap\u00e1 soy una zombi\" ha obtenido el premio Enfants Terribles|url=http://www.20minutos.es/cine/cartelera/pelicula/31847/papa-soy-una-zombi/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=[[20 Minutos]]|language=Spanish|date=10 February 2012}}</ref>\n* 2012, [[Goya Awards]] nomination for 'Best Animated Film'<ref name=\"Animation Magazine\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Goya Awards Reveal Feature, Short Noms|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/goya-awards-reveal-feature-short-noms/|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=[[Animation (magazine)|Animation Magazine]]|date=11 January 2012}}</ref>\n* 2013, [[Gaud\u00ed Awards]] nomination for 'Best Animated Feature'<ref name=\"The Loop\"/>\n* 2013, [[C\u00edrculo de Escritores Cinematogr\u00e1ficos|El C\u00edrculo de Escritores Cinematogr\u00e1ficos]] (Cinema Writers Circle Awards, Spain) nomination for 'Best Animated Film'<ref name=\"The Loop\">{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Jordi|title=Awards: Daddy, I'm a Zombie|url=http://www.theloop.com.au/jordiferro/portfolio/daddy-im-a-zombie/109363|publisher=The Loop|accessdate=29 November 2014|ref=dtae=January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nA sequel entitled ''[[Mummy, I'm a Zombie]]]'' ({{lang-es|Mam\u00e1, soy un zombi}}) which had a later Spanish re-titling to ''Dixie y la rebeli\u00f3n zombi'', was given a theatrical release on 7 November 2014 in Spain.
