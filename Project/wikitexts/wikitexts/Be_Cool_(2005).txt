This was [[Robert Pastorelli]]'s final film, as he died one year before its theatrical release.\n\nThe film adaptation of ''Be Cool'' began production in 2004. It was directed by [[F. Gary Gray]], produced by [[Danny DeVito]] (who produced and co-starred in the first film), and starred [[John Travolta]], reprising his role from the first film. It also marked the second collaboration between Travolta and [[Vince Vaughn]] after starring in 2001's ''[[Domestic Disturbance]]''. The film was released on March 4, 2005. It received negative reviews and grossed $95 million against a budget of $53\u201375 million.\n\n==Plot==\nChili Palmer, restless after years of filmmaking, enters the music industry after witnessing the [[Russian mob]] execute his friend Tommy Athens, owner of a record company. Chili offers to help Tommy's widow, Edie Athens, manage the failing business, which owes $300,000 to hip-hop producer Sin LaSalle.\n\nChili is impressed by singer Linda Moon and helps free her from contractual obligations to Nick Carr and Raji, who has a [[gay]] [[Samoa]]n bodyguard named Elliot, an aspiring actor and the butt of Carr and Raji's [[Homophobia|homophobic]] jokes. Carr and Raji hire a hitman, Joe \"Loop\" Lupino to kill Chili before he can save Edie's company by arranging a live performance for Linda along with [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Aerosmith]].\n\nLasalle demands payment of the $300,000, but agrees to give Chili a few days to get the money plus the [[Vigorish|vig]]. When the [[people of Russia|Russians]] attempt to kill Chili, Joe Loop mistakenly kills Ivan Argianiyev, the Russian mob's hitman. Carr is furious about the mistake and demands that Raji talks to Loop at once. Raji then kills Loop with a metal baseball bat after Loop \"disrespects\" him.\n\nCarr then tries to trick Chili by handing him a [[pawn ticket]], claiming that Linda's contract is being held at a pawn shop owned by the Russians. Chili being much smarter than Carr anticipated, has Edie give the ticket to the police, who pay the Russians a visit. Raji and Elliot set up LaSalle by making him believe that Carr tricked Chili in giving him the $300,000 to get Linda's contract. LaSalle and the DubMD confront Carr in his office, as do Bulkin and his men. Insulted by Bulkin's racist remarks, LaSalle kills him.\n\nChili squeezes in a dance scene with Edie, celebrating as Linda Moon gets to make her appearance with Aerosmith in concert. Based on Linda's success in that concert, Chili assuages LaSalle by making him her producer.\n\nBut Carr is not accepting any deal, so he makes Raji put Elliot to kill Chili. By assuring Elliot that he can help his acting career, Chili befriends him. After learning that Chili had gotten him an audition for a [[Nicole Kidman]] film, Elliot turns on Raji, who had erased the message on his answering machine. For all his smooth talking and flamboyant wardrobe, Raji finds himself in a firework conflagration which roasts him live on camera. Carr is arrested on murder charges when Chili makes sure he is caught with the bat used to kill Joe Loop, via another pawn ticket.\n\nAt the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], Linda wins the awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|best new artist]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|video of the year]]. During her acceptance speech, she thanks Edie, Sin and Chili. Edie and Chili leave the award ceremony. And as Chili drives off, he passes a billboard revealing that Elliot is the co-star of a new movie with Nicole Kidman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Travolta]] as Chili Palmer\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Edie Athens\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Roger \"Raji\" Lowenthal\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Sin LaSalle\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]] as Dabu\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Joseph \"Joe Loop\" Lupino\n* [[Christina Milian]] as Linda Moon\n* [[Paul Adelstein]] as Hyman Gordon\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Marla\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Eliot Wilhelm\n* [[Gregory Alan Williams]] as Darryl\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Nick Carr\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Martin Weir\n* [[Seth Green]] as Shotgun\n* [[James Woods]] as Tommy Athens\n* Alex Kubik as Roman Bulkin\n* George Fisher as Ivan Argianiyev\n* Serdar Kalsin as Semyon\n* [[Anthony J.

Gary Gray]] discussed the failure of the film, stating: \"With ''Be Cool'', I made some assumptions in thinking that movie was going to work. I'd just made a successful PG-13 movie [''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]''], and when I walked into ''Be Cool'', it was rated R and then at the last minute in preproduction I was told, 'Well, you have to make this PG-13.' I should have walked off the film. This was a movie about shylocks and gangsta rappers and if you can't make that world edgy, you probably shouldn't do it. I walked in thinking I was going to make one movie and then it changed. Maybe it was arrogant of me to think because I had success in this realm of PG-13 I could make that work\".<ref name=\"Fleming\">{{cite web |date=August 14, 2015 |author=Mike Fleming |title=F.
