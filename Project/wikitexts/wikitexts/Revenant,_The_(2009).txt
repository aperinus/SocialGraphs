The film was shot in Los Angeles, California.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film focuses on Second Lieutenant Bart Gregory (David Anders) who has been killed under mysterious circumstances in [[Iraq War|Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33815/a-trailer-the-revenant-finds-its-way-online|title=A Trailer for The Revenant Finds Its Way Online|work=Dread Central}}</ref>  After his friends and girlfriend Janet (Louise Griffiths) attend his funeral, Bart awakens in his grave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17560|title=Trailer for Widely Praised 'The Revenant' - Bloody Disgusting!|work=Bloody Disgusting!}}</ref> Enlisting the help of his best friend, Joey Leubner (Chris Wylde), Bart begins to understand and learn how to deal with his new undead state; mainly, the fact that Bart needs blood to hold back decomposition and that he returns to a state of in-animation during daylight hours. Joey does research online to find out what Bart is and seems to be stuck between a [[Zombie]] and [[Vampire]], finally stating that Bart is a [[Revenant]].\n\nWhile buying beer from a small store in Koreatown, Bart and Joey become [[vigilantes]] when Bart both kills and feeds off of a gangster who is holding up the store. They enjoy the media coverage of the incident, and Joey asks Bart to bestow him with the \"dark gift\". Bart refuses to do so and laughs the idea off. However, after a subsequent attempt at vigilantism goes wrong and Joey is fatally wounded, Bart is forced to drink Joey's blood in order to save him.\n\nThe two continue their vigilante killing spree for a while, until Mathilda (Jacy King), a friend of Janet who dislikes both Bart and Joey, follows them and threatens to reveal their activities to the world, especially Janet. Joey shoots Mathilda through the chest, but before she dies, she is able to send the information to Janet.\n\nFearing they will be caught, Joey tells Bart to meet him back at the apartment with a packed bag in half an hour, then drives away mysteriously. Bart meets a teary Janet at the apartment, who forces him to explain the fact that he requires blood to stay stable. She then begs him to feed off of her instead, so that he will no longer need to kill. Bart loses control and drains her until she dies.\n\nJoey returns to the apartment with a \"pimped out\" [[hearse]] for the two to use, and suggests that they go to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to continue their reign. However, after Bart shows him Janet's corpse, the two begin to fight, and proceed to shoot each other repeatedly, although this is insufficient to kill either of them. Joey storms out and states that he will continue on to Vegas alone. Bart decapitates Janet in order to ensure her death, then drops her remains over the bridge where he and Joey usually disposed of their corpses. Bart is captured by [[SWAT]] teams and taken to jail, where, come dawn, he collapses in his cell. Upon nightfall, Bart reawakens in the morgue and escapes, returning to the apartment. Inside is a package containing Joey's severed head.\n\nSince he was decapitated at night, Joey is still \"alive\", and Bart uses a vibrating [[dildo]] to enable Joey's head to talk. Joey warns Bart that a [[gang]]banger who was their first kill is after him for revenge, and then requests that Bart kill him for good. Bart crushes Joey's head underneath a bulldozer, and then tries to find a way to kill himself.\n\nAgainst normal convention, a bullet through the brain does not have the desired effect, and neither does hanging himself with Christmas lights. He even throws himself in front of the subway train, but only succeeds in severing his arm. Bart then boards a train, where he finds and reads a letter that Janet left in his uniform's pocket at his funeral. He breaks down and attacks the only other passenger. He is caught and flees into the station where more SWAT teams attempt to catch him.\n\nHe finally escapes to a hilltop and at dawn collapses once more, while he is being surrounded by men in [[hazmat suit]]s.\n\nThe film then cuts to a tour of sorts, where various military personnel are being shown revenants in glass containers, including Bart. A General asks Bart if he was a soldier, and then states that this fact may give him an advantage.\n\nBart is then shown in a large canister being airdropped into [[Kh\u016bzest\u0101n Province]], [[Iran]], along with the other revenants, where the canister opens upon landing, releasing him on the country.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[David Anders]] as Barthenoy (Bart) Gregory: Having come back from death as a [[Revenant (folklore)|revenant]], Bart must deal with his new condition, a potential for a second chance on life, and trying to come to terms with the girlfriend that he had left behind.\n*[[Chris Wylde]] as Joey Leubner: As Bart's best friend, Joey acts as a partner and sidekick to Bart, providing him background of Bart's deteriorating condition, and encouraging him to act on his darker impulses in order to survive. \n*[[Louise Griffiths]] as Janet: Bart's love interest who is devastated after Bart's unexpected death. \n*Jacy King as Mathilda (Matty): A [[Wicca]]n nurse who is close friend to Janet, Matty acts as the voice of reason.\n*[[Emiliano Torres]] - Miguel\n*Senyo Amoaku \u2013 liquor store robber\n*Cathy Shim \u2013 Sophia Chang\n*[[David Ury]] \u2013 ATM robber\n*Wally White \u2013 The Minister\n*Zana Zefi \u2013 Ms. Rahmanov\n*Clint Jung - Marty\n\n== Development ==\n''The Revenant'' was written, directed, and produced by Kerry Prior, who also supervised the visual effects on the film.

The film was edited by Kerry Prior, though the opening credits state \"image juxtaposition designer Walter Montague Urch\".\n\n\"Walter Montague Urch\" could be a reference to [[Walter Map]] and [[Montague Summers]], who have written about revenants and men who have returned from the dead.\n\n== Filming ==\nFilming for ''The Revenant'' began in April 2008 in [[Los Angeles]], California.
