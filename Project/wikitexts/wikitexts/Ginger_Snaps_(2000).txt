The film stars [[Emily Perkins]] and [[Katharine Isabelle]] as [[Brigitte Fitzgerald|Brigitte]] and [[Ginger Fitzgerald]], two morbid teenage sisters whose relationship is tested when Ginger (who has started her period for the first time) is attacked and bitten by a unknown animal, and then later, during the next full moon, slowly starts to transform into a lycanthrope ([[werewolf]]). The supporting cast features [[Kris Lemche]], [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]], [[Danielle Hampton]], John Bourgeois, [[Peter Keleghan]], and [[Mimi Rogers]].\n\nAfter premiering at the Munich [[Fantasy Filmfest]] in August 2000 and screening at the [[2000 Toronto International Film Festival]], ''Ginger Snaps'' received a limited theatrical release in May 2001. Despite modest [[box office]] receipts, the film was a critical success. It has since amassed a [[cult following]] and has been reexamined for its [[feminism|feminist]] themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37147051 |doi=10.1386/fiin.4.3.68/1 |doi-broken-date=July 31, 2022 |via=[[ResearchGate]]|title=Menstrual Monsters: The reception of the Ginger Snaps cult horror franchise |date=January 2006 |last1=Barker |first1=Martin }}</ref><ref name=\"Vice\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3zxw5/ginger-snaps-was-a-monster-win-for-canadian-cinema |title='Ginger Snaps' Was a Monster Win for Canadian Cinema |last=Blichert |first=Frederick |date=August 5, 2020 |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=August 21, 2022}}</ref>  It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed]]'', and a prequel, ''[[Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning]]'', which were filmed back-to-back and both released in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Bailey Downs, a rash of dog killings has been occurring. [[Brigitte Fitzgerald|Brigitte]] and [[Ginger Fitzgerald]] are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death, and as children, formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on the way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger. As the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer.\n\nFollowing the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. Her wounds heal quickly, and she starts to behave aggressively, grow hair from her scars, sprout a tail, and menstruate heavily. She has unprotected sex with classmate Jason McCardy, furiously beats Trina in public, and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to get information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a [[werewolf]] and is transforming into one. Sam suggests infusing an extract of [[Aconitum|monkshood]], a [[perennial plant]].\n\nTrina accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. She fights with Ginger and is accidentally killed. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers, and the fingers are misplaced. On [[Halloween]], Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates a monkshood extract. Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected by Ginger when they had sex), and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behavior, which proves it is a cure. At school, she discovers Ginger's murder of a faculty member and witnesses her killing another. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him.\n\nThe girls' mother finds the fingers and Trina's corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, saying that she will protect them. Brigitte arrives to find Ginger hurting Sam for rejecting her sexual advances. Brigitte wounds Ginger's and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger's blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. Ginger feels her transformation approaching and Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back to the Fitzgerald house to prepare more of the cure for her.\n\nGinger transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, a transformed Ginger attacks him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte's insincerity, and kills Sam.\n\nAs Ginger stalks Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and weeps.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Emily Perkins]] as [[Brigitte Fitzgerald]]\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as [[Ginger Fitzgerald]]\n* [[Kris Lemche]] as Sam\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Pamela Fitzgerald\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Jason McCardy\n* [[Danielle Hampton]] as Trina Sinclair\n* John Bourgeois as Henry Fitzgerald\n* [[Peter Keleghan]] as Mr. Wayne, a teacher and guidance counselor at Bailey Downs High School\n* Christopher Redman as Ben\n* Jimmy MacInnis as Tim\n* Lindsay Leese as Nurse Ferry, the school nurse\n* Wendii Fulford as Ms. Sykes, the Bailey Downs High School gym and field hockey teacher\n* Ann Baggley as Mother\n* Pak-Kong Ho as Janitor\n* Bryon Bully as Hockey Kid\n* Steven Taylor as Puppy Kid\n}}\n\nNick Nolan portrayed both the initial werewolf (nicknamed \"the Beast of Bailey Downs\" by the town's residents) and the \"Gingerwolf\", the werewolf which Ginger becomes.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ginger Snaps (2000) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210070/fullcredits|access-date=2020-07-26}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=August 2021}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector [[John Fawcett (director)|John Fawcett]] has said, \"I knew that I wanted to make a metamorphosis movie and a horror film. I also knew that I wanted to work with girls\".<ref name=\"kit\">{{cite press release |publisher=TVA International |date=2000-07-17|url=http://www.ginger-snaps.com/presskit.htm |title=Ginger Snaps: Press Kit|access-date=2006-11-30}}</ref> In January 1995, he talked to screenwriter [[Karen Walton]], who was initially reluctant to write the script due to the horror genre's reputation for weak characters, poor storytelling, and a negative portrayal of women. However, Fawcett convinced Walton the film would re-interpret the genre.<ref name=\"kit\"/> Walton has said, \"a lot of werewolf movies seemed very much the same. My favourite was of course ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'', because it was at least a little punk about it, but it was still two white dudes grappling with the beast inside of them... I love stories that work on a lot of different levels, for a whole bunch of different kinds of people. That it turned out to be OK in the marketplace as just one girl's voice \u2013 and a director who really wanted to support that \u2013 is remarkable, I think, for the day.\"<ref name=\"Vice\" />\n\nFawcett and Walton encountered trouble financing the film. They approached producer [[Steve Hoban]], with whom they had worked before, and he agreed to produce the film. Hoban employed Ken Chubb to edit and polish the story, and after two years they were ready to seek financiers.<ref name=\"kit\"/>\n\nMotion International committed to co-financing and Canadian distribution, and [[Trimark Pictures]] agreed to be the co-financier, U.S distributor and international sales agent.<ref name=\"kit\"/> The film seemed ready to go into production by fall of 1998; however, negotiations with Trimark caused the producers to miss the budgeting deadline for [[Telefilm Canada]], the Canadian federal film funding agency. Rather than go ahead with only 60% of the funding, Hoban decided to wait a year for Telefilm's funding. During this interval, Trimark dropped the film. [[Lionsgate Films]], who Trimark would end up merging with in 2000, took Trimark's place, and Unapix Entertainment agreed to distribute the film on [[DVD]], along with [[Artisan Entertainment]] for the American DVD release.<ref name=\"kit\"/> The film's budget was $4.5 million.<ref name=mathijs/>{{rp|16}}\n\n===Casting===\nCasting the two leads met with substantial difficulty. While a casting director was easily found for Los Angeles, Canadian casting directors proved to be appalled by the horror, gore, and language. When one finally agreed to pick up the film, the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine shooting]] and another [[W. R. Myers High School shooting|school shooting in Alberta]] suddenly thrust the public spotlight on violent teens. The ''[[Toronto Star]]''{{'}}s announcement that Telefilm was funding a \"teen slasher movie\" met with a flurry of debate and outrage in the media, which generated a significant amount of adverse publicity in proportion to the size of the project.<ref name=\"kit\"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Charles|last=Taylor|title=Ginger Snaps|work=salon.com|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html|date=October 26, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020206041642/https://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html |archive-date=2002-02-06}}</ref>\n\nCasting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Perkins and Isabelle auditioned on the same day at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. When their taped auditions arrived, screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters.<ref name=\"kit\"/>\n\nCoincidentally, both actresses were born in the same hospital, attended the same preschool, elementary, and private schools, and are at the same agency. Perkins was twenty-two at the time and Isabelle four years younger, but Perkins was cast as the younger sister.\n\nAttention then turned to the next most important characters: the drug dealer and the mother roles. Mimi Rogers readily agreed to play the mother, Pamela, saying that she liked the black humour and comic relief in the role.<ref name=\"kit\"/> Robin Cook, the Canadian casting director, put forward one of her favourites, [[Kris Lemche]], for the role of drug dealer Sam. After seeing Kris's audition, Fawcett hired him.<ref name=\"kit\"/>\n[[Image:Isabellemakeup.jpeg|thumb|right|Katharine Isabelle having a [[facial prosthetic]] applied.]]\n\n===Shooting===\n[[Principal photography]] took place between October 25 and December 6, 1999, lasting a little over six weeks. Three of Toronto's suburbs, Etobicoke, Brampton (Kris Lemche's hometown), and Scarborough served as the suburb of Bailey Downs.<ref name=kit/> Shooting outside during Toronto's winter for sixteen hours a day, six days a week meant that sicknesses would make their rounds through the cast and crew every few weeks.<ref name=kit/><ref name=kat/>\n\nOn the first day of shooting in the suburbs, all the still photographs for the title sequence were created. The bloody, staged deaths drew a crowd and Fawcett worried about upsetting the neighbours.<ref name=kit/> The girls were covered in fake blood for the shots, and at the time, a homeowner's basement served as their changing room. Each time they needed to change, someone had to distract the homeowner's four-year-old child.<ref name=\"kat\">Allan, Keri. \"[http://www.ginger-snaps.com/interview_katharine_isabelle.htm Katharine Isabelle]\" (2001). ''sci-fi-online.com''. Retrieved November 19, 2006.</ref>\n\nLong shooting days pushed the earliest possible start later each day until the scenes written for day were being shot after late into the night. Director of photography Thom Best solved the problem by using [[Diffusion filter|diffusion gel]] and four eighteen kilowatt lamps which generated enough light to be seen a mile high in the sky.<ref name=kit/>\n\nThe special effects proved to be a major hardship, as Fawcett eschewed [[Special effects#CGI and SFX|CGI]] effects and preferred to use more traditional means of prosthetics and make-up. Consequently, Isabelle had to spend up to seven hours in the makeup chair to create Ginger's metamorphosis and a further two hours to remove them.<ref name=kat/> Often covered in sticky fake blood that required [[Borax]] and household detergent to remove, she further endured wearing contacts that hindered her vision and teeth that meant she could not speak without a lisp. The most aggravating thing was the full [[facial prosthetic]] which gave her a permanently runny nose that she had to stop with [[cotton swab]]s.<ref name=\"kit\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nBeginning in December 1999, Brett Sullivan worked with Fawcett for eight weeks to create the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"kit\"/> Despite the short time for editing, the film was nominated for a [[Genie Award|Genie]] in editing.<ref name=\"genie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.academy.ca/hist/history.cfm?stitle=Ginger+Snaps&awyear=0&winonly=0&awards=0&rtype=2&curstep=4&submit.x=52&submit.y=11 |title=Canadian Awards History Search |access-date=2006-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322093553/http://www.academy.ca/hist/history.cfm?stitle=Ginger+Snaps&awyear=0&winonly=0&awards=0&rtype=2&curstep=4&submit.x=52&submit.y=11 |archive-date=March 22, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite a similarly tight schedule in the sound department, the film would also be nominated for a Genie in sound editing.<ref name=\"genie\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack was released on [[Roadrunner Records]].\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| title1          = Inside You\n| note1           =\n| extra1          = [[Godhead (band)|Godhead]]\n| length1         = 3:31\n| title2          = Pipe Dream\n| note2           =\n| extra2          = [[Project 86]]\n| length2         = 4:35\n| title3          = Siberian Kiss\n| note3           =\n| extra3          = [[Glassjaw]]\n| length3         = 3:50\n| title4          = The Silent Acquiescence of Millions\n| note4           =\n| extra4          = [[Sinch (band)|Sinch]]\n| length4         = 8:44\n| title5          = Temple from the Within\n| note5           =\n| extra5          = [[Killswitch Engage]]\n| length5         = 3:45\n| title6          = First Commandment\n| note6           =\n| extra6          = [[Soulfly]] (feat.
