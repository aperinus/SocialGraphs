It stars [[Ed Helms]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Adam Levine]], Mickey Gooch Jr. and [[Russell Peters]]. The film marks the final film role of [[Alan Thicke]], who died on December 13, 2016.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 23, 2017. It was released on January 26, 2018, by [[Momentum Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nEddie Krumble (Ed Helms) is a widowed contract actor who works as an audience member for infomercials, with his best friend Chris (Tracy Morgan). He also has a budding romance with Judy (Amanda Seyfried), a shy gas station attendant.\n\nOne day he gets noticed by Stillerman (Russell Peters), a late night talk show host because of his frequent appearances as a recurring audience member. He loses his job due to Stillerman's segments searching for \"the Clapper\". The ''Stillerman Show's'' hunt for Eddie also gets Judy fired and she appears to go missing.\n\nInitially declining offers to appear on Stillerman's show without payment (there is a rule against paying guests), Eddie caves in, appearing on the show to find Judy. After, Eddie and Chris do several \"Searching for Judy\" segments on the show, which they are paid for. After a few such segments, Judy phones the network and tells Eddie on-air to stop \"stalking\" her. Fearing a lawsuit, the show ends these segments and cut ties with Eddie and Chris.\n\nSix months later, Eddie and Chris reappear on the show, as does Eddie's mother Ida (Brenda Vaccaro) berating Stillerman's treatment of her son. On air, Eddie admits that he misses his late wife and that he loves Judy, who sees the segment while she is pumping gas that night. As Eddie mentions on television where he'll be the next day, she finds him and tells him she loves him back. They subsequently marry in the closing credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Eddie Krumble\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Judy\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Chris\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Ida Krumble\n* [[Leah Remini]] as Producer Louise\n* [[Adam Levine]] as Raef Ranter\n* [[Russell Peters]] as Stillerman\n* [[James Ransone]] as Darth Guy\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Himself\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Dr. Rogers B Hay\n* [[Mark Cuban]] as Himself\n* Todd Giebenhain as Tambakis\n* [[Nico Santos (actor)|Nico Santos]] as Buffet Person\n* [[P.
