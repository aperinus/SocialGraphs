As some of these artists discuss their growth in popular artistic culture they explain how becoming renowned and admired in the [[art world]] was something that never occurred to them from their various roots in street culture, or simply creating art for themselves. As many of the artists began to be recognizable and sought after they discuss their series of commercial success: creating advertisements for popular products, designing products themselves, working in film and being hired to paint and create artwork in well known locations. The personal feelings and convictions of some of the artists and how creating work for corporations compares to their beginnings in street culture is also discussed. The film portrays the artists as outside the realm of contemporary art.\n\n[[Image:Beautiful losers book.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Cover of ''Beautiful Losers'' art book]]\n\n==Art book==\nThe film was preceded by a published art collection titled ''Beautiful Losers.''({{ISBN|1933045302}}) The book was co-published by Iconoclast Editions and [[Distributed Art Publishers]], and edited by co-curators Christian Strike and Aaron Rose, who directed the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flux.net/who-is-aaron-rose |title=Who is Aaron Rose |access-date=2008-04-01 |last=Wells |first=Meg |date=2008-03-14 |work=Flux.com | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080323234854/http://flux.net/who-is-aaron-rose| archive-date= 23 March 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Traveling museum exhibition==\nThe publication of the book was to complement and commemorate the traveling museum exhibition, which itself was one of the settings and subjects for the film.
