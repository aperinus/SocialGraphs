''Jin-Roh'' is the third film in Oshii's ''[[Kerberos saga]]'' and is primarily based on Oshii's manga ''[[Kerberos Panzer Cop]]''.\n\nThe film follows Kazuki Fuse, a member of [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Metropolitan Security Police Organization (MP)|a special police unit]] set during an [[alternate history]] of 1950s Japanese riots. Failing to follow an order to execute a frightened young girl only to see her commit suicide by detonating an [[improvised explosive device]] before his very eyes, Fuse is put on trial and sent back to the training camp for re-evaluation. Visiting the grave of the suicide, he meets Kei, the girl's sister, who does not hold him responsible for her demise. The film proceeds as the two develop a peculiar relationship.\n\nThe film premiered on November 17, 1999, in France, and [[Bandai Entertainment]] and [[Viz Media]] licensed the film for an English-language release in North America and Europe. It has been relicensed in North America by [[Discotek Media]], with a DVD released on April 29, 2014 followed by a Blu-Ray on January 27, 2015.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=774149892614107&set=a.196378827057886.55668.147168055312297&type=1&theater Discotek Media].

It focuses on Kazuki Fuse, a member of the elite Kerberos Panzer Cops, a metropolitan [[counter-terrorism]] unit. Fuse confronts his own humanity when he fails to shoot a young  terrorist that his unit traps in the storm-water tunnels. She detonates a bomb in front of him, but only kills herself. The incident damages the reputation of the unit and Fuse is reprimanded. He visits the ashes of the dead girl and meets Kei Amemiya, who claims to be the elder sister of the terrorist and they develop a friendship. Kei is eventually revealed not to be the suicide bomber's sister, but a former bomb courier coerced into acting on behalf of the Special Unit's rival division [[Kerberos saga characters#Metropolitan Police Public Security Division|Public Security]].\n\nA trap is set by the local police forces and the Public Security Division intended to discredit the Special Unit with Kei as bait to catch Fuse, intending to show a terrorist passing a satchel bomb to a member of the Panzers. However, Fuse sneaks in, seizes Kei, neutralizes the Capitol Police agents and they escape. Later, Kei reveals her role in the deception and suggests they leave together, but Fuse decides to stay.\n\nThey make their way to the tunnels once more, where they are met by members of the Wolf Brigade, a secret, deep-cover unit in the Kerberos Corps led by Hajime Handa. They provide Fuse with a full set of armor and weaponry, before leaving with Kei in tow. Hachiroh Tohbe explains to Kei that the Wolf Brigade has used the Public Security Division's plan to flush out those who were most active in trying to eliminate the Kerberos Corps, and eliminate them in turn. Public Security agents follow a tracking device in Kei's bag and make their way into the tunnels. They encounter the fully armored Fuse, who slaughters them all.\n\nLater, the Wolf Brigade meet in a junkyard and Fuse is ordered to kill Kei to ensure she is never recaptured by Public Security. Kei embraces Fuse and sadly recites the dialogue of [[Little Red Riding Hood]], describing the grotesque appearance of the wolf disguised as a loved one. Fuse is distraught, but regardless kills Kei. Fuse is horrified at his action, but now having sacrificed his humanity, he has no other choice but to remain part of the pack. The old sergeant solemnly compares Kei's fate to the demise of Red Riding Hood and the triumph of the wolf.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yoshikatsu Fujiki]] ([[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''[[Corporal]] Kazuki Fuse'''|\u4f0f \u4e00\u8cb4|Fuse Kazuki}}\n* Sumi Mutoh ([[Moneca Stori]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Kei Amemiya'''|\u96e8\u5bae \u572d|Amemiya Kei}}\n* [[Hiroyuki Kinoshita]] (Colin Murdock in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Atsushi Henmi'''|\u8fba\u898b \u6566|Henmi Atsushi}}\n* [[Eri Sendai]] ([[Maggie Blue O'Hara]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Nanami Agawa'''|\u963f\u5ddd \u4e03\u751f|Agawa Nanami}}\n* Kenji Nakagawa ([[French Tickner]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Isao Aniya'''|\u5b89\u4ec1\u5c4b \u52f2|Aniya Isao}}\n* [[Kousei Hirota]] ([[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Bunmei Muroto'''|\u5ba4\u6238 \u6587\u660e|Muroto Bunmei}}\n* Ryuichi Horibe (Ron Halder in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Shiroh Tatsumi'''|\u5dfd \u5fd7\u90ce|Tatsumi Shir\u014d}}\n* Yukihiro Yoshida ([[Michael Kopsa]] in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Hajime Handa'''|\u534a\u7530 \u5143|Handa Hajime}}\n* [[Tamio \u014cki]] as {{nihongo|'''Capo Officer'''|\u81ea\u6cbb\u8b66\u5e79\u90e8|Jichikei kanbu}}\n* [[Yoshisada Sakaguchi]] (Doug Abrahams in the English version) as {{nihongo|'''Hachiroh Tohbe'''|\u5854\u90e8 \u516b\u90ce|T\u014dbe Hachir\u014d}}\n\n==Production==\nMamoru Oshii had wanted to do what ultimately became ''Jin-Roh'' several years prior. It was originally planned to be the third and final live-action feature film of the Kerberos trilogy, but its production wasn't possible until 1994, while Oshii was already working on ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''. As the filmmaker wasn't able to produce two films in the same time but didn't want someone else to direct his final episode, Oshii decided that the third episode would be an anime instead.\n\nThe project was originally pitched as a six-episode [[Original video animation|OVA]] as he knew [[Bandai Visual]] was interested in having him do a series for them and his original [[Kerberos Panzer Cop]] manga was formed by six chapters. As he proposed the project to [[Bandai Visual]] at a meeting they instead asked him to direct ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' but green-lit the series for pre-production.<ref name=\"dan42\">[http://dan42.com/jinroh/e/interviews.html Dan42's JIN-ROH lair (Interviews)]. Dan42.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-12.</ref> The production eventually evolved into a feature film following the international success of Ghost in the Shell as [[Manga Entertainment]] wanted a similar hit and saw potential in Kerberos Panzer Cops as the manga had been published in the United States.\n\nAfter reluctantly giving up the directorial role, Oshii originally thought on ''[[Patlabor 2: The Movie]]'' animation director [[Kazuchika Kise]], but he had no interest in chief direction at the time. He then committed ''Jin-Roh'' as a debut film to a trusted young collaborator, Hiroyuki Okiura, who had worked on animation movies such as ''Ghost in the Shell'' (character designer) and ''Patlabor 2: The Movie.''<ref>''Making Of Jin-Roh interview'' featured in the Jin-Roh DVD published by CTV Int'l</ref> Oshii considered him the most able candidate among the younger staff of the studio and both Production IG and Bandai Visual, knowing about his directing ambitions and his interest in creating a serious drama, wanted him to do his debut for them.<ref name=\"dan42\" />\n\nOshii \"begged\" to at least be entrusted with the screenplay, the prospect of working with Okiura changing his previous reluctance about merely writing films. This wasn't originally in Bandai's plans for the film, but Oshii expected [[Kazunori It\u014d]], his usual screenwriter, to reject their offer as he had previously told him that he didn't want to write a story involving dogs following his work for Jin-Roh live-action prequel ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'', and after he did so he was offered the role. He ultimately still found the experience frustrating both through the tiping (\"The moment you write, you want to direct\") and after realizing the result would unavoidably be much different from what he pictured in his head. Lacking any creative control on the process, he chose to distance himself from the animation production while looking forward to the final product.<ref name=\"dan42\" />\n\nOkiura favored traditional animation, and thus the film was almost completely drawn by hand, requiring 80,000 cels.<ref name=\"ANN\">{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/jin-roh |title=Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade |last=Macdonald |first=Christopher |website=Anime News Network }}</ref> Oshii, who characterized him as \"allergic to computers\", admitted that had he directed the film he would have relied in computer animation just as he did in ''Ghost in the Shell'' and no more than 30,000 cels would have been needed.<ref name=\"dan42\" /> Still the celwork was subsequently processed through the Animo software in order to enhance some visual effects, textures and camerawork.<ref name=\"shirase\">{{cite magazine |last=Mich\u00e1n |first=Miguel |date=November 2000 |title=Jin-Roh, el anime del nuevo milenio |trans-title=Jin-Roh, the new millennium's anime |language=es |magazine=Shirase |page=27 |publisher=Ares Inform\u00e1tica }}</ref>\n\nThe film's musical score was composed by [[Hajime Mizoguchi]].\n\n==Release==\n''Jin-Roh'' was first seen in the early 1999 film festival circuit, including the [[49th Berlin International Film Festival|49th Berlinale]] and the 19th [[Fantasporto]] in February.<ref name=\"variety9906\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1999/film/reviews/jin-roh-the-wolf-brigade-1200458046/ |title=Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade |last=Elley |first=Derek |date=June 21, 1999 |website=Variety }}</ref> It was subsequently shown in Cannes' [[March\u00e9 du Film]], which presumably netted its early French theatrical release on November 17.
