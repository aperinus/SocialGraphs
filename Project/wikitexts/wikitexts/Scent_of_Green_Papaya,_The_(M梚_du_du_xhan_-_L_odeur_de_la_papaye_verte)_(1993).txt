It is also his first collaboration with Vietnamese composer [[T\u00f4n-Th\u00e2t Ti\u00eat]] who subsequently wrote the music for two more films: ''[[Cyclo (film)|Cyclo]]'' and ''[[Vertical Ray of the Sun]]''.\n\nAlthough set in Vietnam, the film was shot entirely on a [[soundstage]] in [[Boulogne-Billancourt|Boulogne]], France.\n\n==Plot==\nA young girl, M\u00f9i, becomes a servant for a family that was once wealthy, but is sinking into genteel poverty due to the husband's infidelities and spending sprees. Their only income is from the wife's small business. The husband's widowed mother, an invalid who seldom leaves her upstairs room, blames her daughter-in-law, telling her, \"You have a man, but you don't know how to keep him happy.\" The eldest son prefers his friend's company, the bookish middle son torments insects, and the youngest, who idolizes his father, is willful, disruptive, and resentful. M\u00f9i is notably peaceful and intensely curious about the world. Having lost a young daughter during one of her husband's earlier absences, the wife is kind to M\u00f9i, treating her like one of her own.\n\nWhen the husband leaves for his fourth and final time, he steals his wife's meagre savings and jewelry. He stays away long enough for the family to almost run out of food and go hungry. He collapses soon after his return home, the wife sells an heirloom vase and other valuables to pay for medical expenses, and a doctor is summoned. As he is treated with [[acupuncture]], musicians play cheerful music outside the room. When he dies, the wife faints and the family is shocked.\n\nTen years later, the family has fallen on hard times. Two sons have left, and the wife has taken the place of the grandmother upstairs, tragic and rarely seen. On the family shrine, the grandmother's and husband's photos have joined those of other departed relatives. It is determined that the household can no longer afford to keep M\u00f9i. The heartbroken wife gives M\u00f9i a silk dress and some gold jewelry, and M\u00f9i become a servant for the older son's wealthy friend, who is now a concert pianist. He is engaged to be married, but seems to prefer playing the piano to spending time with his frivolous fianc\u00e9e.\n\nOne night, as the fianc\u00e9e chatters on, his piano playing becomes more stormy as he strives to ignore her. She leaves, but watches through the window, and sees that when M\u00f9i enters the room, his playing becomes both passionate and peaceful. Later that night, he goes to M\u00f9i's quarters and closes the door behind him. When the fianc\u00e9e learns of this she furiously slaps M\u00f9i, smashes some of his belongings, and then leaves her engagement ring on a table. When he returns, he calmly pockets the ring. He starts teaching M\u00f9i to read and write. In the final scene, a visibly pregnant M\u00f9i is reading poetry to him, and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tran Nu Y\u00ean-Kh\u00ea]] as Mui, age 20 (as Tr\u00e2n Nu Y\u00ean-Kh\u00ea)\n* Man San Lu as Mui, age 10\n* Thi Loc Truong as La m\u00e8re (as Truong Thi L\u00f4c)\n* Anh Hoa Nguyen as La vieille Ti (as Nguy\u00ean 'Anh Hoa)\n* Hoa Hoi Vuong as Khuyen (as Vuong H\u00f2a H\u00f4i)\n* Ngoc Trung Tran as Le p\u00e8re\n* Vantha Talisman as Thu\n* Keo Souvannavong as Trung\n* Van Oanh Nguyen as Mr. Thuan\n* Gerard Neth as Tin\n* Nhat Do as Lam\n* Thi Hai Vo as La grand-m\u00e8re\n* Thi Thanh Tra Nguyen as Mai\n* Lam Huy Bui as Le m\u00e9decin\n* Xuan Thu Nguyen as L'antiquaire\n* Xuan Loi Phan as Musiciens\n* Xuan Dung Phan as Musiciens\n* Van Chung Le as Musiciens\n* Tho Phuong as Le coiffeur\n* Long Chau as Clientes\n* Thi Van Khanh Truong as Clientes\n* H\u00f4ng Hanh Luguern as Clientes \n* Ba Hang Phan as Le livreur d'eau<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for The Scent of Green Papaya |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107617/fullcredits#cast |access-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Year-end lists===\n* 4th&nbsp;\u2013 Bob Strauss, ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Bob|date=December 30, 1994|title=At the Movies: Quantity Over Quality|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|page=L6|edition=Valley}}</ref>\n* 4th&nbsp;\u2013 David Elliott, ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=David|date=December 25, 1994|title=On the big screen, color it a satisfying time|newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|edition=1, 2|page=E=8}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n* 1993 [[Cannes Film Festival]] Award of the Youth French Film (Anh Hung Tran) '''Won'''\n* 1993 [[Cannes Film Festival]] Golden Camera Award (Anh Hung Tran) '''Won'''\n* 1993 [[Camerimage]] Golden Frog Award Nomination (Beno\u00eet Delhomme)\n* 1994 [[Academy Award]] Nomination for Best Foreign Language Film\n* 1994 [[British Film Institute]] Award Sutherland Trophy (Anh Hung Tran) '''Won'''\n* 1994 [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for Best First Work (Anh Hung Tran) '''Won'''<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for The Scent of Green Papaya |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107617/awards |access-date=March 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 66th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Vietnamese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0107617}}\n* {{Amg movie|131132|The Scent of Green Papaya}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the-scent-of-green-papaya|The Scent of Green Papaya}}\n\n{{Tran Anh Hung}}\n{{Cam\u00e9ra d'Or}}\n{{C\u00e9sar Award for Best First Feature Film}}\n{{Sutherland Trophy}}\n{{Vietnamese submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scent of Green Papaya, The}}\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-language films]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tran Anh Hung]]\n[[Category:Best First Feature Film C\u00e9sar Award winners]]\n[[Category:Cam\u00e9ra d'Or winners]]\n[[Category:1993 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]"}]}}}}
