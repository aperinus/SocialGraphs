The storyline by [[Eric Roth]] and [[Robin Swicord]] is loosely based on the 1922 [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|short story of the same name]] by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. The film stars [[Brad Pitt]] as a man who ages in reverse and [[Cate Blanchett]] as the [[Romantic interest|love interest]] throughout his life. The film also stars [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Mahershala Ali]], [[Julia Ormond]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Elias Koteas]], and [[Tilda Swinton]].\n\nProducer [[Ray Stark]] bought the film rights to do the short story in the mid-1980s with [[Universal Pictures]] backing the film, but struggled to get the project off the ground until he sold the rights to producers [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (producer)|Frank Marshall]] in the 1990s. Although it was moved to [[Paramount Pictures]] in the 1990s, the film did not enter production until after Fincher and Pitt signed on along with the rest of the cast in 2005. Principal photography began in November 2006 and wrapped up in September 2007. [[Digital Domain]] worked on the visual effects of the film, particularly in the process of the metamorphosis of Pitt's character.\n\n''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' was released in North America on December 25, 2008 to positive reviews from critics, who praised Fincher's directing, Pitt's performance, production values, and visual effects. The film was a box office success, grossing $335.8 million worldwide against its $167 million budget. The film received thirteen [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, the most of the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Fincher, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Pitt, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Taraji P. Henson]], and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn August 2005, Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a [[New Orleans]] hospital as [[Hurricane Katrina]] approaches. She tells her daughter Caroline, about blind clockmaker Mr. Gateau, hired to make a clock for a train station in 1918. When it was unveiled, the public was surprised to see it running backwards. She reveals that Mr. Gateau made it as a memorial for those who lost their sons in [[World War I]], including his own son. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from Benjamin Button's diary.\n\nOn the evening of [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]], a boy is born with the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. His mother, Caroline, dies soon after childbirth and his father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a [[nursing home]]. Caretaker Queenie and cook Mr. Tizzy Weathers find the baby, and she raises him as her own, naming him Benjamin. As the years pass, Benjamin physically blends in with the elderly residents but has the mind and curiosities of a child. He eventually transitions from a wheelchair to crutches and learns to walk. He befriends a visiting [[African Pygmy]] named Oti, who teaches him to look beyond the physical, and resident Mrs. Maple, who teaches him to play the [[piano]].\n\nOn [[Thanksgiving]] 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home and they connect instantly. Later, he accepts work on the [[tugboat]] ''Chelsea'' captained by Mike Clark. Thomas Button introduces himself to Benjamin, but does not reveal his true identity. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew and travels around the world. He sends Daisy hundreds of [[postcard]]s, and learns that she was accepted into a [[ballet]] company in [[New York City]].\n\nIn [[Murmansk]] in 1941, Benjamin becomes smitten with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of a British trade minister. Their affair eventually ends, leaving Benjamin heartbroken. That December, the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|United States enters]] [[World War II]]. Mike volunteers the ''Chelsea'' for [[U.S. Navy]] service, and they are assigned to salvage duties. They find a near sunken U.S. transport and thousands of dead American troops. The culprit, a [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]], surfaces and fires on the tugboat. Captain Mike rams the submarine and the resulting explosion sinks both. Most of the crew perishes except for Benjamin and Rick Brody, who are rescued the following day.\n\nIn May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, reuniting with Queenie and learns that Mr. Weathers died. He reconnects with Daisy and she attempts to seduce him but Benjamin refuses and she departs. Benjamin visits terminally-ill Thomas and learns the details of his birth and family. Thomas gives his [[button]] manufacturing company and estate to Benjamin before dying.\n\nIn 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced, but departs upon seeing she is romantically-involved. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in [[Paris]]. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.\n\nIn 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love. Queenie dies, and Benjamin and Daisy move-in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, tells Benjamin that she is pregnant. Their daughter, Caroline, is born in the spring of 1968. Believing he cannot be a proper father due to his reverse aging, Benjamin sells his assets, leaves the money for Daisy and Caroline, and leaves to travel alone during the 1970s.\n\nBenjamin, physically a young man, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him as a family friend to her husband Robert and Caroline. She admits he was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. She later visits him at his hotel, where they have sex and part once more. In 1990, recently [[widow]]ed Daisy is contacted by social workers who found Benjamin, who is now physically a [[pre-teen]]. When she arrives, they explain that he was living in a condemned building, was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and that his diary had her name on it. Benjamin displays early signs of [[dementia]], so Daisy eventually moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life as he regresses into infancy.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Gateau's clock was replaced with a properly working modern [[digital clock]] and in the spring of 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically over 84 years old. Back in 2005, having finally revealed that Benjamin is Caroline's father, Daisy dies. [[Hurricane Katrina]] floods a storage room holding Mr. Gateau's clock, which continues to tick backwards.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Benjamin Button (adult)\n** [[Robert Towers]] as Benjamin Button (apparent adult)\n** Peter Donald Badalamenti II as Benjamin Button (apparent adult)\n** [[Tom Everett]] as Benjamin Button (apparent adult)\n** [[Spencer Daniels]] as Benjamin Button (apparent age 12)\n** [[Chandler Canterbury]] as Benjamin Button (apparent age 8)\n** Charles Henry Wyson as Benjamin Button (apparent age 6)\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Daisy Fuller (adult)\n** [[Elle Fanning]] as Daisy Fuller (age 7)\n** [[Madisen Beaty]] as Daisy Fuller (age 10)\n* [[Taraji P.

The first choice to direct it was [[Frank Oz]], with [[Martin Short]] attached for the title role, but Oz could not work out how to make the story work. The film was optioned in 1991 by [[Steven Spielberg]], with [[Tom Cruise]] attached for the lead role, but Spielberg left the project to direct ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[Schindler's List]]''. Other directors attached were [[Patrick Read Johnson]] and [[Agnieszka Holland]]. Stark eventually sold the rights to producers [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (filmmaker)|Frank Marshall]], who took the film to [[Paramount Pictures]], with Universal still on as a co-production partner. By summer 1994, Maryland Film Office chief Jack Gerbes was approached with the possibility of making the film in [[Baltimore]]. In October 1998, screenwriter [[Robin Swicord]] wrote for director [[Ron Howard]] an adapted screenplay of the short story, a project which would potentially star actor [[John Travolta]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117481695.html?categoryid=3&cs=1 |title='Husband' vows renewed; doc on saint set |work=Variety |date=October 22, 1998 |access-date=April 28, 2007}}</ref> In May 2000, Paramount hired screenwriter [[Jim Taylor (writer)|Jim Taylor]] to adapt a screenplay from the short story.
