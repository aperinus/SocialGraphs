A remake of [[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|the 1925 silent film with a similar title]], it was adapted from [[Lew Wallace]]'s 1880 novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''. The screenplay is credited to [[Karl Tunberg]], but includes contributions from [[Maxwell Anderson]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Christopher Fry]].\n\n''Ben-Hur'' had the largest budget ($15.175 million), as well as the largest sets built, of any film produced at the time. [[Costume designer]] [[Elizabeth Haffenden]] oversaw a staff of 100 wardrobe fabricators to make the costumes, and a workshop employing 200 artists and workmen provided the hundreds of [[frieze]]s and statues needed in the film. Filming commenced on May 18, 1958, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on January 7, 1959, with shooting lasting for 12 to 14 hours a day and six days a week. [[Pre-production]] began in Italy at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] around October 1957, and [[post-production]] took six months. Under cinematographer [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert L. Surtees]], executives at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] made the decision to produce the film in a [[widescreen]] format. Over 200 camels and 2,500 horses were used in the shooting of the film, with some 10,000 extras. The sea battle was filmed using miniatures in a huge tank on the back lot at the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. The nine-minute chariot race has become one of cinema's most famous [[Action film|action sequences]], and the score, composed and conducted by [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]], was at the time the longest ever composed for a film, and was highly influential on cinema for over 15 years.\n\nFollowing a $14.7 million marketing effort, ''Ben-Hur'' premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on November 18, 1959. It was the fastest-grossing, as well as the highest-grossing film of 1959, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time, after ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. It won a record eleven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Wyler), [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Heston), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Griffith), and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography \u2013 Color]] (Surtees); it also won [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]] for Stephen Boyd. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] named it the 72nd best [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies|American film]] and the second best American epic film in the [[AFI's 10 Top 10]]. In 2004, the [[National Film Preservation Board]] selected ''Ben-Hur'' for preservation by the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-04-215/films-added-to-national-film-registry-for-2004/2004-12-28/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Prologue, a baby is born in Bethlehem among the shepherds and visited by Magi in a cave.\n\nIn A.D. 26,{{Efn|The movie at first begins in 1 BC, with a significant [[prologue]] recounting the [[Nativity of Jesus]], before its main title card, emphasizing the \"A Tale of the Christ\" subtext.}} [[Judah Ben-Hur]] is a wealthy Jewish prince and merchant in Jerusalem, living with his mother, Miriam, and his sister, Tirzah. The family's loyal slave, the merchant Simonides, pays a visit with his daughter, [[Esther (character)|Esther]]. Seeing each other for the first time since childhood, Judah and Esther fall in love, but she is betrothed to another. After several years away from Jerusalem, Judah's childhood friend Messala returns as commander of the [[Antonia Fortress|Fortress of Antonia]]. Messala believes in the glory of [[Roman Empire|Rome and its imperial power]], while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah deliver potential rebels to the Roman authorities.\n\nDuring a parade for the new [[Prefect|governor]] of [[Iudaea Province|Judea]], [[Valerius Gratus]], loose tiles fall from the roof of Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the [[galley slave|galleys]] and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. Simonides confronts Messala and is also imprisoned. Judah swears revenge upon Messala. As he and other slaves are marched to the galleys, they stop in [[Nazareth]] to water the Romans' horses. Judah begs for water, but the commander of the Roman detachment denies it to him. Judah collapses, but is revived when Jesus gives him water.\n\nAfter three years as a galley slave, Judah is assigned to the flagship of the [[Roman Consul#Under the Empire|Roman Consul]] Quintus Arrius, who has been charged with destroying a fleet of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonian]] pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a [[gladiator]] or charioteer. Judah declines the offer. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius exempts Judah, among all the rowers, from being chained to the ship. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah frees as many other rowers as he can and rescues Arrius. Arrius believes he has lost the battle and attempts to [[Suicide#Ritual suicide|fall on his sword]], but Judah stops him. After they are rescued, Arrius is told his fleet had won a decisive victory. Arrius petitions Emperor [[Tiberius]] to free Judah, and [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopts him as his son]].\n\nJudah becomes a champion charioteer, then returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets [[Biblical Magi|Balthasar]] and Arab Sheik Ilderim. After noting Judah's prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his ''[[quadriga]]'' in a race before the new governor of Judea, [[Pontius Pilate]]. Judah declines, even after learning that Messala will compete. Judah returns to Jerusalem. He finds Esther and learns she is not married and that she still loves him. Miriam and Tirzah contracted [[leprosy]] in prison and were expelled from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah, so Esther tells Judah they died. Judah smashes his family's [[mezuzah]], then seeks revenge by competing against Messala in the chariot race. Sheik Ilderim goads Messala into making an enormous wager on himself.\n\nDuring the race, Messala drives a [[Scythed chariot|chariot with blades on the hubs]] to disable his competitors. He attempts to destroy Judah's chariot, but wrecks his own instead. He is dragged behind his horses and trampled by another chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah to search for his family in the Valley of the Lepers.\n\nJudah visits the leper colony, where he confronts Esther while she delivers supplies to his mother and sister. Esther convinces Judah to not see them. Judah visits Pilate and rejects his [[Property|patrimony]] and Roman citizenship. He returns with Esther to the leper colony, reveals himself to Miriam and learns that Tirzah is dying. Judah and Esther take Miriam and her daughter to see Jesus, but the [[trial of Jesus]] has begun. As Jesus is carrying his cross through the streets, he collapses. Judah recognizes him as the man who gave him water years before, and reciprocates. As Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus, Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed.\n\nJudah returns to his house, where he finds Esther, and his mother and sister now restored to health. The four embrace one another and rejoice at the miracle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Judah Ben-Hur]]\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as Quintus Arrius\n* [[Haya Harareet]] as [[Esther (character)|Esther]]\n* [[Stephen Boyd]] as Messala\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as [[Sheik Ilderim]]\n* [[Martha Scott]] as Miriam\n* [[Cathy O'Donnell]] as Tirzah\n* [[Sam Jaffe]] as Simonides\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as [[Balthazar (Magus)|Balthasar]]\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Terence Longdon]] as Drusus\n* [[George Relph]] as [[Tiberius Caesar]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Sextus\n* [[Laurence Payne]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Claude Heater]] as [[Jesus Christ]] (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.claudeheater.com |title = Personal Website &#124; Claudeheater}}</ref>\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Greci]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://westernboothill.blogspot.com/2017/06/rip-jose-greci.html|title = Boot Hill: RIP Jos\u00e9 Greci|date = June 2, 2017|access-date = November 13, 2018|archive-date = December 29, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191229054513/http://westernboothill.blogspot.com/2017/06/rip-jose-greci.html|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{main|Production of Ben-Hur (1959 film)}}\n\n[[File:Ben Hur22.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Ben-Hur'' filming site near [[Lifta]], intended to represent [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) originally announced a remake of the 1925 silent film ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' in December 1952, ostensibly as a way to spend its Italian assets.{{Efn|MGM had extensive amounts of income in Italian [[lira]].

Concerned that a roaring [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity scene]], Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet.<ref name=\"Schumach\">Schumach, Murray. \"Metro Stills Leo for the First Time.\" ''[[The New York Times]].''

Zimbalist hired a number of screenwriters to cut the story down and turn the novel into a script. According to [[Gore Vidal]], more than 12 versions of the script had been written by various writers by the spring of 1958.<ref name=\"Vidal73\">Vidal, p. 73.</ref> Vidal himself had been asked to write a version of the script in 1957, refused, and been placed on [[Suspension (punishment)|suspension]] for his decision.<ref name=\"Vidal73\" /> According to Vidal, Karl Tunberg was one of the last writers to work on the script. Other sources place Tunberg's initial involvement much earlier. Tunberg cut out everything in the book after the crucifixion of Jesus, omitted the sub-plot in which Ben-Hur fakes his death and raises a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, and altered the manner in which the leperous women are healed.{{efn|Instead of being healed as Christ carries His cross, the women are healed after accidentally soaking in rainwater stained by the blood of Jesus after the crucifixion.}}<ref name=\"Morsberger\">Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 482.</ref> According to Wyler, Vidal, their biographers (see bibliography below) and the sources that follow them, Zimbalist was unhappy with Tunberg's script, considering it to be \"pedestrian\"<ref name=\"Morsberger\" /> and \"unshootable\".<ref name=\"Kaplan440\">Kaplan, p. 440.</ref>\n\nThe writing effort changed direction when director Sidney Franklin fell ill and was removed from the production.

Vidal made one structural change which was not revised, however. The Tunberg script had Ben-Hur and Messala reuniting and falling out in a single scene. Vidal broke the scene in two, so that the men first reunite at the Castle Antonia and then later argue and end their friendship at Ben-Hur's home. Vidal also added small character touches to the script, such as Messala's purchase of a brooch for Tirzah and Ben-Hur's purchase of a horse for Messala.<ref name=\"Kaplan445\" /> Vidal claimed that he worked on the first half of the script (everything up to the chariot race), and scripted 10 versions of the scene where Ben-Hur confronts Messala and begs for his family's freedom.<ref name=\"Herman400\">Herman, p. 400.</ref><ref name=\"Giddins247\">Giddins, p. 247.</ref>\n\nVidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal first made the claim in an interview in the 1995 documentary film ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role as if he were a spurned homosexual lover.<ref>Joshel, Malamud, and McGuire, pp.&nbsp;37\u201338.</ref> Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations.<ref name=\"Herman400\" /> Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate.<ref name=\"Morsberger\" /><ref name=\"Herman400\" /><ref name=\"VidalAdvocate\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hWMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT67#v=onepage&q=%22Gore%20Vidal%22%20%22Ben-Hur%22%20homosexual%20subtext \"Chuck Roast.\" ''The Advocate.''

On June 6, 1958, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set's gates until police arrived and dispersed them.<ref>\"Romans in Mob Scene Not in 'Ben Hur' Script.\" ''United Press International.''

The 70mm lenses had a minimum focusing distance of {{convert|50|ft|m}}, and the camera was mounted on a small Italian-made car so the camera crew could keep in front of the chariots. The horses, however, accelerated down the {{convert|1500|ft|m|adj=on}} straight much faster than the car could, and the long focal length left Marton and Canutt with too little time to get their shots. The production company purchased a more powerful American car, but the horses were still too fast, and even with a head start, the filmmakers only had a few more seconds of shot time. As filming progressed, vast amounts of footage were shot for this sequence. The ratio of footage shot to footage used was 263:1,<!--for the whole movie, or just this scene, as the text implies?--> one of the highest ratios ever for a film.<ref name=\"Didinger157\" />\n\nOne of the most notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury.<ref name=\"Raymond32\" /> Marton wanted to keep the shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the ''quadriga'' while the horses kept going.<ref name=\"Herman407\">Herman, p. 407</ref> The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments.<ref>Canutt and Drake, pp.&nbsp;16\u201319.</ref> Boyd did all but two of his own stunts.<ref name=\"Eagan560\" /> For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury.
