The film depicts a young [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Doctor Watson|John Watson]] meeting and solving a mystery together at a [[boarding school]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851204/REVIEWS/512040301/1023 |title=Young Sherlock Holmes Movie Review (1985) &#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1985-12-04 |access-date=2013-11-10}}</ref>\n\nThe film is notable for being the first full-length movie to feature a completely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] character.

Holmes\u2019 mentors there include Rupert Waxflatter, an eccentric retired professor to whom the school has given a large attic space for his inventions, which include a flying machine. Waxflatter's niece, Elizabeth, and Holmes, are in love.\n\nElsewhere in the city, a hooded figure with a blowgun shoots two men with thorns that induce nightmarish hallucinations, causing their apparent suicides. Holmes brings his suspicions of foul play to Scotland Yard detective Lestrade, who rebuffs him.\n\nAfter a school rival frames him for misconduct, Holmes is expelled.\u00a0He has one last duel with Professor Rathe, the fencing instructor. While Holmes says goodbye to Watson, Waxflatter is shot with a thorn and stabs himself. Dying, he whispers the word \"Eh-Tar\" to Holmes.\n\nHolmes, Watson and Elizabeth secretly investigate the murders, uncovering the existence of Rame-Tep, an ancient Egyptian cult of [[Osiris]] worshippers. The trio track the cult to a London paraffin warehouse and a secret underground wooden pyramid, where they interrupt the sacrifice of a young girl. The Rame-Tep wound them with thorns and they escape to a cemetery to endure the hallucinations.\n\nBack in Waxflatter's loft, Holmes and Watson find a drawing of six men, including the three victims and a fourth man, Chester Cragwitch, who is still alive.\u00a0That night, Holmes and Watson go to see Cragwitch, who explains that in his youth, he and the other five men were in Egypt, where they [[Looting|looted]] an underground [[pyramid]] containing the tombs of five Egyptian princesses. The resulting protest was violently put down by the [[British Army]]. A local boy named Eh-Tar and his sister vowed to seek revenge and replace the bodies of the five princesses. As they return to the school, a chance remark by Watson causes Holmes to realize that Eh-Tar is none other than Professor Rathe.\n\nRathe and his sister Mrs. Dribb abduct Elizabeth, planning to use her as the final sacrifice. Using Waxflatter's flying machine, Holmes and Watson reach the warehouse just in time to rescue Elizabeth and destroy the temple. When Rathe tries to shoot Holmes, Elizabeth shields Holmes with her body and is mortally wounded. Rathe falls into the frozen [[River Thames]].\n\nHolmes transfers to another school and Watson gives him an antique [[tobacco pipe|pipe]] that he bought during the investigations as a Christmas/farewell present.\n\nAn ending credits scene reveals that Rathe escaped. Checking in to a hotel in Switzerland, he signs in as \"[[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]], the protagonist \n* [[Alan Cox (actor)|Alan Cox]] as [[Doctor Watson|John Watson]], Holmes' sidekick\n**[[Michael Hordern]] voices an older John Watson, who narrates the movie.\n* [[Sophie Ward]] as Elizabeth Hardy, Holmes' love interest\n* [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]] as Rathe.

Though he admitted that he was \"very worried about offending some of the Holmes purists\", Columbus used the original Doyle stories as his guide. Of the creation of the film, Columbus stated:\n\n{{blockquote|\"The thing that was most important to me was why Holmes became so cold and calculating, and why he was alone for the rest of his life,\" Mr. Columbus explains. \"That's why he is so emotional in the film; as a youngster, he was ruled by emotion, he fell in love with the love of his life, and as a result of what happens in this film, he becomes the person he was later.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>}}\n\nWhen [[Steven Spielberg]] came aboard the project he wanted to make certain the script had the proper tone and captured the [[Victorian era]]. He first had noted [[Sherlockian]] John Bennett Shaw read the screenplay and provide notes. He then had English novelist [[Jeffrey Archer]] act as [[script doctor]] to [[Anglicisation|anglicize]] the script and ensure authenticity.<ref name=\"bostrom407\">{{cite book |last=Bostr\u00f6m |first=Mattias |title=[[From Holmes to Sherlock]] |publisher=[[Mysterious Press]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-8021-2789-1 |pages=406\u2013407}}</ref>\n\nThe cast includes actors with previous associations to Sherlock Holmes.
