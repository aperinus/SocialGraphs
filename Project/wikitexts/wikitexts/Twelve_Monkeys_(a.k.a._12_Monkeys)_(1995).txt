After [[Universal Studios]] acquired the rights to remake ''La Jet\u00e9e'' as a full-length film, [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] were hired to write the script.\n\nUnder Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million budget, and filming lasted from February to May 1995. The film was shot mostly in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]], where the story was set.\n\nThe film was released to critical praise and grossed $168.8 million worldwide. Pitt was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and he won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance. The film also won and was nominated for various categories at the [[Saturn Award]]s.\n\n== Plot ==\nA deadly virus, released in 1996, wipes out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus.\n\nIn 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in an underground compound beneath [[Philadelphia]]. Cole is selected to be sent back in time to find the original virus to help scientists develop a cure in exchange for a reduced sentence. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport.\n\nCole arrives in [[Baltimore]], 1990, not 1996 as planned; he is arrested and incarcerated at a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] and [[anti-corporatism|anti-corporatist]] views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors where he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened.\n\nAfter an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but he disappears, waking up back in 2035. Cole is interrogated by the scientists who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole another chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. Cole accidentally arrives at a battlefield during [[World War I]], is shot in the leg and then transported to 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the [[Cassandra metaphor|Cassandra complex]] to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Railly meets Dr. Peters who tells her that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision while [[Human impact on the environment|humanity's gradual destruction of the environment]] is the real lunacy.\n\nCole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it and, when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys before they set out in search of him. When Cole confronts Goines, he denies any involvement with the group and says that, in 1990, Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father, Dr. Leland Goines.\n\nCole is transported back to 2035 where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission. But when he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her he now believes himself crazy as she had suggested. Meanwhile, Railly has discovered evidence of his time travel which she shows him, believing he is sane. They decide to depart for the [[Florida Keys]] before the onset of the plague.\n\nThey learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a message telling the scientists that following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is the wrong track and he will not return. Cole is confronted by Jose, his cell mate from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and instructs him to follow orders.\n\nRailly spots Dr. Peters at the airport and recognizes him from a newspaper as an assistant of Goines' father. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations of the viral outbreaks.\n\nCole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing his gun, Cole is shot by police. As Cole lies dying in Railly's arms, Railly suddenly begins to scan the crowd around her. Railly finally makes eye contact with a small boy\u2014the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future, who comments that her job is \"insurance.\" The young Cole watches the plane take off from the ground outside the airport.\n<!-- Do not add further details or interpretation here \u2013 the ending is clearly left ambiguous. -->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as James Cole\n** Joseph Melito as young James Cole\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Dr. Kathryn Railly\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Jeffrey Goines\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Dr. Leland Goines\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Dr. Peters\n* [[Jon Seda]] as Jose\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Lt.

Kosberg persuaded that film's director, [[Chris Marker]], to let him [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the project to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], seeing it as a perfect basis for a full-length science fiction film. Universal agreed to purchase the [[film rights|remake rights]] and hired [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] to write the screenplay.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Chris Nashawaty |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1219922_1,00.html |title=They Call Him Mr. Pitch |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 28, 2006 |access-date=2012-04-10 |archive-date=October 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016103131/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1219922_1,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Producer [[Charles Roven]] chose [[Terry Gilliam]] to direct, because he believed the filmmaker's style was perfect for ''12 Monkeys''{{'}} nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot.<ref name=\"note\" /> Gilliam had just abandoned a [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' when he signed to direct ''12 Monkeys''.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite book |author=Ian Christie |author2=Terry Gilliam |author2-link=Terry Gilliam |title=Gilliam on Gilliam |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 220\u2013225] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-571-20280-2 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/gilliamongilliam0000gill/page/220 }}</ref> The film also represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples' \"intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting. It deals with time, madness and a perception of what the world is or isn't. It is a study of madness and dreams, of death and re-birth, set in a world coming apart.\"<ref name=\"note\">DVD production notes</ref>\n\nUniversal took longer than expected to approve ''12 Monkeys'', although Gilliam had two stars (Willis and Pitt) and a firm budget of $29.5 million (low for a Hollywood science fiction film). Universal's production of ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) had resulted in various [[cost overrun]]s. To get ''12 Monkeys'' approved for production, Gilliam persuaded Willis to lower his normal [[asking price]].<ref name=\"second\">Christie, Gilliam, pp.226\u2013230</ref> Because of Universal's strict production incentives and his history with the studio on ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam received [[final cut privilege]].

By the time of ''12 Monkeys''{{'}} release, ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' (1994), and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' (1995) had been released, making Pitt an [[A-list]] actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing.

There were also technical glitches with the futuristic mechanical props. Because the film has a nonlinear storyline, continuity errors occurred, and some scenes had to be reshot. Gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding.

The film is also intended to be a study of people's declining ability to communicate in modern civilization due to the interference of technology.<ref name=\"comment\" />\n\n=== Allusions to other films and media ===\n''12 Monkeys'' is inspired by the French short film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' (1962); as in ''La Jet\u00e9e'', characters are haunted by the images of their own deaths.<ref name=\"third\" /> Like ''La Jet\u00e9e'', ''12 Monkeys'' contains references to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958). Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch scenes from ''Vertigo'' and ''The Birds''. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy ([[Kim Novak]]) transforms herself into blonde Madeleine in ''Vertigo''; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie ([[James Stewart]]) saw Judy emerge within a green light.<ref name=\"third\" /> Brief notes of [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore in the first part of ''Vertigo''. The scene at [[Muir Woods National Monument]], where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in ''12 Monkeys''. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from ''Vertigo'' is repeated.<ref name=\"third\" /> The Muir Woods scene in ''Vertigo'' is also reenacted in ''La Jet\u00e9e''.
