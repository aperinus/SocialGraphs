It is a fictional story of three student filmmakers\u2014[[Heather Donahue]], [[Michael C. Williams]], and [[Joshua Leonard]]\u2014who hike into the Black Hills near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The three disappear, but their equipment and footage are discovered a year later. The purportedly \"recovered footage\" is the film the viewer sees.\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez conceived of a fictional legend of the Blair Witch in 1993. They developed a 35-page screenplay with the dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]]. A [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] call advertisement in ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]'' magazine was prepared by the directors; Donahue, Williams and Leonard were cast. The film entered production in October 1997, with the [[principal photography]] taking place in [[Maryland]] for eight days. About 20 hours of footage was shot, which was edited down to 82 minutes. Shot on an original budget of $35,000\u201360,000, the film had a final cost of $200,000\u2013750,000 after post-production edits.\n\nWhen ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] at midnight on January 23, 1999, its promotional marketing campaign listed the actors as either \"missing\" or \"deceased\". Owing to its successful run at Sundance, [[Artisan Entertainment]] bought the film's distribution rights for $1.1&nbsp;million. The film had a limited release on July 14 the same year, before expanding to a wider release starting on July 30. While critical reception was mostly positive, audience reception was split.\n\n''The Blair Witch Project'' grossed nearly $250&nbsp;million worldwide, making it one of the most successful [[independent film]]s of all time, as well as the 41st most profitable horror film, while also being a [[sleeper hit]]. The film launched a [[Blair Witch|media franchise]], which includes two sequels (''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|Book of Shadows]]'' and ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''), novels, comic books, and video games. The film is credited with reviving the [[found footage (film technique)|found-footage technique]] which was later used by similarly successful horror films such as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' and ''[[Cloverfield]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nThe film purports to be footage found in the discarded cameras of three young filmmakers who had gone missing.\n\nIn October 1994, film students [[Heather Donahue|Heather]], [[Michael C. Williams|Mike]], and [[Joshua Leonard|Josh]] set out to produce a [[documentary]] about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a [[hermit]] who lived in the woods and kidnapped seven children in the 1940s; he supposedly killed them all in his basement, murdering them in pairs while having one stand in a corner. The students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. They meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver, who went missing in 1888; when she returned three days later, she talked about \"an old woman whose feet never touched the ground\". The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century; their bodies later disappeared.\n\nThey camp for the night, and the next day, find an old cemetery with seven small [[cairn]]s, one of which Josh accidentally knocks over. That night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping. The following day, they try to hike back to the car but cannot find it before dark and make camp. They again hear twigs snapping. In the morning, they find that three cairns have been built around their tent. Heather learns her map is missing. Mike reveals he kicked the map into a creek out of frustration, which provokes a fight between the three as they realize they are lost. They decide to head south, using Mike's compass, and discover stick figures suspended from trees. They again hear strange sounds that night, including children laughing. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they hide in the woods until dawn.\n\nUpon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. They come across a river identical to one they crossed earlier and realize they have walked in a circle. Josh disappears the next morning, and Heather and Mike try in vain to find him. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams but are unable to locate him. They theorize that his screams are a fabrication by the witch to draw them out of their tent.\n\nThe next day, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks tied with fabric from Josh's shirt. Upon opening the bundle, she also finds a blood-soaked scrap of his shirt containing teeth, hair, a finger, and a large piece of a tongue. Although distraught, she does not tell Mike. That night, she records herself apologizing to her family and Mike's and Josh's families, taking responsibility for their predicament.\n\nThey again hear Josh's agonized cries and follow them to an abandoned house containing demonic symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Trying to find Josh, they go to the basement, where an unseen force attacks Mike, causing him to drop his camera. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike standing in a corner facing the wall. Heather calls out to him, but he doesn't react. The unseen force attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera, and the footage ends.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of ''The Blair Witch Project'' began in 1993.<ref name=\"onion\"/> While film students at the [[University of Central Florida]], Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez were inspired to make the film after realizing that they found [[documentaries]] on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. In order to produce the project, they, along with [[Gregg Hale (producer)|Gregg Hale]], Robin Cowie and Michael Monello, started [[Haxan Films]]. The namesake for the production company is [[Benjamin Christensen]]'s 1922 [[silent film|silent]] documentary horror film ''[[H\u00e4xan]]'' (English: ''Witchcraft Through the Ages'').<ref name=\"villagevoice1\">{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Anthony |title=Season of the Witch |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=July 14, 1999 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928,kaufman,7024,1.html |access-date=September 26, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303170002/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928%2Ckaufman%2C7024%2C1.html |archive-date=March 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez developed a 35-page screenplay for their fictional film, intending dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]].

The advertisement said a \"completely improvised feature film\" would be shot in a \"wooded location\". Donahue said that during the audition, Myrick and S\u00e1nchez posed her the question: \"You've served seven years of a nine-year sentence. Why should we let you out on parole?\" to which she had to respond.<ref name=\"real\"/> Joshua Leonard said he was cast due to his knowledge of how to run a camera, as no omniscient camera was used to film the scenes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/how-joshua-leonard-fell-love-moviemaking/ |work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |title=How Joshua Leonard Fell In Love With Moviemaking |author=Loewenstein, Melinda |date=March 16, 2013 |access-date=October 31, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309205137/http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/how-joshua-leonard-fell-love-moviemaking/ |archive-date=March 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPre-production began on October 5, 1997, and Michael Monello became a co-producer.<ref name=\"makingofpt3\">{{cite news |last1=Rock |first1=Ben |author-link=Ben Rock |title=The Making of The Blair Witch Project: Part 3 \u2013 Doom Woods Preppers |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180906/making-blair-witch-project-part-3-doom-woods-preppers/ |access-date=March 27, 2017 |publisher=[[Dread Central]] |date=August 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328022029/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180906/making-blair-witch-project-part-3-doom-woods-preppers/ |archive-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name=timeline/> In developing the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations.
