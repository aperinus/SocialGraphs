Levy]]. The story focuses on an [[assassination]] attempt on the [[President of the United States]] in [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]], as seen from the various vantage points of different characters. [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Matthew Fox]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[William Hurt]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]] star. The film is often compared, unfavorably, to [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon]]'', which also employed storytelling through multiple perspectives. ''Rashomon'' used the multiple perspectives to question the possibility of truth, in a process called the [[Rashomon effect]]; in contrast, ''Vantage Point'' recounts a series of events which are re-enacted from several different perspectives and viewpoints to reveal a truthful account of what happened. ''Vantage Point'' also explores kidnapping, assassination and terrorism.<ref name=\"film\">[[Pete Travis|Travis, Pete]] (Director). (2008). ''Vantage Point'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Columbia Pictures]].</ref>\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[Relativity Media]], [[Original Film]], and Art In Motion, and began filming in [[Mexico City]] on June 18, 2006. It premiered in Salamanca on February 13, 2008, and was released in theaters in the United States by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through the [[Columbia Pictures]] label on February 22. The [[film score]], released by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on February 26, was composed by [[Atli \u00d6rvarsson]].\n\n''Vantage Point'' grossed $151 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Salamanca]], [[Spain]], an assassination attempt on U.S. President Henry Ashton unfolds from several different vantage points.\n\nGNN producer Rex Brooks directs news coverage from a mobile television studio as the president arrives to a ceremony at the city's [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor]], for the start of international negotiations against terrorism. The mayor of Salamanca introduces the President, who is shot twice as he reaches the podium, soon followed by an explosion outside the plaza. Moments later, a secondary explosion at the podium kills and injures numerous people.\n\nBefore the President takes the stage, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Thomas Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in an allegedly vacated building, and observes American tourist Howard Lewis filming the audience. After the President is shot, Barnes tackles a man named Enrique rushing to the podium. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN studio to view their footage. He receives a call from another Secret Service agent, who reports he is pursuing the suspected assassin; Barnes is then startled by an image from GNN's live feed.\n\nEnrique, a Spanish police officer guarding the Mayor, overhears his girlfriend Veronica being embraced by a stranger and plan to meet later under an overpass. Enrique confronts Veronica, who assures him of her love as he hands her a bag. When the President is shot, Enrique rushes to protect the Mayor but is tackled by Barnes. Enrique witnesses Veronica toss the bag under the podium, causing the second explosion. Escaping the Secret Service, Enrique confronts an unseen individual at the overpass.\n\nIn the crowd, Howard Lewis chats with a man called Sam, while a little girl named Anna bumps into him. Lewis notices Barnes looking at the nearby window, and films him with his camcorder. Following the explosion at the podium, Lewis chases Enrique and the pursuing Secret Service agents. At the overpass, Lewis views the agents from afar shooting at Enrique as he greets an individual in a police uniform under the overpass. Wounded, Enrique falls to the ground. As a speeding ambulance is about to hit Anna, Lewis runs into the road after her.\n\nPreviously, Ashton, having been informed of a credible threat, returns to his hotel room while his [[Political decoy|body double]] proceeds to the plaza. Ashton and his personnel discuss the reason and origin for the terrorists' plot, and the return of Barnes to active duty; they watch on TV the double being shot and the first explosion. One adviser is intent on Ashton giving immediate order for retaliation against the village of origin of the terrorists they are aware of, when the second explosion shatters the room's windows. The staffer insists in earnest on retaliation, but Ashton refuses, so the negotiations can continue. A masked assailant bursts into the room, shoots the advisers, and abducts Ashton.\n\nAt the plaza, terrorist Suarez, previously seen as Sam, shoots Ashton's body double using a remote-controlled automatic rifle placed adjacent to the window that drew Barnes' attention. The rifle is retrieved by Secret Service agent Kent Taylor, who Barnes sees on the GNN live feed leaving the scene wearing a Spanish police uniform. Barnes realizes that Taylor, who happens to be his partner, is part of the terror plot. The man Enrique saw embracing Veronica is revealed to be sharpshooter Javier, whose brother is being held hostage by the terrorists to ensure Javier's cooperation. The explosion at the hotel is detonated by a suicide bomber disguised as a bellhop, who gave Javier a room key. At the hotel, Javier kills the guards and aides and kidnaps the president, placing him in an ambulance with Suarez and Veronica disguised as medics. Javier joins Taylor in a police car to rendezvous at the overpass. Barnes commandeers a car in pursuit, but gets into a collision.\n\nAt the overpass, Enrique, who did not die in the blast at the podium as intended, confronts Javier and Taylor. Javier shoots Enrique, mistakenly believing he had knowledge of his brother's whereabouts. Javier is shot dead by Taylor after demanding to be brought to his brother, killed earlier by Suarez. Enrique dies of his wounds as Barnes reaches the scene and fires at Taylor, who attempts to flee. After crashing his car, a critically injured Taylor is dragged out by Barnes, furious at his partner's betrayal, before he dies right before revealing the President's whereabouts. Ashton regains consciousness in the ambulance and attacks Veronica, distracting her and Suarez as Anna runs into their path. Suarez swerves, causing the ambulance to flip over as Lewis pulls Anna out of its way. Barnes runs to the ambulance where he sees Veronica lying dead. He shoots and kills Suarez before rescuing the President.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Thomas Barnes\n* [[William Hurt]] as President Henry Ashton\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as Kent Taylor\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Howard Lewis\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Sam / Suarez\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Rex Brooks\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Javier\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as Veronica\n* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Enrique\n* [[Richard T.
