It is the first [[sequel]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the second film in the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]]. Set [[Psycho (1960 film)|22 years after the first film]], it follows [[Norman Bates]] after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him as someone begins to murder the people around him. The film is unrelated to the 1982 novel ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], which he wrote as a sequel to his original 1959 novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a student of Hitchcock's, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklin's American feature film debut.<ref name=afi/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was released on June 3, 1983, and grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=June 3, 2018|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho2.htm|title=Psycho II}}</ref> It received mixed-to-positive reviews from film critics. The film was followed by ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986).\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty-two years after [[Psycho (1960 film)|his killing spree]], [[Norman Bates]] is deemed mentally sound and released from a mental institution, despite the protests of [[Marion Crane]]'s sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]]. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman moves to his old home behind the Bates Motel and starts working in a nearby diner. A young waitress there, Mary, gets thrown out of her boyfriend's place and Norman offers her to stay at his home. He later discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, is dealing drugs and fires him.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to go well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" everywhere he goes. A drunk Toomey later picks a fight with Norman, who suspects him of leaving the messages. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress kills Toomey.\n\nOne night, after hearing voices in the house, Norman enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was twenty-two years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. A female figure later appears in front of two nearby teenagers and kills one. The second one, however, escapes. In the attic, Mary finds Norman, who shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff later questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. Norman fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary meets with Lila, her mother. The two have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norman's mother. Mary altered his mother's bedroom and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive him insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers that Mary is Lila's daughter and suspects the two women must be the ones harassing Norman. Norman does not buy it, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary, who says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse. Lila, however, will not stop.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from the cellar, a shadowy figure murders her. Meanwhile, the police find Toomey's body. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. He answers the phone and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with him. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, she runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother in a bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary accidentally plunges a knife into his heart.\n\nConfronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity finally snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Backing into the fruit cellar, she stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. In light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as his mother, the police incorrectly determine Mary committed all the murders.\n\nLater, [[Emma Spool]], another waitress from the diner, visits Norman and informs him that she is his real mother. Mrs. Bates was her sister and adopted Norman as an infant while Emma was institutionalized. Emma reveals that she was the real murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman kills her and carries the body to Mother's room. He begins talking to himself in her voice, as the \"Mother\" personality once again takes control of his mind.\n\n[[File:Anthony Perkins (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Anthony Perkins]] in 1983]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]]\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Dr. Bill Raymond\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Mary Loomis\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Warren Toomey\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]]\n* Ben Hartigan as Judge\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* Jill Caroll as Kim\n* Tim Maier as Josh\n* [[Oz Perkins]] as Young Norman Bates\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1982, author [[Robert Bloch]] published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films.
