Looking for more money to pursue opening a restaurant on [[St. Croix, Virgin Islands]], she decides to give the job a shot despite knowing nothing of basketball. She contacts the correct people and is given the job.\n\nShe shows up for her first day on the job and the team is already skeptical of her. When she walks in, she lets basketball players run the team, calling their own fouls, running their own plays, and basically allowing them to be carefree. During a game, she makes some bad decisions which irks some of the players on the team. This inspires her to learn more about the game with the assistance of her players. They help her and the team begins to slowly find success.\n\nThe team also has to deal with outside forces that threaten the team. Tyrik \"Shorty Doo-Wop\" Russell is on probation and eventually gets into more trouble. Spaceman is also on probation, is constantly using drugs, and has trouble with a teacher. Busy-bee got shot during the season and misses several games.\n\nSeveral other players are having academic trouble and some don't even get along with each other. The team also find out that the coach only plans to stay with them one season and then leave to open a restaurant.\n\nThe team eventually comes together despite their differences and troubles. They end up with very successful season, and get into the city championship. They go to [[Madison Square Garden]] to face their opponent (Washington Heights) and lose by a small margin. Afterward, the coach informs them that they should be proud of themselves and that she will return next season.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Phyllis Saroka, a [[physical education]] coach who takes a job coaching boys basketball at Sunset Park. First, she takes the job to earn extra money for a year to open a restaurant but begins to become close to the team and eventually helps make them successful. She informs the team she will return next season after the city championships.\n* [[Fredro Starr]] as Tyrik \"Shorty Doo-Wop\" Russell, the leader of the Sunset Park basketball team. He becomes the closest to the new coach and helps her out the most. He turns on her once he finds out about her restaurant plan and begins acting out. He then comes back to lead the team.\n* [[Terrence Howard|Terrence DaShon Howard]] as \"Spaceman\", a care-free, weed smoking, quiet member of the team and a close friend of Shorty. He eventually becomes a key component of the team on the inside. He has conflict with a teacher as the film progresses, and his friendship with Shorty is tested when Shorty begins acting out.\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Mona, Phyllis's best friend who supports all of Phyllis's decisions and brags about her achievements to others.\n* [[Camille Saviola]] as Barbara, a lawyer and friend of Phyllis. At Phyllis's request, she defends Shorty when he gets into legal trouble. She gets very angry when she finds out Shorty actually committed the crime he was accused of and she got him off the charges.\n* [[De'aundre Bonds]] as \"Busy-Bee\", the undersized youngest player on the team. He is very supportive of the team and his teammates. He yearns to play but does not get very many chances to do so as he got shot while somebody tried to steal his coat. When he returns, he is given the chance to play and becomes successful.\n* James Harris as \"Butter\", the main post player on the team. He is a ladies man and is constantly bragging about how many women he has and has had in the past.\n* [[Antwon Tanner]] as \"Drano\", a guard who at first is scared to shoot the ball despite having good shooting skills. He is eventually given the confidence to shoot more and becomes a long-range threat for the team. He is also seen as the smart guy of the team because of his excellent school work. He is actually seen tutoring other team members.\n* Anthony Hall as Andre, a member of the team who takes a free throw at Madison Square Gorden which he misses.\n* [[Shawn Michael Howard]] as Kurt\n* [[Guy Torry]] as \"Boo Man\", a comedic character and heckler in the crowd during Sunset Park's games. He is constantly making fun of the players, their game, and the coach. Later in the film, however, he becomes more positive and supportive of the team.\n* [[John Vargas]] as Mr. Santiago, the principal that acts as a minor antagonist to both the coach and the players.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sunset_park/ |title = Sunset Park - Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[White savior narrative in film]]\n* [[List of hood films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0117784|title=Sunset Park}}\n*{{Mojo title|sunsetpark|Sunset Park}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|sunset_park|Sunset Park}}\n{{Danny DeVito}}\n{{Steve Gomer}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sunset Park (film)}}\n[[Category:1996 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American basketball films]]\n[[Category:American sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:1990s hip hop films]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steve Gomer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Danny DeVito]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Miles Goodman]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
