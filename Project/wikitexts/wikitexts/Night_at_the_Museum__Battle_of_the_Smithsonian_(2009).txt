The film stars [[Ben Stiller]] in the lead role, [[Amy Adams]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Christopher Guest]], [[Alain Chabat]], [[Jon Bernthal]] and [[Robin Williams]]. It is the second installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' series]], following [[Night at the Museum|the original film]]. The film was released theatrically on May 22, 2009 by [[20th Century Fox]]. Like its predecessor, it received mixed reviews and became a box office success by grossing over $413 million on a $150 million budget.\n\nA live-action sequel, ''[[Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb]]'' was released on December 19, 2014, while an animated direct sequel, ''[[Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again]]'', is also scheduled to be released in 2022 for the streaming service [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events of the [[Night at the Museum|first film]], Larry Daley, a night guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], now runs his own [[direct response television]] company that sells inventions based on his museum experiences. One day he stops by the museum. Dr. McPhee says that most exhibits are being moved to the Federal Archives at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], being replaced with holographic information providers. Larry spends one last night with his exhibit friends. Shortly before dawn, [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] tells Larry that the Tablet of Ahkmenrah would be staying as one of the only original exhibits at the museum, along with Teddy, [[Tyrannosaurus|Rexy]], and Ahkmenrah himself. All of the other exhibits going to the Smithsonian (including the [[Attila|Huns]], [[Neanderthal]]s, miniatures, [[Sacagawea]], and [[Capuchin monkey|Dexter]]) would therefore lose the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved the following day, Larry surprisingly receives a phone call from Jedediah, who informs him that the monkey Dexter stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing the exhibits there to life as well. Hearing sounds of fighting and chaos as someone pulls Jed away from the phone, Larry travels to [[Washington, DC]], and navigates his way to the archives while posing as a night guard, with external help from his son Nick.\n\nAs it is still daytime, Larry finds his friends trapped in their [[shipping container]] while under attack from the army of Ahkmenrah's evil older brother Kahmunrah. Larry attempts to pry the tablet out of Dexter's hands, but right as he gets it, the sun goes down, the tablet activates, and the exhibits in the Smithsonian come to life again. Kahmunrah locks Larry's friends in the shipping container and reveals his plans to use the tablet's powers to conquer the world. However, Larry escapes with the aid of a gigantic octopus and a wax model of General [[George A. Custer]], although the latter is captured and imprisoned with Larry's friends.\n\nThen, a wax model of the adventurous [[Amelia Earhart]] becomes Larry's travelling companion around the museum as they try to figure out a way to rescue the others. The two evade Kahmunrah's army, eventually trapping them in the photograph of [[V-J Day in Times Square]]. As they are chased into the photo, Amelia and Larry are separated. Amelia's clothes and style help her fit in, but Larry is left coverless. He cuts in on the sailor and kisses with the nurse, becoming the main subject of the photo. Amelia then takes Larry out of the photo.\n\nMeanwhile, Kahmunrah enlists a trio of evil historical leaders \u2014 [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], and [[Al Capone]] \u2014 to help capture Larry and retrieve the tablet. Jedediah and Octavius escape the shipping container, but Jed is re-captured and placed in an hourglass while Octavius manages to make it outside. Kahmunrah is unable to open his Gate of the Underworld without the tablet, so he gives Larry and Amelia an hour to translate it, otherwise he will kill Larry and his friends, starting with Jed trapped in the hourglass. Larry and Amelia's friendship increases to the point where she develops a crush on him and ends up kissing him as three flying sculptures of [[Cupid]] look on while singing love songs. As Amelia kisses him, he wears a shocked expression. It subsides after a few moments, though. Larry is annoyed by the cupids, and confused about Amelia's actions. He doesn't know how to tell her she isn't real.\n\nLarry and Amelia decide to go to the [[National Air and Space Museum]] to find help, briefly encountering the statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], who confuses them for a couple. Meanwhile, Octavius makes it to the [[White House]] in an attempt to get help, but he is dragged away by a squirrel. Inside the Air and Space Museum, Larry has to ground all of the aircraft and rockets from taking off, before a group of [[Albert Einstein]] [[bobblehead]]s inform him that the combination he is looking for is the value of [[pi]]. Amelia tries to convince Larry for them to be a couple, but Larry struggles to tell her the truth that she is made of wax, so they cannot be together. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone's troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape using the [[Wright Flyer]]. They crash the plane into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the acquired combination to summon an army of [[Horus]] warriors. However, Octavius arrives and interrupts the process, having tamed the squirrel. Kahmunrah scoffs due to his small size, but then Octavius reveals that he did bring help as the statue of Lincoln crashes in through the window and frightens the warriors back into the Underworld. Lincoln cryptically reminds Larry that \"a house divided against itself cannot stand,\" and then returns to the Memorial.\n\nAs a furious Kahmunrah orders his allies to kill Larry and Jed anyway, Amelia gathers an army of allies including Larry's friends, Custer, and the other museum exhibits they had encountered, leading to a climactic battle. At first, Kahmunrah's alliance is too powerful, and Larry finds Custer hiding behind a pile of treasure, ashamed that he led Larry's friends to another tragic defeat like the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]]. However, Larry persuades him to forget the past and fight for his new friends now. As Octavius rescues Jedediah, the tide of the battle starts to turn back in their favor. Larry obtains the tablet, and devises a plan to stop Kahmunrah. Inspired by Lincoln's quote, Larry sparks a disagreement between Capone, Bonaparte, and Ivan, causing them to brawl amongst themselves. Larry attempts to escape, only to be cut off by an angry Kahmunrah, brandishing a [[khopesh]]. After a brief yet dramatic scuffle between Kahmunrah and Larry, armed with his flashlight, Amelia eventually manages to use the tablet to open the gate, and Larry defeats Kahmunrah and banishes him into the [[Duat|Underworld]].\n\nAmelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home. Even though Larry does love Amelia, they both know she has to leave, or she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian. She understands she can't be Larry's love interest because of this. However, the two share a final kiss before she takes off.\n \nTwo months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it and keep it open later into the night. All of the exhibits remain capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being [[animatronic]]s or hired [[Historical reenactment|re-enactors]]. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman named Tess who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museum's new extension of visiting hours.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:WilsonAdamsStillerMay09.jpg|thumb|right|Owen Wilson, Amy Adams and Ben Stiller at a panel for the film in May 2009.]]\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a night security guard and Amelia\u2019s love interest.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dr. McPhee, the curator at the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss.\n* [[Jake Cherry]] as Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley.\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Tess, a young woman at the end of the movie who looks like [[Amelia Earhart]].\n* [[Mindy Kaling]] as Docent\n* [[George Foreman]] as Himself\n* [[Shawn Levy]] as Infomercial Father\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Ed, Larry Daley's assistant\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Brandon (pronounced \"Brundon\"), a security guard at the Smithsonian\n\n===Exhibits===\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the wax statue of the 26th President of the United States.\n** Williams also voices the bronze bust of Theodore Roosevelt.\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Amelia Earhart]], the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, and Larry's love interest.\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Jedediah, a [[cowboy]] minifigure.\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Kahmunrah, a pharaoh who is Ahkmenrah's older brother. \n** Azaria also voices [[The Thinker]], a famous statue and [[Statue of Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|Abraham Lincoln]], a statue of the 16th President of the United States.\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as [[Ivan the Terrible]], the historic [[List of Russian rulers|Tsar of Russia]] who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the leader of the [[First French Empire]] who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as young [[Al Capone]], a photographic standee of the gangster and founder of the [[Chicago Outfit]] who allies with Kahmunrah.\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Octavius, a [[Roman legion|Roman soldier]] minifigure.\n* [[Mizuo Peck]] as [[Sacagawea]], the polyurethane model of the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman who is Theodore Roosevelt's girlfriend.\n* [[Bill Hader]] as [[George Armstrong Custer]], a military figure who Larry befriends.\n* [[Rami Malek]] as Ahkmenrah, a mummy of a pharaoh who is the benevolent younger brother of Kahmunrah.\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as [[Moai|Easter Island Head]] (voice)\n* Kerry van der Griend as [[Neanderthal]] #1\n* Matthew Harrison as Neanderthal #2\n* Rick Dobran as Neanderthal #3\n* Randy Lee as [[Huns|Hun]] #1\n* Darryl Quon as Hun #2\n* Gerald Wong as Hun #3\n* Paul Chih-Ping Cheng as Hun #4\n* [[Jonas Brothers]] as the Cherubs\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Joey Motorola, a [[sailor]] who resides in the [[V-J Day in Times Square]] photograph.\n* [[Alberta Mayne]] as [[Greta Zimmer Friedman]] (Kissing Nurse)\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as [[Albert Einstein]] Bobbleheads\n* [[Keith Powell]] as [[Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee Airman]] #1\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as [[Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee Airman]] #2\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Air and Space Mission Control Tech #1\n* Matty Finochio as Air and Space Mission Control Tech #2\n* [[Thomas Lennon]] as [[Wright brothers|Orville Wright]]\n* [[Robert Ben Garant]] as [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]]\n* [[Caroll Spinney]] as [[Oscar the Grouch]], the famous ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character that tries to ally with Kahmunrah only to be dismissed because he classified him as \"vaguely grouchy.\" This was his last film before his retirement from acting in 2018 and his death in 2019.\n* Thomas Morley as [[Darth Vader]], the famous ''[[Star Wars]]'' character that tries to ally with Kahmunrah only to be turned away because he classified him as \"dark.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1078912/fullcredits|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWriters [[Robert Ben Garant]] and [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] confirmed to Dark Horizons that they were writing a sequel to ''Night at the Museum,'' originally with the tentative title ''Another Night at the Museum''.
