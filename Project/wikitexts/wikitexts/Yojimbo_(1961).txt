While stopping at a farmhouse for water, he overhears an elderly couple lamenting that their only son, not wanting to waste his life as a farmer, has run off to join the \"gamblers\" who have descended on a nearby town overrun with criminals and divided between two rival bosses. The stranger heads to the town where he meets Gonji, the owner of a small ''[[izakaya]]'' who advises him to leave. He tells the r\u014dnin that the two warring bosses, Ushitora and Seibei, are fighting over the lucrative gambling trade run by Seibei; Ushitora had been Seibei's right-hand man, but rebelled when Seibei decided that his successor would be his son Yoichiro, a useless youth. The town's mayor, a silk merchant named Tazaemon, had long been in Seibei's pocket, so Ushitora aligned himself with the local [[sake]] brewer, Tokuemon, proclaiming him the new mayor. After sizing up the situation and recognizing that no one in town cares about ending the violence, the stranger says he intends to stay, as the town would be better off with both sides dead.\n\nHe first convinces the weaker Seibei to hire his services by effortlessly killing three of Ushitora's men. When asked his name, he sees a mulberry field and states his name is Kuwabatake Sanjuro ({{lang|ja|\u6851\u7551\u4e09\u5341\u90ce}}), where {{lang|ja|\u6851\u7551}} Kuwabatake = \"mulberry field\" and where {{lang|ja|\u4e09\u5341\u90ce}} Sanjuro (\"thirty-years-old\").{{efn|\u4e09\u5341\u90ce Sanjuro is a proper given name (and therefore could very well be the r\u014dnin's true name), but it can also be interpreted as meaning \"thirty-years-old\".}}\n\nSeibei decides that with the ronin's swordsmanship, the time is right to deal with Ushitora. However, Sanjuro eavesdrops on Seibei's wife, who orders Yoichiro to prove himself by killing the ronin after the upcoming raid, saving them from having to pay him. Sanjuro leads the attack on the other faction, but then \"resigns\" over Seibei's treachery, expecting both sides to massacre each other. His plan is foiled due to the unexpected arrival of a ''[[bugy\u014d]]'' (a government official), which gives both Seibei and Ushitora the opportunity to make a bloodless retreat and cease their war.\n \nThe ''bugy\u014d'' leaves soon after to investigate the murder of a fellow official in another town. Sanjuro soon realizes that Ushitora sent two men to commit the murder when he overhears them discussing it in Gonji's tavern. With this knowledge, Sanjuro captures the killers and sells them to Seibei, but then tells Ushitora that it was Seibei's men who caught them. An alarmed Ushitora rewards him generously for his help and orders the kidnapping of Yoichiro, whom he offers in exchange for the two prisoners. However, Ushitora double-crosses Seibei at the swap when his brother, Unosuke, shoots the assassins with a pistol; anticipating this, Seibei reveals he had ordered the kidnapping of Tokuemon\u2019s mistress. The next morning, she is exchanged for Yoichiro.\n\nSanjuro learns that the woman, Nui, is the wife of a local farmer who lost her to Ushitora over a gambling debt; Ushitora then gave her away as [[Personal property|chattel]] to Tokuemon in order to gain his support. Sanjuro tricks Ushitora into revealing the safe house where Nui is hidden, then kills the guards posted there and reunites the woman with her husband and son, ordering them to leave town immediately. Pretending to be on Ushitora's side, Sanjuro is able to convince Ushitora that Seibei is responsible for killing his men. The gang war escalates, with Ushitora burning down Tazaemon's silk warehouse and Seibei retaliating by trashing Tokuemon's brewery. After some time, Unosuke becomes suspicious of Sanjuro and the circumstances surrounding Nui's escape, eventually uncovering evidence of the ronin's betrayal. Sanjuro is severely beaten and imprisoned by Ushitora's thugs, who torture him to find out Nui's whereabouts.\n\nSanjuro manages to escape when Ushitora decides to eliminate Seibei once and for all. As he is being smuggled out of town in a coffin by Gonji, he witnesses the brutal end of Seibei and his family as their home is set on fire and they are all cut down while trying to surrender. Sanjuro recuperates in a small temple near a cemetery. However, when he learns that Gonji has been captured by Ushitora, he returns to town. Sanjuro confronts Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang, taking on all of them by himself in a duel and killing them easily. He spares only one terrified young man, who turns out to be the youth he met on the way into town, and sends him back to his parents. As Sanjuro surveys the damage, Tazaemon comes out of his home, in a samurai outfit and beating a prayer drum. Driven mad, he circles around town and then goes after Tokuemon, stabbing him to death. Sanjuro frees Gonji, proclaims that the town will be quiet from then on, and departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Toshiro Mifune]] as {{nihongo|\"Kuwabatake Sanjuro\"|\u6851\u7551 \u4e09\u5341\u90ce}}, a wandering ronin and master swordsman drawn into a gang war.\n* [[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as {{nihongo|Gonji|\u6a29\u723a}}, the [[izakaya]] (tavern) owner and the ronin's ally and confidant.\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as {{nihongo|Unosuke|\u536f\u4e4b\u52a9}}, a gun-toting gangster and younger brother to both Ushitora and Inokichi.\n* Seizaburo Kawazu as {{nihongo|Seibei|\u6e05\u5175\u885b}}, the original boss of the town's underworld.

It doesn\u2019t sound like ''Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s'', though, or ''Days of Wine and Roses''. The blaring Latin sound of ''Touch of Evil'' comes closer, but actually you wouldn\u2019t think of Mancini if you hadn\u2019t been told. Sato\u2019s effect has lots of drums, mixes traditional Japanese flutes and other instruments with American big band noises, and feels jaunty and jangling throughout, discreetly off, as if half the band was playing in the wrong key. It\u2019s distracting at first, then you realise it\u2019s not decoration, it\u2019s commentary. It\u2019s a companion to ''Sanjuro'', the sound of his mind, discordant and undefeated and unserious, even when he\u2019s grubby and silent and apparently solemn.<ref name=\"Books, Vol 2007, page 17\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Release==\n''Yojimbo'' was released in Japan on 25 April 1961.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=448}} The film was released by Seneca International in both a subtitled and dubbed format in the United States in September 1961.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=448}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Yojimbo'' was [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|Japan's fourth highest-grossing film]] of 1961, earning a [[theatrical rental|distribution rental]] income of {{JPY|351 million|link=yes}}.{{sfn|''Kinema Junpo''|2012|p=180}} This was equivalent to estimated [[box office]] gross receipts of approximately {{JPY|{{#expr:<!--rentals-->351*<!--1961 rental-receipts ratio-->(73003/38869) round 0}} million}}<ref name=\"Statistics\">{{cite web |title=Statistics of Film Industry in Japan |url=http://www.eiren.org/statistics_e/index.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:659/360 round 2}} million|long=no|link=yes}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Japan |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1971&locations=JP&start=1960 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1961 |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref>\n\nOverseas, the film had a September 1961 release in [[North America]], but the box office income of this release is currently unknown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yojimbo |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/releasegroup/gr895635973/ |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> At the 2002 Kurosawa & Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kurosawa & Mifune Festival |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/releasegroup/gr11096581/ |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> In South Korea, a 2012 re-release grossed {{KRW|1.566 million|link=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc601\ud654\uc815\ubcf4 |trans-title=Movie Information |url=http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do |website=KOFIC |publisher=[[Korean Film Council]] |language=ko |access-date=26 August 2019 }}</ref> ({{US$|{{To USD|1566000|KOR|year=2012|round=yes}}|long=no}}).\n\nIn Europe, a January 1991 limited French re-release sold 14,178 tickets,<ref>{{cite web |title=Yojimbo (1961) |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=20392 |website=JP's Box-Office |language=fr |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately {{Currency|{{#expr:14178*4.5 round 0}}|code=Euro|linked=yes}}<ref name=\"Europe\">{{cite book |chapter=Cinema market |title=Cinema, TV and radio in the EU: Statistics on audiovisual services (Data 1980-2002) |date=2003 |publisher=[[Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]] |isbn=92-894-5709-0 |issn=1725-4515 |pages=31\u201364 (61) |edition=2003 |chapter-url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5648553/KS-BT-03-001-EN.PDF/3758081d-5ae4-4e21-9d78-fca7bcc68d5c#page=67 |website=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> ($87,934).<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical currency converter with official exchange rates (EUR) |url=https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=63801&C1=EUR&C2=USD&DD=31&MM=01&YYYY=1991 |date=31 January 1991 |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> Other limited European re-releases sold 3,392 tickets between 2000 and 2018,<ref>{{cite web |title=Film #16103: Yojimbo |url=http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=16103 |website=[[Lumiere (database)|Lumiere]] |publisher=[[European Audiovisual Observatory]] |access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of at least {{Currency|{{#expr:3392*5.6 round 0}}|code=Euro}}<ref name=\"Europe\"/> ({{US$|{{To USD|18995|EUR|year=2008|round=yes}}|long=no}}).

In both films he takes his surname from the plants he happens to be looking at when asked his name: in ''Yojimbo'' it is the mulberry trees that feed the town's silkworms, and in ''Sanjuro'' it is camellia bushes used to make tea.{{sfn|Conrad|2022|p=}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Toshiro Mifune as a lone hero in Yojimbo (1961).jpg|thumb|left|Western-influencing cinematography; Toshiro Mifune as a lone hero in wide framing]]\n\nBoth in Japan and the West, ''Yojimbo'' has had an influence on various forms of entertainment.\n\nIn 1964, ''Yojimbo'' was [[remake|remade]] as ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a [[Spaghetti Western]] directed by [[Sergio Leone]] and starring [[Clint Eastwood]] in his first appearance as the [[Man with No Name]].{{sfn|Curti|2016|pp=25-26}} The film was followed by two prequels. The three films are collectively known as the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]''. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa's film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed ''Fistful''{{'}}s release in North America for three years. It would be settled out of court for an undisclosed agreement before the U.S. release.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2002|p=312}} In ''Yojimbo'', the [[protagonist]] defeats a man who carries a gun, while he carries only a knife and a sword; in the equivalent scene in ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Eastwood's [[pistol]]-wielding character survives being shot by a [[rifle]] by hiding an iron plate under his clothes to serve as a shield against bullets.\n\nA second, looser Spaghetti Western adaptation, ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'', was directed by [[Sergio Corbucci]] in 1966 and featured [[Franco Nero]] in [[Django (character)|the title role]]. Known for its high level (at the time of its release) of graphic violence, the film's character and title were referenced in two official films (a sequel and prequel) and over thirty unofficial ones.<ref name=Western>Marco Giusti, ''Dizionario del western all'italiana'', 1st ed.

In the film's third act, [[Luke Skywalker]]'s attire is visually reminiscent to that of Sanjuro's, both characters are also framed in [[Wide shot]] and are portrayed as ''lone heroes'' with both having to deal with a larger threat by themselves, Sanjuro confronts Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang while Luke confronts the entire [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]].
