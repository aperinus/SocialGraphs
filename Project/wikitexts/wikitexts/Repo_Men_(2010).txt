An American-Canadian production, it is based on the novel ''The Repossession Mambo'' by [[Eric Garcia (writer)|Eric Garcia]], and follows a repo man who goes on the run after he becomes the recipient of an artificial heart and finds himself suffering the same fate as his victims. The film was theatrically released on March 19, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2025, advancements in medical technology have perfected bio-mechanical organs. A corporation known as The Union sells these expensive \"artiforgs\" on credit, and when customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their artiforgs The Union sends \"repo men\" to locate and forcibly repossess the organ - invariably resulting in the death of the owner.\n\nRemy (Jude Law) and his partner, Jake Freivald (Forest Whitaker), are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Remy allows Jake to discreetly perform a repossession nearby, but is caught by Carol who leaves with Peter in anger.\nWhile patrolling with Jake, the duo discovers a \"nest\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and are attempting to escape the country. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves, impressing their boss, Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy declines and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg.\n\nCarol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake.  As he tries to go back to work, he realizes he's developed sympathy for the customers, unable to lie when he tries sales, but also unable to kill when repossessing their artiforgs. He's soon unable to make the payments on his heart and is in debt.  Jake discovers that Remy has not been repossessing and takes him to a \"nest\" with enough artiforgs to clear his debt; however, Remy cannot do the job. Furious, Jake demands he stay there until he gets over his inhibition. A stunned debtor wakes up and knocks Remy out.\n\nWaking up, Remy encounters Beth, a singer he would see while drinking in a bar with Jake. He takes her to a motel room and discovers she has numerous artiforgs. Breaking into the office, Remy attempts to clear Beth's and his own accounts, but he is interrupted by Jake, who lets him leave. On the run, Beth and Remy leave for the abandoned outskirts of the city. Beth tells Remy of how she contracted various diseases and was involved in a car crash, and was forced to resort to buying artiforgs on the black market after running up severe debts. They begin a relationship, and Remy decides to document his life as a repo man with an old typewriter Beth found. As he works on a manuscript, he is interrupted by a repo man. Remy sets a trap and the collector drops through a hole in the floor. Beth falls through the same hole, damaging her prosthetic knee. Before the collector can shoot Beth, Remy manages to kill him.\n\nRemy sneaks into his former workplace to obtain scanning jammers he had confiscated during his raid on the nest. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account, only to discover that accounts can now only be cleared at the Union's central office due to his earlier attempt. Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport, but security is alerted by bleeding from Beth's knee. A fight with airport security ensues. Jake arrives, but is on the other side of a security panel and watches their escape. They go to a [[black market]] doctor to replace Beth's knee.\n\nAfter the procedure, they are stopped by Jake who tries to convince Remy to rejoin him as a repo man. Remy refuses, and Jake reveals he rigged the defibrillator unit that caused his heart to fail, so Remy would continue to work with him. They fight, and Jake knocks Remy unconscious. Beth awakens Remy, saying she stunned Jake as an organ repossession raid is underway. They flee to an underground residence where Remy is subdued by a freedom fighter (Yvette Nicole Brown). Later Remy decides to delete the accounts of all implant clients. Remy meets Carol and Peter on a train one last time, passing on his manuscript to Peter.\n\nRemy and Beth break into Union headquarters and are forced to fight their way through the facility to the Union's database. Using Beth's prosthetic eye, they enter and seal themselves inside as Jake and Frank arrive. The server's only interface is an organ scanner, requiring Remy and Beth to cut themselves open to use the scanner internally on each of their artiforgs, clearing their accounts. Frank and Jake enter the server room using an artiforg from one of the slain repo men, finding Beth near death and Remy attempting to scan her heart. Jake is ordered to kill Remy, but he instead kills Frank and helps revive Beth. Jake tosses two grenades into the artiforg drawer of the server, with the explosion destroying the mainframe, wiping the records of everyone who has an account with the Union.\n\nLater, Remy is seen on a tropical beach, enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text has been published as a book, ''The Repossession Mambo''. While Remy talks to Jake, he notices that Jake suddenly disappears, leaving Remy's book on his chair; then Remy sees the beach flicker with static before returning to normal. It is revealed that Remy is in a coma, having sustained severe brain damage when Jake knocked him unconscious. Jake has paid off Remy's debt for his heart and also paid to link his brain to a neural network, allowing him to live out his life peacefully in a computer generated dream world. Beth is unconscious, and Jake says he will take care of her; he then says a sorrowful goodbye to Remy. The film ends with Frank delivering a sales pitch for the neural network.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jude Law]] as Remy, a repo man.\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Jake Freivald, Remy's partner. \n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Frank Mercer, Remy's boss.\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Beth, a singer who has multiple artificial organs.\n* [[Carice van Houten]] as Carol, Remy's wife.\n* [[Chandler Canterbury]] as Peter, Remy's son.\n* [[Rza|RZA]] as T-Bone, a soul musician in debt.\n* [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Rhodesia, the leader of an underground residence.\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Asbury, a black-market organs dealer.\n* [[Liza Lapira]] as Alva, a black-market surgeon's assistant.\n* [[Joe Pingue]] as Raymond Pearl, Remy's co-worker sent out to repo his heart.\n* [[Tiffany Espensen]] as Young Alva.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2007, screenwriters [[Eric Garcia (writer)|Eric Garcia]] and [[Garrett Lerner]] began working with Miguel Sapochnik on a screenplay based on a novel being written by Garcia.
