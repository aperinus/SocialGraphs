He meets socialite Leslie Lynnton, who quickly ends a budding relationship with a British diplomat. After a whirlwind romance, Leslie and Bick marry and return to the Benedicts' Texas cattle ranch, Reata. Leslie has difficulty adjusting to her new life. Bick's older sister, Luz, runs the household and resents Leslie's intrusion. Leslie soon learns that she, like the other women, is expected to be subservient in the male-dominated Texas culture. Jett Rink, a ranch hand, becomes infatuated with Leslie. When Jett drives her around the county, Leslie observes the Mexican workers' terrible living conditions. She presses Bick to help improve their situation.\n\nLuz is killed while riding Leslie's horse, War Winds, being bucked off after digging in her spurs as a hostile act towards Leslie. Luz leaves a small piece of Benedict land to Jett. Bick, who despises Jett, offers to buy the property at twice its value, but Jett refuses to sell and names his land 'Little Reata'.\n\nLeslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III (\"Jordy\") and Judy and later have another daughter, Luz II. Bick continually favors his young son and pushes him into masculine pursuits, which the youngster resists. The marriage becomes strained, and Leslie takes the children to her parents for an extended visit. Bick goes to Maryland, and he and Leslie reconcile and return to Texas.\n\nJett continues working his land, eventually striking oil. Covered in crude, he drives to the Benedict house and proclaims he will be richer than them. Jett makes a pass at Leslie, leading to a brief fistfight with Bick before he drives off. Jett prospers over the years. He tries to persuade Bick to let him drill for oil on Reata. Bick, determined to preserve his family's cattle ranching legacy, refuses.\n\nYears later, now 1941, tensions arise regarding the now-grown Benedict children. Bick intends that Jordy will succeed him and run the ranch, but Jordy wants to become a doctor. Leslie plans for Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, but she wants to study [[animal husbandry]] at Texas Tech. Each sibling successfully convinces one parent to persuade the other to allow them to pursue their own goals.\n\nAt the family Christmas party, Bick wants Judy's new husband, Bob Dace, to work on the ranch after he returns from World War II. Dace declines, saying he and Judy want to build their own life. Jett persuades Bick to allow oil drilling on his land. Realizing that his children will not take over the ranch when he retires, Bick agrees. Once oil production starts on the ranch, the Benedicts grow wealthier and more powerful.\n\nThe Benedict\u2013Rink rivalry reaches a head when the Benedicts discover that Luz II has been having a secret romantic relationship with the much older Jett. At his Austin hotel, Jett hosts a huge party in his own honor. The Benedicts are guests, but Jett will not allow staff to serve Jordy's Mexican wife, Juana. Enraged, Jordy starts and loses a fight with Jett, who then has Jordy thrown out. Bick challenges Jett, but seeing that the drunken Jett is in no state to defend himself, he and the other Benedicts leave. Jett staggers into the banquet hall and sits in the seat of honor. He passes out as he attempts to give his speech  in front of the packed ballroom. Later, Luz II hears the slumped over Jett bemoaning his unrequited love for Leslie and leaves heartbroken; Jett topples over in a stupor and falls onto the floor.\n\nDriving home the next day, the Benedicts stop at a diner. A sign at the counter states, \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone,\" meaning ethnic minorities are unwelcome. Sarge, the racist owner, insults Juana and her and Jordy's young son. When Sarge ejects a Mexican family from the diner, Bick says to leave them alone. Bick fights Sarge, who beats him and then tosses the sign onto Bick. Back at Reata, Bick laments failing to preserve the Benedict family legacy. Leslie replies that, after the diner fight, he was her hero for the first time. She considers their own family legacy a success. They look at their two grandchildren, one Caucasian and one Hispanic.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Leslie Lynnton Benedict\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Jordan \"Bick\" Benedict Jr.\n* [[James Dean]] as Jett Rink\n* [[Jane Withers]] as Vashti Hake Snyth, the Benedicts' neighbor\n* [[Robert Nichols (actor)|Robert Nichols]] as Mort \"Pinky\" Snyth, Vashti's husband\n* [[Chill Wills]] as Uncle Bawley, Bick's uncle\n* [[Mercedes McCambridge]] as Luz Benedict, Bick's sister\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Luz Benedict II, Leslie and Bick's daughter\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Jordan \"Jordy\" Benedict III, Leslie and Bick's son\n* Fran Bennett as Judy Benedict, Leslie and Bick's daughter\n* [[Earl Holliman]] as Robert \"Bob\" Dace, Judy's husband\n* [[Elsa C\u00e1rdenas]] as Juana Villalobos Benedict, Jordan III's wife\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Leslie's father\n* [[Judith Evelyn]] as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Leslie's mother\n* [[Carolyn Craig]] as Lacy Lynnton, Leslie's sister\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Sir David Karfrey, Lacy's husband\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as \u00c1ngel Obreg\u00f3n II\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nFerber's character of Jordan Benedict II and her description of the Reata Ranch were based on [[King Ranch|Robert \"Bob\" J. Kleberg Jr. (1896\u20131974) and the King Ranch]] in [[Kingsville, Texas]]. Like the over half-million-acre Reata, King Ranch comprises 825,000 acres (3,340&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; 1,289&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and includes portions of six Texas counties, including most of [[Kleberg County]] and much of [[Kenedy County]], and was largely a livestock ranch before the discovery of oil. The fictional character Jett Rink was inspired partly by the extraordinary rags-to-riches life story of the wildcatter oil tycoon [[Glenn Herbert McCarthy]] (1907\u20131988). Author Edna Ferber met McCarthy when she was a guest at his Houston, Texas, [[Shamrock Hotel]] (known as the Shamrock Hilton after 1955), the fictional Emperador Hotel in both the book and the film.\n\n===Casting===\nThe Australian actor [[Rod Taylor]] was cast in one of his early Hollywood roles after being seen in an episode of ''[[Studio 57]]'', titled \"The Black Sheep's Daughter\".<ref>Stephen Vagg, ''Rod Taylor: An Australian in Hollywood'', Bear Manor Media, 2010 p49</ref>\n\nStevens gave Hudson a choice between [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Grace Kelly]] to play the leading lady Leslie.

Both productions focus on the struggle between wealthy oilmen and cattlemen in Texas in the mid to late 20th century. In addition, both productions have an antagonist with the initials J.R.<ref>Gary M. Cramer, \"'Giant': A giant book about a giant film,\" Philadelphia Inquirer, May 3, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, [[Martin Scorsese]] wrote about the movie as a guilty pleasure:\n<blockquote> I've seen this film over forty times. I don't like the obvious romanticism, and it's very studied, but there's more here than people have seen. It has to do with the depiction of a life style through the passage of so many years. You see people grow. I like James Dean; I like the use of music, even though Dimitri Tiomkin did it; I like Boris Leven's image of the house, and the changes in the house; I like the wide image of Mercedes McCambridge riding the bronco, then cut to an extreme closeup of her hitting the bronc with her spur, then back to the wide image. As far as filmmaking goes, ''Giant'' is an inspiring film. I don't mean morally, but visually. It's all visual.<ref>Martin Scorsese's Guilty Pleasures\nScorsese, Martin. Film Comment; New York Vol. 14, Iss. 5, (Sep/Oct 1978): 63-66</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe making of ''Giant'' was the background to the [[Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|play]] and [[Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|movie]] ''Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n*[[List of American films of 1956]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.
