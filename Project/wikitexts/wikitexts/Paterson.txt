Every day follows much the same pattern: Paterson gets up early and goes to work, where he listens to passengers talking and, during pauses, writes poetry in a notebook he carries with him. After work he walks Marvin, his wife's dog, and stops for a beer at Shades Bar, where he interacts with the other patrons and the owner, Doc ([[Barry Shabaka Henley]]).\n\nPaterson's wife, Laura, loves his poems and is apparently their only audience. She has long urged him to publish them or at least make copies. He finally promises to go to the copy shop on the weekend. But when Paterson and Laura come home from a movie on Saturday night, they find that Marvin has shredded his notebook, destroying his poems.\n\nThe next day, a dejected Paterson goes for a walk and sits down at his favorite site, the [[Great Falls (Passaic River)|Great Falls of the Passaic River]]. There, a Japanese man ([[Masatoshi Nagase]]) takes a seat beside him and begins a conversation about poetry after Paterson notices that the man is reading the book-length poem ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'' by [[William Carlos Williams]]. The man seems to know that Paterson himself is a poet even though he denies it and hands him a gift, an empty notebook. The film ends with Paterson writing a poem in his new notebook.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Paterson\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Laura\n* [[William Jackson Harper]] as Everett\n*

The story builds to an accidental circumstance that, on the surface, might not seem like a big deal\u2014but in the context of Paterson\u2019s tiny universe, resonates with tragic connotations. The brilliantly cryptic finale explores what it means to work back from personal setbacks to find a new source of inspiration. It\u2019s an apt statement from Jarmusch, a filmmaker who continues to surprise and innovate while remaining true to his singular voice, and who here seems to have delivered its purest manifestation.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/05/cannes-review-adam-driver-stars-in-jim-jarmuschs-paterson-his-most-intimate-film-290526/ |title=Cannes Review: Adam Driver Stars in Jim Jarmusch's 'Paterson,' His Most Intimate Film |website=[[Indiewire]] |first=Eric |last=Kohn |date=May 15, 2016|access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> [[David Edelstein]] noted the film's unreality, writing: \"What Jarmusch hasn't attempted in his Paterson is to explore the part of the city that was called, when Williams wrote about it, 'the slums.' Perhaps he felt that abject poverty wouldn't suit his slightly ironic distance, that it would rip the film's fragile fabric. It might have, but without that edge this Paterson comes close to seeming twee, like one of Wes Anderson's dollhouse communities. The poems make all the difference, transforming the most amorphous yearnings into something hard and beautiful and real.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=''Paterson'' Evokes the Inner World of the Artist But Flirts With Twee |first=David |last=Edelstein |work=New York Magazine |date=December 26, 2016 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/12/movie-review-paterson.html |accessdate=September 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
