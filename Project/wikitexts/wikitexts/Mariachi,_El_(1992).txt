It marked the feature-length debut of Rodriguez as writer and director. The [[Spanish language]] film was shot with a mainly amateur cast in the northern [[Mexico|Mexican]] border town of [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]], [[Coahuila]], Mexico across from [[Del Rio, Texas]], the home town of leading actor [[Carlos Gallardo (actor)|Carlos Gallardo]] as the title character. The [[United States dollar|US$]]7,225 production was originally intended for the Mexican home-video market, but executives at [[Columbia Pictures]] liked the film and bought the American distribution rights. Columbia eventually spent $200,000 to transfer the print to film, to remix the sound, and on other post-production work, then spent millions more on marketing and distribution.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/25/paranormal-activity-box-office-profit|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Paranormal Activity and the myth of the shoestring shocker|date=November 25, 2009|access-date=May 1, 2010|first=Tom|last=Shone|archive-date=October 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022064329/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/25/paranormal-activity-box-office-profit|url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe success of Rodriguez's directorial debut led him to create two sequels (''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'') with [[Antonio Banderas]] taking over from Gallardo for the character, though Gallardo co-produced both films and had a minor role in ''Desperado''.\n\nIn 2011, ''El Mariachi'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=2011 National Film Registry More Than a Box of Chocolates|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/2011-national-film-registry-more-than-a-box-of-chocolates/2011-12-28/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114151454/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-11-240/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191832/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] as the lowest-budgeted film ever to gross $1 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/2/academy-awards-2015-the-guinness-world-records-alternative-oscars-373083|title=Oscars 2015: The Guinness World Records alternative Academy Awards|date=February 20, 2015|website=Guinness World Records|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-date=December 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225224831/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/2/academy-awards-2015-the-guinness-world-records-alternative-oscars-373083|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter breaking out of jail in a small Mexican town, a ruthless criminal, nicknamed Azul, ventures off with a guitar case full of weapons and vows revenge on the local [[drug lord]], Moco, who had him arrested in the first place. Meanwhile, a young musician arrives in town carrying his own guitar case which contains his signature guitar. He hopes to find work in the town in order to pursue his dream of becoming a mariachi like his father.\n\nFrom the confines of his heavily guarded villa on the outskirts of town, Moco sends a large group of [[Hitman|hitmen]] to kill Azul. They are told to look for a man who is wearing black and carrying a guitar case, but because the Mariachi also matches this description, the hitmen mistake him for Azul and start pursuing him. Only Moco, however, knows Azul's actual face. The Mariachi is then forced to kill four of the attackers in self-defense after being chased through the streets. As the Mariachi seeks refuge in a bar owned by a beautiful woman named Domin\u00f3, he quickly falls in love with her. Unfortunately, Moco is not only financing the bar, but also has his own romantic interest in Domin\u00f3.\n\nWhen Azul visits the bar for a beer and information about Moco, he accidentally leaves with the Mariachi's guitar case. Moco's thugs capture Azul on the street but release him when they learn that the case he is carrying contains only a guitar. A short time later, the Mariachi is captured and taken to Moco, who identifies him as the wrong man and sets him free.\n\nMeanwhile, Azul, who has no directions to Moco's home, takes Domin\u00f3 with him and orders her to take him to Moco's, or Moco will kill the mariachi. Domin\u00f3 agrees to save the Mariachi's life. When they arrive at Moco's gated compound, Azul pretends to take Domin\u00f3 hostage in order to gain entry. Moco soon realizes that Domin\u00f3 has fallen for the Mariachi and, in a fit of rage, shoots both her and Azul. Suddenly, the Mariachi arrives to find the woman he loves gunned down. Moco then shoots the Mariachi's left hand, rendering him useless as a guitar player, and proceeds to taunt and laugh at the Mariachi. Overcome with grief and rage, the Mariachi picks up Azul's gun with his right hand and kills Moco, avenging Domin\u00f3's death. Moco's surviving henchmen, seeing their leader dead, walk off carelessly and leave Moco's body and the wounded Mariachi behind.\n\nThe Mariachi leaves the town on Domin\u00f3's motorbike, taking her [[pit bull]] and her letter-opener as mementos of her. His dreams to become a mariachi have been shattered, and his only protection for his future are Azul's former weapons, which he takes along in the guitar case. He rides off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carlos Gallardo (actor)|Carlos Gallardo]] as \"El Mariachi\"\n* Consuelo G\u00f3mez as Domin\u00f3\n* [[Peter Marquardt]] as Mauricio \"Moco\"\n* Reinol Mart\u00ednez as \"Azul\"\n* Jaime de Hoyos as \"Bigot\u00f3n\"\n* [[Edith Gonz\u00e1lez|Edith Gonzalez]] as Electra\n* Ramiro G\u00f3mez as The Waiter\n* Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Viejo as The Clerk\n* Luis Baro as Domin\u00f3's Assistant\n* \u00d3scar Fabila as The Boy\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in numerous locations in [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]], [[Coahuila]], located in Northeastern Mexico adjacent to [[Del Rio, Texas]]. The film used [[16 mm film]] and was shot in 14 days.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kempley |first=Rita |date=1993-04-03 |title=THE AMATEUR AUTEUR |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/04/03/the-amateur-auteur/dbaa4c1a-c3f7-419b-bbfa-fde8d41811b7/ |access-date=2022-03-17 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Rodriguez had a $7,000 budget, almost half of which he raised by participating in experimental clinical drug testing while living in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=garage>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1993/film_for_song.php|title=Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi - Filmmaker Magazine - Winter 1993|website=www.filmmakermagazine.com|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-date=December 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225224726/https://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter1993/film_for_song.php|url-status=live}}</ref> The opening scenes, featuring a shootout in a jail, were filmed at the local Acu\u00f1a jail situated on the outskirts of the town.<ref name=dvdcom/> The female warden and the male guard were the real-life warden and guard; Rodriguez thought it was convenient because it saved him the cost of hiring actors and renting clothing.<ref name=dvdcom/> The intro bar scene was shot inside the Corona Club and exterior street scenes were shot on Hidalgo Street. The shootout was filmed outside at \"Boy's Town\", the local red-light district.\n\nNot everyone in Acu\u00f1a was pleased with the filming. Local journalists Ramiro G\u00f3mez and Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Viejo were especially critical of the filming, and to win them over, Rodriguez gave them small parts in the film.<ref name=dvdextra/> Due to the high body count of the film, Rodriguez increasingly had difficulties finding adult men to play thugs, as dead characters obviously could not return; for that reason, when the Mariachi meets Moco's gang at the end of the film, the gang consists mainly of teenagers.<ref name=dvdcom/>\n\nOn the ''El Mariachi'' DVD, Rodriguez devotes both a DVD commentary and an \"Extras\" section to explaining the tricks of filming a feature-length film with just $7,000. Rodriguez heavily stresses the need for cost cutting, \"because if you start to spend, you cannot stop anymore.\"<ref name=dvdextra>''El Mariachi'' DVD extras</ref> This is why he cut costs at every possible opportunity. He did not use a [[Clapperboard|slate]]; the actors, instead, signaled the number of scene and number of take with their fingers. He did not use a [[Tracking shot|dolly]], and instead held the camera while being pushed around in a [[wheelchair]]. He did not use synchronised sound; rather, he shot the film silent, then recorded on-set audio so it could be synced in post-production. Professional lighting was replaced by two 200-watt clip-on desk lamps. No [[film crew]] was hired; actors not in the scenes helped out instead.<ref name=dvdextra/> Rodriguez believed in filming scenes sequentially in one long take with a single camera; every few seconds, he froze the action, so he could change the camera angle and make it appear that he used multiple cameras simultaneously.<ref name=dvdcom>''El Mariachi'' DVD commentary</ref> [[Blooper]]s were kept in to save film: Rodriguez is visible on a bus with the Mariachi; the Mariachi bumps his weapon into a street pole; he fails to throw his guitar case on a balcony; and Domin\u00f3 twitches her face when she is already dead.<ref name=dvdextra/> Rodriguez spared expense by shooting on 16&nbsp;mm film as opposed to [[35mm movie film|35 mm]], and transferred the film to [[video]] for editing, avoiding the costs of cutting on film.<ref name=dvdextra/> In the end, he used only 24 rolls of film<ref name=dvdextra/> and only spent $7,225 of the $9,000 he had planned.<ref name=garage/>\n\nRodriguez gave insight into his low budget approach to simulate machine gun fire. The problem was that when using real guns, as opposed to the specially designed [[blank (cartridge)|blank]] firing firearms used in most films, the blanks would jam the weapon after being fired once. To solve this, Rodriguez filmed the firing of one blank from different angles, dubbed canned machine gun sounds over it, and had the actors drop bullet shells to the ground to make it look like as if multiple rounds had been shot.<ref name=dvdextra/> In addition, he occasionally used water guns instead of real guns to save money.<ref name=dvdextra/> The [[bullet hit squib|squibs]] used in shootout scenes were simply condoms filled with fake blood and fixed over [[weightlifting belt]]s.<ref name=dvdcom/>\n\nSeveral aspects of the film were improvised. The tortoise that crawls in front of the Mariachi was not planned, but was kept in anyways.<ref name=dvdcom/> Similarly, there is a scene in which the Mariachi buys a coconut, but Rodriguez forgot to show him paying for the fruit; instead of driving back to the place to shoot additional scenes, Rodriguez decided to build in a voice-over in which the Mariachi asserts that the coconuts were for free.<ref name=dvdcom/> Improvisation was also useful to cover up continuity mistakes: at the end of the movie, the Mariachi has his left hand shot, but Rodriguez forgot to bring the metal glove to cover up the actor's hand; he solved it by packing his hand with black duct tape.<ref name=dvdextra/>\n\nIn the DVD commentary, Rodriguez describes the acting of Peter Marquardt who portrayed gangster boss Moco. As the language of the film was Spanish, which Marquardt did not master, he had to learn his lines without understanding what he was saying.<ref name=dvdcom/> The [[running gag]], in which Moco lights up his match using the [[moustache]] of his henchman Bigot\u00f3n, was described by Rodriguez as a means to start and end the film: the end scene is a [[parody]] of this scene. When Moco was hit in the chest in the final shooting, Marquardt's blood squib exploded with such force that he actually crumpled to the ground in pain.<ref name=dvdcom/>\n\nOriginally, the film was meant to be sold on the Latino video market as funding for another bigger and better project that Rodriguez was contemplating. However, after being rejected from various Latino straight-to-video distributors, Rodriguez decided to send his film (it was in the format of a trailer at the time) to bigger distribution companies where it started to get attention.\n\nWhen the sequel ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' was produced, [[Antonio Banderas]] replaced Gallardo as the actor for the main character of the series. The filmmakers re-shot the final showdown from ''El Mariachi'' as a flashback sequence for Banderas' character in ''Desperado''.\n\n===Music===\nFor the scene in which the Mariachi delivers a song in front of Domin\u00f3, Rodriguez hired Juan Francisco Suarez Vidaurri, a local entertainer. Recording the song with little more than a microphone held next to the musician, Rodriguez pitched the voice to match the voice of Mariachi actor Carlos Gallardo.<ref name=dvdextra/>\nCo-composer Chris Knudson has gone on to produce and release albums under the monikers Val Holler, LightBody Sound and Kanude.  His song \"Wheels\" from the 2008 Kanude debut album was featured in Season 4, Episode 2 of HBO's series \"True Blood.\"\n\n===Book===\nThe story of the film's production inspired Rodriguez to write the book ''[[Rebel Without a Crew|Rebel Without a Crew: Or How a 23-Year-Old Filmmaker with $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player]]''.\n\n==Television adaptation==\nSony's [[AXN]] channel confirmed that it would air TV series adaptation called ''[[El Mariachi\u00a0(2014 TV series)|El Mariachi]]''.
