The film's story revolves around a young woman who is abducted and tortured by a sadistic serial killer. After surviving the abduction, she insists that her identity is that of another woman.\n\n''I Know Who Killed Me'' was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on July 27, 2007, and was deemed a critical and commercial box office failure and it has since been called [[List of films considered the worst#I Know Who Killed Me (2007)|one of the worst films ever made]]. The film was the most awarded at the [[28th Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning eight of nine nominations, including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and Lohan tying with herself to win [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] as well as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple|Worst Screen Couple]] for both characters she portrayed. It did, however, attain a more successful [[home video]] performance, having almost quadrupled its U.S. box office gross in estimated domestic DVD sales. The film subsequently developed a [[cult following]] and several screenings of it have been put together by historic theaters and film festivals.\n\n==Plot==\nThe quiet suburb of New Salem is being terrorized by a serial killer who abducts and tortures young women, holding them captive for weeks before murdering them. Aubrey Fleming, a pianist and aspiring writer, appears to be his latest victim when she disappears during a night out with her friends. She is later seen bound and gagged on an operating table as her hands are exposed to [[dry ice]]. As the days tick by, the special FBI Task Force convened to track the killer begins to lose hope of finding him before it's too late.\n\nLate one night, a driver discovers a young woman by the side of a deserted road, disheveled and seriously wounded, with one of her hands and legs [[amputation|amputated]]. The girl, who looks identical to Aubrey, is rushed to the hospital, where Aubrey's distraught parents, Susan and Daniel, wait by her side as she slips in and out of consciousness. When she is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a down-on-her-luck [[stripper]] named Dakota Moss. Convinced Aubrey is suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], her doctors, parents, and law enforcement officials can only wait for rest and therapy to restore her memory. But after returning to her parent's suburban home, she continues to insist she is not who they think she is.\n\nAn FBI psychologist believes Dakota to be a [[Delusional disorder|delusional]] [[persona]] of Aubrey, and the agents speculate the persona functions to distance and protect Aubrey from the events that happened. Examining Aubrey's [[laptop]], they discover a [[short story]] about a girl with an identical twin sister named Dakota. In addition, a [[DNA]] test confirms that Dakota is Aubrey. Nonetheless, Dakota explains away her injuries to the police, recollecting a series of bizarre events that happened before she arrived in town. She begins to suspect she may be Aubrey's identical twin sister and comes to believe her injuries are sympathetic resonance with her twin's wounds, manifesting in a [[stigmata]]-like fashion. However, Susan shows Dakota a video of her pregnancy ultrasound clearly revealing there was only one fetus in her womb. Dakota confronts Daniel, and he eventually admits that his and Susan's child died shortly after birth and that he informally adopted Aubrey from Virginia Sue Moss (another character that appears in Aubrey's short story), a [[crack cocaine|crack]] addict who bore twin daughters\u2014one of whom was Dakota, who was left to be raised by her biological mother. Susan has remained unaware of this for all of Aubrey's life.\n\nConfused and terrified, Dakota starts seeing visions of a menacing figure slowly butchering his captive. One of these visions takes Dakota to a nearby cemetery. After investigating the grave of Aubrey's recently murdered friend, Jennifer Toland, Dakota finds a blue ribbon from a piano competition, with a message from Jennifer's (and Aubrey's) piano teacher, Douglas Norquist. She is followed by Daniel, and declares \"I know who killed me\".\n\nThe two go, without FBI backup, to Norquist's home to confront him. Daniel heads into Norquist's house alone leaving a panicking Dakota in the car alone. Attempting to calm herself, Dakota refers to herself as Aubrey. Daniel is seemingly overpowered, and it is implied killed, by Norquist. Dakota, having entered the house, attacks Norquist in self-defense and cuts his hand off before being overpowered and tied up. Confused, Norquist asks why she has returned and exclaimed that he had buried her (referencing an earlier vision Dakota had). Freeing herself, Dakota kills Norquist and heads into the nearby wood, finding where Norquist had supposedly buried Aubrey alive. Using her prosthetic hand, she smashes the front of the glass coffin that Norquist had buried Aubrey in, revealing her barely alive in a white dress. This seemingly verifies Dakota's version of events. Relieved to have found her long-lost twin, Dakota lies on the ground next to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Aubrey Fleming / Dakota Moss\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Susan Fleming\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Daniel Fleming\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Jerrod Pointer\n* [[Garcelle Beauvais]] as Agent Julie Bascome\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] as Agent Phil Lazarus\n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as Dr. Greg Jameson\n* [[Jessica Lee Rose]] as Marcia\n* [[Megan Henning]] as Anya\n* [[Bonnie Aarons]] as Fat Teena\n* [[Kenya Moore]] as Jazmin\n* [[Rodney Rowland]] as Kenny Scalfe\n* Thomas Tofel as Douglas Norquist\n\n==Production==\nBefore filming, Lohan took [[pole-dancing]] lessons to prepare for her role as a stripper, stating: \"I've been in pole dancing lessons, S Factor by [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]], every day for four hours.

I went for a very bright poppy look with saturated colors, particularly blues and reds.\" He concluded, \"Love it or hate it, it's stuff that I wanted to see on the big screen and now I can.

And there were a lot of plot scenes, especially a lot of investigative FBI stuff that were just totally cut out of the movie. [...] I was more interested at the time with just the weirdness of it all.\"<ref name=\"lrm\"/> Siverston stated about casting Lohan: \"We needed someone who could play complete opposites... but not in a clich\u00e9d way. The movie really rests on Lindsay's shoulders.\" Likewise, producer Mancuso Jr.'s only concern in casting Lohan was whether the actress, best known for roles in family comedies and teen flicks, could continue making the transition and play more adult-oriented characters, admitting, \"It was a risk, but it didn't scare me because I felt like she wouldn't do this unless she was willing to go for it.\"<ref name=\"entwk\"/>\n\nIn July 2007, Lohan was arrested for driving under the influence, which prevented her from doing promotion for the film.
