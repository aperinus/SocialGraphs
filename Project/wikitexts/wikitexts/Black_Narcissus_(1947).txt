The title refers to the [[Parfums Caron|Caron]] perfume ''Narcisse Noir''.\n\nBased on the 1939 [[Black Narcissus (novel)|novel]] by [[Rumer Godden]], the film revolves around the growing tensions within a small convent of [[Anglican religious order|Anglican nun]]s who are trying to establish a school and hospital in the old palace of an Indian Raja at the top of an isolated mountain above a fertile valley in the [[Himalayas]]. The palace has ancient Indian erotic paintings on its walls and is run by the agent of the Indian general who owns it, a handsome middle-aged Englishman who is a source of attraction for the nuns.\n\n''Black Narcissus'' achieved considerable acclaim for its technical mastery with the cinematographer, [[Jack Cardiff]], winning an [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography, and [[Alfred Junge]] winning an [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]].<ref name=oscar>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1948/B?qt-honorees=1#block-quicktabs-honorees|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |publisher=AMPAS |access-date=4 March 2016 |title=1948, Oscars.org, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref name=globe>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/film/black-narcissus|work=[[Golden Globe Award]] |publisher=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |access-date=4 March 2016 |title=Black Narcissus, Golden Globes}}</ref>\n\nAccording to film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], \"''Black Narcissus'' is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved\".<ref>{{cite book| first=David| last=Thomson| title=The New Biographical Dictionary of Film| edition=4th reprint| location=New York| publisher=Alfred Knopf| year=2002| url=https://archive.org/details/newbiographicald0000thom_g3v7/page/694/mode/2up?q=%22kathleen+byron%22| page=694| isbn=978-0-3754-1128-1| access-date=25 May 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Christian mission|mission]] of [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[nun]]s from the congregation of The Servants of Mary is invited by General Toda Rai, the [[Rajput]] ruler of a [[princely state]] in the [[Himalayas]], to set up a school and hospital to be called St Faith. The convent will be located at Mopu, a dilapidated palace high on a cliff where the general's father previously kept his harem. An order of monks had already tried unsuccessfully to establish themselves there, and the general's agent {{Nowrap|Mr Dean}} makes the social and environmental difficulties they will face plain to them. The ambitious Sister Clodagh is appointed Sister Superior and sent with four other nuns: Sister Philippa for the garden; Sister Briony for the infirmary; Sister Blanche, better known as \"Sister Honey\", to teach lace-making; and the emotionally unwell Sister Ruth for general classes. Mr Dean is unimpressed with them, and predicts they will manage to remain only until the beginning of the monsoon season.\n\nDuring their time setting up the convent, the nuns face troubles with the old building and with the local Hindu population, often clashing with the building's native caretaker Angu Ayah. They have difficulty accepting a holy man in their grounds (the general's uncle) who spends all his time in meditation of one of the mountains. They take in a local girl called Kanchi to try to control her erratic spirit, and give the general's current heir\u2014referred to as the Young General\u2014classes to understand Western culture prior to a trip to Britain. Kanchi is whipped by Ayah for stealing, but the Young General stops her and ends up falling for Kanchi in a situation compared by Mr Dean to the tale of \"[[The King and the Beggar-maid]]\".\n\nEach member of the convent has troubles of her own caused by their surroundings, which seem to magnify emotions. They all have ill health, and Philippa loses herself in the environment and ends up planting the vegetable garden with flowers instead. Ruth, already highly strung, becomes increasingly jealous of Clodagh and obsessed with Mr Dean, leading her to renounce the order. Clodagh remembers a failed romance from her home in Ireland which had prompted her to join the congregation in the first place. Honey's growing attachment to the children ends in disaster when she gives medicine to a fatally ill baby. The child's death angers the locals, who blame and abandon the mission, and puts further strain on the nuns. Mr Dean unsuccessfully tries to persuade Clodagh to leave before anything else untoward happens.\n\nOne night Clodagh confronts the now-unstable Ruth, finding her in a modern dress she had ordered to impress {{Nowrap|Mr Dean}}. Ruth escapes Clodagh's watch and finds {{Nowrap|Mr Dean}}. When he refuses her advances, she has a complete mental breakdown and goes back to the mission, intent on killing Clodagh. When Clodagh is ringing the bell for morning service located on a cliff edge, Ruth attempts to push her over the edge. In the resulting struggle, Ruth falls off the cliff to her death. The mission leaves just as the monsoon season begins, with Clodagh's final request to {{Nowrap|Mr Dean}} being to tend Ruth's grave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as Sister Clodagh\n* [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] as The Young General (Dilip Rai)<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Narcissus (1947) |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a5551ac |website=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=16 July 2020}}</ref>\n* [[David Farrar (actor)|David Farrar]] as Mr. Dean\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as Sister Ruth\n* [[Flora Robson]] as Sister Philippa\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Kanchi\n* [[Jenny Laird]] as Sister Honey\n* [[Judith Furse]] as Sister Briony\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as The Old General\n* [[May Hallatt]] as Angu Ayah\n* Eddie Whaley Jr. as Joseph Anthony, the young interpreter\n* Shaun Noble as Con, Clodagh's sweetheart\n* Nancy Roberts as Mother Dorothea\n}}\n<Gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Deborah Kerr 3.jpg|Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh\nFile:David Farrar.jpg|David Farrar as Mr Dean\nFile:Kathleen Byron.jpg|Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth\nFile:Black Narcissus (1947), screenshot of Jean Simmons.png|Jean Simmons as Kanchi\n</Gallery>\n\n==Analysis==\n''Black Narcissus'' was released only a few months before [[Partition of India|India achieved independence]] from Britain in August 1947. Film critic [[Dave Kehr]] has suggested that the final images of the film, as the nuns abandon the Himalayas and proceed down the mountain, could have been interpreted by British viewers in 1947 as \"a last farewell to their fading empire\"; he suggests that for the film-makers, it is not an image of defeat \"but of a respectful, rational retreat from something that England never owned nor understood\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Kehr |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/94 |title=Black Narcissus |website=[[The Criterion Collection]] |access-date=31 October 2009\n|date=29 January 2001}}</ref> The story in the film quite closely follows that of the book, which was published in 1939.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Black Narcissus'' was adapted from writer [[Rumer Godden]]'s 1939 novel of the same name.{{sfn|Street|2015|pages=5\u20138}} Michael Powell was introduced to the novel by actress [[Mary Morris]], who had appeared in ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940) and an early film he did with Emeric Pressburger, ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939).{{sfn|Street|2015|p=11}} Godden had adapted her novel for a stage production for [[Lee Strasberg]] in the United States, but allowed Pressburger to write his own screenplay adaptation with Powell.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=11}}\n\n===Casting===\nKathleen Byron was among the first to be cast in the film, in the role of the crazed Sister Ruth.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=22}} Pressburger described Byron as having a \"dreamy voice and great eyes like a lynx\", which he felt appropriate for the mentally disturbed character.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=22}} In the role of the leading Sister Superior, Sister Clodagh, Deborah Kerr was cast.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=22}} Pressburger chose Kerr for the role despite the reservations of Powell, who felt she was too young for the part.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=22}} At one point, Powell considered [[Greta Garbo]] for the part.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=22}}  Kerr was paid \u00a316,000 for fifty-five days of work.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=23}}\n\nDavid Farrar was cast as Mr Dean, the virile British agent who becomes the object of Sister Ruth's obsession.{{sfn|Street|2015|pages=22\u201323}} Farrar was paid \u00a34,500 for forty-five days of shooting.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=23}} Flora Robson appears as Sister Philippa, a gardening nun in the convent.{{sfn|Street|2015|p=23}}\n\nOf the three principal Indian roles, only the Young General was played by an ethnic Indian, Sabu; the roles of Kanchi, played by Jean Simmons,{{sfn|Street|2015|p=24}} and the Old General were performed by [[Racial brownface|white actors in make-up]].{{sfn|Street|2015|pages=22\u201325}} Kanchi, 17, is described by Godden as \"a basket of fruit, piled high and luscious and ready to eat.

Percy Day]]) to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas, as well as some scale models for motion shots of the convent.{{sfn|Street|2015|pages=27\u201330}} Powell said later: \"Our mountains were painted on glass. We decided to do the whole thing in the studio and that's the way we managed to maintain colour control to the very end. Sometimes in a film its theme or its colour are more important than the plot.\"\n\nFor the costumes, [[Alfred Junge]], the art director, had three main colour schemes. The nuns were always in the white habits that he designed from a medley of medieval types. These white robes of heavy material stressed the nuns' other-worldliness amid the exotic native surroundings. The chief native characters were robed in brilliant colours, particularly the generals in jewels and in rich silks. Other native characters brought into the film for \"atmosphere\" were clad in more sombre colours with the usual native dress of the Nepalese, Bhutanese and Tibetan peoples toned down to prevent overloading the eye with brilliance.\n\nAccording to Robert Horton, Powell set the climactic sequence, a murder attempt on the cliffs of the cloister, to a pre-existing musical track, staging it as though it were a piece of visual choreography. There was some personal, behind-the-scenes tension, as Kerr was the director's ex-lover and Byron his current one. \"It was a situation not uncommon in show business, I was told,\" Powell later wrote, \"but it was new to me.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-21-ca-34463-story.html| title=Really Big Shoes| date=21 September 1997| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| language=en-US| author=Turan, Kenneth| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009043003/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-21-ca-34463-story.html| archive-date=9 October 2019| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOriginally the film was intended to end with an additional scene in which Sister Clodagh sobs and blames herself for the convent's failure to Mother Dorothea. Mother Dorothea touches and speaks to Sister Clodagh welcomingly as the latter's tears continue to fall. When they filmed the scene with the rainfall on the leaves in what was to have been the penultimate scene, Powell was so impressed with it that he decided to designate that the last scene and to scrap the Mother Dorothea closing scene.

In Michael Powell's own view, this was the most erotic film he ever made. \"It is all done by suggestion, but eroticism is in every frame and image from beginning to end. It is a film full of wonderful performances and passion just below the surface, which finally, at the end of the film, erupts.\" The English film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]], who put it on his list of the ten best films ever made, took Powell's statement further, and said that it was the most erotic film he had ever seen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |date=19 September 2019 |chapter=The Meaning of ''Black Narcissus'' |title=The Films that Made Me |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaWmDwAAQBAJ&q=black+narcissus&pg=PA200 |page=511 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-1-4482-1756-4}}</ref>\n\nIn ''The Great British Picture Show'', the writer George Perry stated, \"Archers films looked better than they were&nbsp;\u2013 the location photography in Technicolor by [[Jack Cardiff]] in ''Black Narcissus'' was a great deal better than the story and lifted the film above the threatening banality.\" In contrast, the critic [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] wrote in the ''[[Radio Times]]'' in the 1980s that \"unusually for a British film from the emotionally frozen forties the melodrama works so well it almost seems as if Powell and Pressburger survived the slings and barbs of contemporary criticism to find their ideal audience in the 1980s\".{{sfn|Christie|1994}} [[Marina Warner]], introducing the film on BBC2 (on a nun-themed film evening, with ''[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (film)|Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]]''), called it a masterpiece.\n\nThe film's resonance with populations exploring previously stifled sexual desires and expression extends beyond its contemporary milieu of women in the post-war era.
