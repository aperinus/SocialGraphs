Please make more concise if possible. ---> \nIn 2013, massive alien monsters called [[Kaiju]] begin emerging from an interdimensional portal called \"The Breach\" at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and attacking coastal cities. In response, humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers. Each is co-piloted by two or more people who share a mental link by a process called \"Drifting\" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.\n\nIn 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot the American Jaeger, ''Gipsy Danger'', to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed Knifehead. The Kaiju unexpectedly pierces the Jaeger's armor, ripping out half of its head and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the damaged Jaeger solo, kills Knifehead and walks ''Gipsy'' to shore before collapsing. Traumatized by the loss of his brother and the stress of piloting alone, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program.\n\nFive years later, world leaders decide to cease funding for the Jaeger program and replace it with coastal defense walls, since Kaiju are appearing more frequently and Jaegers are being destroyed as quickly as they are built. The walls are quickly proven to be ineffective. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under the command of Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to try to destroy the Breach using a [[tactical nuclear weapon]], even though previous attempts to do so have failed.\n\nRaleigh, now working in wall construction, is recruited by Pentecost for the mission. Travelling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the director of the Jaeger restoration program and Pentecost's adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation \u2013 the refurbished ''Gipsy Danger'', the Russian ''Cherno Alpha'', the Chinese ''Crimson Typhoon'', and the Australian ''Striker Eureka'', piloted by father-and-son team, Herc and Chuck Hansen. To find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts and decides that Mako is \"drift-compatible\". During their first test, Raleigh falls out of alignment after reliving Yancy's death, causing Mako to become lost in the memory of a Kaiju attack on Tokyo, nearly firing ''Gipsy'''s energy cannon. As a result, Pentecost grounds Mako.\n\nPentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilize and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed. Newton suggests attempting to drift with a Kaiju's brain to learn more about them but is dismissed by his colleagues. He tries it regardless, discovering that Kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. Pentecost instructs Newton to find black market dealer Hannibal Chau to obtain another Kaiju brain to drift with. Newton realizes the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and the two newest Kaiju to emerge, Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him in Hong Kong.\n\nAll Jaegers except ''Gipsy Danger'' are dispatched to intervene. The Kaijus destroy ''Crimson Typhoon'' and ''Cherno Alpha'', while Leatherback disables ''Striker Eureka'' with an EMP blast. As the only non-digital Jaeger, Pentecost sends the nuclear-powered ''Gipsy Danger'' to help. ''Gipsy'' manages to defeat Leatherback and Otachi. Newton and Hannibal go to harvest Otachi's secondary brain but discover she is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out and devours Hannibal before choking on its own [[umbilical cord]]. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering that the Breach only opens in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.\n\nPentecost reveals to Raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation Jaeger, which lacked radiation shielding. His last mission was in Tokyo, where he saved a young Mako but piloted alone. Two new Kaiju are detected guarding the Breach, prompting ''Gipsy'' and the repaired ''Striker'', piloted by Pentecost and Chuck, to go ahead with the assault. Approaching the Breach, the Jaegers are attacked by the Kaiju alongside a new Category-5 Kaiju, Slattern, leading to ''Striker'' being crippled. Pentecost and Chuck decide to sacrifice ''Striker'' while ''Gipsy'' acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the Breach. After ''Striker'' self-destructs, ''Gipsy'' slaughters Slattern, riding its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from ''Gipsy'', manually triggers ''Gipsy'''s self-destruct, and ejects himself before it explodes and seals the Breach. Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean; they embrace as rescue helicopters arrive.\n<!--- [[WP:FILMPLOT]] 400-700 words.

When pilots drift, they quickly gain intimate knowledge of each other's memories and feelings, and have no choice but to accept them; del Toro found this concept's dramatic potential compelling. The director expressed his intention that the empathy metaphors extend to real life:\n\n<blockquote>The pilots' smaller stories actually make a bigger point, which is that we're all together in the same robot [in life] ... Either we get along or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.</blockquote>\n\nDel Toro acknowledged this message's simplicity, but said he would have liked to have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.<ref name=\"Boston\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/07/06/pacific-rim-latest-heartfelt-project-from-guillermo-del-toro/aTU5X0wLpNaUe1GpbHqDUO/story.html|title=''Pacific Rim'' is the heartfelt project from del Toro|last=Russo|first=Tom|work=bostonglobe.com|date=July 6, 2013|access-date=July 7, 2013}}</ref> The film's ten primary characters all have \"little arcs\" conducive to this idea.

That's life ...

Derived from the [[Bechdel test]], it was born from the following observation: even though the film ''Pacific Rim'' gives a rather good representation of women, it fails the Bechdel test. The criterion of the Mako Mori test is as follows: there is at least one female character; with her own narrative arc; independent to that of a male character.<ref>{{cite news |date=August 18, 2013 |last=Romano |first=Aja |title=The Mako Mori Test: 'Pacific Rim' inspires a Bechdel Test alternative |url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/ |access-date=January 1, 2021 |newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Bechdel & Mako Mori Test |url=https://wiftv.ca/2014/01/28/the-bechdel-mako-mori-test/ |last=Paraboo |first=Krystal |website=Women in Film and Television Vancouver Blog |date=2014-01-28 |access-date=2020-05-23 }}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Pacific Rim Uprising}}\nA sequel titled ''Pacific Rim Uprising'', directed by [[Steven S.
