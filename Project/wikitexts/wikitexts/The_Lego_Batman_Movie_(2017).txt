Pictures]]. It was directed by [[Chris McKay]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], from a screenplay by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]], Erik Sommers, [[Jared Stern]], and [[John Whittington (screenwriter)|John Whittington]], and produced by [[Dan Lin]], [[Roy Lee]], and  [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]]. Based on the [[List of Batman supporting characters|characters]] from the [[DC Universe]] created by [[DC Comics]] and the [[Lego Super Heroes|Lego DC Super Heroes]]' [[Lego Batman|Batman]] toy line, the film is a [[Co-production (media)|collaboration]] between [[Production company|production houses]] from the United States, Australia, and Denmark, the first [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] in [[The Lego Movie (franchise)|''The Lego Movie'' film series]] and the second installment overall. The story follows the [[Batman|title character]] as he attempts to overcome his greatest fear to stop [[Joker (character)|the Joker]]'s latest plan. The film features [[Will Arnett]] reprising his role as Batman from ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' alongside [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Michael Cera]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]].\n\nDevelopment of ''The Lego Batman Movie'' started in October 2014, after Warner Bros. announced several Lego films, following the critical and commercial success of ''The Lego Movie'', while Chris McKay was hired to direct the film after being replaced by [[Rob Schrab]] to direct the sequel to ''The Lego Movie''. The film pays homage for numerous references to previous ''Batman'' films, cartoons and comics. Like ''The Lego Movie'', the animation was provided by [[Animal Logic]]. [[Lorne Balfe]] composed the film's musical score.\n\n''The Lego Batman Movie'' had its world premiere in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on January 29, 2017,<ref name=\"RTEWinPassPremiere\" /> and was released in the United States on February 10, 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-batman-movie-gets-release-790232|title='The Lego Batman Movie' Gets Release Date|first=Borys|last=Kit|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 20, 2015|access-date=July 16, 2015|archive-date=April 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422184441/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-batman-movie-gets-release-790232|url-status=live}}</ref> in [[RealD 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX]], [[IMAX 3D]] and [[4DX]] formats. The film received generally positive reviews from critics for its animation, voice acting, soundtrack, visual style, and humor, and was also commercially successful, having grossed $310 million worldwide against a budget of around $80 million. A sequel, ''Lego Superfriends'', was announced in 2018, but was cancelled after [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the Lego franchise rights.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- DO NOT EXPAND PLOT ANY FURTHER! [[WP:FILMPLOT]] guidelines for Feature Film plots, require 400 to 700 words. -->\nWithin the DC superhero dimension of the [[Lego]] multiverse, [[Batman]] protects [[Gotham City]] and fights crime. During his latest mission to stop the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and Gotham's other supervillains from destroying the city, Batman hurts Joker's feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him.\n\nThe following day, Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of [[Jim Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]] and the ascension of his daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]] as the city's new [[police commissioner]], only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. Joker crashes the party with the city's other villains, all of whom surrender except [[Harley Quinn]], who disappears during the confusion.\n\nKnowing that Joker is up to no good, Batman plans to steal [[Superman]]'s [[Phantom Zone]] projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone, which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse, only for [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] to intervene and advise him to take care of [[Dick Grayson]], whom he unwittingly adopted as his son during the gala earlier. Reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], whereupon the pair successfully recovers the projector from the [[Fortress of Solitude]] and breaks into [[Arkham Asylum]] to send the Joker to the Phantom Zone. Suspecting that Joker ''wanted'' to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin.\n\nWhile the projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan, and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone. Realizing that the city does need him after all, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the new threat.\n\nAlthough Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching [[Wayne Manor|Wayne Island]], he chooses to send them away, fearing that he might lose them just like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker, believing how Batman is incapable of changing his ways, zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the [[Batcave]]'s stash of confiscated bombs to destroy Gotham City. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his arrogance has caused everyone and accepts his greatest fear: being part of a family. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for leaving them and requesting their help to stop Joker.\n\nWith help from Gotham's other villains, who felt neglected by the Joker when he refused to break them out of Arkham, Batman and his team defeat the escaped villains and send them back to the Phantom Zone. However, they fail to stop Joker's bombs from going off, and the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Batman convinces Joker to help him by telling him he gives him purpose to be the hero he is, and with the help of every civilian and villain, they manage to save Gotham, chain-linking themselves together to reassemble the plates.\n\nWith the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to face the consequences of his earlier behavior, only to be rejected by Phyllis, who chooses to let him remain after realizing he is a hero and seeing how much he had changed to save everyone. Afterward, Batman gives Joker and the other villains a head start to avoid capture, knowing they will be no match for the new Bat-family.\n\n==Voice Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Lego Movie characters|List of Batman supporting characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mariah Carey WBLS 2018 Interview 4.jpg\n| width1 = 163\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Channing Tatum (19421648739).jpg\n| width2 = 181\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Among others, [[Mariah Carey]] ''(left)'' and [[Channing Tatum]] ''(right)'' guest-voice Mayor McCaskill and Superman respectively\n| direction = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Will Arnett]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]: A billionaire by day and superhero by night, who defends Gotham City from crime.
