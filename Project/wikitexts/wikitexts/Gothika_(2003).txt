Dutton]], [[John Carroll Lynch]], and [[Bernard Hill]]. The film follows a psychiatrist who finds herself incarcerated in the penitentiary in which she works, accused of brutally murdering her own husband.\n\nThe fourth project developed by production company [[Dark Castle Entertainment]], following 2002's ''[[Ghost Ship (2002 film)|Ghost Ship]]'', ''Gothika'' was the second film by the company to be co-distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], the first being ''[[Thirteen Ghosts]]''. It was also the first feature by Dark Castle to boast a number of high-profile stars in its lead roles.\n\n''Gothika'' was shot in [[Montreal]], Quebec in the spring of 2003. It was released theatrically in the United States on November 21, 2003, the Friday before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The film grossed $141.6 million internationally, though it received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Miranda Grey, a psychiatrist at Woodward Penitentiary in rural western [[Connecticut]], crashes her car one night on a country road to avoid hitting a young woman. When she awakens, she finds herself an inmate of the women's ward in which she works, receiving treatment from her colleague, Dr. Pete Graham. Miranda is horrified when Pete reveals to her that her husband, Douglas, has been the victim of a brutal [[axe murder]], and that she is the sole suspect. As Miranda attempts to adjust to life as an inmate, she is haunted by visions of the young woman she saw the night of the car accident, and is attacked by her apparition in the showers; the woman carves the phrase \"Not Alone\" into Miranda's arm, though the hospital staff presume Miranda is [[self-harm]]ing. She later learns that the same phrase was scrawled in Douglas's blood inside their home after his murder. Miranda meets with her lawyer and start preparing for her defense and they bring in Douglas's best friend, Sheriff Bob Ryan, who confronts Miranda in the penitentiary, accusing her of the murder.\n\nMiranda begins to bond with fellow inmate Chloe Sava, whom she treated prior to her incarceration. During Miranda's previous sessions with Chloe, Chloe claimed to have been raped in the hospital. One night, Miranda's cell door inexplicably opens, and she quietly prowls through the ward. As she passes Chloe's cell, she witnesses Chloe being raped, and glimpses a [[tattoo]] of an [[Anima Sola]] on the perpetrator's chest. She is subsequently found by guards, who disbelieve her story. As time passes, Miranda regains memories of the night of the car accident, and subsequently identifies the mysterious woman as Rachel, the daughter of Miranda's superior, Dr. Phil Parsons; she had died in an apparent [[suicide]] several years prior. Late one night, Miranda is attacked by Rachel's ghost in her cell, and subsequently manages to escape from the hospital. She returns to her home and observes the blood-stained crime scene. This triggers vivid memories of Miranda committing Douglas's murder, though she believes that Rachel [[spirit possession|possessed]] her to carry out the act.\n\nRecalling that Douglas mentioned he was going to visit his rural farmhouse in [[Rhode Island]] prior to his murder, Miranda decides to visit the site, hoping it will contain clues. While investigating a cellar in the barn, she finds a blood-stained mattress, along with containers of sedatives, restraints, and video recording equipment. Miranda views one of the tapes: It is a [[snuff film]] shot by Douglas, which shows him raping, torturing, and murdering a young woman. Police subsequently arrive at the property, arresting Miranda and finding one of Douglas's victims, Tracey Seaver, still alive in the barn. Miranda realizes that Rachel possessed her to avenge her own murder by Douglas.\n\nIncarcerated in the county jail, Miranda converses with Sheriff Ryan about Douglas's crimes, and asserts that Rachel's suicide was staged; she also espouses her belief that a second perpetrator was involved. Using her expertise as a psychiatrist, Miranda constructs a psychological profile of the second perpetrator, and realizes it is in fact Sheriff Ryan. Ryan, realizing Miranda has identified him, attempts to inject her with a sedative. In the struggle, Miranda tears at his shirt, revealing the Anima Sola tattoo on his chest. Miranda manages to turn the syringe on Ryan before fleeing. In a drugged state, Ryan pursues Miranda through the jail, ranting proudly about his and Douglas's crimes; he tells her that Rachel was their first victim, and that they worked together to abduct, rape, and murder a string of local women. Suddenly, Rachel's apparition appears, distracting Ryan. He begins to shoot at it, causing a gas leak and subsequent explosion that sets him ablaze. Miranda obtains his gun, and shoots the burned Ryan to death. Moments later Pete arrives at the jail to try to save her, having realized the truth.\n\nApproximately a year later, Miranda, now freed, walks with Chloe, also released from the penitentiary, on a city sidewalk. Miranda claims to be free of Rachel's influence and sends Chloe off in a taxi. Miranda then sees a young boy standing in the middle of the road who appears as though he is about to be struck by a fire truck. Miranda yells for the boy to move, but after the fire truck passes through the boy without harming him, she realizes he was only a [[ghost]]. As Miranda walks away, she fails to notice a missing person flyer for the young boy on a nearby telephone pole.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Dr. Miranda Grey\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Dr. Pete Graham\n* [[Charles S.

He wrote that \"the plot is preposterous\" but nonetheless felt that stylish direction and Berry's performance made ''Gothika'' enjoyable on its own \"lurid\" terms: \"The casting of Halle Berry is useful to the movie, because she evokes a vulnerable quality that triggers our concern. [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] might have wanted to work with her.
