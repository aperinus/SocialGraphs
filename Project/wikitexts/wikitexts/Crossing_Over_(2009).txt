It follows [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]s of different nationalities struggling to achieve legal status in [[Los Angeles]]: dealing with the border, document fraud and [[extortion]], the [[right of asylum|asylum]] and [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] process, work-site enforcement, [[naturalization]], the office of counter-terrorism, and the clash of cultures. The film is based on Kramer's similarly titled 1995 short film. He produced the film alongside [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{hatnote|There are several stories interwoven throughout the film. For simplicity, they are separated out in this description, each with its own paragraph.}}\n\nAfter immigrant Mireya Sanchez is deported, [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] / [[Homeland Security Investigations]] Special Agent Max Brogan takes care of her little son and brings him to the boy's grandparents in [[Mexico]]. Later the woman is found dead near the border. Brogan returns to the grandparents to tell them the bad news.\n\nTaslima Jahangir, a 15-year-old girl from [[Bangladesh]], presents a paper at school promoting that people should try to understand the [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|9/11 hijackers]]. The school principal reports this to authorities. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents raid the home and ransack the girl's room, reading her diaries and a school assignment on the ethics of suicide; they criticize her room as \"too austere\" and note that she has an account on an Islamic website. The profiler says this makes her look like a would-be [[Suicide attack|suicide bomber]]. Taslima is not charged for this, but it turns out that she stays in the United States illegally. She was born in Bangladesh and brought to the United States at age three. Taslima's continued presence jeopardizes her chances and puts at risk her two younger siblings, who are [[United States nationality law|US citizens]] because they were born in the country. Denise Frankel, the immigration defense attorney, suggests that instead of the whole family's being deported, Taslima can leave for Bangladesh with her mother while the rest of the family stays in the U.S.\n\nCole Frankel, an immigration examiner/officer, gets into a car accident with Claire Shepard, an aspiring actress from [[Australia]]. Realizing that she is in the country illegally, Cole makes an arrangement with Claire whereby she will have unlimited sex with him for two months in exchange for a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. When Cole eventually says he wants to leave his wife for Claire, she makes it clear that she holds him in contempt and is only sleeping with him for the green card. In a moment of clarity, Cole exempts Claire from completing the two months and arranges for her to get her green card in the mail. Special Agents from the ICE / Office of Inspector General eventually confront Claire about the suspiciousness in her immigration paperwork, and she admits to the sexual arrangement she had with Cole and leaves the country \"voluntarily\". Cole is arrested by ICE/OIG for corruption. His wife Denise Frankel adopts a little girl from [[Nigeria]], who has already been in the detention center for 23 months.\n\nBrogan has a colleague, Hamid Baraheri. His sister, Zahra, is having sex with a married man, Javier Pedroza. The Baraheri family does not approve. Hamid's brother Farid plans to scare the couple, but things get out of hand: he shoots both of them, and goes to Hamid, who helps him hide the evidence. Brogan slowly suspects Hamid's involvement as the film progresses.\n\nJavier Pedroza worked in a copy shop and made extra money by providing counterfeit immigration papers. Claire had previously paid him for false papers before she had made her arrangement with Cole. But when Javier was killed, the authorities discovered her documents among his belongings, leading the immigration team to examine Claire's case more closely.\n\nSouth Korean teenager Yong Kim is about to be naturalized with the rest of his family, but he has started to hang out with a bad crowd and ultimately participates in a convenience store robbery to \"pop his cherry\" with his gang. Hamid happens to be at the same convenience store and kills the other robbers but (due to his own guilt over his involvement in his sister's death) lets Yong Kim go free.\n\nGavin Kossef, Claire's boyfriend and an atheist Jewish musician from the United Kingdom, pretends to be a religious Jew in order to get a job at a Jewish school, which allows him to stay in the U.S. When reporting to an immigration office, the immigration examiner/officer makes him demonstrate his familiarity with the Jewish religion in front of a [[rabbi]] visiting for other purposes &ndash; Kossef chants poorly but the rabbi gives his approval. After the test, in private, the rabbi requires Kossef to bring his \"wonderful\" voice to temple and to take lessons from him to eliminate the deficiencies in his knowledge.\n\nBrogan investigates the murder of Zahra Baraheri and her boyfriend.  He finds proof of Farid's guilt in the murders and Hamid's guilt in the cover-up.  Disgusted by the brothers' actions he turns the evidence over to the Los Angeles Police Department.  The LAPD arrests Farid for two counts of murder and Hamid as an accessory to two murders after the fact.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] Special Agent Max Brogan\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Cole Frankel\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Denise Frankel\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Gavin Kossef\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] Special Agent Hamid Baraheri\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Mireya S\u00e1nchez\n* Marshall Manesh as Sangar Baraheri\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Claire Shephard\n* [[Justin Chon]] as Yong Kim\n* [[Summer Bishil]] as Taslima Jahangir\n* Melody Khazae as Zahra Baraheri\n* [[Jacqueline Obradors]] as [[FBI]] Special Agent Marina Phadkar\n*Naila Azad Nupur as Rokeya Jahangir<ref>{{Citation|last=Kramer|first=Wayne|title=Crossing Over|date=2009-02-26|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0924129/|type=Crime, Drama|others=Harrison Ford, Ashley Judd, Ray Liotta, Jim Sturgess|publisher=The Weinstein Company, The Kennedy/Marshall Company, Movie Prose|access-date=2020-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Crossing Over'' was filmed on location in Los Angeles in 2007.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe film originally featured a scene in which an [[Iran]]ian woman is murdered by her brother in an [[honor killing]]. Following complaints that the plotline was unrealistic and offensive, the killing was presented as an intended beating which got out of hand, removing the dialogue referring to \"honor\" and \"family honor\".<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2140974,00.html |title='Honour killing' screenplay changed after Iranian complaints |work=guardian.co.uk |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[Sean Penn]] filmed scenes as an immigration cop.

The film's original running length was 140 minutes, but the film's producer (who had final cut privilege) was convinced to edit the film down to 113 minutes when Harvey Weinstein threatened to release the film [[straight to DVD]] and bypass a theatrical release altogether. In many countries outside of the US, the film went straight to DVD anyway.\n\nThe film was distributed in the United States by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and [[The Weinstein Company]]. It was given a limited theatrical release on February 27, 2009, and ultimately grossed less than US$500,000 in North America, and just over US$2.5 million internationally. The film has reportedly made another US$1.7 million in U.S. DVD sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2009/CROSN.php |title=Crossing Over - Box Office Data, DVD Sales, Movie News, Cast Information |work=The Numbers |accessdate=2013-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally negative reviews. Review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 16% of 106 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 4.1/10.
