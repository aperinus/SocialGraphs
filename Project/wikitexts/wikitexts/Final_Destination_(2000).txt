It is the first installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]] and stars [[Devon Sawa]], [[Ali Larter]], [[Kerr Smith]], and [[Tony Todd]]. Sawa portrays a teenager who cheats death after having a [[wikt:premonition|premonition]] of a catastrophic plane explosion. He and several of his classmates leave the plane before the explosion occurs, but [[Death (personification)|Death]] later takes the lives of those who were meant to die on the plane.\n\nThe film began as a [[spec script]] written by Reddick for an [[List of unmade episodes of The X-Files#Flight 180|episode of ''The X-Files'']] in order for Reddick to get a TV agent. A colleague at [[New Line Cinema]] persuaded Reddick to write it as a feature-length film. Later, Wong and Morgan, ''The X-Files'' writing partners, became interested in the script and agreed to rewrite and direct the film, marking Wong's film directing debut. Filming took place in New York City and Vancouver, with additional scenes filmed in Toronto and San Francisco. It was released on March 17, 2000, and became a financial success, making $10 million on its opening weekend. The DVD release of the film, released on September 26, 2000, in the United States and Canada, includes commentaries, deleted scenes, and documentaries.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Positive reviews praised the film for \"generating a respectable amount of suspense\", \"playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing\", \"an unexpectedly alert teen-scream disaster chiller\", and Sawa's performance, while negative reviews described the film as \"dramatically flat\" and \"aimed at the teen dating crowd\".<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" /> It received the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor|Best Performance by a Younger Actor]] for Sawa's performance.<ref name=\"Best\">{{cite web|publisher=Saturn Awards |title=Past Saturn Awards Winners for Best Horror Film |url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#horror |access-date=April 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511180136/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"Younger\">{{cite web|publisher=Saturn Awards |title=Past Saturn Awards Winners for Best Performance by a Younger Actor |url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#younger |access-date=October 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512032708/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archive-date=May 12, 2011 }}</ref> The film's success spawned a [[media franchise]], encompassing four additional installments, as well as a series of [[Final Destination (film series)#Novels|novels]] and [[Final Destination (film series)#Comic books|comic books]]. The first sequel, ''[[Final Destination 2]]'', was released on January 31, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP: FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nHigh school student [[Alex Browning]] boards Vol\u00e9e Airlines Flight 180, a [[Boeing 747#747-200|Boeing 747]] with his classmates for their senior trip to [[Paris]] from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]]. Before take-off, Alex has a [[Precognition|premonition]] that the plane will face a mechanical failure, leading to a mid-air explosion, killing everybody on board. When [[Omen|the events from his vision]] begin to occur in reality, he panics until a fight breaks out between him and his rival [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Horton|Carter Horton]], resulting in both of them being removed from the plane, along with Alex's best friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Tod Waggner|Tod Waggner]], Carter's girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Terry Chaney|Terry Chaney]], teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie Lewton|Valerie Lewton]], and students [[List of Final Destination characters#Billy Hitchcock|Billy Hitchcock]] and [[Clear Rivers]]. None of the other passengers, except Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Weine|Weine]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Schreck|Schreck]], who are both suspicious of Alex.\n\nThirty-nine days later, after attending a memorial service for the victims, an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to accidentally [[Strangulation|hang]] himself in his shower that night. While his death is ruled a suicide, Alex sneaks into the funeral home along with Clear to examine Tod's corpse when the [[Funeral director|mortician]], [[William Bludworth]], reveals that the survivors who escaped from the impending circumstance have disrupted [[Death (personification)|Death's plan]], who is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die from the accident. Alex and Clear are discussing their next move when the rest of the survivors arrive outside the caf\u00e9, where Terry is run over and killed by a speeding bus on the road.\n\nAfter watching a news report on the cause of the explosion, Alex concludes that Death is reclaiming the survivors according to the sequence of their intended demise on the plane. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton whose house explodes after she is impaled by a falling kitchen knife. The remaining survivors reunite while driving through town as Alex explains the situation. Carter, who is next, is enraged over Terry's loss and stops his car on a train crossing, attempting to die on his own terms. While the others escape, he changes his mind at the last minute but his seatbelt jams. Alex manages to save him just before the car is smashed by an oncoming train that knocks a [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] from the wreckage into the air, decapitating Billy. Alex learns that because he intervened in Carter's death, it skipped to the next person afterwards. The next day, while hiding out in a fortified cabin, Alex recalls having changed seats with two classmates in his premonition and realizes that Clear is actually next. He rushes to her house to save her while being pursued by Weine and Schreck. Alex finds Clear who is trapped inside her car surrounded by loose electrical cables that ignite a gasoline leak around her. He grabs the cable, allowing her to escape from the car just before it explodes.\n\nSix months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex reveals that Death never skipped him after he saved Clear. Fearing that their struggle is unfinished, Alex retreats when a bus hurls a parking signage towards a neon sign which descends towards him. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second but the sign swings back down towards the former and kills him, leaving Death's plan to resume action.\n\n==Cast==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Devon Sawa]] as [[Alex Browning]]\n* [[Ali Larter]] as [[Clear Rivers]]\n* [[Kerr Smith]] as Carter Horton\n* [[Kristen Cloke]] as Valerie Lewton\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Agent Weine\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Agent Schreck\n* [[Chad Donella|Chad E.

She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed,\" said Reddick. \"I thought, that's creepy\u2014what if she was supposed to die on that flight?\"<ref name=\"Disgusting\">{{cite web|title=Special Feature 'Final Destination': Not So Final After All!|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=August 12, 2011|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/|access-date=May 3, 2012}}</ref> Building on his idea, Reddick wrote a script and got an agent, but instead of submitting the script to ''The X-Files'', he acted on the suggestion of a colleague at [[New Line Cinema]] to write it as a feature film.\n\nNew Line Cinema bought Reddick's treatment and hired him to write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]]. Both writers were willing to make it into a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. \"I believe that at one time or another we've all experienced a sense of prescience. We have a hunch, a feeling, and then that hunch proves true,\" Wong said. \"We want to do for planes and air travel what ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' did for sharks and swimming\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Expanding on his decision to write and direct the film, Wong stated:\n<blockquote>One thing we were all in agreement on from the start is that we didn't want to do a slasher movie. [. . .] I became very excited when we decided to make the world at large, in the service of death, our antagonist. Everyday objects and occurrences then take on ominous proportions and it becomes less about whether or not our characters are going to die and more about how they will die and how they can delay their deaths. The entertainment value is in the \"ride\" not in the outcome, and by placing the premise of the film on the inevitability of death, we play a certain philosophical note.<ref name=\"Angel\">{{cite web|title=Final Destination Press Book|work=Angelfire|url=http://www.angelfire.com/stars/chaddonella/flight180/press/book.html|access-date=May 9, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMorgan said:\n<blockquote>The main thing they wanted about Death coming to get people is that you never saw a kind of a [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] figure. You never saw a killer. And they liked that idea and they said, \"Okay. Go write it.\" Once we had a basic story, I started cataloging the strange coincidences in my own life. For example, I was in the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver airport]] waiting for a flight when [[John Denver]] came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, \"Hey, he just died in a plane crash{{snd}}that's a little weird.\" We wrote that version of that experience into the script.<ref name=\"XFiles\">{{cite video|people=James Wong (director)|title=Final Destination: A Look at Test Screening|medium=Videotape / DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema}}</ref><ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" /></blockquote>\n\nProducers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions helped with the film's budget because both were similarly fascinated about the idea of an invisible force executing its victims. Perry, a fan of ''The X-Files'', claimed that he \"responded to Wong and Morgan's work for one specific reason: dread\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Disgusting\" /> New Line Cinema accepted financing and distributing rights for the film after Reddick came to them personally.<ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:FD Flight Survivors.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A screenshot from the film showing the main cast: (from left to right) [[Kristen Cloke]] as Valerie Lewton, [[Seann William Scott]] as Billy Hitchcock, [[Kerr Smith]] as Carter Horton, [[Amanda Detmer]] as Terry Chaney, [[Ali Larter]] as [[Clear Rivers]], [[Devon Sawa]] as [[Alex Browning]], and [[Chad Donella]] as Tod Waggner.]]\n{{main|List of Final Destination characters#Final Destination (2000)|l1=List of characters in Final Destination}}\n\"One of the most important things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties \u2013 the little things that a character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you,\" Morgan said about the auditions.\n\n[[Alex Browning]], the last role cast, went to Canadian actor [[Devon Sawa]], who previously starred in the 1999 film ''[[Idle Hands]]''. Sawa said that when he read the script on a plane, he found himself peeking out the window at the engine every couple of minutes. Then he went down and met Glen and Jim, and he thought \"they were amazing and already had some great ideas\".<ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Devon\">{{cite web|website=DevonSawa.org|title=Starshine Devon Sawa \u2013 Auditions|url=http://www.devonsawa.org/about-devon/auditions/|access-date=April 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316075521/http://www.devonsawa.org/about-devon/auditions/|archive-date=March 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works. Morgan was astounded by Sawa's performance in ''Idle Hands'', and Sawa was hired.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /> Of the script, Sawa said, \"There's not a lot of good stuff{{nbsp}}[. . .] for my age. You get a lot of scripts and all but they're teen ensembles and they're just crap. And then I got Flight 180{{nbsp}}[. . .] it's just awesome.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" />\n\nSawa described his role as \"in the beginning, [Alex] was kinda loopy and cotter, and you know, probably not the most popular guy in school. I think he might have been a dork, you know, doing their stuff and they had their own thing going and they're after the two beautiful girls in school, but there's no chance of that happening. I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes\". \"Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible,\" Wong said. \"He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" /> Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as \"a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" />\n\n[[Ali Larter]], who starred in the 1999 film ''[[Varsity Blues (film)|Varsity Blues]]'', was cast as female lead [[Clear Rivers]]. \"The film shows how easy it is to turn on someone, to blame someone when you're scared,\" Larter said. \"It's also about trusting your intuitions and yourself\". She defined her part as \"that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself and had made a life within that. She's an artist, she lives by herself, and she's kinda holding to her grip for what the world has given her\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n[[Seann William Scott]], famous for portraying [[Steve Stifler]] in the 1999 film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', was hired as class clown Billy Hitchcock. Scott admired the film and felt that \"it's [as] dark and eerie as any ''Twilight Zone''\".<ref name=\"Angel\" /> He laughed at his role, saying that \"[he] is lacking some social skills, he doesn't have quite a few friends, and he's like the tag-along\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /> Scott was surprised when in the script his character was written as fat. The writers eventually changed it for Scott.<ref name=\"Platinum\" />\n\n''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' star [[Kerr Smith]] was cast as jock Carter Horton. Smith identified Carter as \"your typical high school bully whose life depends on anger\" and mentioned the fact that Carter feared Alex not having control of his own life.<ref name=\"XFiles\" />\n\n[[Kristen Cloke]], Morgan's wife, was cast as teacher Valerie Lewton.<ref name=\"Cast\">{{cite web |work=Yahoo!

As an actor, I can find a way to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things\". Cloke described her part as \"strong and sassy \u2013 in control. After the crash, she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change.

Detmer defined Terry as \"very put-together [and] seems content to defer to [Carter] \u2013 to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her\".<ref name=\"Angel\" /> On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. \"I believe in fate.

The cast members were filming other projects during production, so filming schedules had to be moved repeatedly for all of the cast to appear. Sawa restrained his appearance in ''[[The Guilty (2000 film)|The Guilty]]'' during production, and even commented that \"[he] had to share a trailer with [[Bill Pullman]] because it was bigger and would make him look more famous\".<ref name=\"Devon\" /> Smith, who was a regular in ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', had to hold episodes for the film.<ref name=\"Dawson\">{{cite web|publisher=Sony Entertainment|work=Dawson's Creek|title=Dawson's Creek Official Website|url=http://www.dawsonscreek.com/|access-date=April 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124010519/http://www.dawsonscreek.com/|archive-date=November 24, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Detmer, her death scene (being rammed by a speeding bus) was filmed first because \"it was easy but much anticipated\".<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" /> All death scenes were filmed using [[lifecasting|lifecasts]] of the actual actors.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /> The death scenes, the memorial, the forest scene and the scenes in [[Paris]] were all filmed in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].<ref name=\"Platinum\" /> Additional scenes were filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[San Francisco]].<ref name=\"Platinum\" /> For the airport, the crew used [[Vancouver International Airport]] as a stand-in for [[John F.

To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of \"skewing\" the sets. \"What I've tried to do with the sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing that calls attention to itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness\u2014the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right\". To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set\u2014one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\n\"On the skewed sets I force the perspective either vertically or horizontally,\" Willet explained. \"Nothing is square and, although you can't put your finger on it, it just makes you feel like something is not right\". Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. \"In the real world, the colors are bright and rich,\" Willet said. \"In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic\".<ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nThe plane scene during which passengers die in mid-air was created inside a very large [[sound stage]]. The three-ton hydraulic [[gimbal]] was operated automatically. \"We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people,\" [[special effect]]s supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the onboard sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. Sawa said that \"the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real\". Wong said, \"You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting.\"<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nA miniature model of the [[Boeing 747]] airplane was created for the explosion scene. The model, one of the most detailed miniature scenes in the film, was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide, and the landing gear was made from all machined metals.<ref name=\"Prop\">{{cite web|website=YourProps.com|title=Final Destination (2000), Original Screen Used 747 Used During Production, original/screen-us|url=http://www.yourprops.com/Original-Screen-Used-747-Used-During-Production-original---screen-used-movie-props-Final-Destination--2000--prop-47725.html|access-date=April 20, 2011}}</ref> According to [[visual effects]] supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw, the miniature had to be launched about 40 feet up into the air to make it look like a real Boeing 747 exploded into a fireball. If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air. To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" />\n\nThe train scene (in which Carter's car is smashed by the train) was one of the most difficult scenes to shoot. The car used for the crash was a replica of the original, severed in half prior to filming. According to Sonderhoff, in order to ensure the safety of the actors, they had to make sure that there was no real sheet metal in the car.<ref name=\"XFiles\" /><ref name=\"Platinum\" /><ref name=\"Angel\" />\n\nFor the death scenes, the crew used several lifecasts of the actors and [[chocolate syrup]] for [[fake blood]]. Creating the [[Rube Goldberg]] effect for Ms. Lewton's death scene was the most difficult to plan according to the crew.
