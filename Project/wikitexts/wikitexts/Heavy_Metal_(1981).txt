It starred the voices of [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Jackie Burroughs]], [[John Candy]], [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Don Francks]], [[Martin Lavut]], [[Marilyn Lightstone]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Alice Playten]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Percy Rodriguez]], [[Susan Roman]], [[Richard Romanus]], [[August Schellenberg]], [[John Vernon]], and [[Zal Yanovsky]]. The screenplay was written by Daniel Goldberg and [[Len Blum]].\n\nThe film is an [[Anthology film|anthology]] of various science fiction and fantasy stories tied together by a single theme of an evil force that is \"the sum of all evils\". It was adapted from ''Heavy Metal'' magazine and original stories in the same spirit. Like the magazine, the film features a great deal of [[graphic violence]], [[sexuality]], and [[nudity]]. Its production was expedited by having several [[animation company|animation houses]] working simultaneously on different segments. Despite the mixed reviews by film critics on its initial release, the film was a modest success at the box office and has since achieved [[Cult film|cult status]]. The film's influential soundtrack was packaged by music manager [[Irving Azoff]] and included several popular rock bands and artists, including [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Sammy Hagar]], [[Don Felder]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[DEVO]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], and [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], among others.<ref name=\"Heavy Metal\"/>\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]'' was released in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n===\"Soft Landing\"===\nBased on the comic of the same name by [[Dan O'Bannon]] and Thomas Warkentin.\n\nThe title sequence story opens with a [[Space Shuttle]] orbiting the Earth. The bay doors open, releasing a 1960 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Corvette]]. An [[astronaut]] seated in the car then begins descending through Earth's atmosphere, landing in a desert canyon.\n\n;Crew\n* [[Jimmy T.

He says he has something to show her. When he opens his case, a green, crystalline sphere rises out and melts him. It introduces itself to the terrified girl as \"the sum of all evils\". Looking into the orb known as the Loc-Nar, the girl sees how it has influenced societies throughout time and space. At the end of the film (the Epilogue), the anthology's theme comes full-circle back to the girl's home.\n\n;Cast\n* [[Percy Rodriguez]] (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Don Francks]] as Grimaldi\n* Caroline Semple as Girl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Harold Whitaker]] \u2013 director\n* [[John Halas]] \u2013 producer\n\n===\"Harry Canyon\"===\nOriginal story by [[Daniel Goldberg (producer)|Daniel Goldberg]] and [[Len Blum]]; based on ''[[The Long Tomorrow (comics)|The Long Tomorrow]]'' by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]].\n\nIn a dystopian and crime-ridden [[New York City]] in 2031, cynical taxicab driver Harry Canyon narrates his day in [[film noir]] style, grumbling about his fares and frequent robbery attempts he thwarts with a [[Raygun|disintegrator]] installed in the back of his seat. He stumbles into an incident where he rescues a sexy young woman from Rudnick, a gangster who murdered her father. She explains that her father discovered the Loc-Nar, and they have been pursued relentlessly by people attempting to obtain it. Harry takes her to his apartment, where they have sex. She decides to sell the Loc-Nar to Rudnick and split the money with Harry. Rudnick is disintegrated by the Loc-Nar at the exchange, and she attempts to double-cross Harry to keep the money for herself. When she pulls out a gun, Harry uses the disintegrator on her. He keeps the money, and summarizes the incident as a \"two-day ride with one hell of a tip\".\n\n;Cast\n{{div col}}\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Alien, Henchman\n* [[John Candy]] as Desk Sergeant\n* [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Whore\n* [[Susan Roman]] as Girl, Satellite\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Harry Canyon\n* [[Al Waxman]] as Rudnick\n{{div col end}}\n\n;Crew\n{{div col}}\n* [[Pino van Lamsweerde]] \u2013 director\n* W.

During a lightning experiment, the orb hurls the young man into the world of Neverwhere, where he transforms into a naked, muscular man called [[Den (comics)|Den]], an acronym for his earth name, David Ellis Norman. There, Den witnesses a strange ritual, rescuing a beautiful, young woman who is about to be sacrificed to [[Cthulhu|Uhluhtc]]. Reaching safety, she introduces herself as Katherine Wells from the British colony of [[Gibraltar]]. The two start having sex, but are interrupted by the minions of Ard, an immortal man who wants to obtain the Loc-Nar for himself. After being taken to see Ard, Den demands to see Katherine. His request is ignored and Ard orders his men to castrate Den. Den fights off the soldiers and shoots Ard, who is immortal and heals immediately. The girl turns out to be sleeping, encased in glass under a spell where only Ard can awaken her. Ard offers Den a deal: if he gets the Loc-Nar from the Queen and brings it to him, the girl will be released. Den agrees and infiltrates the palace along with Ard's best soldier, Norl. They are promptly caught by the Queen's guards, but she offers leniency if Den has sex with her. He complies, thereby distracting the Queen while the raiding party steals the Loc-Nar. Den escapes and races back to rescue Katherine from Ard. Recreating the lightning incident that drew him to Neverwhere, he is able to banish Ard and the Queen. Den suspects that they were teleported to Earth. Refusing the opportunity to take the Loc-Nar for himself, Den rides with Katherine into the sunset, content to remain in Neverwhere. As for the Loc-Nar, it rises into the sky and lands on a space station where it is picked up by someone else.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* John Candy as [[Den (comics)|Den]]\n* [[Jackie Burroughs]] as Katherine Wells\n* [[Martin Lavut]] as Ard\n* Marilyn Lightstone as Queen\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Norl\n\n;Crew\n* [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] \u2013 director\n* Jerry Hibbert \u2013 producer\n* [[Richard Corben]] \u2013 writer\n\n===\"Captain Sternn\"===\nBased on [[Captain Sternn|the character of the same name]] created by [[Bernie Wrightson]].\n\nOn a space station, crooked space captain [[Captain Sternn|Lincoln F. Sternn]] is on trial for numerous serious charges presented by the prosecutor consisting of 12 counts of murder in the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 counts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape&nbsp;\u2014 and one moving violation. Pleading \"not guilty\" against the advice of his [[lawyer]] Charlie, Sternn explains that he expects to be acquitted because he bribed a witness named Hanover Fiste. Fiste takes the stand upon being called to by the prosecutor, but his perjury is subverted when the Loc-Nar, now the size of a marble, causes him to blurt out highly incriminating statements about Sternn (though whether or not any of them are true is unknown) before changing him into a hulking muscular brute that chases Sternn throughout the station, breaking through bulkheads and wreaking havoc. Eventually, he corners Sternn, who gives him his promised payoff, and he promptly shrinks back to his scrawny original form. Sternn opens a trap door under Fiste, ejecting him into space. The Loc-Nar enters Earth's atmosphere with Fiste's flaming severed hand still clinging to it.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] as Hanover Fiste\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Charlie, the lawyer\n* [[Douglas Kenney]] as Regolian\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as [[Captain Sternn|Captain Lincoln F.

This original story was created by Cornelius Cole III.\n\nThe original rough animatics are set to a loop of the beginning of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\". The 1996 VHS release included this segment at the end of the tape. On the DVD release, this segment is included as a bonus feature. In both released versions, the sequence is set to the music of \"Passacaglia\" (from ''Magnificat''), composed and conducted by [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].\n\n===\"B-17\"===\nA [[World War II]] [[B-17 bomber]] nicknamed the ''Pacific Pearl'' makes a difficult bombing run with heavy damage and casualties. As the bomber limps home, the co-pilot goes back to check on the crew. Finding nothing but dead bodies, he notices the Loc-Nar trailing the plane. Informing the pilot, he heads back to the cockpit, when the Loc-Nar rams itself into the plane and reanimates the dead crew members as [[zombie]]s. The co-pilot is killed, while the pilot parachutes away in time. He lands on an island where he finds a graveyard of airplanes from various times, along with the wrecked airplanes' zombified airmen, who surround him, sealing the horrified pilot's fate.\n\n;Cast\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* Don Francks as Co-Pilot (Holden)\n* George Touliatos as Pilot (Skip)\n* [[Zal Yanovsky]] as Navigator\n\n;Crew\n* Barrie Nelson \u2013 director\n* W.

At the meeting, the doctor tries to dismiss the occurrences. When he sees the Loc-Nar in the locket of Gloria, a beautiful buxom stenographer, he begins to behave erratically and sexually assaults her. A colossal starship drills through the roof and abducts the doctor and, by accident, Gloria. The ship's robot is irritated at Anrak, who is actually a malfunctioning [[Android (robot)|android]], but its mood changes when it sees Gloria. With the help of the ship's alien pilot Edsel and co-pilot Zeke, the robot convinces Gloria to stay on board and have [[Sex robot|\"robot sex\"]] (albeit off-screen). Meanwhile, Edsel and Zeke snort a huge amount of a powdered drug called Plutonian Nyborg before flying home, zoning out on the cosmos.

As they begin to climb the volcano, it erupts, and green slime covers the crowd, mutating them into an evil barbarian army. The mutants subsequently attack a nearby city of peaceful scholars. Desperate, the city leaders mentally summon the Taarakians, a once powerful but declining warrior race with whom the city had a pact, but the city falls before the call can be answered.\n\nTaarna, a beautiful, mute warrior and the last of the Taarakians, receives the summons, and after ritually preparing herself, she and her avian mount fly to the beleaguered city, only to find the citizens dead. Determined to avenge them, she begins following the trail of their murderers and encounters a small band of the mutant barbarians. After killing them, and with more information at hand, she travels towards the mutant camp, but she and her mount are captured.\n\nTaarna is tortured and thrown into an open pit, unconscious. Her mount escapes and rescues her. She tries going for the Loc-Nar, but the mutants pursue and shoot her mount down. The mutant leader faces Taarna in a duel to the death, wounding her, but Taarna manages to kill him. With the last of their strength, Taarna and her companion make a death flight to the volcano. As they approach, the Loc-Nar warns her off, claiming that sacrificing herself would be futile. Ignoring the Loc-Nar, Taarna unleashes the power imbued in her sword and dives into the volcano, destroying the Loc-Nar.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* Percy Rodriguez (uncredited) as Loc-Nar\n* [[Thor Bishopric]] as Boy\n* Ned Conlon as Councilman #1\n* Len Doncheff as Barbarian #1\n* Don Francks as Barbarian #2\n* Joseph Golland as Councilman #2\n* Charles Joliffe as Councilman #3\n* [[Mavor Moore]] as Elder\n* August Schellenberg as Taarak\n* [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]] as Bartender\n* George Touliatos as Barbarian #3\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Barbarian Leader\n* Zal Yanovsky as Barbarian #4\n\n'''Music'''\n* \"[[E5150]]\" by [[Black Sabbath]]\n* \"The Mob Rules\" by Black Sabbath\n* \"[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]\" by [[Devo]]\n\n===\"Epilogue\"===\nAs the final story ends, the Loc-Nar that was terrorizing the girl explodes, destroying the mansion in the process.

Additionally, Taarna the Taarakian was rotoscoped, using Toronto model Carole Desbiens as a model for the animated character. The shot of the exploding house near the end of the movie was originally to be rotoscoped, but as the film's release date had been moved up from October/November to August 7, 1981, a lack of time prevented this. This remains as the only non-animated sequence in the film. During development of this film, the Canadian animation studio, [[Nelvana Limited]], was offered the chance to work on ''Heavy Metal'', but they declined their offer, instead working on their first theatrical film, ''[[Rock & Rule]]''.\n\nFantasy illustrator [[Chris Achilleos|Chris Achill\u00e9os]] designed and painted the iconic promotional poster image, commissioned in 1980, that features the central character Taarna on her birdlike steed.

Both songs can be found on Blue \u00d6yster Cult's album ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]''.
