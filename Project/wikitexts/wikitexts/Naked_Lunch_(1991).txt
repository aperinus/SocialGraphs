It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[William S. Burroughs]]' 1959 [[Naked Lunch|novel of the same name]], and an [[international co-production]] of [[Cinema of Canada|Canada]], [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].\n\nThe film was released on 27 December 1991 in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]], and 24 April 1992 in the United Kingdom by [[First Independent Films]]. It received positive reviews from critics, but was a [[box-office bomb|box office flop]], garnering only $2.6 million out of a $17\u201318 million budget due to a limited release. It won numerous honours, including the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Director]] and seven [[13th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], notably [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. ''Naked Lunch'' has since become a [[cult film]], acclaimed for its surrealistic visual and thematic elements.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1953, [[Pest control|Exterminator]] William Lee finds that his wife Joan is stealing his supply of [[insecticide]] to [[Recreational drug use|use as a recreational drug]]. Lee is arrested by the police, and he begins hallucinating due to being exposed to the insecticide. Lee comes to believe that he is a secret agent, and his boss, a giant talking [[beetle]], assigns him the mission of killing Joan, who is allegedly an agent of an organization called Interzone Incorporated. Lee dismisses the beetle's instructions and kills it. Lee returns home to find Joan having sex with Hank, one of his writer friends. Shortly afterwards, he accidentally kills her while attempting to shoot a drinking glass off her head to emulate [[William Tell]].\n\nHaving inadvertently accomplished his mission, Lee flees to [[Interzone (book)|Interzone]], located in a city somewhere in [[North Africa]]. He spends his time writing reports concerning his mission; these documents, at the insistence of his visiting literary colleagues, are eventually compiled into the titular book. While Lee is addicted to assorted mind-altering substances, his replacement typewriter, a Clark Nova, becomes a talking insect which tells him to find Dr. Benway by seducing Joan Frost, a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of his dead wife. There is a row at gunpoint with Joan's husband Tom, after Lee steals his typewriter, which is then destroyed by the Clark Nova insect. Lee also encounters Yves Cloquet, who is apparently an attractive young gay Swiss gentleman. However, Lee later discovers that Yves is merely disguised as a human, and that his true form is a huge monstrous shapeshifting centipede.\n\nAfter concluding that Dr. Benway is actually secretly masterminding a narcotics operation for a drug called \"black meat\" which is supposedly derived from the guts of [[Scolopendra gigantea|giant Brazilian centipedes]], Lee encounters Tom's housekeeper Fadela, previously observed to be an agent of the narcotics operation. Fadela reveals herself as Dr. Benway in disguise. After being recruited as a double agent for the black meat operation, Lee completes his report and flees Interzone to Annexia with Joan Frost. Stopped by the Annexian border patrol and instructed to prove that he is a writer as he claims, Lee produces a pen. When this proves insufficient for passage, Lee, now having realized that accidentally murdering his wife has driven him to become a writer, demonstrates his William Tell routine using a glass atop Joan Frost's head. He again misses, and thus re-enacts the earlier killing of his wife. The border guards cheerfully bid him welcome to Annexia, and his new life as a writer. Lee is shown shedding a tear at this bittersweet accomplishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter Weller]] as William Lee\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Joan Frost / Joan Lee\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Tom Frost\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Yves Cloquet\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Dr. Benway\n* [[Monique Mercure]] as Fadela\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as Hank\n* [[Michael Zelniker]] as Martin\n* [[Robert A.
