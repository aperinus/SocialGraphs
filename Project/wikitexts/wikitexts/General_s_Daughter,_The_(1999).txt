It stars [[John Travolta]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Clarence Williams III]], and [[James Woods]]. The plot concerns the mysterious death of the daughter of a prominent [[United States Army|Army]] general. ''The General's Daughter'' received negative reviews from critics, but was a box-office success, grossing $149.7 million worldwide against an estimated budget of $60 to $95 million.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile in Georgia, Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, an undercover agent of the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Division Command]], masquerades as [[First Sergeant#United States Army|First Sergeant]] Frank White to broker an illegal arms trade with a self-proclaimed [[freedom fighter]]. At Fort MacCallum, Brenner gets a flat tire and Captain Elisabeth Campbell, a [[Psychological Operations (United States)|psychological operations]] officer and the daughter of Lieutenant General Joseph \"Fighting Joe\" Campbell, the base commander, helps him change it. The next evening she is found murdered. The base [[provost marshal]], Colonel William Kent, secures the crime scene. Brenner and rape specialist Warrant Officer Sara Sunhill are brought in to investigate. They receive Elisabeth's records and notice that her grades plummeted her second year at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Brenner wants to search Elisabeth's house, but Kent declines because it is off-base and therefore outside their jurisdiction.\n\nPicking the lock of Elisabeth's house, Brenner and Sunhill find a room containing video and [[BDSM]] equipment, but an intruder attacks him and removes the videotapes. He questions Elisabeth's superior officer, Colonel Robert Moore, whose evasiveness leads to his arrest on charges of [[Conduct unbecoming|conduct unbecoming an officer]]. At the crime scene, Sunhill is attacked in an attempt to intimidate her and Brenner. During the attack she notices one assailant is wearing a silver [[claddagh ring]], and identifies him as Captain Jake Elby. At gunpoint, Elby confesses that Elisabeth was sexually promiscuous with the men on the base as part of an extensive \"psychological warfare\" campaign against her father.\n\nBack at the jail, Kent releases Moore, confining him to quarters at his home on-base. Upon returning to Moore's home, he, Brenner, and Sunhill find him dead with an apparently self-inflicted bullet to the head, which Brenner doubts was suicide. Campbell's [[adjutant]], Colonel George Fowler, attempts to close the investigation stating Moore killed himself out of guilt, but Brenner insists on continuing the investigation. Brenner and Sunhill travel to West Point, where Elisabeth's psychiatrist, Colonel Donald Slesinger, explains that during a training exercise seven years earlier, several cadets brutally gang-raped Elisabeth and left her naked and staked down in the same position she was found murdered, and a cadet came forward regarding the attack. Sunhill tracks down the former cadet and tricks him into admitting his presence during the attack; feeling trapped and guilt-ridden, he admits to witnessing it and explains how the male cadets hated Elisabeth, since she surpassed them as a cadet.\n\nBrenner visits the general, who corroborates the attack and confirms that before visiting Elisabeth in the hospital, he met with another general, who felt the assailants would go undetected given the type of training exercise and stated the attack going public could ruin the concept of women in the military. Campbell reluctantly agreed and tried to convince Elisabeth to forget the attack, effectively traumatizing her. After revealing that Sunhill easily identified Elisabeth's assailants, who face 20 years in prison, Brenner deduces Elisabeth had Moore help her stage the attack scene so she could force her father to see what he covered up. Campbell states that he threatened Elisabeth with a court martial due to her affairs with multiple officers, including Kent, and that she responded to his ultimatum with the staged attack scene. Unmoved, he left her tied naked to the stakes.\n\nRealizing that Kent releasing Moore from prison, taking Elisabeth's keys, and sleeping with her makes him a suspect, Brenner learns that Kent is at the crime scene with Sunhill and wants him to join them. At the scene, Kent admits his obsession with Elisabeth and that after he found her at the staged scene, upset over her father being unmoved by her effort, she dismissed Kent and spat in his face. Enraged, he strangled her. After admitting to murdering Moore to evade detection, Kent then commits suicide by stepping on a [[S-mine|mine]]. As Campbell prepares to board the plane to accompany Elisabeth's body to the funeral, Brenner confronts him and blames him for her death, explaining that his betrayal effectively killed her and Kent just put her out of her misery. Though Campbell warns him to keep silent, Brenner has him [[court-martial]]ed for conspiracy to conceal a crime, ruining the general's career.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as [[Chief Warrant Officer]] Paul Brenner\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Chief Warrant Officer Sarah Sunhill\n* [[James Cromwell]] as [[Lieutenant General]] Joe Campbell\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as [[Colonel]] Bill Kent\n* [[Leslie Stefanson]] as [[Captain]] Elisabeth Campbell, General Campbell's daughter and [[Psychological Operations (United States)|Psychological Operations]] Officer\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as [[Chief of Police]] Yardley\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as Colonel George Fowler, [[Adjuntant]] to the General\n* [[James Woods]] as Colonel Bob Moore, Elisabeth's [[commanding officer]]\n* [[Mark Boone Jr.]] as [[Sergeant]] Dalbert Elkins\n* [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] as Colonel Don Slesinger, Elisabeth's psychiatrist at West Point\n* [[Boyd Kestner]] as Captain Jake Elby\n* [[Brad Beyer]] as Captain Bransford\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Captain Goodson\n* [[John Frankenheimer]] as General Sonnenberg\n\n==Production==\n''The General's Daughter'' was directed by [[Simon West]] and produced by [[Mace Neufeld]].
