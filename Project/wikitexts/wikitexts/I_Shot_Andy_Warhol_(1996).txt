The film then uses flashbacks to when Valerie was living in New York as a sex worker, then to her difficult childhood, then to her success in studying psychology at college. Here, Valerie discovers that she is a lesbian, that she can write, and that she has a distinctive view of the world. This leads her to New York City and its downtown [[Bohemianism|underworld]]. Through her friend Stevie, she meets [[Candy Darling]], who in turn introduces her to Warhol.\n\nValerie also meets [[Maurice Girodias]], the publisher of [[Olympia Press]]. While Valerie wants Warhol to produce her play, ''[[Up Your Ass (play)|Up Your Ass]]'', Girodias wants her to write a pornographic novel for him. Once she signs a contract with Girodias, she comes to suspect his offer is not a generous one and may not be in her best interest. She comes to regret signing this contract. At this point, her increasing derangement leads her to believe that Warhol and Girodias are controlling her. The film concludes, where it began, with Solanas' attempted murder of Warhol. Warhol lives in fear that Valerie will strike again and never fully recovers from the shooting. The ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'' becomes a feminist classic.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as [[Valerie Solanas]]\n* [[Jared Harris]] as [[Andy Warhol]]\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as [[Candy Darling]]\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Stevie\n* [[Lothaire Bluteau]] as [[Maurice Girodias]]\n* [[Anna Levine]] as Iris\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as [[Alan Burke]]\n* [[Tahnee Welch]] as [[Viva (actress)|Viva]]\n* Jamie Harrold as [[Jackie Curtis]]\n* [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] as [[Gerard Malanga]]\n* [[James K.

Solanas' writing is set against the new technologies of reproduction championed by Warhol.{{sfn|Heller|2008|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nMany people who knew Solanas and Warhol tried to rationalize the shooting. Stephen Koch, who in 1973 wrote a study of Warhol's film, stated: \"Valerie lives in terror of dependence: That is what the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]'' is about, an absolute terror before the experience of need. Like Warhol, Solanas is obsessed with an image of [[autonomy]], except that... she has played the obsession desperately, rather than with Warhol's famous cool.\"<ref>Harron, I Shot Andy Warhol, Grove Press NY, 1995</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nFilm review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 77% of critics gave the film positive reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_shot_andy_warhol/ \"I Shot Andy Warhol\"] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted score of 75/100, based on 20 critics, denoting \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-shot-andy-warhol \"I Shot Andy Warhol\"] at [[Metacritic]]</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n====Wins====\n* [[Gij\u00f3n International Film Festival]] Best Art Direction \u2013 Th\u00e9r\u00e8se DePrez\n* [[Seattle International Film Festival]] Golden Space Needle Award for Best Actress \u2013 [[Lili Taylor]]\n* [[Stockholm Film Festival]] Award for Best Actress \u2013 Lili Taylor\n* [[Sundance Film Festival]] Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance \u2013 Lili Taylor<ref>[https://ew.com/article/1996/02/09/1996-sundance-film-festival/ The 1996 Sundance Film Festival|EW.com]</ref>\n\n====Nominations====\n* [[Independent Spirit Awards]] Best First Feature \u2013 [[Mary Harron]], [[Tom Kalin]], and [[Christine Vachon]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwC2g6a2lKk 12th annual Spirit Awards ceremony - FULL SHOW | 1997 | Film Independent on YouTube]</ref>\n* [[Stockholm Film Festival]] Bronze Horse\n* [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Jury Prize \u2013 Dramatic\n\n==Home media==\n''I Shot Andy Warhol'' was released on Region 1 [[DVD]] on January 23, 2001.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = I Shot Andy Warhol: Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| released   = 30 April 1996\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 43:11\n| label      = [[TAG Recordings]] / [[Atlantic Records]]\n}}\n\n{{tracklist |extra_column=Artist |total_length= 43:11\n|title1=[[Season_of_the_Witch_(song)|Season Of The Witch]] |extra1= [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]] |length1= 5:19 |writer1= [[Donovan]]\n|title2=[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe In Magic]] |extra2= [[The Lovin' Spoonful]] |length2= 2:06 |writer2= [[John Sebastian]]\n|title3=[[Love Is All Around]] |extra3= [[R.E.M.]] |length3= 3:05 |writer3= [[Reg Presley]]\n|title4=[[Buffalo Springfield (album)#Track listing|Burned]] |extra4= [[Wilco]] |length4= 2:34 |writer4= [[Neil Young]]\n|title5=[[Itchycoo Park]] |extra5= [[Ben Lee]] |length5= 3:04 |writer5= [[Ronnie Lane]] / [[Steve Marriott]]\n|title6=[[Sunshine Superman (song)|Sunshine Superman]] |extra6= [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] |length6= 5:01 |writer6= [[Donovan]]\n|title7=[[Mas que Nada]] |extra7= [[S\u00e9rgio_Mendes]] and [[S\u00e9rgio_Mendes#Brasil '66|Brasil '66]] |length7= 2:38 |writer7= [[Jorge Ben]]\n|title8=[[False_Start_(album)#Track listing|Gimi A Little Break]] |extra8= [[Love (band)|Love]] |length8= 2:02 |writer8= [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]]\n|title9=Sensitive Euro Man |extra9= [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] |length9= 3:16 |writer9= [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]\n|title10=[[Kick Out the Jams (song)|Kick Out the Jams]] |extra10= [[MC5]] |length10= 2:54 |writer10= [[Dennis Thompson (drummer)|Dennis Thompson]] / [[Fred \"Sonic\" Smith|Frederick D.
