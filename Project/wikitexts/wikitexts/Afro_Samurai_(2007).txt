It was originally serialized irregularly in the [[avant-garde]] ''d\u014djinshi'' [[manga magazine]] ''[[Nou Nou Hau]]'' from November 1998 to September 2002. Inspired by Okazaki's love of [[soul music|soul]] and [[hip hop music]] and American media, it follows the life of Afro Samurai who witnessed his father, Rokutaro (owner of the No. 1 headband) killed by a male gunslinger named Justice (owner of the No. 2 headband) while he was a child. As an adult, Afro sets off to kill Justice and avenge his father.\n\nThe ''Afro Samurai'' ''d\u014djinshi'' was adapted into an [[anime]] [[miniseries]] by [[Gonzo (studio)|Gonzo]] in 2007, along with the [[television film]] sequel ''[[Afro Samurai: Resurrection]]'' in 2009, both of which starred [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as the title character. The anime gained two [[Emmy]] nominations, for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, which it won an Outstanding Animated Program. After the release of the anime series, Okazaki remade the original ''Afro Samurai'' ''d\u014djinshi'' into a two-volume manga. To be only released in North America, [[Tor Books]] and [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the title and published it under their new ''Tor/Seven Seas'' imprint. In addition to the miniseries, ''Afro Samurai'' has been adapted into [[Afro Samurai (video game)|a video game]] and an upcoming live action film. For the television series and film, two soundtracks by the [[RZA]] of [[Wu-Tang Clan]] were released and a profile book in Japan.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Afro Samurai characters}}\nIn a [[Feudalism|feudal]] yet [[Future|futuristic]] Japan, it is said that the one wearing the Number 1 headband is the greatest warrior in the world and shall possess [[god]]-like powers. Some believe it grants immortality, while others believe they received headbands from the gods themselves. The only way to obtain the Number 1 headband is to challenge and defeat the current wearer in combat. However, only the wearer of the Number 2 headband can challenge the Number 1 whereas anyone can challenge the Number 2. Thus, the Number 2 can survive. The Number 2 headband's current owner, the outlaw Justice, fights and kills Rokutaro, Afro's father and owner of the Number 1 headband. A young Afro witnesses the fight and vows revenge against Justice, who tells him to seek him out when he is \"ready to duel a god.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vachev |first1=July |title=Afro Samurai rundown |url=https://ifgn.com/afro-samurai-afro-samurai-2-revenge-of-kuma/ |website=IFGN |access-date=January 30, 2019|publisher=IFGN}}</ref>\n\nYears later, Afro wears the Number 2 headband. He kills a group of [[Assassination|assassins]], criminals and mercenaries, sent by the Empty Seven Clan, for whom they seek the headband. Recalling his tragic past, Afro goes to Mount Shumi to face Jinno, his childhood friend and fellow samurai, who blames him for killing their master (who had the Number 2 headband). He defeats Jinno and tracks down Justice, who explains that there are other headbands in existence, ranging to an unspecified higher number. Claiming that he intends to use his power as the Number 1 to bring peace to all mankind, Justice reveals that he killed all headband bearers and decorated his safe house with corpses. Afro kills Justice and takes the Number 1 headband. Afro settles in as the new Number 1 while Jinno, now claiming all headbands from Justice, returns to take revenge.\n\nIn ''[[Afro Samurai: Resurrection]]'', Jinno and his sister Sio, steal Rokutaro's body and the Number 1 headband. After killing Shichigoro and taking the Number 2 headband, Afro confronts the resurrected Rokutaro, who kills the siblings. Afro defeats Rokutaro, gives the Number 2 headband to Shichigoro's son Kotaro, and peacefully continues wearing the Number 1. Elsewhere, a unknown man meets the revived Justice.\n\n==Production==\nOkazaki started drawing [[African Americans|African-American]] characters on items like [[Kleenex]] boxes when he was a teenager, inspired by his fondness for [[hip hop]] and [[soul music]]. He also drew ideas from American media and their depiction of Japanese culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema-factory.net/contents/317_afrosamurai/interview.html|script-title=ja:\u6728\ufa11\u6587\u667a\u76e3\u7763\u3001\u5ca1\u5d0e\u80fd\u58eb(\u539f\u4f5c\u8005)\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|language=ja|access-date=October 28, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210015102/http://www.cinema-factory.net/contents/317_afrosamurai/interview.html| archive-date= 10 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Takashi started combining elements of [[samurai]] into his work, eventually developing the design for Afro, which was also based in the legendary black samurai [[Yasuke]] who existed during the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan.
