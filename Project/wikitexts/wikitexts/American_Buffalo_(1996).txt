The film is based on [[David Mamet]]'s 1975 play ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]''.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Gregory Mosher]], who also directed the [[American Buffalo (play)|theatrical version]] of ''American Buffalo''.<ref name=\"nytdiamond\">{{cite news | first=Jamie | last=Diamond|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/01/movies/a-story-his-father-might-have-told.html |title=A Story His Father Might Have Told | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 1, 1996|access-date=December 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDonny runs a junk shop in a sparsely populated and decaying neighborhood. Teach, who has no visible means of support, spends many hours a day at the shop, as does Bobby, a young man who is eager to please Donny in any way he can.\n\nTeach comes up with a scheme to rob the home of a man whose safe is said to contain rare coins. Bobby is often sent on errands for food or information. Teach's nerves are already on edge when Bobby suddenly returns to say that a third man involved in that night's robbery can't go through with it because he is in the hospital. Donny distrusts what he is hearing and is unable to locate the man in the hospital, whereupon Teach angrily turns on Bobby.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Teach\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Donny\n* [[Sean Nelson (actor)|Sean Nelson]] as Bobby\n\n==Production==\nIn 1986, [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] announced that a film adaptation in the works, but the film was eventually stuck in development hell for years.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1986-03-19|title=Cannon To Produce 'Zorba', 'Buffalo'|page=4|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Al Pacino]], who originated the role of Teach on Broadway, was the first choice to play the role in the adaptation; however, Pacino did not respond in a timely fashion so Corrente offered the role to Dustin Hoffman. The film was shot on location in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], Corrente's home town.<ref name=\"nythold\" />\n\n==Reception==\n[[Stephen Holden]] called it an \"ugly fable of American [[free enterprise]] at the bottom of the food chain,\" adding, \"With its [[staccato]], [[profanity]]-laced language and metaphorically potent setting, ''American Buffalo'' folds a stylized parody of American [[gangster movie]]s into a bleak [[Samuel Beckett]] vision that is wide enough to accommodate many interpretations....In filming ''American Buffalo'', Mr. Corrente has taken as conventionally naturalistic an approach as the play permits, playing down its social metaphors to concentrate on the characters' psychology.\"<ref name=\"nythold\">{{cite news| first=Stephen |last=Holden| author-link= Stephen Holden| title= Ratso Rizzo's Long-Lost Son| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E2D8163AF930A2575AC0A960958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= September 13, 1996|access-date=September 9, 2011}}</ref> [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] gave the film a [[Academic grading in the United States|\"B\"]], saying \"''American Buffalo'' is about nothing less Mametian than commerce, friendship, betrayal, despair, and American hustle. Director [[Michael Corrente]] (''[[Federal Hill (film)|Federal Hill]]'') works at getting the story off the stage (it's set in a junk shop) by occasionally moving to an empty, decrepit city street. But mostly he just locks on to Hoffman and Franz.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum| author-link= Lisa Schwarzbaum| title= American Buffalo| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,294262,00.html | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York City|date= September 27, 1996| access-date=September 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 and a half out of four stars, saying \"It is a clich\u00e9, but true, that some plays have their real life on the stage. ''American Buffalo'' is a play like that&mdash;or, at least, it is not a play that finds its life in this movie....Because the film never really brings to life its inner secrets, it seems leisurely, and toward the end, it seems long. It doesn't have the energy or the danger of [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s [[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|film version]] of Mamet's ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]''. The language is all there, and it is a joy, but the irony is missing. Or, more precisely, the irony about the irony.\"<ref>{{cite news| first=Roger |last=Ebert | author-link= Roger Ebert| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960913/REVIEWS/609130301/1023| title= American Buffalo | date= September 13, 1996 | newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | access-date=September 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTwo months later, upon the film's UK release, Anne Billson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' concluded \"The film's principal interest lies, as it always does with Mamet, in the hypnotic language; repeat your sentences about 20 times, shuffling the word order, repeat the first name of whomever you're talking to as though it were a [[mantra]], add a judicious sprinkling of obscenities, and you've got the general idea. Franz, of television's ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', is terrific, but Hoffman, performing in 'street' mode, complete with long greasy hair, never allows you to forget that he's reciting lines. Eventually the hypnotic repetitiveness of the language and the total lack of action did their work, and the dreaded [[Sandman]], who hovers constantly at the shoulder of all film reviewers, paid me one of his visits.\"<ref>{{cite web| first=Anne |last= Billson| title= American Buffalo| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4706366/What-a-fabulous-dive.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423192813/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4706366/What-a-fabulous-dive.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=23 April 2010 | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | location = London, England | date= 30 November 1996|access-date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe score was composed and orchestrated by [[Thomas Newman]].
