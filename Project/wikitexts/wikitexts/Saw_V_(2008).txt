It is the fifth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Scott Patterson]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Julie Benz]], [[Carlo Rota]], and [[Meagan Good]]. The plot follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Peter Strahm as he pursues Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] after discovering his identity as one of the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s apprentices. Meanwhile, with John Kramer's threat that he will not go untested looming over him, Hoffman seeks to continue John's work and frame Strahm to keep his identity secret. The film also explores Hoffman's backstory and explains how he became Jigsaw's apprentice, while continuing several story lines started in ''[[Saw IV]]''.\n\nDavid Hackl served as the production designer of ''[[Saw II]]'', ''[[Saw III]]'', and ''Saw IV'' and second-unit director for ''Saw III'' and ''Saw IV'' before making his directorial debut with ''Saw V''.<ref>[https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 SAW V and SAW VI Director Already Signed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205065713/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 |date=December 5, 2007 }}, [[Bloody Disgusting]].

[[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, also returned to compose the score for the film. ''Saw'' creators [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] served as executive producers.\n\n''Saw V'' was released by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] in the United States on October 24, 2008, and received generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $113.9 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dominguez |first1=Noah |title=Spiral Pushes the Saw Franchise Past $1 Billion at the Box Office |url=https://www.cbr.com/spiral-box-office-update-saw-billion/ |website=[[cbr.com]] |access-date=5 May 2022 |date=23 May 2021}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Saw VI]]'', was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nConvicted murderer Seth Baxter wakes up chained to a table beneath a [[pendulum]] blade. He is told that he can release himself by crushing his hands between two presses. He does so, but the blade still bisects him as someone watches discreetly.\n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Peter Strahm escapes from the room he was locked in by Detective [[Mark Hoffman]]. He is then attacked by a figure in a pig mask and wakes up with his head sealed in a box being quickly filled with water. Outside, Hoffman delivers Corbett, the kidnapped daughter of Jeff Denlon, to the police and claims they are the only survivors. Strahm, having survived the trap by performing a [[tracheotomy]] with his pen, is brought out alive as well, much to Hoffman's shock.\n\nHoffman is promoted and credited with closing the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw]] case. Hoffman later finds a note in his office reading \"I know who you are,\" and learns of Agent Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's cell phone from the police evidence room. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were \"Detective Hoffman\" and questions how he escaped the plant. After being put on medical leave by his boss, Agent Dan Erickson, Strahm, suspicious of Hoffman, decides to uncover his involvement with Jigsaw and takes case files of past Jigsaw victims to research them.\n\nIn an underground sewer, Ashley, Brit, Charles, Luba and Mallick awaken with collars locked around their necks, connected by cables to a set of blades mounted on the wall behind them. The keys to the collars are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape informs them that they are all connected and that they must \"do the opposite\" of their instincts if they are all to survive the tests ahead of them. Ashley fails to retrieve the key and gets decapitated. In the second room, which is filled with explosives on a timer, Charles first attacks Mallick and then Luba, but she, Brit and Mallick each to retrieve keys to bomb shelters set in the walls. Charles is left to die when the timer expires and the explosives detonate. In the third room, Brit kills Luba and she and Mallick connect her corpse to five cables to complete an electric circuit that unlocks the next door. In the final room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the final door. They realize that all prior tests could have been completed without casualties if they had worked together, and figure out their connection: they were all involved in a building fire that killed eight people. Mallick and Brit concede a truce and each slice an arm in the saws to provide the blood needed to open the final door.\n\nStrahm learns that Hoffman killed Seth Baxter, who had killed Hoffman's sister, years prior. John Kramer abducted Hoffman after the fact, and blackmailed him into helping him set up his future \"games.\" Strahm concludes that everyone was meant to die at the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman. John's ex-wife Jill Tuck claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman tells Erickson about Strahm's theory of a second Jigsaw accomplice, Erickson tries to call him. Hoffman answers on Strahm's phone and hangs up. Erickson has one of his agents track the phone's signal.\n\nFollowing the signal to the sewer observation room, Erickson finds the phone and his own personnel file, both planted by Hoffman. He also finds the still-living Brit and Mallick and calls for medical attention, before putting an [[all-points bulletin]] on Strahm, convinced that he is Jigsaw's successor. Meanwhile, Strahm follows Hoffman to the renovated nerve gas house and finds a tape. In the tape, Hoffman urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman, whom he seals in the box. Strahm believes he has finally caught Hoffman, but the door to the room suddenly shuts itself and the walls begin to close in as the box is lowered beneath the floor. Strahm finishes playing the tape, which warns him that if he does not enter the box, he will die and be framed as Jigsaw's apprentice. Safe inside the box, Hoffman watches as Strahm unsuccessfully tries to escape the room and is ultimately crushed to death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]]\n* [[Scott Patterson]] as Agent Peter Strahm\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jill Tuck\n* [[Julie Benz]] as Brit Stevenson\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Luba Gibbs\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Agent Dan Erickson\n* [[Carlo Rota]] as Charles Salomon\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Mallick Scott\n* Laura Gordon as Ashley Kazon\n* [[Joris Jarsky]] as Seth Baxter\n* Mike Butters as Paul Leahy\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Chief of Police\n* Mike Realba as Detective Fisk\n* [[Jeff Pustil]] as Bernie Feldman\n* Dana Sorman as Law Office Receptionist\n* Sheila Shah as Special Agent Cowan\n* Samantha Lemole as Pamela Jenkins\n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as Officer Daniel Rigg\n* [[Athena Karkanis]] as Agent Lindsey Perez\n* [[Louis Ferreira|Justin Louis]] as Art Blank\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[David Tapp|Detective David Tapp]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as Lynn Denlon\n* [[Niamh Wilson]] as Corbett Denlon\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as Jeff Denlon\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Gus Colyard\n* Tim Burd as Obi Tate\n* [[Sarah Power]] as Angelina Acomb\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Saw V'' was written by ''[[Saw IV]]'' writers [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]],<ref name= \"LionsgatePubSawV\">[http://lionsgatepublicity.com/index_flash.html Lions Gate Publicity lists Saw V for October 24, 2008]</ref><ref name= \"igninterview\">[http://movies.ign.com/articles/830/830917p1.html IGN.com interview with Patrick Melton]</ref> though [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], who had directed all ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' films since ''[[Saw II]]'', affirmed in July 2007 that he would not direct another sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.hollywoodgothique.com/saw-iv-darren-lynn-bousman-interview/|title=SAW IV: Darren Lynn Bousman Interview|publisher=Hollywood Gothique|accessdate=June 29, 2021}}</ref> The film went into production after Christmas 2007.<ref name= \"moviesonline\">[http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13210.html SAW 5 Shooting This Xmas].

The series began with two major assets that set it apart: the concept of a brilliantly righteous executioner, and the actor who played him. Now, aside from Bell's brief, intermittent cameos, it has neither.
