The film was released on August 10, 2012. It received generally positive reviews, and the cast was praised for their performances. It was nominated for a Golden Globe and won a People's Choice Award.\n\n==Plot==\nAlthough a devoted couple, empty nesters Kay and Arnold Soames are in need of help to reignite the spark in their marriage. Married for thirty-one years, they have slept in separate bedrooms for various pragmatic reasons since their youngest child went off to college, and forgo any physical affection. One day Kay (who works as a Coldwater Creek employee) tells Arnold (a partner in an [[Omaha]] accounting firm) she has paid for them to undergo a week of intense marriage counseling with Dr. Bernie Feld in a coastal resort town in [[Maine]]. Arnold, a creature of plodding, unimaginative routine, denies their marriage is in trouble.\n\nIn sessions with Dr. Feld, a psychiatrist, they try to articulate their feelings, revitalize their relationship, and find the spark that caused them to fall in love in the first place. Dr. Feld counsels them, asking increasingly frank questions about their sex life and feelings. Being private and old-fashioned, Arnold is angry and defensive, unwilling to see the depth of his wife's disappointment. Angry and crying, Kay goes alone to a bar where she has several glasses of wine, confides in the female bartender and learns that few others are having any sex, either. Arnold visits a nautical museum.\n\nBack together, they spend the night in the same bed for the first time in years, and Kay awakes to find Arnold's arm around her. At this sign of progress, Dr. Feld urges new measures. They make halting attempts at intimacy on the bed of their budget motel and again in a movie theater, but this time with disastrous results.\n\nIn a one-on-one session, Dr. Feld explains to Arnold that couples seeking marriage counseling are doing so for a reason, and asks Arnold frankly, \"Is this the best you can do?\"  Arnold finally takes the initiative to arrange a romantic dinner and a night at a luxury inn, where they attempt to make love in front of a fireplace, but the grand gesture ultimately fails. At their final session, Dr. Feld tells them they've made much progress and should take up couples therapy back home.\n\nBack in Omaha, old habits resume. Kay offers to pet-sit for a fellow employee and packs a bag to stay there, as a first step in a permanent break with Arnold. That night, both are shown in bed trying to sleep. Arnold enters Kay's bedroom and they tenderly embrace. The lovemaking that follows is warm, natural, and quietly passionate. The next morning it's clear that the marriage has shifted into an improved direction. Later that year, as Kay said she fantasized, they [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|renew their wedding vows]] on a beach with Dr. Feld and their grown children present, making promises to be more understanding and considerate of each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Kay Soames\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Arnold Soames\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Dr. Bernard 'Bernie' Feld\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Karen\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Eileen\n* [[Brett Rice]] as Vince\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Carol\n* [[Ben Rappaport]] as Brad\n* [[Marin Ireland]] as Molly\n* [[Patch Darragh]] as Mark\n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Cora\n* Lee Cunningham as Lee, the unhappy wife\n\n==Production==\nThe project was first announced in 2010 with Streep and [[Jeff Bridges]] in talks for the leads<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/meryl-streep-and-jeff-bridges-think-great-hope-springs| title=Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges think Great Hope Springs | access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref> and [[Mike Nichols]] attached as director.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=28218 | title=Mike Nichols Eyes New Film | access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref> Bridges soon dropped out,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Jeff-Bridges-Won-t-Marry-Meryl-Streep-In-Great-Hope-Springs-After-All-19477.html | title=Jeff Bridges Won't Marry Meryl Streep In Great Hope Springs After All | access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref> and [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] were soon attached to the project.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://collider.com/streep-gandolfini-hoffman-nichols-great-hope-springs/50648/ | title=Meryl Streep, James Gandolfini, and Philip Seymour Hoffman May Star in Mike Nichols' GREAT HOPE SPRINGS | website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] | access-date=2012-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe project then replaced Nichols with [[David Frankel]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/meryl_streep_heads_to_great_hope_springs_david_frankel | title=Meryl Streep Heads To 'Great Hope Springs' With 'Devil Wears Prada' Director David Frankel | access-date=2012-02-07 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104230620/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/meryl_streep_heads_to_great_hope_springs_david_frankel | archive-date=2012-01-04 | url-status=dead }}</ref> without the involvement of Gandolfini and Hoffman.
