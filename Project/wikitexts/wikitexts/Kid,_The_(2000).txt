The film follows a 40-year-old image consultant ([[Bruce Willis]]) who is mysteriously confronted by an eight-year-old version of himself ([[Spencer Breslin]]); [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Chi McBride]], and [[Jean Smart]] also star.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on July 7, 2000. It received mixed reviews from critics, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calling its message \"annoyingly simplistic\", and grossed $110 million against its $65 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nDays from turning 40, Russ Duritz is a successful but abrasive [[image consultant]] in Los Angeles and has a strained relationship with his father. Returning home one day he finds a toy plane on his porch and a strange boy indoors, whom he chases through the streets.\n\nAfter seeing the boy enter a diner, Russ finds no sign of him inside. Thinking he is hallucinating, he visits a psychiatrist, but finds the same boy on his couch eating popcorn and watching TV when he returns home. The boy says his name is Rusty and that he was just searching for his toy plane.\n\nSeeing a resemblance, Russ compares memories and birthmarks and realizes Rusty is actually himself as a kid. After questioning Russ, Rusty tells him, \"I grow up to be a loser.\" Rusty dreams of owning a dog naming Chester and flying planes, but Russ gave up on those dreams.\n\nRuss's co-worker Amy thinks that Russ and Rusty are father and son and accuses him of being a dead-beat dad. Rusty assures her he is not his son and implores Russ to tell her the truth, but he thinks she'd never believe them. Amy realizes the truth while watching the two argue, as they are nearly identical.\n\nIn response to Rusty's questions about how he became Russ, he tells him about his scholarship to UCLA and working for six years to get a master's degree and change himself to who he is. Rusty understands Russ's job as an image consultant to be training people to pretend to be somebody else.\n\nRuss cancels his appointments and spends the day with Rusty, trying to figure out what from the past needs to be fixed to get him back home. Driving through a tunnel, Russ recalls a fight he lost with some bullies who were abusing a three-legged dog. They emerge from the tunnel into Rusty's eighth birthday in 1968.\n\nRuss helps Rusty win the fight and save the dog, but realizes that was only the first half of the ordeal. Rusty's terminally ill mother was called to take him home, where his father angrily berates him for getting into trouble and causing his mother further stress. Rusty breaks down and his father harshly tells him to grow up, making Russ realize why he is the way he is today.\n\nTearfully, Russ assures Rusty that he was not responsible for his mother's death, and that his father's outburst was not because he truly believed Rusty was responsible, but simply because he was scared about the prospect of raising his children alone.\n\nThey celebrate their birthday, but realize their efforts to change the outcome of the day have failed, as their father's outburst left Rusty emotionally scarred in both cases. When a dog named Chester greets Rusty, they find that his owner is an older version of them who owns planes and has a family with Amy.\n\nRealizing that Rusty's appearance was meant to change his own ways rather than Rusty's, Russ arranges to see his father and, with a puppy, visits Amy, who invites him into her home.\n\n==Production==\n''The Kid'' was part of a three-picture deal that Willis cut with the studio to compensate them for the dissolution of 1997's ''[[Broadway Brawler]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Russell Morley \"Russ\" Duritz\n* [[Spencer Breslin]] as young Rusty Duritz\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Amy\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Janet\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Kenny\n* [[Juanita Moore]] as Kenny's Grandmother\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Deidre Lefever\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Dr. Suzanne Alexander\n* [[Reiley McClendon]] as Mark\n* [[Steve Tom]] as Bruce, the Lawyer\n* [[Larry King]] as himself\n* [[Jeri Ryan]] as herself\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as himself\n* [[Matthew Perry]] (''uncredited'') as Mr. Vivian\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Sam Duritz (Russ's father)\n* [[Esther Scott]] as Clarissa\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Skyway Diner Waitress\n* Elizabeth Arlen as Gloria Duritz (Russ's deceased mother)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Disney's The Kid'' opened at #4 at the North American box office, making $12,687,726 [[USD]] in its opening weekend, behind ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'', and ''[[Scary Movie]]''.

Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calculated a 49% overall approval rating based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10.

It's a sweet film, unexpectedly involving, and shows again that Willis, so easily identified with action movies, is gifted in the areas of comedy and pathos: This is a cornball plot, and he lends it credibility just by being in it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/disneys-the-kid-2000|title=Disney's The Kid Movie Review (2000)|date=2000-07-07|first=Roger|last=Ebert|access-date=2014-05-23}}</ref> Film critic [[A.
