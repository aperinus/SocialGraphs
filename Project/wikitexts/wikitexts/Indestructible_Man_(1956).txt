Productions, and distributed in the United States by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation]]. The film was distributed theatrically in 1956 on a double bill with ''[[World Without End (film)|World Without End]]'' (and in some areas with ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''<ref>McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). \"You Won't Believe Your Eyes\". Bear Manor Media. {{ISBN|978-1-59393-273-2}}. Page 254</ref>).\n\n== Plot ==\nTold in a narrative style, popularized by the television police series ''[[Dragnet (1951 TV series)|Dragnet]]'', by police detective Dick Chasen, the story concerns a 72-hour period of horror for the city of Los Angeles. Charles \"Butcher\" Benton is a double-crossed convicted robber and murderer who was executed in the gas chamber. His body is unlawfully sold to a scientist who plans to move his experiments into the cause and cure of cancer to human subjects. Benton's corpse is subjected to chemical injection and massive jolts of high-voltage electricity in order to study the effect on human tissues. But Benton's heart is re-stimulated and he completely revives (though rendered mute due to electrical damage to his vocal cords), immensely strong and with skin virtually impervious to scalpels, police bullets, even to bazooka shells.\n\nAfter killing the doctor and his assistant, Benton sets out to avenge himself on his two henchmen and his attorney, Paul Lowe who, in collusion with the henchmen, had betrayed Benton in order to steal his loot. Benton had left the location of his stash to his stripper-girlfriend , who had since gone straight and begun dating the detective who brought Benton to justice, after she had rejected the lawyer's own advances.\n\nThe story then follows Benton's revenge on his enemies; the police who first learn of a wave of mysterious killings, then of Benton's reanimation; and the developing relationship between the detective and the stripper. The lawyer, Lowe, fearing for his life after the two henchmen are murdered, confesses the plot to the police, and reveals that Benton had always used the sewer system to evade detection; and to find a hiding place for the money, as it turns out.\n\nTracked down by the police, Benton takes a direct hit in the solar plexus from a bazooka, and is heavily burned by a flame thrower. Weakened, he flees to a power station, where he climbs atop a gantry, inadvertently setting it in motion.  As he watches the actions of the police down below, he fails to notice that the gantry is moving toward the main transformer.  A dangling hook comes too close to one of the terminals, and the other transformers erupt in sparks. as hundreds of thousands of volts surge throughout its metal frame, searing Benton to ashes. On a quiet night a few days later, Chasen successfully proposes to his girlfriend.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Cast===\n[[File:Indestructible Man (1956) still 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], [[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] and [[Robert Shayne]] in ''Indestructible Man'' (1956)]]\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\nStarring:\n* [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as Charles \"Butcher\" Benton\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Lt.

One shows \"Butcher\" Benton at a jail where a policeman's body lies on the ground as Benton carries off Eva Martin. The scene logically came after the police threatened to release Paul Lowe from custody if he does not reveal the location of Benton's loot, and before the scene where it is revealed Eva has checked herself out of a hospital, presumably after recovering from unspecified injuries. Presumably, this scene is where Benton made good on his threat to get Paul Lowe, breaking into the jail to do it.\n\nAlthough [[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] played a serious role in this film, he later specialized in comedic roles, most memorably as the irascible Captain Binghamton on TV's ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' (1962\u201366).\n\n==Bibliography==\nThe full story of the making of the movie (complete with interviews with some of the participants) plus the script and pressbook are featured in the book ''Scripts from the Crypt: 'Indestructible Man' '' (BearManor, 2015) by Tom Weaver.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* [[John Darnielle]] of [[the Mountain Goats]] wrote and performed \"Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece\", referencing a line spoken by Chaney's character to his double-crossing lawyer.\n* The 2003 [[Thom Andersen]] [[film essay]] ''[[Los Angeles Plays Itself]]'' featured clips from the film.<ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/review/65367 Los Angeles Plays Itself - DVD Talk]</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film has been released by numerous studios as a \"bargain bin\" disc.
