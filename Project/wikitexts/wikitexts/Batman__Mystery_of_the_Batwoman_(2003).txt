While she claims to fight for justice, Batwoman forsakes Batman's code to never take a life. Batman must figure out who she is, while stopping the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] and [[Rupert Thorne]] from selling illegal weapons to the fictional nation of [[Kasnia]]. The two villains employ Carlton Duquesne, a gangster, to provide protection.\n\nBatman, with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], sets out to stop Batwoman from making mistakes as she tries to take out the villains and as he encounters numerous twists, setbacks, and apparent false leads in determining her true identity. The newest gadget on display is a wind glider used by Batwoman that utilizes some of the most advanced technology ever seen in Gotham City. [[Bruce Wayne]], Batman's alter ego, also becomes romantically involved with Kathy Duquesne, the crime boss' daughter.\n\nIn addition to Kathy, Bruce is introduced to two other women who, as his investigation into the Batwoman's true identity continues, seem to fall well into suspicion: Dr. Roxanne \"Rocky\" Ballantine, a new employee of Wayne Tech, who seemingly but briefly forms a bond with Robin's alter-ego, [[Tim Drake]] and whose technology development is used by the Batwoman against the Penguin; and Detective [[Harvey Bullock (character)|Harvey Bullock]]'s new partner Sonia Alcana, who seems to know too much about the weapons being smuggled by the Penguin and Carlton Dunquesne. With Carlton unable to stop Batwoman's raids on the facilities used to hold the various weapons, the Penguin calls [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] for additional support to ensure that there are no more losses as a result of the Batwoman.\n\nNot long after Bane's arrival in Gotham, it is revealed that there is not one, but three Batwomen, all of whom were the women suspected by Batman; Kathy and Sonia met taking art classes at college and Sonia and Rocky were roommates. They all harbor grudges against the Penguin, Thorne, and Carleton Duquesne; the Penguin had framed Roxanne's fianc\u00e9 Kevin, Thorne had bankrupted Sonia's family, and Carlton Duquesne's war with a rival gang got his wife (and Kathy's mother) killed. They had taken turns posing as Batwoman to remove suspicion on any one of the three. Sonia invented the Batwoman persona as a tribute to Batman, who had saved her life nine years earlier and inspired her to become a police officer.\n\nKathy plants a bomb in the ship taking the weapons into international waters for the exchange - but not before Bane unmasks her. Kathy and Batman narrowly escape as the bomb goes off, while Carlton forsakes his ties to Thorne and the Penguin to save his daughter's life, and Bane falls into the Gotham River. Sonia takes the fall for the Batwoman operation, resigns from the GCPD, and decides to leave Gotham. Batman gives Sonia evidence that he discovered which helps clear Rocky's fianc\u00e9. Carlton agrees to testify against Thorne and the Penguin. After she reconciles with her father, Kathy drives off with Bruce.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Kathleen \"Kathy\" Duquesne\n* [[Kelly Ripa]] as Dr. Roxanne \"Rocky\" Ballantine\n* [[Elisa Gabrielli]] as Detective Sonia Alcana\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as [[Batwoman]]\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Carlton Duquesne\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]]\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as [[Harvey Bullock (character)|Detective Harvey Bullock]]\n* [[Tim Dang]] as Kevin (uncredited)\n* [[Bob Hastings]] as [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner James Gordon]]\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as [[Tim Drake|Tim Drake / Robin]]\n* [[Tara Strong]] as [[Barbara Gordon]]\n* [[John Vernon]] as [[Rupert Thorne]]\n* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n{{Div col end}}\n[[Cyndi Almouzni|Cherie]] performs the single \"Betcha Never\" in the Iceberg Lounge as herself. This is the only time in the [[DC animated universe]] that [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Henry Silva]] did not voice the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] and [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], respectively. This film marked the final performances of [[Bob Hastings]] and [[John Vernon]] as [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner James Gordon]] and [[Rupert Thorne]] before their deaths in 2014 and 2005 respectively as well as being the final film for Hastings. It additionally marked the final film appearance of [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] before his death in 2014 (He would reprise Alfred one more time in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' three-parter episode \"Starcrossed\" in 2004)\n\n==Production design==\nDespite that the majority of returning characters retain the same designs from ''The New Batman Adventures'' era, the character animation is considerably brighter and more lively than from the series. Rupert Thorne was featured in the original show ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', but not in ''The New Batman Adventures''. As such, the animators had to create a new appearance for him specifically for this film; he is streamlined and seems to have lost some weight compared to his previous appearance. the animation was outsourced to [[DR Movie]].<ref>[https://dcanimated.com/WF/batman/tnba/episodes/00motb/ The World's Finest - The New Batman Adventures].</ref>\n\nSeries writers [[Alan Burnett]] and Michael Reaves wrote the script, and [[Kevin Conroy]] reprises the voice of Batman. The film also shows further continuity with previous [[Bruce Timm]]-developed Batman shows: [[Barbara Gordon]]'s romantic relationship with Bruce Wayne (as mentioned in ''[[Batman Beyond]]'') is coming to an end, [[Dick Grayson]] has left Gotham to fight crime in [[Bl\u00fcdhaven]] as [[Nightwing]] (as mentioned in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' and later making a fleeting cameo in an episode of the later released ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled \"Grudge Match\" which is set in the city of Bl\u00fcdhaven), hence his absence in the film although it's not explicitly stated, and Robin and Batgirl are much older than their depictions in ''The New Batman Adventures'', but have not yet been forced to quit in the wake of the flashback events in ''Return of the Joker'' as this film is set before those events.\n\n==Chase Me==\n{{Main|Chase Me}}\nThe US DVD release of ''Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman'' (October 21, 2003) included the bonus short silent film '''''Chase Me'''''. ''Chase Me'' is a 2003 [[United States|American]] [[direct-to-video]] [[animation|animated]] [[short film]] also based on the animated series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. The silent film was produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], and follows [[Batman]] as he chases [[Catwoman]] across [[Gotham City]]. The chase sequences are accompanied by a soundtrack mix of a quiet piano score, and [[jazz]] style score that plays up the chase.\n\nThe film was written by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] and was directed by [[Curt Geda]]. It was co-produced by Geda, Burnett, Margaret M. Dean, [[Benjamin Melniker]], and Batman-producer [[Michael Uslan]]. The score is by [[Lolita Ritmanis]].\n\n''Chase Me'' is also included as part of the main feature on video streaming sites such as [[Amazon Video]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Batman - Mystery of the Batwoman|publisher=[[Amazon Video]]|url=https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Mystery-of-the-Batwoman/dp/B001AQKPLM/|access-date=2013-07-15}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack album, composed by Lolita Ritmanis, produced by John Takis and mastered by James Nelson was released on March 29, 2016 by La-La Land Records.
