The story is set during the period of [[denazification]] investigations conducted in [[Allied-occupied Germany|post-war Germany]] after the [[Second World War]], and it is based on the real interrogations that took place between a U.S. Army investigator and the musical conductor [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]], who had been charged with serving the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. It is based on the [[Taking Sides (play)|1995 play of the same title]] by [[Ronald Harwood]].\n\nThe film was shot on location in Germany with the dialogue in German and English, although in the version released in the US and the UK the dialogue is only in English.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Berlin]] at the end of World War II, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler ([[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]]) is conducting [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]] when yet another Allied air raid stops the performance. A minister in the Nazi government comes to Furtw\u00e4ngler's dressing room to advise him that he should go abroad, and escape the war. The film then jumps to some time after the Allied victory. [[U.S. Army]] General Wallace ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) tasks Major Steve Arnold ([[Harvey Keitel]]) with \"getting\" Furtw\u00e4ngler at his [[denazification]] hearing: \"Find Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany\".<ref>From film audio, 6 minutes into the film.</ref>\n\nArnold gets an office with Lt. David Wills ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]), a [[German Americans|German-American]] [[American Jews|Jew]], and Emmaline Straube ([[Birgit Minichmayr]]), daughter of an executed member of the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]]. Arnold questions several musicians, many of whom know Emmaline's father and say that Furtw\u00e4ngler refused to give Hitler the Nazi salute.\n\nArnold begins interrogating Furtw\u00e4ngler, asking why he didn't leave Germany in 1933 like so many other musicians. Why he had played for Hitler's birthday? Why he had played at a Nazi rally? And why his recording of [[Anton Bruckner]]'s 7th Symphony was used on the radio after Hitler's death? Arnold gets a second violinist to tell him about Furtw\u00e4ngler's womanizing and the conductor's professional jealousy of [[Herbert von Karajan]].\n\nIn a subplot, Arnold is assisted by a young Jewish U.S. Army lieutenant. The young officer begins to have sympathy for the conductor, as does the young German woman who works as a clerk in their office. This causes friction between Arnold and his subordinates.\n\nIn a voice-over, Arnold explains that Furtw\u00e4ngler was exonerated at the later hearings but boasts that his questioning \"winged\" him. Actual footage of the real Furtw\u00e4ngler shows him shaking hands with Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] after a concert. The conductor surreptitiously wipes his hands with a cloth after touching the Nazi.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] as Major Steve Arnold\nIn the same year (2001) Keitel played an opposite role as SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer [[Erich Muhsfeldt]] in the film [[The Grey Zone]].\n\n*[[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]]\n*[[Moritz Bleibtreu]] \tas Lieutenant David Wills\n*[[Birgit Minichmayr]] as Emmi Straube\n*[[Ulrich Tukur]] as Helmut Alfred Rode, 2nd violinist\n*[[Oleg Tabakov]] as Colonel Dymshitz\n*[[Hanns Zischler]] as Rudolf Otto Werner, oboist\n*[[Armin Rohde]] as Schlee, timpanist\n*[[R.

He played at numerous concerts attended by Nazi officials. A recording of the Adagio of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]] was even played after the announcement of the [[death of Hitler]].<ref>Wagnarian Concert of Death. 90 minutes of radio suspense. In: [[Daily Mail]], 4 A.M. edition, 2 may 1945.</ref> In 1945, he eventually went to [[Switzerland]]  after playing a concert in Vienna. These facts, compounded by circumstances of the denazification hearings, caused Furtw\u00e4ngler's case to be significantly delayed.<ref>p. 154, Monod (2005) David.

Steve Arnolds (Harvey Keitel) as a \"caricature, a bully, a [[Philistinism|Philistine]]\", screenplay writer [[Ronald Harwood]] told [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]] that he went on to comb archives for denazification transcripts and to interview officials who had supervised such proceedings.\"They were morally brutal,\" Hardwood stated. \"They bullied people, and they did behave in an extreme way. But they had just seen the [[Extermination camp|camps]], and no one in the world had seen that before.\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2003-09-18 |title=Hitler's Conductor: Man or Monster? |url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/8392/ |access-date=2022-05-22 |website=Jewish Journal |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Roger Ebert]] found the film \"both interesting and unsatisfying. The Keitel performance is over the top, inviting us to side with Furtw\u00e4ngler simply because his interrogator is so vile. There are maddening lapses, as when Furtw\u00e4ngler's rescue of Jewish musicians is mentioned but never really made clear. But Skarsg\u00e5rd's performance is poignant; it has a kind of exhausted passivity, suggesting a man who once stood astride the world and now counts himself lucky to be insulted by the likes of Major Arnold.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031017/REVIEWS/310170307/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Taking Sides}}</ref>\n\nMick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' finds that the film's promise to provide a balanced argument \"goes unrealized, and all we're left with is the spectacle of an idiot bullying a genius. Harvey Keitel's performance as the smug, self-satisfied major is terribly miscalculated, unless he intended for us to loathe the spectacle of a small, stupid man glorying in his sudden power. That's possible. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Furtw\u00e4ngler with an air of exhaustion that seems a generous attempt to justify the script's weakness, that the conductor doesn't defend himself vigorously enough. Of the two men, it's the major who acts more like a Nazi.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/26/DD24851.DTL#taking#ixzz0lggwRZGz | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=FILM CLIPS / Also opening today | first1=Steven | last1=Winn | first2=Edward | last2=Guthmann | first3=Mick | last3=LaSalle | first4=G.
