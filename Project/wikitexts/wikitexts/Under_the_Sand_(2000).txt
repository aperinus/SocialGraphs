The film was nominated for three [[27th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]] and was critically well received. It stars [[Charlotte Rampling]] and [[Bruno Cremer]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Charlotte Rampling]] as Marie Drillon \n*[[Bruno Cremer]] as Jean Drillon \n*[[Jacques Nolot]] as Vincent \n*[[Alexandra Stewart]] as Amanda \n*[[Pierre Vernier (actor)|Pierre Vernier]] as G\u00e9rard \n*[[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Suzanne\n\n==Plot==\nMarie is an English professor at a Parisian university. She has been happily married to Jean for 25 years. They vacation in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]], where his family has a house. At the beach, he goes for a swim while she sunbathes and later falls asleep. He never returns. There are no witnesses to any accident, and his body cannot be found; he may have committed suicide, he may have drowned in an accident. Marie does not accept his death, and she keeps seeing him (perhaps an apparition) after her return to Paris. \n\nMarie begins an affair, even while she denies her husband's death, though she receives a call from the Landes police, saying a body had been found in a fisherman's net. Her friends are worried about her mental health, and when her lover offers her his help, she says he can't measure up to Jean, and rejects him. When visiting Jean's mother, who lives in a nursing home, she tells her that Jean may have killed himself; her mother in law rejects that, and says he probably left her because he was bored with her, and because, she says, she could not give him children. Finally, she goes to Landes to meet with the local officials. She is told he probably drowned while struggling with the undertow. The body, however, has spent so much time under water that it is putrefied and cannot be easily identified; a genetic test shows 90% correspondence with his mother, and the dental records seem to match as well. The lack of any past occurrence of fractures stop them from matching through skeletal analysis. She insists on seeing the body and reacts with horror. They found a watch as well: she denies that it his. When she goes back to the beach where he disappeared, she sees him in the distance and runs toward him or what she believes is him.\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Coucher Soleil Mimizan.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The dramatic scenery at [[Mimizan]]]]\nThe film was shot in [[Paris]] and in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] department including [[Lit-et-Mixe]], [[Mimizan|Mimizan-Plage]] beach and at [[Saint-Julien-en-Born]].\n\n==Awards==\n''Sous le sable'' was nominated for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] at the [[C\u00e9sar Awards 2002]].
