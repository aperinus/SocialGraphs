Jackson]], with [[Walton Goggins]], [[Dennis Christopher]], [[James Remar]], [[Michael Parks]], and [[Don Johnson]] in supporting roles. Set in the [[American frontier|Old West]] and [[Antebellum South]], it is a highly stylized, heavily revisionist tribute to [[Spaghetti Western]]s, in particular the 1966 Italian film ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' by [[Sergio Corbucci]] (the star of which, [[Franco Nero]], has a [[cameo appearance]]). The story follows a black slave who trains under a German bounty hunter, with the ultimate goal of reuniting with his long-lost wife.\n\nDevelopment of ''Django Unchained'' began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to [[The Weinstein Company]]. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with [[Michael K. Williams]] and [[Will Smith]] being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming, and Louisiana.\n\nThe premiere of ''Django Unchained'' took place at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on December 11, 2012, and was theatrically released on December 25, 2012, in the United States, grossing over $425 million worldwide against its $100 million budget, becoming Tarantino's highest-grossing movie to date. The film received acclaim from critics, mainly for Waltz's performance and Tarantino's direction and screenplay, though the film's usage of the word \"[[nigger]]\" and its depiction of violence drew controversy. The film received numerous [[List of accolades received by Django Unchained|awards and nominations]], winning two out of five nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]]. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globes]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTAs]]. For his screenplay, Tarantino won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|BAFTA]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1858 [[Texas]], brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] on foot. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}<!--Not \"Brunhilde.\" Broomhilda is the correct spelling of this character's name.--> von Shaft, a [[house slave]] who speaks [[German language|German]] and English. They are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German [[dentist]]-turned-[[bounty hunter]] seeking to buy Django for his knowledge of the three outlaw Brittle brothers, overseers at the [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] of Django's previous owner and for whom Schultz has a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]]. When Ace refuses to sell Django to Schultz and levels his gun at him, Schultz kills him and shoots Dicky's horse in order to pin him to the ground. Schultz insists on paying a fair price for Django before leaving the other slaves to kill Dicky. Schultz offers Django his freedom and $75 in exchange for help tracking down the Brittles.\n\nDjango and Schultz kill the Brittle brothers at Spencer \"Big Daddy\" Bennett's [[Tennessee]] plantation. Bennett lets Django and Schultz leave due to the warrant, but later tries to attack them with a posse. Schultz ambushes the posse with explosives and Django kills Bennett. Feeling responsible for Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}. They return to Texas where Django collects his first bounty, keeping the [[wanted poster|handbill]]<!--referred to as such multiple times in the movie.--> as a memento. He and Schultz rack up several bounties before spring, when they travel to [[Mississippi]] and learn that {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s new owner is Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to wrestle to the death in brutal \"[[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]\" fights. Schultz and Django hatch a plan: deciding that Candie will price Broomhilda beyond their reach if they try to buy her upfront, they will instead offer {{US$|12000|long=no|1858|round=-3}} for one of his best fighters as a pretext to acquiring Broomhilda for a nominal sum. They meet Candie at his gentlemen's club and make the offer. Intrigued, Candie invites them to Candyland. En route, the group encounters Candie's [[Slave catcher|slave trackers]] who have cornered D'Artagnan, an escapee Mandingo fighter. Schultz attempts to save him, but Django intervenes to prevent him from blowing their cover. Candie has the trackers' dogs maul D'Artagnan to death, visibly upsetting Schultz.\n\nHaving told {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her as his escort while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Candie's staunchly loyal and suspicious head [[House negro|house slave]] Stephen realizes that {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} knows Django, deduces their plan and alerts Candie. Candie alters the deal at gunpoint to sell Broomhilda for $12,000 instead of the fighter; Schultz reluctantly agrees. During the sale's finalization, Candie threatens to kill Broomhilda if Schultz does not [[Handshake|shake his hand]] to seal the deal. Having had enough of Candie's arrogance, Schultz shoots and kills Candie. Butch Pooch, Candie's bodyguard, kills Schultz, and Django goes on a rampage, killing Pooch, Candie's lawyer Leonide Moguy, and several of Candie's henchmen, but is forced to surrender when {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} is taken [[hostage]].\n\nThe next morning, the chained Django is tortured and about to be [[Castration|castrated]] by Candie's henchman Billy Crash when Stephen arrives, informing him that Candie's sister Lara, who has taken charge of the plantation, has ordered him to be sold to a mining company and worked to death. En route there, Django devises an escape plan and uses his first handbill to prove to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter. He falsely claims the men on the handbill are at Candyland and promises the escorts a share of the reward money. Once released, Django kills his escorts and returns to Candyland with [[dynamite]]. Recovering {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, Django bids him goodbye and avenges him and D'Artagnan by killing the trackers, and frees {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} just as Candie's mourners return from his burial. At the mansion, Django kills Lara, Crash and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and [[Kneecapping|kneecaps]] Stephen, who had revealed to be faking his limp, before igniting the dynamite he had planted throughout the mansion. Django and {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} watch from a distance as the mansion explodes before riding off together.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Django Unchained cast.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Samuel L.

He called this type of film \"a Southern\", stating that he wanted: {{blockquote|to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like Spaghetti Westerns, not like big issue movies.

For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television series ''[[Bonanza]]'' and referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by the ''Bonanza'' character Little Joe, played by [[Michael Landon]]. Davis described Django's look as a \"rock-n-roll take on the character\". Django's sunglasses were inspired by [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[The White Buffalo]]'' (1977). Davis used [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s 1770 oil painting ''[[The Blue Boy]]'' as a reference for Django's valet outfit.<ref name=\"Costume\">{{cite web |last=Hanel |first=Marnie |date=January 4, 2013 |title=From Sketch to Still: The Spaghetti-Western Wit of Sharen Davis's Django Unchained Costumes |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/01/django-unchained-costume-design-oscar-nomination |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=January 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303110206/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/01/django-unchained-costume-design-oscar-nomination |archive-date=March 3, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the final scene, {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} wears a dress similar to that of [[Ida Galli]]'s character in ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'' (1965). Davis said the idea of Calvin Candie's costume came partly from [[Rhett Butler]], and that Don Johnson's signature ''[[Miami Vice]]'' look inspired Big Daddy's cream-colored linen suit in the film. King Schultz's faux chinchilla coat was inspired by [[Telly Savalas]] in ''[[Kojak]]''. Davis also revealed that many of her costume ideas did not make the final cut of the film, leaving some unexplained characters such as Zo\u00eb Bell's tracker, who was intended to drop her bandana to reveal an absent jaw.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Django Unchained'' started in California in November 2011<ref>{{cite news |author=Sandle, Tim |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/318611 |title=Django Unchained: new Tarantino movie begins shooting |publisher=DigitalJournal.com |date=January 27, 2012 |access-date=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130022534/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/318611 |archive-date=January 30, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> continuing in Wyoming in February 2012<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/15/tarantino-wraps-up-wyoming-filming-for-new-movie/ |title=Tarantino wraps up Wyoming filming for new movie |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=February 15, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |access-date=February 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113020/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/15/tarantino-wraps-up-wyoming-filming-for-new-movie/ |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> and at the National Historic Landmark [[Evergreen Plantation (Wallace, Louisiana)|Evergreen Plantation]] in [[Wallace, Louisiana]], outside of [[New Orleans]], in March 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/02/25/quentin-tarantinos-django-unchained-begins-filming-at-the-evergreen-plantation-in-louisiana-on-monday |title=Quentin Tarantino's 'Django Unchained' begins filming at the Evergreen Plantation in Louisiana on Monday |author=Christine |date=February 25, 2012 |publisher=OnLocationsVacations.com |access-date=March 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318174615/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/02/25/quentin-tarantinos-django-unchained-begins-filming-at-the-evergreen-plantation-in-louisiana-on-monday/ |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was shot in the [[anamorphic format]] on [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/2012/02/24/oscar-chat-a-conversation-with-best-cinematography-nominees-jeff-cronenweth-and-robert-richardson |title=Oscar Chat: A Conversation With Best Cinematography Nominees Jeff Cronenweth and Robert Richardson |author=Nicoletti, Karen |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=Movieline.com |access-date=April 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417034146/http://movieline.com/2012/02/24/oscar-chat-a-conversation-with-best-cinematography-nominees-jeff-cronenweth-and-robert-richardson/ |archive-date=April 17, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although originally scripted, a sub-plot centering on Zo\u00eb Bell's masked tracker was cut, and remained unfilmed, due to time constraints.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fox |first=Jesse David |title=Zoe Bell Explains What Was Up With Her Masked Character From Django Unchained |url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/01/django-unchaineds-masked-character-explained.html |publisher=Vulture |access-date=January 28, 2012 |date=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131100849/http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/django-unchaineds-masked-character-explained.html|archive-date=January 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After 130 shooting days, the film wrapped up principal photography in July 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Anne |title=Tarantino Officially Wraps 'Django Unchained,' Hits the Editing Room |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/tarantino-officially-wraps-django-unchained-hits-the-editing-room |publisher=IndieWire |access-date=December 1, 2012 |date=July 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728233756/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/tarantino-officially-wraps-django-unchained-hits-the-editing-room|archive-date=July 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Django Unchained'' was the first Tarantino film not edited by [[Sally Menke]], who died in 2010.

The fact that ''Django Unchained'' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving [[sophism|sophistry]] like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] has done \u2013 and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or [[Wayne LaPierre|LaPierre]], can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else.
