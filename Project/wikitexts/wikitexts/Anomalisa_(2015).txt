It was based on Kaufman's 2005 [[audio play]] of the same name under his alias Francis Fregoli, which is considered an exploration of the [[Fregoli delusion]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anomalisa |url=https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/news-and-features/blogs/detail/cultural-blog/2016/11/14/anomalisa |access-date=2020-08-08 |website=www.rcpsych.ac.uk |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"USBACK\" /> ''Anomalisa'' follows British middle-aged [[customer service]] expert Michael Stone ([[David Thewlis]]), who perceives everyone ([[Tom Noonan]]) as identical but Lisa Hesselman ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), whom he meets in a [[Cincinnati]] hotel.\n\nKaufman's audio play premiered in Los Angeles, and featured the voices of Thewlis, Noonan, and Leigh. He opposed adapting the play into a film, fearing loss of artistic merit, but began exploring the idea in 2012 after incorporating edits to the script. Filming faced delays as [[Starburns Industries]] initially secured production funding on [[Kickstarter]] only to adapt the play as a [[short film]], with animation beginning in late 2013. The filmmakers faced struggles with stop-motion technology, a notoriously laborious medium. This was alleviated after [[Paramount Animation]] joined production, enabling the film to be expanded to a feature.\n\n''Anomalisa'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 4, 2015, and was theatrically released in the U.S. on December 30 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for its screenplay, direction, and thematic content. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], the first R-rated animated film to be nominated in this category,<ref>{{Cite web|last=King|first=Melissa|title=Movie addict: Discover the extraordinary in 'Anomalisa'|url=https://www.sctimes.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/04/06/movie-addict-discover-extraordinary-anomalisa/82518694/|access-date=2021-06-17|website=St. Cloud Times|language=en-US}}</ref> and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]].

He feels distant from everyone around him, whom he perceives as having an identical face and voice, including his wife and son. Michael practices his talk in his room in the fictional Fregoli Hotel, but is haunted by the memory of an angry letter from an old flame, Bella, whom he abruptly left years ago without an explanation. He arranges to meet her in the hotel bar; still upset, she is outraged by his invitation to his room and storms out. Going for a walk, Michael mistakes an [[Sex toy|adult toy]] store for a children's toy store. Wanting to buy his son a present, he goes in and discovers his mistake, but is fascinated by a [[Japan]]ese [[Animatronics|animatronic]] doll behind the counter.\n\nAfter taking a shower, Michael hears a unique female voice. He rushes from his room to find its owner: Lisa, an insecure young woman attending the convention with her friend Emily. Enraptured by her unique appearance and voice, he invites both women for drinks at the bar. Afterward, to Lisa's surprise, Michael invites her to his room. Captivated, he encourages her to sing (she chooses [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\") and tell him about her life. After she calls herself an \"anomaly\", he nicknames her Anomalisa. They become intimate and have sex.\n\nMichael has a nightmare in which the lower half of his face falls off and the identical people of the world pursue him, claiming that they love him and insisting that he and Lisa cannot be together. The dream inspires Michael to propose that he and Lisa start a new life together. She agrees, but her eating habits during breakfast annoy him, and her voice and face begin to transform into those of everyone else. During his convention talk, Michael suffers a breakdown, saying that he has no one to talk to and ranting about the American government, alienating the audience.\n\nMichael returns to his home in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He gives the Japanese animatronic woman to his son, who is nonplussed. Michael's wife has arranged a surprise party, but he does not recognize any of the attendees, angering her. Michael sits alone on the stairs as the animatronic woman sings \"[[Momotar\u014d#Momotar\u014d's Song|Momotar\u014d's Song]]\", a Japanese children's song.\n\nLisa writes Michael a letter, saying she hopes they will meet again. Lisa's friend Emily, sitting beside her in the car, has her own unique face.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Michael Stone, a middle-aged British English-born motivational speaker and customer service expert with a mostly negative attitude. To him, every person looks and sounds the same except Lisa, whom he perceives as different.\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Lisa Hesselman, a sweet but insecure woman who has come to the hotel to attend Michael's talk about customer service.\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as everyone else.\n\n== Production ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = <!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n | total_width       = 300\n | image1            = Charlie Kaufman Fantastic Fest 2015-0257 (27441349145) (cropped).jpg\n | width1            = 719\n | height1           = 865\n | image2            = Duke Johnson director.jpg\n | width2            = 660\n | height2           = 906\n | footer            = Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson at the 2015 [[Fantastic Fest]]\n}}\nThe first version of ''Anomalisa'' was written and performed in 2005 for the Los Angeles run of \"Theater of the New Ear\", described as \"a concert for music and text, or a set of 'sound plays'\" by [[Carter Burwell]], who commissioned and scored them.<ref name=\"carterburwellTONE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/TONE.shtml|title=Theater of the New Ear|work=Carter Burwell official website|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> It was a double bill with Kaufman's ''Hope Leaves the Theater'', and replaced ''Sawbones'', by the [[Coen Brothers]], from the earlier New York run, after that play's actors were unavailable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/16/entertainment/et-ear16|title=Lend an ear to Charlie Kaufman|last=Swed|first=Mark|date=September 16, 2005|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> This ''Anomalisa'' was credited to the [[pen name]] Francis Fregoli, a reference to the [[Fregoli delusion]], a disorder centered around the belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise.<ref name=USBACK>{{cite web|last1=Lawless|first1=Jill|title=Charlie Kaufman wows Venice critics with inventive adult animation 'Anomalisa'|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/entertainment/articles/2015/09/09/charlie-kaufman-is-back-with-adult-animation-anomalisa|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=September 9, 2015|access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref> The 2005 performance had Thewlis and Leigh sitting on opposite sides of the stage, with Noonan in the middle; Burwell conducted the Parabola Ensemble, and there was a [[foley artist]].<ref name=\"carterburwellTONE\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/legit/markets-festivals/theater-of-the-new-ear-1200523153/|title=Review: Theater of the New Ear|last=Gallo|first=Phil|date=September 15, 2005|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKaufman was initially opposed to turning the play into an animated film, saying that the play had \"a disconnect between what's being said on stage and what the audience is seeing \u2013 there's Tom playing all these characters, there's Jennifer and David having sex while they're really just standing across the stage from each other and moaning.
