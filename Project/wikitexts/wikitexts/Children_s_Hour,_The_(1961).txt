The screenplay by [[John Michael Hayes]] is based on the 1934 [[The Children's Hour (play)|play of the same title]] by [[Lillian Hellman]]. The film stars [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[James Garner]] and [[Fay Bainter]] (in her final film role).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1960s, former college classmates Martha Dobie and Karen Wright open a private boarding school for girls. After an engagement of two years to the doctor Joe Cardin, Karen finally agrees to set a wedding date. Joe is related to the influential Amelia Tilford, whose granddaughter Mary is a student at the school. Mary is a spoiled, conniving child who [[bullying|bullies]] her classmates.\n\nWhilst being punished for a lie Mary had told, one of her roommates overhears an argument between Martha and her Aunt Lily. Lily accuses Martha of being jealous and having an [[Lesbian sexual practices|unnatural relationship]] with Karen. On hearing this Mary spreads this gossip to her grandmother and Amelia spreads it around the parents of the school.\n\nKaren learns of this and confronts Amelia about Mary accusing Martha and Karen of being [[lesbianism|lovers]]. Mary is foiled at convincing others that she personally saw the interactions between Martha and Karen. Using her knowledge that her roommate, Rosalie, has stolen jewelry and other personal items from a number of people, Mary forces Rosalie to corroborate her story.\n\nThe two women file a suit of [[libel]] and [[slander]] against Mrs. Tilford. A few months later, Martha and Karen are isolated at the school, having lost all of their students and ruined their reputations after losing the lawsuit. Karen calls off her engagement with Joe when he asks her if what was said about Martha and her was true. When she finds out, Martha points out that other female couples have persevered after being found out, because of the strength of their love, then admits that she has been in love with Karen for years. Karen says that Martha is just confused about her feelings, but Martha insists it is love, breaking down in tears.\n\nRosalie\u2018s mother finds the collection of stolen items her daughter has kept, leading to the revelation of Mary\u2019s lie about Martha and Karen. Mrs. Tilford tells the judge, who will overturn the outcome of the lawsuit, publish the results in the newspaper, and a full financial settlement will be paid to the teachers. Karen tells Martha that they are still friends, and can open a new school.\n\nAunt Lily asks Karen about the whereabouts of Martha as her door is locked. Karen breaks loose the door's slide lock with a candleholder and discovers Martha has [[hanged]] herself in her room.\n\nThe film ends with Karen attending Martha's funeral and walking away while Joe watches her.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast and order per opening credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Karen Wright\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Martha Dobie\n* [[James Garner]] as Dr. Joseph \"Joe\" Cardin\n* [[Miriam Hopkins]] as Lily Mortar\n* [[Fay Bainter]] as Mrs. Amelia Tilford\n* Karen Balkin as Mary Tilford\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Rosalie Wells\n* [[Mimi Gibson]] as Evelyn\n* Debbie Moldow as Catherine\n* [[William Mims]] as Mr. Burton \n* [[Sally Brophy]] as Mrs. Wells (credited as Sallie Brophy)\n* [[Hope Summers]] as Agatha\n}}\n\n==Production==\nHellman's play was inspired by the 1810 true story of two [[Scottish people|Scottish]] school teachers, Miss [[Marianne Woods]] and Miss [[Jane Pirie]], whose lives were destroyed when one of their students accused them of engaging in a sexual relationship, but in the Scottish case, they eventually won their suit, although that did not change the devastation wrought on their lives.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/great-edinburgh-scandals/Drumsheugh-Lesbian-sex-row-rocked.5013092.jp |title=Lesbian sex row rocked society |newspaper=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=25 February 2009 |access-date=13 March 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908155653/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/great-edinburgh-scandals/Drumsheugh-Lesbian-sex-row-rocked.5013092.jp|archive-date=September 8, 2009}}</ref> At the time of the play's premiere (1934) the mention of [[homosexuality]] on stage was illegal in [[New York State]], but authorities chose to overlook its subject matter when the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was acclaimed by the critics.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=18608&rss=mrqe |title=These Three|publisher= Turner Classic Movies|access-date=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first film adaptation of the play was ''[[These Three]]'' directed by Wyler and released in 1936.  Because the [[Hays Code]], in effect at the time of the original film's production (1936), would never permit a film to focus on or even hint at lesbianism, [[Samuel Goldwyn]] was the only producer interested in purchasing the rights. He signed Hellman to adapt her play for the screen, and the playwright changed the lie about the two school teachers being lovers into a rumor that one of them had slept with the other's fianc\u00e9. Because the Production Code refused to allow Goldwyn to use the play's original title, it was changed to ''The Lie'', and then ''These Three''.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nBy the time Wyler was ready to film the remake in 1961, the Hays Code had been liberalized to allow screenwriter John Michael Hayes to restore the original nature of the lie. Aside from having Martha hang rather than shoot herself as she had in the play, he remained faithful to Hellman's work, retaining substantial portions of her dialogue.\n\nIn the 1995 [[documentary film]] ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] said she and [[Audrey Hepburn]] never talked about their characters' alleged [[homosexuality]]. She also claimed Wyler cut some scenes hinting at Martha's love for Karen because of concerns about critical reaction to the film.\n\nThe film was [[James Garner]]'s first after suing [[Warner Bros.]] to win his release from the television series ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''. Wyler broke an unofficial [[blacklist]] of the actor by casting him, and Garner steadily appeared in films and television shows over the following decades, including immediately playing leading roles in four different major movies released in 1963: ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' with [[Steve McQueen]], ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'' with [[Doris Day]], ''[[The Wheeler Dealers]]'' with [[Lee Remick]], and ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'' again with box office queen Doris Day.\n\n[[Miriam Hopkins]], who portrays Lily Mortar in the remake, appeared as Martha in ''These Three''.\n\nThe film's [[location shooting]] was done at the historic [[Shadow Ranch]], in present-day [[West Hills, Los Angeles|West Hills]] of the western [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laparks.org/dos/historic/shadow.htm|title=Shadow Ranch Park|publisher= Laparks.org|access-date=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed:\n\n{{blockquote|In short, there are several glaring holes in the fabric of the plot, and obviously Miss Hellman, who did the adaptation, and John Michael Hayes, who wrote the script, knew they were there, for they have plainly sidestepped the biggest of them. They have not let us know what the youngster whispered to the grandmother that made her hoot with startled indignation and go rushing to the telephone ... And they have not let us into the courtroom where the critical suit for slander was tried. They have only reported the trial and the verdict in one quickly tossed off line. So this drama that was supposed to be so novel and daring because of its muted theme is really quite unrealistic and scandalous in a prim and priggish way. What's more, it is not too well acted, except by Audrey Hepburn in the role of the younger of the school teachers ... Shirley MacLaine as the older school teacher ... inclines to be too kittenish in some scenes and do too much vocal hand-wringing toward the end ... James Garner as the fianc\u00e9 of Miss Hepburn and Miriam Hopkins as the aunt of Miss MacLaine give performances of such artificial laboring that Mr. Wyler should hang his head in shame. Indeed, there is nothing about this picture of which he can be very proud.<ref>{{cite news|author=Crowther, Bosley|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07EEDA1338E63ABC4D52DFB5668389679EDE |title=The Children's Hour (1961)|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 March 1962|access-date=13 March 2014}}</ref>}}\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine ... beautifully complement each other.
