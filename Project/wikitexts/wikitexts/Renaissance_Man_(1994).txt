A down on his luck advertising executive takes the only job he can get, teaching literature to army recruits. In Australia, the film is known under the title of '''''Army Intelligence'''''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harris |first=Paul |date=February 5, 1995 |title=Paul Harris on video |pages=89 |work=The Age (Melbourne) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/legacy/122888920/?terms=%22renaissance%20man%22%20%22army%20intelligence%22&match=1 |access-date=September 12, 2022}}</ref> The film received generally negative reviews. It grossed $24 million at the box office against a budget of $40 million.\n\n==Plot==\nBill Rago is a divorced advertising executive down on his luck. When he loses his job in [[Detroit]], the unemployment agency finds him a temporary job: teaching basic literacy classes at a nearby [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] training base, Fort McClane.\n\nInitially unenthusiastic, Rago finds that he has only six weeks to teach a group of undereducated soldiers the basics of comprehension and use of English language. Most of the soldiers are only semi-literate and equally unenthusiastic.\n\nUnable to connect with his pupils and desperate to spark their interest, Rago quotes from his favorite play, ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. They are unfamiliar with it (or even the concept of a \"play\") and a small initial spark of interest is generated. He casts each student as a character in a classroom reading, then takes everyone on a field trip across the [[Blue Water Bridge]] to [[Stratford, Ontario]] Canada, to a live performance by [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] actors. He introduces them to Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' as well.\n\nIn the meantime he takes steps to mend bridges with his daughter by buying her an airline ticket to [[Mexico]] \u2013 as well as buying her a [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]] [[Catadioptric system#Catadioptric telescopes|telescope]] \u2013 so that she can start on the path to becoming a professional [[astronomer]].\n\nDespite the disapproval of their hard-as-nails Drill Sergeant Cass, and the loss of one of the trainees, Pvt. Hobbs, who is revealed as a drug dealer hiding under an assumed identity, Rago sets an end-of-term oral examination. Even the friendly Capt. Murdoch, who is in charge of the project doesn't expect the soldiers to pass Rago's class, adding that if they fail they will be discharged from the Army.\n\nHobbs writes a letter to Rago and Murdoch, whose letters to the prison warden may result in him getting an early parole. Hobbs says he read ''[[Othello]]'' in the prison library (the librarian said he was the first inmate in 16 years to request Shakespeare) and was thinking about taking college classes once he's released.\n\nWhile on duty, on a dare from Cass in front of other men, Pvt. Benitez recites the [[St. Crispin's Day Speech]] by King Henry V while in full combat gear in the middle of a rainstorm during a night exercise; the speech moves even the hardened Sgt. Cass. The students then all pass Rago's class with flying colors.\n\nRago meets and dates Marie, a soldier in the records department who helps him do some investigation before the base's graduation ceremony. It results in Pvt. Davis being presented with the [[Silver Star]] medal his father was to have been awarded posthumously, after he was killed in [[Vietnam]].\n\nAs the proud soldiers march at their graduation parade, Rago is saluted by his \"graduates\". He signs on to continue teaching soldiers-in-training.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Bill Rago\n* [[Gregory Hines]] as [[Sergeant first class|Sergeant First Class]] Cass\n* [[James Remar]] as [[Captain]] Tom Murdoch\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as [[Colonel]] James \n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Jack Markin\n* [[Lillo Brancato, Jr.]] as [[Private (rank)|Private]] Donnie Benitez\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Private Miranda Myers\n* [[Kadeem Hardison]] as Private Jamaal Montgomery\n* [[Richard T.

Marshall requested rewrites to make the script funnier, not merely by adding more jokes but by \"deepening the characters and finding all the humor and heart in them.\"\nBurnstein was on call during filming to answer questions about the script, particularly when it came to lines relating to Hamlet. He visited the set, spending time at each location. Marshall allowed him to watch some of the [[dailies]] but as it was his first film he did not offer his opinions, and he also knew that editors would be \"the last writer\" and make their own changes to the film. Burnstein and his family appeared as extras at the baseball game.<ref>{{cite web |date=7 June 2013 |author1=Dane Jackson |title=Interview with Jim Burnstein, writer of Renaissance Man |url=https://cinemanerdz.com/interview-with-jim-burnstein-writer-of-renaissance-man/ |website=CinemaNerdz.com }}</ref> \nDeVito was cast in April 1993.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 April 1993 |last1=Archerd |first1=Army |title=Vanna offers indecent fortune to Bundys |url=https://variety.com/1993/voices/columns/vanna-offers-indecent-fortune-to-bundys-1117862176/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |quote=Penny Marshall's asking Danny DeVito to be her 'Renaissance Man' at Disney }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=20 October 1993 |last1=Archerd |first1=Army |title=Tartikoff enjoying busy sked |url=https://variety.com/1993/voices/columns/tartikoff-enjoying-busy-sked-1117862367/ |website=Variety |quote=Cliff Robertson is in Jackson, S.C., joining Penny Marshall's 'Renaissance Man' as an Army colonel who comes up with the scheme to bring in a civilian, Danny DeVito, to instruct }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Filming}}\nFilming began on July 2, 1993, and ended on November 26, 1993.{{Citation needed|date=April 2022}} The scenes at the fictional \"Fort McClane\" were actually filmed at [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], [[South Carolina]].<ref name=\"latimes-drill\">{{cite web |date=May 15, 1994 |author=Robert W.
