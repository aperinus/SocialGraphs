It was [[Estelle Getty]]'s final film role before her retirement in 2001 and her death in July 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=October 2022}}\nEleanor and Frederick Little are intending to adopt a younger brother for their older son, George. They visit the orphanage where they are soon overwhelmed by the choice of children. They meet a young anthropomorphic mouse named Stuart, who advises them on who to choose. They fall in love with him and decide to adopt him. When George meets Stuart, he is shocked and disappointed to find his new little brother is in fact a mouse. He refuses to acknowledge Stuart as his brother while the Littles' cat Snowbell, who attempts to eat Stuart when he first comes home, feels jealous of Stuart and sickened at the fact that he is now a pet cat to a mouse. \n\nDespite a warm and loving welcome from his new parents, Stuart struggles to fit in with his new family who also have to get used to having a small mouse with them which leads to several incidents, such as Stuart accidentally being put in the washing machine with the laundry. Fortunately, Eleanor finds him in time and Stuart recovers after a coughing fit from swallowing too much detergent.\n\nThe Littles host a family gathering to introduce Stuart. Here, George openly says that Stuart is not his brother, but only a mouse who he cannot do any brotherly things with like playing ball or riding bikes. After the party, Stuart admits to his parents that he feels like an outcast and something is missing inside. Eleanor and Frederick visit Mrs. Keeper at the orphanage to try and find out about Stuart's real parents, but Mrs. Keeper has no information at this point. At home, George and Stuart begin to bond when Stuart falls into George\u2019s playroom in the basement while trying to escape Snowbell. The two of them finish off George's ''Wasp'' boat for an upcoming race. That night, Snowbell and his friend Monty, who visited the Littles' house earlier and discovered Stuart, host a meeting with Smokey, an alley cat mobster, hatching a plan to have Stuart removed from the Little household without killing him.\n\nOn the day of the boat race, the ''Wasp'' is finished, and the Littles arrive at Central Park, where George discovers that his nemesis, Anton, is there. As the race is about to start, Stuart accidentally destroys George's remote control, rendering his boat inoperable. To make up for this, he takes control of it himself. Anton, however, attempts to cheat by ramming his much larger boat into other ones and sinking them. When he attempts to do the same thing to the ''Wasp'', Stuart manages to bite into the line of his sail, rendering Anton's boat inoperable. He subsequently wins the race.\n\nThat evening, the Littles take their first family photo together as a four before they are suddenly interrupted by the arrival of a mouse couple named Reggie and Camille Stout, who claim to be Stuart's biological parents who were forced to give him up due to poverty. The Littles reluctantly agree to allow Stuart to leave with his parents with George giving Stuart his toy roadster as a farewell present. The Stouts drive Stuart away from the Littles as they both look back at each other, heartbroken. Three days later, Mrs. Keeper visits the Littles enquiring to how things are going (not knowing that Stuart has gone) and to give them some news. She informs them that, according to the records, Stuart's parents died in a supermarket several years ago after a pile of canned food fell and crushed them. Realizing Stuart has been taken and believing the Stouts to be kidnappers who posed as his real parents, the Littles call the police, who start searching around the house.\n\nFearing that his deception will be exposed and he may lose his home, a frightened Snowbell informs Monty and Smokey that the Littles know about the Stouts so Smokey decides that Stuart must be killed instead. The Stouts are told by the cats to hand Stuart over to them. Filled with remorse, Reggie and Camille struggle to hide their emotions, so they tell him the truth; that they were cornered by the cats and in exchange for their lives, agreed to pose as his parents. Stuart is delighted to hear he is not a Stout and realises what has been missing: the Littles. He drives away in the roadster bidding farewell to his fake family. On his way home, Stuart is confronted and ambushed by Smokey and his gang, but manages to evade them by driving his car into the sewers, losing his car and luggage in the process when they both fall into the sewer water.\n\nMeanwhile, the Littles and their extended family have been putting up missing posters for Stuart around the city, using his face from the family photograph. Stuart arrives home, only to find that he arrived too late because the Littles have already left the house when he came home and encounters Snowbell, who lies to him that the Littles have been happy since he left and shows him that his face has been cut from the family photograph. A heartbroken and tearful Stuart leaves, but Snowbell realizes the error of his ways when he sees the pain the Littles are going through and that Smokey and his cronies are still planning to hunt down Stuart.\n\nSmokey and his gang return to Central Park along with Snowbell, trying to track Stuart down, but are unable to find him. Snowbell, unfit and out of breath, takes a break and finds Stuart up in a bird's nest. He tries to get Stuart to leave, but the cats return and find them in the tree together. Snowbell refuses to give Stuart to the hungry cats and takes him higher up the tree with the cats giving chase. Stuart is astonished that Snowbell is trying to save him which causes Snowbell to confess he lied about the Littles being happy without him and that they truly love him. Stuart is overjoyed and hugs Snowbell in gratitude. The cats see this and mock Snowbell when he asks that they cancel the hunt. Smokey refuses to listen and gives the order to kill them both. Stuart responds by taking off Snowbell's collar and using it to lure them.\n\nThe cats give chase, and eventually corner Stuart hanging from a tree branch. They get together on a lower one to catch him, but Snowbell saves Stuart by snapping the branch which sends Monty and the cats falling into the water below. A vengeful Smokey sneaks up behind Snowbell, but before he can kill him, Stuart intervenes by releasing a thin branch that smacks Smokey in the face, sending him tumbling into the water. Embarrassed, Smokey climbs out of the water and escapes, only to be attacked by a pack of dogs after turning a corner. Monty and the other cats also climb out of the water.\n\nSnowbell takes Stuart home, where he looks in the window to find the Littles miserable without him. They are just heading to bed when Stuart calls out to them but they cannot hear him through the glass. He taps on it and George looks up to see Stuart. The Littles rush to him and are overjoyed to be reunited with their son and brother. They ask him how he managed to come home to which Stuart replies: \u201cEvery Little in the world can find the Little house\u201d confirming he is a Little and is back where he belongs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Stuart Little characters}}\n\n===Live-action cast===\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Geena Davis]] as Mrs. Eleanor Little, the mother of the Little family and Frederick's wife.\n*[[Hugh Laurie]] as Mr. Frederick Little, the father of the Little family and Eleanor's husband.\n*[[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as George Little, the eldest child of the Little family and Stuart's older brother.\n*[[Jeffrey Jones]] as Uncle Crenshaw Little, the older brother of Frederick Little and the younger brother of Beatrice.\n*[[Connie Ray]] as Aunt Tina Little, the wife of Crenshaw and the sister-in-law of Beatrice and Frederick.\n*[[Allyce Beasley]] as Aunt Beatrice Little, the older sister of Crenshaw and Frederick.\n*[[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Cousin Edgar Little, the cousin of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick and the nephew of Grandpa Spencer.\n*[[Estelle Getty]] as Grandma Estelle Little, the mother of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick.\n*[[Harold Gould]] as Grandpa Spencer Little, the father of Beatrice, Crenshaw and Frederick.\n*[[Patrick Thomas O'Brien]] as Uncle Stretch Little, the husband of Beatrice and the brother-in-law of Crenshaw and Frederick.\n*[[Julia Sweeney]] as Mrs. Keeper, the head of the New York City Public Orphanage.\n*[[Dabney Coleman]] as Dr. Beechwood, a [[medical doctor|doctor]] who came to the Littles' house.\n* Miles Marsico as Anton, a mean-spirited child who bullied George during the boat race.\n*[[Jim Doughan]] as Detective Phil Allen, Detective Sherman's partner.
