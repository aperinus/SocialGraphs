The film centers on the chase for [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] magician turned mafia informant Robert 'Buddy Aces' Israel ([[Jeremy Piven]]), on whom a one-million-dollar bounty is placed. The ensemble cast includes [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jason Bateman]], [[Common (entertainer)|Common]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Ray Liotta]], [[Chris Pine]], and [[Matthew Fox]], all co-starring as the various individuals attempting to either capture, kill or protect Israel.\n\n''Smokin' Aces'' was the official acting debut of Keys and Common. The film is set in [[Lake Tahoe]] and was mainly filmed at [[MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa]], called the \"Nomad Casino\". It received mixed reviews, and grossed $57 million at the box office. It was followed by a 2010 [[prequel]], ''[[Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball]]'', directed by [[P. J. Pesce]] and produced and co-written by Carnahan.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] magician and wannabe gangster Buddy \"Aces\" Israel is in hiding at a [[Lake Tahoe]] hotel while his agent negotiates a potential immunity deal with [[FBI]] Deputy Director Stanley Locke. [[Special Agent]]s Richard Messner and Donald Carruthers learn that ailing mob boss Primo Sparazza has issued a $1 million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Israel and sent a mysterious \"Swede\" to bring him Israel's heart. A number of assassins also seek the reward: master of disguise Lazlo Soot; hitwomen Sharice Watters and Georgia Sykes, hired by Sparazza's [[underboss]]; mercenary Pasquale Acosta; and psychotic [[neo-Nazi]] brothers Darwin, Jeeves, and Lester Tremor.\n\nLocke sends Messner and Carruthers to take Israel into protective custody. Bail bondsmen Jack Dupree, \"Pistol\" Pete Deeks, and Hollis Elmore have been hired by the law firm that posted Israel's bail to capture him as well. The bondsmen are attacked by the Tremors, and only Elmore escapes alive. Messner visits the murder scene while Carruthers proceeds to the hotel, which each of the assassins have infiltrated. Carruthers recognizes Acosta, disguised as a security officer, in an elevator and both are mortally wounded in the ensuing gunfight.\n\nSoot gains access to Israel's penthouse, posing as his henchman Hugo. Sir Ivy, Israel's second-in-command, confronts Israel for agreeing to inform on Ivy and his entourage as part of the plea deal, and is subdued by hotel security. In Los Angeles, Locke abruptly withdraws from the deal with Israel and orders that Messner and Carruthers not be told. The Tremor brothers reach the penthouse floor and attack the security team and Ivy, who kills Jeeves and Lester. Israel, learning Locke has terminated the plea deal, attempts [[suicide]].\n\nFinding Carruthers and Acosta, Sykes is cornered when Messner sets up a position around the elevator. Watters provides cover from a nearby hotel with an [[Barrett M82|M82]] sniper rifle, outgunning Messner's team. Acosta wounds Sykes, but is shot by a dying Carruthers. Believing Sykes is dead, Watters continues shooting at the FBI. Sykes escapes to the penthouse, where she stops Darwin Tremor before he can kill Ivy. Tremor escapes, and Messner, distraught over Carruthers' death, stops Ivy and Sykes on the stairwell but lets them go. Seeing the pair alive and free through her rifle scope, Watters is gunned down by the FBI.\n\nLocke and his team descend on the hotel and take Israel to the hospital. Soot escapes, while Acosta is carted away on a gurney, still alive, and Darwin is gunned down by Elmore. At the hospital, Messner learns the truth from Locke: the Swede is a prominent heart surgeon, and Soot was hired to retrieve Israel's heart as a transplant for Sparazza; Israel is Sparazza's illegitimate son and most compatible donor. Sparazza is revealed to be Freeman Heller, a former undercover FBI agent who was thought to have been killed by the mob. In reality, the FBI attempted to kill Heller for blurring the lines between mobster and agent. Heller survived, permanently adopting the identity of Sparazza.\n\nMessner is furious over the unnecessary deaths of Carruthers and his fellow agents, and Locke's plan to complete the transplant, sacrificing Israel to save Sparazza and exploit his decades of criminal operations. Ordered to keep quiet, Messner instead locks himself in the operating room and takes Israel and Sparazza off life support, killing them both. As Locke and his men desperately try to break in, Messner lays his gun and badge on the floor, apparently resigning from the FBI.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Jack Dupree, a world-weary Las Vegas bail bondsman who is hired to bring Buddy Israel back from Lake Tahoe and see that he makes his next court appearance.\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Richard Messner, an [[FBI]] [[special agent]] assigned to protect Israel and ensure his testimony.\n* [[Andy Garcia]] as Stanley Locke, Deputy Director of the FBI and the agent heading the case against Sparazza.\n* [[Chris Pine]] as Darwin Tremor, the eldest of the Tremor brothers, a trio of redneck, speed-freak, neo-Nazi skinhead hitmen with a penchant for scorched earth tactics.

[[Joe Carnahan]], the film's writer-director, makes a cameo as an armed robber at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Title sequence==\nDuring the making of the film, Joe Carnahan's on-set photographer captured thousands of stills. These stills (over 3,000) were given to the London-based studio VooDooDog, who found sequential photographs that could be animated into title sequences. The images were then manipulated using After Effects, giving control of camera movement and depth of field. The sequence takes inspirations from ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and other 1970s movies. To give the rostrum type hand-made feel, ink textures were filmed using a Canon 5D stills camera. Originally two sequences were produced, an opening sequence and end sequence. However, only the end sequence was used.\n\n\"Yes, Joe liked the opening credits we did but after their edit they felt it slowed the momentum of the introduction. That seems to be a big concern for filmmakers now\u2014they're aware of the short attention span of audiences and don't want to delay the story. As a designer, I am not sure I would agree, of course. I think that if credit sequences are good and entertaining, they can hold an audience's attention\".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Donnellon |first=Paul |title=Smokin' Aces (2006) |date=1 May 2012 |subject-link=Paul Donnellon |interviewer=[[Ian Albinson]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=July 19, 2012 |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/smokin-aces/}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe movie itself contains 18 songs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.what-song.com/movie/title.php?Title=Smokin'%20Aces |title=Smokin' Aces [2007&#93; |publisher=what-song |access-date=2010-07-10}}</ref> leaving only one out of the official soundtrack which was \"Spottieottiedopaliscious\" by [[Outkast]].
