The film was produced and directed by [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], and is based on the [[Aladdin|Arabic folktale of the same name]] from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The voice cast features [[Scott Weinger]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Linda Larkin]], and [[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]]. The film follows the titular [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], an [[Arabs|Arabian]] [[street children|street urchin]], who finds a magic lamp containing a [[Genie (Disney)|genie]]. With the genie's help, Aladdin disguises himself as a wealthy prince and tries to impress the [[Sultan]] in order to marry his free-spirited daughter, [[Jasmine (Aladdin)|Princess Jasmine]], while the Sultan's evil vizier [[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]] plots to steal the magic lamp for his own uses.\n\nLyricist [[Howard Ashman]] first pitched the idea, and the screenplay went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] agreed to its production. The animators based their designs on the work of caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]], and computers were used for both [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|finishing the artwork]] and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by [[Alan Menken]] and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Sir [[Tim Rice]], who took over after Ashman's death.\n\n''Aladdin'' was released on November 11, 1992. It received positive reviews from critics (particularly for Williams' performance). It was a commercial success, becoming the [[1992 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1992]] with an earning of over $504&nbsp;million in worldwide box office revenue. Upon release, it became the first animated feature to reach the half-billion-dollar mark and was the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Timeline of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film of all time]] until it was surpassed by ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994).\n\n''Aladdin'' garnered two [[Academy Awards]], as well as other accolades for its soundtrack, which had the first and only number from a Disney feature to earn a [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]], for the film's \"[[A Whole New World]],\" sung by [[Peabo Bryson]] and [[Regina Belle]]. The film's home video [[VHS]] release also set a sales record and grossed about $500{{nbsp}}million in the United States. {{nobreak|''Aladdin''{{'}}s}} success led to various derived works and other material inspired by the film, including two [[direct-to-video]] sequels ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' (1996), an [[Aladdin (animated TV series)|animated television series]], and a [[Aladdin (2011 musical)|Broadway adaptation]]. A [[Aladdin (2019 film)|live-action film adaptation]] directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] was released on May 24, 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400 and 700 words.

Please check and update the wordcount when editing. -->\n\nA merchant [[Fourth wall|shows the viewers]] a lamp that is up for sale, and begins to tell a story.\n\n[[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]], the royal [[vizier]] of the fictional Middle Eastern city of Agrabah, seeks a lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders. He is told that only one person is worthy to enter: \"the diamond in the rough,\" whom Jafar later identifies as a young [[Street children|street urchin]] named [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]]. Meanwhile, [[Jasmine (Aladdin)|Princess Jasmine]] becomes upset that the law requires her to marry a prince instead of marrying for love. She escapes the palace, and meets Aladdin and his pet monkey, Abu, who save her from an angry merchant. The palace guards then capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders. Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, but he lies to her, saying Aladdin has been executed.\n\nDisguised as a feeble old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and brings them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. After being told to touch nothing but the lamp, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] inside, and obtains the lamp. Forgetting the cave's rule, Abu grabs a jewel. Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet rush to escape the cave as it collapses. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws him and Abu back into the cave, though not before Abu steals the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets [[Genie (Disney)|the genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them all from the cave without using a wish, then uses his first wish to become a prince to woo Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude.\n\nJafar's parrot [[Iago (Aladdin)|Iago]] suggests that he plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. Aladdin, as \"Prince Ali Ababwa,\" arrives in Agrabah with a large host, but Jasmine becomes angry when he discusses her fate with her father, the Sultan, and Jafar without her. As a means of apologizing, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the magic carpet. When she infers his true identity by mentioning Abu, he lies to her, saying that he only dresses as a commoner to escape the stresses of royal life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's behest and throw him into the sea. The Genie appears and saves Aladdin, at the cost of his second wish. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's evil plot. Jafar flees after spotting the lamp and thus discovering Aladdin's true identity.\n\nFearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin breaks his promise and refuses to free the Genie. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer. He then exposes Aladdin, exiling him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland, though they escape. Jasmine tries to help Aladdin steal the lamp back, but Jafar notices and overpowers her, Abu, and the carpet with his magic. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself. Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him. The Genie then throws Jafar's lamp far into the desert, banishing Jafar and Iago to the Cave of Wonders for 10,000 years.\n\nWith Agrabah returned to normal, the Genie advises Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title, so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Aladdin instead decides to keep his promise, and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin's nobility, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie bids the group a fond farewell and leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n*[[Scott Weinger]] as [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], a poor yet kind-hearted Agrabah thief.
