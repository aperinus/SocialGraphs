It was nominated for seven [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning \"Worst Remake or Sequel\", and has garnered a legacy as one of [[List of films considered the worst#The Scarlet Letter (1995)|the worst films ever made]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1667 in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], and an uneasy [[Ceasefire|truce]] exists between local [[Puritan]]s and their neighbors, the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]. Chief Metacomet succeeds his father [[Massasoit]] as head of the latter just as a new colonist, [[Hester Prynne]] arrives overseas from England. As Hester waits for her husband\u2014who is due to follow shortly after\u2014she falls for a young minister, [[Arthur Dimmesdale]]. When it emerges that [[Roger Chillingworth|Roger Prynne]] has likely been killed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], they become inseparable lovers.\n\nFinding herself pregnant with Dimmesdale's child, Hester is [[imprisonment|imprisoned]] for her indiscretion. The minister intends to declare his sin and face execution, but Hester convinces him otherwise. Sentenced to wear a scarlet \"A\" for [[adultery]], Prynne is ostracized by the public, and a [[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]] is charged to follow her whenever she comes to town. Meanwhile, Hester's husband resurfaces, having spent his absence in captivity as a [[prisoner of war]]. Learning of the scandal, he adopts the fictitious guise of \"Dr. Roger Chillingworth\" and begins seeking out her paramour.\n\nThe physician eventually murders a male settler leaving Hester's home and scalps him in an effort to implicate Algonquian warriors. Infuriated by this atrocity, the colonists declare war on the Indians and Roger, distraught by the severe consequences of his action, promptly commits [[suicide]]. Hester is nearly hanged with other undesirables in the ensuing outrage, but Dimmesdale saves her neck by confessing that he is the father of her child. As he takes her place on the gallows, the Algonquian attack Massachusetts Bay; both sides sustain heavy casualties. The Puritans are more concerned with concealing the conflict from England than harassing Hester any further; she finally abandons her scarlet letter and departs with Dimmesdale for [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Demi Moore]] as [[Hester Prynne]]\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Rev.
