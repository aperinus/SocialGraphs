It is based on the 1980 serialized [[manga]] of [[Kokurikozaka kara|the same name]] illustrated by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsur\u014d Sayama. The film stars the voices of [[Masami Nagasawa]], [[Junichi Okada]], [[Keiko Takeshita]], [[Yuriko Ishida]], [[Jun Fubuki]], Takashi Naito, [[Shunsuke Kazama]], [[Nao \u014cmori]] and [[Teruyuki Kagawa]].\n\nSet in 1963 [[Yokohama]], Japan, the film tells the story of Umi Matsuzaki, a high school girl living in a boarding house, 'Coquelicot Manor'. When Umi meets Shun Kazama, a member of the school's newspaper club, they decide to clean up the school's clubhouse, the 'Latin Quarter'. However, Tokumaru, the chairman of the local high school and a businessman, intends to demolish the building for redevelopment and Umi and Shun, along with Shir\u014d Mizunuma, must persuade him to reconsider.\n\n''From Up on Poppy Hill'' premiered on July 16, 2011, in Japan. It received positive reviews from most film critics and grossed $61 million worldwide. An English version was distributed by [[GKIDS]]; it was released to theaters on March 15, 2013, in North America.<ref name=Hopewell>{{cite web|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Keslassy|first2=Elsa|title=GKIDS plants N.

Her mother, Ryoko, is a medical professor studying in the [[United States]]. Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings and her grandmother. Each morning, Umi raises a set of [[signal flags]] with the message \"I pray for safe voyages\".\n\nOne day, a poem about the flags being raised is published in Konan Academy's newspaper. Shun Kazama, the poem's author, witnesses the flags from the sea as he rides his father's tugboat to school. At first, Umi gets the wrong impression of Shun as he does a daredevil stunt on behalf of the \"Latin Quarter\", an old building housing their high school's clubs that's being threatened with demolition. Upon her sister's request, Umi accompanies her to obtain Shun's autograph at the Latin Quarter. She learns Shun and the school's [[student government president]] Shir\u014d Mizunuma publish the school newspaper. Umi convinces Shir\u014d and Shun to renovate the Latin Quarter, and all the students contribute, both boys and girls. Umi and Shun start having feelings for each other.\n\nAt Coquelicot Manor, Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men. One of them is her deceased father, Y\u016bichir\u014d Sawamura, who was killed while serving on a supply ship during the [[Korean War]]. Shun is stunned to see he has a duplicate of the photograph. His father admits shortly after the end of [[World War II]], Y\u016bichir\u014d arrived at their house one evening with an infant, Shun. The Kazamas had recently lost their newborn, so they adopted Shun. At first, Shun tries to avoid Umi, then he finally tells her they are siblings. Umi and Shun repress their romantic feelings and they continue to see each other as friends.\n\nThe renovation of the Latin Quarter is complete but the [[Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education]] decides to proceed with the building's demolition anyway. Shir\u014d, Shun, and Umi take the train to [[Tokyo]], which is preparing for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and meet with Tokumaru, the school board's chairman. They successfully convince him to come inspect the Latin Quarter. Umi later professes her love to Shun, and he reciprocates in spite of their situation.\n\nHaving just returned from the United States, Ryoko tells Umi Shun's father was actually Hiroshi Tachibana, the second man in the photo. In 1945, Tachibana was killed in an accident on a [[History of Japanese nationality#Japanese Nationality and Repatriation after World War II|repatriation]] ship. Shun's mother died in childbirth, and his other relatives were killed in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Nagasaki]]. Ryoko was unable to raise Shun, as she was already pregnant with Umi at the time. Y\u016bichir\u014d [[Koseki|registered]] the child as his own to avoid leaving Shun as an orphan in the confusing [[Occupied Japan|postwar years]], but Shun was eventually given to the Kazamas.\n\nTokumaru visits the Latin Quarter and, impressed by the students' efforts, cancels the demolition. Umi and Shun are summoned to the harbor. They meet Yoshio Onodera, now a ship's captain and the third man in the photograph, as well as the sole survivor of the three. Confirming Umi and Shun are not related by blood, he tells the full story of the three men's history. With everything resolved, Umi resumes her daily routine of raising the flags, but now, it is not just for her father.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Masami Nagasawa]] as {{nihongo|Umi Matsuzaki|\u677e\u5d0e \u6d77|Matsuzaki Umi}}, the oldest daughter of a family that runs a lodging house and a student at Konan Academy.

At the start of the Korean War, those ships, together with their Japanese crews, were pressed into service by the US military to carry forces and supplies to Korea. Japanese vessels played a significant role at the [[Battle of Inchon|Incheon]] and [[Blockade of Wonsan|Wonsan landings]]. The shipping firm Tozai Kisen was among the most prominent firms involved, concluding \"an agreement with the US military\u2019s Japan Logistical Command (JLC) to provide 122 small vessels and around 1,300 crew for transport and landing work\".\n\nAccording to estimates, 56 Japanese sailors and labourers were killed in the Korean War zone in the first six months of the war alone; 23 of the deaths occurred when Japanese-crewed ships were sunk by mines. Official estimates of the total number of Japanese killed in the Korean War have never been published, nor have the U.S. or Japanese governments officially recognised the role of Japanese non-combatants in the Korean War.<ref name=\"japanfocus20120730\">{{cite web |url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/3803 |title=Post-War Warriors: Japanese Combatants in the Korean War |date=July 30, 2012 |publisher=The Asia-Pacific Journal |access-date=September 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083222/http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/3803 |archive-date=October 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s saw an escalating increase in [[student activism]] and campus revolts in Japan as well as in other parts of the world.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Yamate siryoukan.JPG|thumb|left|''Yamate Archives Museum'' in [[Yamate]], the Yokohama neighborhood where ''From Up on Poppy Hill'' is set.<ref name=\"yamate\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jibtv.com/enj/otomatsuri/yamate_yokohama.html |title=Townscape Information: Yamate, Yokohama |date=September 30, 2013 |publisher=Enjoy Network Japan |access-date=November 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403164813/http://www.jibtv.com/enj/otomatsuri/yamate_yokohama.html |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>]]\n''From Up on Poppy Hill'' was officially revealed as the new [[Studio Ghibli]] film for 2011 on December 15, 2010.<ref name=\"eiga20101215\">{{cite web |url=http://eiga.com/news/20101215/16/ |script-title=ja:\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u306f\u5bae\u5d0e\u543e\u6717\u76e3\u7763\u300c\u30b3\u30af\u30ea\u30b3\u5742\u304b\u3089\u300d |date=December 15, 2010 |publisher=Eiga.com |access-date=August 14, 2011 |language=ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917021122/http://eiga.com/news/20101215/16/ |archive-date=September 17, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It is based on the 1980s [[sh\u014djo manga]] of the same name by Tetsuo Sayama and Chizuru Takahashi.<ref name=\"cinematoday20110513\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0032274 |title=\u9577\u6fa4\u307e\u3055\u307f\u3001\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea\u300e\u30b3\u30af\u30ea\u30b3\u5742\u304b\u3089\u300f\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306e\u58f0\u306b\u629c\u3066\u304d\uff01\u601d\u3044\u3092\u5bc4\u305b\u308b\u5c11\u5e74\u6f14\u3058\u308b\u306e\u306fV6\u5ca1\u7530\u51c6\u4e00\uff01 |date=May 13, 2011 |publisher=Cinema Today |access-date=September 27, 2011 |language=ja |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914145535/http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0032274 |archive-date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was revealed the director [[Gor\u014d Miyazaki]] would be directing.<ref name=\"eiga20101215\" /> Gor\u014d Miyazaki is the eldest son of Studio Ghibli's co-founder and acclaimed director [[Hayao Miyazaki]];
