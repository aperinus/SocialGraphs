The original music score is composed by [[Michael Nyman]]. The film did poorly at the box office and was received as an average film by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nDaniel Dillon is an [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant who settles in the high mountains of [[California]] during the Gold Rush of 1849. It is now 1867, and Dillon has a vault filled with gold and a town of his own, named Kingdom Come. Dillon owns nearly every business of consequence in the town; if someone digs for gold, rents a hotel room, opens a bank account, or commits a crime, they will have to deal with Dillon.\n\nDonald Dalglish is a [[surveying|surveyor]] with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], which wants to put a train either through Kingdom Come, or somewhere in the vicinity. He is here to decide the route. Dillon is anxious to ensure that the railway line is routed through \"his\" town, as this will bring more business.\n\nAmong the travelers who arrive in town with Dalglish are two women, the beautiful but ailing Elena Burn and her lovely teenage daughter Hope. The presence of these women is deeply troubling for Dillon, for they are the keys to a dark secret Dillon has kept from the people of Kingdom Come for nearly twenty years. Dillon had come to these mountains with his [[Poles|Polish]] wife Elena and their months-old baby, Hope. On a cold and snowy night they happen upon a shack named Kingdom Come, owned by a disillusioned [[Californian Gold Rush#Forty-niners|'49er]] named Burn. Like Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, Dillon sells Elena and Hope to the prospector in exchange for the small gold claim that would later flourish and make Dillon so wealthy. Burn has died, and Elena has come to find Dillon because Burn left her with nothing, she is dying, and she wants Dillon to give her $200 per year so that she can \"do right by Hope\".\n\nDillon tells Lucia that they have to end their relationship and gives her some gold bricks and the deeds to her home, the saloon/brothel, and the tobacco house. Lucia is heartbroken, wanting Dillon and not his money. Dillon tells Elena that he never married anyone else because he was always married to her. The two renew their marriage but their time together is short, filled with Dillon's efforts to find a cure for her illness and ending with her death.\n\nElena's death coincides with the decision to route the railway some distance from the town for easier passage and construction. Lucia moves the girls, the booze and the tobacco house to the valley, effectively moving the entire population of Kingdom Come to her new town of [[Lisbon|Lisboa]], named for her father's home in Portugal, to be near the railroad. Following Elena's funeral, Hope tells Dillon that she is leaving to find Dalglish and start a life with him. Dillon takes her up to the original shack Kingdom Come, showing her a picture of their family when she was a baby, and revealing the deal made right on that spot between him and Burn. Hope leaves him and goes to the new Lisboa.\n\nDillon is thus faced with the loss of both Elena and Hope, and his town. He sets fire to all the buildings in Kingdom Come. The smoke attracts the people of Lisboa, who find Dillon's frozen body in the snow near his original shack. Lucia is devastated, crying over the frozen body as it is brought back to the ruins of Kingdom Come. While many of the 'former' townspeople rush to find Dillon's stockpile of gold in the burned out vault, Hope and Dalglish choose instead to follow Dillon's body as Lucia and others continue with it down the mountain.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Daniel Dillon\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Lucia\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Donald Dalglish\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Elena Dillon/Burn\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Hope Dillon/Burn\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Frank Bellanger\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Annie\n* [[Sean McGinley]] as Sweetley\n* [[Tom McCamus]] as Burn\n* Karolina Muller as Young Elena\n* [[Barry Ward (actor)|Barry Ward]] as Young Dillon\n* [[Duncan Frasier]] as Crocker\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nPrimary filming took place at the [[Fortress Mountain Resort]] in [[Kananaskis Country]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Near the end of the film, in a scene where the character of Dillon is standing in the street and throws an oil can onto a burning building, you can see the tower, cables and chairs of a modern [[ski lift]] in the background. The decision to have the film's dramatic burning of the entire town of Kingdom Come also served as a first step to fulfill the producer's commitment to return the site to its original natural condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218378/trivia|title=The Claim (2000) - IMDb|publisher=imdb}}</ref>\n\nSome secondary filming took place in Colorado. The town that Lucia creates in the valley below Kingdom Come is not to be confused with the real town of [[Arcade, Yolo County, California|Lisbon, California]] (now the unincorporated community of Arcade), located on the route of the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] which started operation in 1918.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = The Claim\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| cover        = Nymanclaim.jpg\n| caption      = design and illustration by [[Dave McKean]]\n| released     = {{film date|df=y|2001|1|23}}undefined<!--This is when it was issued by Emd Int'l and probably should not be used to indicate that the album was first released in 2000-->\n| recorded     = September 2000, Whitfield Street Studios, [[London]]\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]], [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary classical]], [[Minimalist music|minimalism]]\n| length       = 50:51\n| label        = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| producer     = <!--none credited-->\n| prev_title   = [[The End of the Affair (1999 film)|The End of the Affair]]\n| prev_year        = 1999\n| year         = 2000\n| next_title   = [[String Quartets 2, 3 & 4/If & Why|String Quartets 2, 3 & 4/<br>If & Why]]\n| next_year        = 2002\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} <ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r517948|first=Tim|last=DiGravina}}</ref>\n| rev2      =\n| rev2Score =\n}}\n''The Claim'' is [[Michael Nyman]]'s first (and, as of 2008, only) score for a Western, and his second collaboration with Michael Winterbottom. In it, in particular, in \"The Shootout,\" Nyman pays homage to [[Ennio Morricone]]'s Western scores. \"The Shootout\" also incorporates material from ''[[A Zed & Two Noughts]]'' and ''[[Prospero's Books]]'' in a layered manner with elements of the main themes of the score and a Morricone-style [[trumpet]] motif. The score includes the principal scalar riff that appears in numerous Nyman works, including ''[[Out of the Ruins]]'', ''[[String Quartets 1-3#String Quartet No. 3|String Quartet No. 3]]'', ''[[\u00c0 la folie]]'', ''[[Carrington (film)|Carrington]]'', the rejected score from ''[[Practical Magic]]'', and ''[[The End of the Affair (1999 film)|The End of the Affair]]''. ''The Claim'' marks Michael Nyman's last use of this musical material (as of 2008).\n\nPortions of the score appear as solo piano works on Nyman's 2005 album, ''[[The Piano Sings]]'', which features Nyman's personal piano interpretations of music he had written for various films.\n\n====Track listing====\n#The Exchange\n#The First Encounter\n#The Hut\n#The Explosion\n#The Recollection\n#The Fiery House\n#The Betrothal\n#The Firework Display\n#The Train\n#The Shootout\n#The Death Of Elena\n#The Explanation\n#The Burning\n#The Snowy Death\n#The Closing\n\n====Production details====\n*Artists: The [[Michael Nyman Orchestra]]\n*Composed and [[conducted]] by [[Michael Nyman]]\n*[[Orchestration]]: [[Gary Carpenter (composer)|Gary Carpenter]]/Michael Nyman\n*Programmer and music editor: [[Robert Worby]]\n*[[Auricle Ensemble|Auricle]] Operator: [[Chris Cozens]]\n*Engineer: Austin Ince\n*Assistant Engineers: Simon Changer and Ryu Kawashima\n*Recorded, mixed and edited at Whitfield Sterret Studios, London, September 2000\n*Music published by Northlight Music Ltd.

Robert Roten writing for ''Laramie Movie Reviews'' found the film to be watchable though very slow in narrative pace stating, \"It reminded me of the scene in ''[[Aguirre, The Wrath of God]]'' where the boat is dragged through the jungle. If the story was as crisp as the snow, and the plot advanced faster than a glacier, this might have been a better film. I'm glad I didn't spend more than a dollar on this. It rates a C.\"<ref>[http://www.lariat.org/atthemovies/old/theclaim.html Robert Roten.
