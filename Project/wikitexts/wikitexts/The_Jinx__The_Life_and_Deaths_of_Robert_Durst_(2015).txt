Durst sat with Jarecki for more than 20 hours over several years, despite having never previously cooperated with any journalist.\n\n''The Jinx'' gained widespread exposure when Durst was arrested on [[Murder#Degrees of murder|first-degree murder]] charges for the death of his friend [[Susan Berman]], the day before its finale aired.<ref name=\"NYT arrest\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe series investigates the unsolved 1982 disappearance of Durst's wife Kathie, the 2000 [[execution-style]] killing of writer [[Susan Berman]], and the 2001 death and [[dismemberment]] of Durst's neighbor Morris Black in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Texas]]. Durst was suspected of involvement in the first two murders and confessed to the third, but claimed self defense and was acquitted at trial.  The series incorporates a wide array of existing media including news footage, security footage, police evidence, and archival interviews, combined with footage shot by Jarecki. It is composed of contemporary interviews, visual reenactments (some of which were shot at Jarecki's [[upstate New York]] home),<ref name=\"Reenactments\">{{cite news |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/the-jinx-reenactments-chelsea-gonzalez.html |work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] |title=What It Was Like to Be a Re-Enactor on ''The Jinx''|access-date=March 18, 2015 |date=March 17, 2015 |first=Gazelle |last=Emami}}</ref> and self-reflexive footage of Jarecki's film-making process and odd working relationship with Durst. Its complex editing style and [[narrative]] construction emphasize the contradictions within both Durst's life and the bizarre and grisly murders he committed.\n\nDuring the conclusion of the fifth episode, Sareb Kaufman, Berman's stepson, contacts the filmmakers asking them to review material that was left by Berman after her murder. In it, he highlights an envelope from Durst to Berman sent in March 1999: the envelope's [[Block letters|block letter]] handwriting matches and contains the same \"Beverley {{sic}} Hills\" misspelling as an anonymous envelope sent to police in December 2000 to alert them to Berman's murder. The filmmakers, shocked by the revelation, place both envelopes in a [[safety deposit box]], and decide to get a second interview from Durst.\n\nIn the sixth and final episode, the filmmakers visit a [[Questioned document examination|forensic document examiner]]. After analyzing both envelopes and other documents in Durst's block letter writing, he states that the two writings have characteristics that can come from \"one person, and only one person\". Jarecki attempts to get a second interview with Durst, who suddenly becomes evasive and uninterested in a follow-up. At one point he claims to be in Spain, but Kaufman says that Durst told him he was in Los Angeles. After Durst is arrested for violating a [[restraining order]] filed by his brother [[Douglas Durst|Douglas]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2013/08/17/robert-durst-busted-for-violating-restraining-order-at-brothers-midtown-home/ |title=Robert Durst busted for violating restraining order at brother's Midtown home |first=Laura |last=Italiano |date=August 17, 2013 |work=New York Post|access-date=August 1, 2017}}</ref> Jarecki convinces Durst to conduct a second interview. During their session, Jarecki confronts Durst about the match in handwriting on the two envelopes - Durst acknowledges the similarity, but denies writing the letter about Berman's murder. After the interview Durst goes to the bathroom. Apparently unaware that his microphone is still recording, he makes a rambling, off-camera statement to himself, ending with, \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\"\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Episode table |background=#292929 |overall= |title= |airdate= |viewers= |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title =
