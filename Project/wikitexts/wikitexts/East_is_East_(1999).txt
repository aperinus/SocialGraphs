It is set in [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], Lancashire (now in [[Greater Manchester]]), in 1971, in a mixed-ethnicity British household headed by [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] father George ([[Om Puri]]) and an English mother, Ella ([[Linda Bassett]]).\n\n''East Is East'' is based on Khan-Din's 1996 [[East Is East (play)|play of the same name]], which opened at the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in October 1996 and [[Royal Court Theatre]] in November 1996. The title derives from the 1889 [[Rudyard Kipling]] poem \"[[The Ballad of East and West]]\", of which the opening line reads: \"Oh East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet\".\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed, winning the [[Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film]] at the [[BAFTA Awards]]. It was also a major box office success, grossing {{US$|30,438,635|year=1999|round=-6|long=no}} worldwide and earning over ten times its \u00a31.9&nbsp;million ({{US$|3 million|long=no}}) budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, George Khan is a [[British Pakistani|Pakistani]] [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Muslim who has lived in Britain]] since 1937. He has a wife in [[Pakistan]]. He and his second wife Ella, a [[White British|British]] [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] woman of [[Irish Briton|Irish descent]], have been married for twenty-five years and have seven children; Nazir, Abdul, Tariq, Maneer, Saleem, Meenah (the only daughter) and Sajid. George and Ella run a popular [[fish and chips|fish and chip]] shop.\n\nWhile George is obsessed with the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] (primarily out of concern for his first family living near the conflict zone) and arranging marriages for his children, the children themselves, born and brought up in Britain, increasingly see themselves as British and reject Pakistani dress, food, religion and culture. After George disowns Nazir for running out on his arranged marriage, he immediately begins making plans to have another of his children married to maintain his image.\n\nOn a trip to Bradford, George is introduced to Mr. Shah, a fellow Pakistani Muslim who wishes to marry off his two unattractive daughters. George arranges in secret for his second and third sons, Abdul and Tariq, to marry them, despite Ella's misgivings, a conversation that the youngest child, Sajid, overhears. During a quarrel, Sajid reveals the arranged marriages to his brothers; Tariq, the most rebellious son whose is in a relationship with Stella Moorhouse (whose grandfather is a supporter of [[Enoch Powell]] and repatriation), flies into a rage and defiles the wedding garments George had bought. The most obedient son, Maneer, is caught by George trying to tidy the mess up and beaten when he refuses to tell George who was responsible; Ella intervenes and is also beaten. Tariq travels to [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] and tracks down Nazir, now a hat designer and in a homosexual relationship, who returns to confront George for his actions. However, upon seeing Ella's and Maneer's bruises, he becomes frightened his appearance will anger George further and make the situation worse for his siblings and his mother. Ella urges him to go, so he obeys her wish and flees before George catches sight of him. After a heated argument with his father, Tariq reluctantly agrees to go along with the marriage, but defiantly states that he will follow his father's example of also having a British second wife.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Shah arrive with their daughters to meet George's family. Ella maintains her composure despite Mrs. Shah's condescending and rude attitude, but things come to a head when a scuffle ensues over a sculpture of a vagina that Saleem had made as a project for art college, and he accidentally drops it into Mrs. Shah's lap. Angered, Mrs. Shah insults George's entire family and is ejected from the house by Ella along with her husband and daughters. Enraged, George attacks Ella but is stopped by Abdul and the other children long enough for him to see how his actions have turned his entire family against him, and leaves the household in shame to seek solace in his shop.\n\nIn the aftermath, George and Ella make amends over tea while the kids play in the street.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Om Puri]] \u2013 Zahir \"George\" Khan\n*[[Linda Bassett]] \u2013 Ella Khan\n*[[Ian Aspinall]] \u2013 Nazir \"Nigel\" Khan\n*[[Raji James]] \u2013 Abdul \"Arthur\" Khan\n*[[Jimi Mistry]] \u2013 Tariq \"Tony\" Khan\n*[[Emil Marwa]] \u2013 Maneer \"Gandhi\" Khan\n*[[Chris Bisson]] \u2013 Saleem \"Picasso\" Khan\n*[[Archie Panjabi]] \u2013 Meenah Khan\n*[[Jordan Routledge]] \u2013 Sajid \"Spaz\" Khan\n*Emma Rydal \u2013 Stella Moorhouse\n*[[John Bardon]] \u2013 Mr. Moorhouse\n*Gary Damer \u2013 Earnest \"Pongo\" Moorhouse\n*[[Ruth Jones]] \u2013 Peggy\n*[[Madhav Sharma]] \u2013 Mr Shah\n*[[Lesley Nicol (actor)|Lesley Nicol]] \u2013  Auntie Annie\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews, scoring 78% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with twenty-five positive and seven negative reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/east_is_east|title=East is East (1999) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a major box office success.
