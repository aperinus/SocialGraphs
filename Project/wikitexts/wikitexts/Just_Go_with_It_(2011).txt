It is a remake of the 1969 film ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' and stars [[Adam Sandler]] (who also co-produced the film) and [[Jennifer Aniston]] with supporting roles by [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Nick Swardson]], [[Brooklyn Decker]], [[Bailee Madison]], [[Griffin Gluck]], and [[Heidi Montag]]. It tells the story of a plastic surgeon who enlists his assistant into helping him woo a sixth-grade math teacher\n\nProduction of the film began on March 2, 2010. The film was released on {{nowrap|February 11}}, 2011, by [[Columbia Pictures]] in North America. The film grossed over $214 million, making it a box office success. However, it received negative reviews, with criticism for its plot and editing but praise for its writing and acting. It won two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=September 2021}}\nIn 1988, 22-year-old Daniel \"Danny\" Maccabee ([[Adam Sandler]]) leaves his wedding right before the ceremony after learning that his fianc\u00e9e Veruca is cheating on him, and is only marrying him because he is going to be a wealthy [[cardiologist]]. While he's drinking alone at a bar, a beautiful, young woman walks in and sits next to Danny. She's rude to him initially, expecting him to hit on her like all the other guys had, but then she notices the ring. Taking a chance and making up a fake sob story about his \"wife,\" Danny ends up sleeping with her.\n\nTwenty-three years later, Danny is a successful [[plastic surgeon]] in [[Los Angeles]] who feigns being in an unhappy marriage to get women, as well as avoid romantic commitment that may lead to more heartbreak. The only woman aware of his schemes is his office manager/assistant and friend, Katherine Murphy ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny tends to a kid's knee scrape, removing his ring to treat the wound. Shortly after, he meets Palmer ([[Brooklyn Decker]]), a young sixth-grade math teacher who he hits it off with immediately. The next morning, after spending the night on the beach together, she finds Danny\u2019s wedding ring in his pocket. She leaves, upset that he cheated on his wife with her.\n\nInstead of telling her the truth, Danny tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin because she cheated on him with a man named \"Dolph Lundgren\". When Palmer insists on meeting Devlin, Danny asks Katherine to pose as \"Devlin\", which she ultimately agrees to.\n\nKatherine then meets with Danny and Palmer and gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well. Danny then privately meets with Katherine's kids, Maggie ([[Bailee Madison]]) and Michael ([[Griffin Gluck]]), to get them to play along and gives them the aliases of \"Kiki Dee\" and \"Bart\" respectively.\n\nPalmer meets the kids at a play center where Maggie has adopted a fake British accent, and Michael acts very morosely. They blackmail Danny in front of Palmer to take them all to [[Hawaii]]. At the airport, they are all surprised by Danny's goofball cousin Eddie ([[Nick Swardson]]), who has adopted an Austrian disguise as \"Dolph Lundgren\" because he is running from his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. To maintain the lies, Danny and Katherine are forced to bring him along.\n\nAt the resort in Hawaii, Danny tells Eddie that he is considering asking Palmer to marry him. Katherine and Danny also run into the real-life Devlin Adams ([[Nicole Kidman]]) and her husband Ian Maxtone-Jones ([[Dave Matthews]]). Because of Katherine and Devlin's long-time rivalry, Katherine introduces Danny as her husband rather than admitting she is a [[single mother]]. Over time, Katherine is impressed by Danny and his way with her kids.\n\nKatherine again runs into Devlin, who invites her and Danny out to dinner. Eddie agrees to take Palmer out to dinner so that Danny can go with Katherine. Since he is supposed to be a sheep salesman, Eddie's cover is nearly blown when he is forced to save the life of an actual sheep who choked on a toy whistle. At dinner, Devlin asks Danny and Katherine to tell each other what they admire most about each other, and, as Danny and Katherine talk, they start to feel a connection. Later, when Palmer and Eddie return from their dinner date, Palmer suggests that she and Danny get married now since a drunken Eddie told her about Danny's plans of engagement. Danny and Katherine are both surprised by her proposition, but Danny agrees. Danny later calls Katherine regarding his confusion, but Katherine says that she will be taking a job in [[New York City]] to get a fresh start.\n\nThe next day, Palmer confronts Katherine about Danny's feelings for her, which Katherine dismisses. Katherine then runs into Devlin at a bar and admits that she pretended to be married to Danny to avoid embarrassment. Devlin confesses that she is divorcing Ian because he is gay and also that he did not invent the iPod, but rather made his money by suing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] after getting hit by a foul ball. Katherine confides in Devlin about being in love with Danny, but then Danny shows up behind her, saying that he is not marrying Palmer and that he is deeply in love with Katherine. Meanwhile, on the plane ride back to the mainland, Palmer meets a professional tennis player ([[Andy Roddick]]) who shares her interests. Sometime later, Danny and Katherine get married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Dr. Daniel \"Danny\" Maccabee\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Katherine Murphy\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Devlin Adams \n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Eddie Simms\n* [[Brooklyn Decker]] as Palmer Dodge\n* [[Bailee Madison]] as Maggie Murphy\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] as Michael Murphy\n* [[Dave Matthews]] as Ian Maxtone-Jones\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Kirsten Brant\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Adon\n* [[Heidi Montag]] as Kimberly\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Joanna Damon\n* Rakefet Abergel as Patricia\n* [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]] as Tanner Patrick\n* [[Mario Joyner]] as Henderson\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Ernesto\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Brian (Soul Patch)\n* [[Andy Roddick]] as Himself \n* [[Jake Shimabukuro]] as ukulele player\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2021}}\nOriginally titled \"Holiday in Hawaii\", and then \"Pretend Wife\",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic0baa5eecf1bc595672289a0895f49ed |title=Sandler, Aniston playing 'Pretend' |author=Borys Kit |date=2009-12-08 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |access-date=2010-02-07}}</ref> it was released as \"Just Go with It\".\n\nThe film was shot in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[Hawaii]]an islands of [[Maui]] and [[Kauai]] between March 2, 2010, and May 25, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The film is deliberately vague about which Hawaiian island its latter portion depicts; thus, the characters hike across a rope bridge on Maui and arrive in the next scene at a spectacular waterfall on Kauai, rather than the ordinary irrigation dam and pond on Maui where the actual trail terminates.\n\nThe characters stay at a Hawaiian hotel called the [[Waldorf Astoria]].
