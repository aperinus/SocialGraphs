It is set in 1938 and explores the lives of [[widow]]s at an [[ashram]] in [[Varanasi]], India. The film is also the third and final installment of Mehta's ''[[Elements trilogy]]''. It was preceded by ''[[Fire (1996 film)|Fire]]'' (1996) and ''[[Earth (1998 film)|Earth]]'' (1998). Author [[Bapsi Sidhwa]] wrote the 2006 novel based upon the film, ''[[Water (novel)|Water: A Novel]]'', published by Milkweed Press. Sidhwa's earlier novel, ''[[Cracking India]]'' was the basis for ''[[Earth (1998 film)|Earth]]'', the second film in the trilogy.\n\n''Water'' is a dark introspect into the tales of rural Indian widows in the 1940s and covers controversial and subjects such as child marriage, misogyny and ostracism.<ref>{{Cite web |title='Water' at Majestic Cinema |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060604/tv/WateratMC.html |access-date=30 November 2019 |publisher=Sarasaviya}}</ref> The film premiered at the 2005 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], where it was honoured with the Opening Night Gala, and was released across Canada in November of that year.<ref>{{cite news |date=2005-09-09 |title=Water opens Toronto Film Festival |language=en-GB |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4228552.stm |access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref> It was first released in India on 9 March 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/09/arts/AS-A-E-MOV-India-Widow-Film.php|title=Oscar-nominated film \"Water\" released in India 7 years after protests shut down filming|website=Iht.com|access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film stars [[Seema Biswas]], [[Lisa Ray]], [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] and [[Sarala Kariyawasam]] in pivotal roles and [[Manorama (Hindi actress)|Manorama]], [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]], [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Raghuvir Yadav]] and [[Vinay Pathak]] in supporting roles.

The film was also written by Deepa Mehta.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nathan Lee |date=7 August 2008 |title=Stigmatized by Society |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/movies/08forg.html?_r=0 |access-date=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in 1938 when India was still [[British Empire in India|under British occupation]]. [[Child marriage]] was common practice, and widows had a diminished position in society.\n\nChuyia ([[Sarala Kariyawasam]]) is an eight-year-old girl, whose husband suddenly dies. In keeping with traditions of widowhood, she is dressed in a white [[sari]], her head is shaven and she is left in an [[ashram]], to spend the rest of her life in renunciation. There are fourteen women who live in the dilapidated house, sent there to expiate bad [[karma]], as well as to relieve their families of the financial and emotional burdens of caring for widows. The ashram is ruled by Madhumati ([[Manorama (Hindi actress)|Manorama]]), a pompous lady in her 70s. Her only friend is the pimp, Gulabi ([[Raghuvir Yadav]]), a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] who keeps Madhumati supplied with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. The two also have a side business: Gulabi helps Madhumati prostitute Kalyani ([[Lisa Ray]]), a beautiful young widow, by ferrying her across [[the Ganges]] to customers. Kalyani was forced into prostitution as a teenager to support the ashram.\n\nShakuntala ([[Seema Biswas]]) is perhaps the most enigmatic of the women. Attractive, witty and sharp, she is also one of the few widows who can read. She exudes enough anger that even Madhumati leaves her alone. Shakuntala is caught between being a God-fearing, devout Hindu, and her hatred of being a widow. She seeks the counsel of Sadananda ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), a priest, who makes her aware of her unjust and unholy situation. She becomes attached to Chuyia upon her arrival at the ashram.\n\nChuyia is convinced that her stay is a temporary one and that her mother will come to take her away but quickly adapts to her new life. She befriends Kalyani, and witnesses Kalyani's budding romance with Narayan ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), a charming upper-class follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Despite her initial reluctance, Kalyani eventually buys into his dream of marriage and a new life in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. She agrees to go away with him.\n\nHer plan is disrupted when Chuyia accidentally reveals their affair to Madhumati. Enraged at losing a source of income and afraid of the social disgrace, Madhumati locks Kalyani up. Much to everyone's surprise, the God-fearing Shakuntala lets Kalyani out to go meet Narayan, who ferries her across the river to take her to his home. However, when Kalyani recognizes Narayan's bungalow, she realizes that Narayan is the son of one of the men whom she has been pimped out to. In shock, she demands that he take her back. Narayan confronts his father, learning the reason for Kalyani's actions. Disgusted, he decides to walk out on his father and join [[Mahatma Gandhi]] ([[Mohan Jhangiani]]). He arrives at the ashram to take Kalyani with him, only to find that Kalyani has drowned herself.\n\nMadhumati sends Chuyia away to be prostituted as a replacement for Kalyani. Shakuntala finds out and tries to prevent the worst, but she is too late. When Shakuntala finds Chuyia, Chuyia is deeply traumatized and catatonic. Cradling Chuyia, Shakuntala spends the night on the shores of the river. Walking through town with Chuyia in her arms, she hears talk of Gandhi speaking at the train station, ready to leave town. She follows the crowd to receive his blessing. As the train departs, in an act of desperation Shakuntala runs alongside the train, asking people to take Chuyia with them. She spots Narayan on the train and hands Chuyia over to him. The train departs, carrying Chuyia away while leaving the teary-eyed Shakuntala behind.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Seema Biswas]] as Shakuntala/Gyanvati Twins double role\n* [[Lisa Ray]] as Kalyani\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] as Narayan\n* [[Waheeda Rehman]] as Bhagavati, Narayan's Mother\n* [[Sarala Kariyawasam]] as Chuyia <ref>{{Cite web |title='Water' takes Sarala to international heights |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/060604/tv/WatertakesSarala.html |access-date=30 November 2019 |publisher=Sarasaviya}}</ref>\n* [[Buddhi Wickrama]] as Baba\n* Ronica Sajnani as Kunti\n* [[Manorama (Hindi actress)|Manorama]] as Madhumati\n* Rishma Malik as Snehalata\n* Vidula Javalgekar as Patiraji (auntie)\n* [[Daya Alwis]] as Saduram\n* [[Raghuvir Yadav]] as Gulabi\n* Vinay Pathak as Rabindra\n* [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] as Sadananda\n* [[Gerson Da Cunha]] as Seth Dwarkanath\n* [[Iranganie Serasinghe]] as Mother-in-Law\n* Mohan Jhangiani as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\n* [[Sanoja Bibile]] as Woman Bather\n\n== Production ==\n''Water'' is a co-production between Canada, India<ref>{{Cite web |title=Water |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/water/details |access-date=13 June 2019 |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> and the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Water (2005) |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b84002117 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713033621/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b84002117 |archive-date=13 July 2012 |access-date=10 January 2016 |website=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> The film was shot twice with the same (bilingual) actors, once in Hindi, once in English.\n\n== Release ==\nThe film debuted on 8 September 2005 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and opened in other theatres at the dates given below.

Critical response ===\nThe film received high praise from Kevin Thomas, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':\n<blockquote>\nFor all her impassioned commitment as a filmmaker, Mehta never preaches but instead tells a story of intertwining strands in a wholly compelling manner. \"Water,\" set in British occupied India of 1938, is as beautiful as it is harrowing, its idyllic setting beside the sacred Ganges River contrasting with the widows' oppressive existence as outcasts. The film seethes with anger over their plight yet never judges, and possesses a lyrical, poetical quality. Just like the Ganges, life goes on flowing, no matter what. Mehta sees her people in the round, entrapped and blinded by a cruel and outmoded custom dictated by ancient religious texts but sustained more often by a family's desire to relieve itself of the economic burden of supporting widows. As a result, she is able to inject considerable humour in her stunningly perceptive and beautifully structured narrative. \"Water\" emerges as a film of extraordinary richness and complexity.<ref>Thomas, Kevin (2006).

Her earlier film, ''[[Fire (1996 film)|Fire]]'', however, had previously attracted hostility from conservative right-wing organizations, which objected to her subject matter and portrayal of conservative households in a negative light. Protestors organised protests and attacks on cinemas that screened that film. The day before filming of ''Water'' was due to begin, the crew was informed that there were complications with their location permits for filming. The following day, they learned that 2,000 protesters had stormed the [[ghats]], destroying and burning the main film set and throwing the remnants into the [[Ganges]] in protest of what ultimately were revealed to be false accusations regarding the subject matter of the film.<ref name=note3 /> A right-wing politician [[Arun Pathak]] also organised a suicide protest to stop the film production.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 February 2000 |title='Water' shooting stopped again, Mehta 'asked to leave Varanasi' |url=http://www.hindu.com/2000/02/07/stories/01070005.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120906051548/http://www.hindu.com/2000/02/07/stories/01070005.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 September 2012 |access-date=20 October 2011 |website=[[The Hindu]] |publisher=[[The Hindu Group]]}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting tensions and economic setbacks led to several years of struggle as Mehta was eventually forced to film ''Water'' in [[Sri Lanka]], rather than in India.<ref name=\"note3\" /> Finally Mehta was able to make the film, but with a new cast and under a false title (''River Moon'') in 2003.
