The diagnosis of cancer is harsh and the doctor cannot say for sure whether Pete will celebrate his 18th birthday. Hospitalized, he meets Jusa ([[Joonas Saartamo]]), a \"tough guy\", cancer patient too. They eventually become friends, after a first moment of clash. One night, encouraged by the [[vodka]] on Jusa's 18th birthday, Pete confesses his love to Kata ([[Johanna R\u00f6nnl\u00f6f]]), his dream girl since high school. Jusa and Pete travel to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] where Kata has a summer job at her uncle's hotel. In Jusa's wild company, Pete experiences something which he never felt before as they decide to take a trip to [[Mombasa]] via Lapland, together with Kata, as this is Jusa's last wish before his inevitable death.\n\nJusa has sex with Kata to whom he loses his virginity. Pete acquiesces and stays in the red convertible while Jusa and Kata are having a sexual intercourse in a barn. Afterwards Pete joins them and the three spend the night together sleeping in the barn. Jusa will never see the dreamed beach of Mombasa: he dies in the company of Kata and Pete in Finland on the beach by the shiny blue Baltic Sea.\n\nThe movie's theme song is \"Mombasa\" performed by the band Denigrate. The song is a remake of the eponymous 1975 hit performed by [[Taiska]], which is the original Finnish cover of the Italian song \"Ibo-le-le\".\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0328132|title=One-Way Ticket to Mombasa}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s adventure films]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:Finnish drama films]]\n[[Category:Finnish teen films]]\n{{2000s-drama-film-stub}}\n{{Finland-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
