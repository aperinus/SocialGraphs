Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt New York City following the [[Vietnam War]], the film follows [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a veteran working as a taxi driver, and his deteriorating [[mental state]] as he works nights in the city.\n\nWith ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956) and ''[[A Bigger Splash (1973 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. With cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. [[Bernard Herrmann]] composed the film's music in what would be his final score, finished just several hours before his death; the film is dedicated to him.\n\nThe film was theatrically released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on February 7, 1976, where it was a critical and commercial success, despite generating controversy for its graphic violence at the climactic ending, and casting of then 12-year-old Foster in the role of a [[child prostitute]]. The film received numerous accolades including the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]'s [[Palme d'Or]], and four nominations at the [[49th Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster).\n\nAlthough ''Taxi Driver'' generated further controversy for its role in [[John Hinckley Jr.]]'s motive to attempt to assassinate then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the film has remained popular; one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time. In 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. In 1994, the film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]], and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Travis Bickle]] is a 26-year-old honorably discharged [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran suffering from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and living alone in New York City. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]] and loneliness. He frequently goes to the [[Adult movie theater|porn theater]]s on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorism]]s, such as \"you're only as healthy as you feel.\" He becomes disgusted with the crime and [[urban decay]] that he witnesses in Manhattan, and dreams about ridding \"the scum off the streets.\"  \n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Travis enters the campaign office where she works, and asks her out for coffee, to which she agrees. Betsy confesses that she feels a special connection to Travis, and agrees to go on another date with him. During their date Travis takes Betsy to a porn theater, which repulses her and causes her to leave. He attempts to reconcile with her, to no avail. Enraged, he storms into the campaign office where she works, and berates her before he is ordered to leave. Experiencing an [[existential crisis]] and seeing various counts of prostitution throughout the city, Travis confides in fellow taxi driver nicknamed Wizard about his [[Homicidal ideation|violent thoughts]]. \n\nHowever, Wizard dismisses them and assures him that he will be fine. In an attempt to find an outlet for his rage, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to a [[black market]] gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and modifies one to allow him to hide and quickly deploy it from his sleeve. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to scope out their security. One night, Travis shoots and kills a man attempting to rob a convenience store run by a friend of his. On his trips around the city, Travis regularly encounters Iris, a [[Child prostitution|child prostitute]] whom he fantasizes about saving. \n\nTravis solicits her and tries to persuade her to stop prostituting herself. Soon after, Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally where he plans to assassinate Palantine. However, he is chased away by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents who see him unzipping his jacket and putting his hand inside. That evening, Travis drives to the [[brothel]] where Iris works, and shoots her pimp, Sport. He enters the building and engages in a shootout with Sport and one of Iris's clients, a mafioso. Travis is shot several times but manages to kill the two men. He then brawls with the bouncer, whom he manages to stab through the hand with his knife located in his shoe and finish him off with a gunshot to the head. \n\nTravis attempts to commit suicide, but is out of bullets. Bloody and injured, he slumps on a couch next to a sobbing Iris. As police respond to the scene, a delirious Travis imitates shooting himself in the head using his finger. Travis goes into a [[coma]] due to his injuries. He is heralded by the press as a heroic vigilante and is not prosecuted for the murders, also receiving a letter from Iris's father, thanking him. After recovering, Travis returns to work, where he encounters Betsy as a fare; they interact cordially, with Betsy saying she followed his story in the newspapers. Travis drops her at home, and declines to take her money, driving off with a smile. He suddenly becomes agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris Steensma\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Senator Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as \"Wizard\"\n* Steven Prince as \"Easy Andy\", the Gun Salesman\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as \"Passenger Watching Silhouette\"/Man Outside Palantine Headquarters\n* [[Harry Northup]] as \"Doughboy\"\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Melio, the Bodega Clerk\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as the Personnel Officer\n}}\nCredits adapted from:<ref name=\"AFI\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=30ed59b1-ab13-4c35-b0af-5acb732405b1&sr=40.732704&cp=1&pos=0|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog - Taxi Driver|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2020-03-14|archive-date=August 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808044047/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=30ed59b1-ab13-4c35-b0af-5acb732405b1&sr=40.732704&cp=1&pos=0|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |access-date=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nAccording to director [[Martin Scorsese]], it was [[Brian De Palma]] who introduced him to [[Paul Schrader]]. ''Taxi Driver'' arose from Scorsese feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries; he attempted to inculcate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956) and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1973 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (1973) as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=David|author-link1=David M.

Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[Peptic ulcer disease|stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" he states \"The first draft was maybe 60 pages, and I started the next draft immediately, and it took less than two weeks.\" Schrader recalls that \"I realized I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks [...] that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid [[psychosis]], making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\"/> [[Dustin Hoffman]] was offered the role of Travis Bickle but turned it down because he thought that Scorsese was \"crazy\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a81436/hoffman-turned-down-crazy-scorsese/ |title=Hoffman turned down 'crazy' Scorsese |work=Digital Spy |last=Dadds |first=Kimberley |date=December 10, 2017 |access-date=July 29, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=July 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210722025603/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a81436/hoffman-turned-down-crazy-scorsese/ }}</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'' in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900''. De Niro apparently lost {{Convert|16|kg|abbr=off}} and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of criminal [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s, distorted nocturnal images, and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|title=Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective|date=March 18, 2017|first=Will|last=Perkins|website=[[Art of the Title]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330215710/https://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|archive-date=March 30, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=March 30, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/taxi-driver/|title=Taxi Driver|date=September 5, 2011|first=Shaun|last=Mir|website=[[Art of the Title]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330215824/https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/taxi-driver/|archive-date=March 30, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=March 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nOn a low budget of $1.9 million, various actors took pay cuts to create the project. De Niro and [[Cybill Shepherd]] each received only $35,000 to make the film, and Scorsese was given $65,000. Overall, $200,000 of the budget was given to performers in the film.<ref name=budget/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67148/13-grimy-facts-about-taxi-driver|title=13 Surprising Facts About ''Taxi Driver'' On Its 45th Anniversary|date=February 8, 2016|first=Eric|last=D.

The film came into conflict with the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/taxi-driver-oral-history-de-881032|title='Taxi Driver' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary|date=April 7, 2016|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330215309/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/taxi-driver-oral-history-de-881032|archive-date=March 30, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=March 30, 2021}}</ref> When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation.
