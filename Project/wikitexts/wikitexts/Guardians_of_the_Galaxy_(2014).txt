Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 10th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[James Gunn]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Nicole Perlman]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Vin Diesel]], and [[Bradley Cooper]] as the titular [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians]], along with [[Lee Pace]], [[Michael Rooker]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[John C.

In the film, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] and a group of extraterrestrial criminals go on the run after stealing a [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|powerful artifact]].\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the July 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. In addition to an original score by [[Tyler Bates]], the film's soundtrack includes several popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s chosen by Gunn. Post-production was completed on July 7, 2014.\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on July 21, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 1, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $773.3 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014, as well as the [[2014 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. The film was praised for its screenplay, direction, acting, humor, soundtrack, visual effects, and action sequences. It was nominated for two awards at the [[87th Academy Awards]], and received [[List of accolades received by Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|numerous other accolades]]. A sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', was released in 2017. A third film, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'', will be released in 2023.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be kept between 400 to 700 words! -->\n\nIn 1988, following his mother's death, a young [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] is abducted from Earth by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the [[Ravagers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ravagers]] led by [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta]]. In 2014, on the abandoned planet [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Morag|Morag]], Quill steals a mysterious Orb, but is attacked by forces of the fanatical [[Kree (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kree]] renegade [[Ronan the Accuser (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ronan the Accuser]] led by [[Korath the Pursuer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korath]]. Although Quill escapes with the Orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the Orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the Orb on [[Xandar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Kyln|Kyln]] prison. An inmate there, [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with the powerful intergalactic warlord, [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], and Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the Orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the Orb to the Collector [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''[[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Milano|Milano]]''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flees to [[Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestials (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meets Tivan. Tivan opens the Orb, revealing the [[Power Stone (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Power Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's collection. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the Orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the Orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar. Hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the warship with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group finds themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real one to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], has their criminal records [[expunged]], and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother, a [[cassette tape]] filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified outside the film's narrative as [[Cosmo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.<ref name=\"EWJuly2014\" /> Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.<ref name=\"PrattWeight\" /> Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /> and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' to accommodate his participation in the film.<ref name=\"ParksandRec\" /> [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a]] as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]]:<br />An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes.

I've been blue before [in ''Avatar''].\"<ref name=\"2013MayMTV\" /> Salda\u00f1a described Gamora as \"... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal, but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her.

Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life, as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" />\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]:<br />A tree-like humanoid,<ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /> he is the accomplice of Rocket.

He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with ever {{sic}} 'I am Groot,' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\" /> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]:<br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movements from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, were recorded as potential references for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process continued to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone who could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.\"<ref name=\"IGNRocketJun2014\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ronan the Accuser]]:<br />A [[Kree]] zealot and war criminal who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for the annihilation of his mortal enemies, the Xandarians. Ronan and his [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]] army<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"AMCYoutube\" /> Describing Ronan, Gunn said, \"He is the primary villain, and he is a really twisted guy, he has a really religious bent in this film. He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta]]:<br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would be ending.<ref name=\"RookerUSAToday\" /> Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply.<ref name=\"RookerMakeup\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]:<br />An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> About the character, Gillan said, \"She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly.

He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock.

Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"2011SeptEW\" />\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He said the film's titular team would consist of the characters [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Star-Lord]], [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]], and [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]].<ref name=\"2012SDCCPanel\" /> Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.<ref name=\"2012SDCCArt\" /> In August 2012, [[James Gunn]] entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including future MCU directors [[Peyton Reed]] and the duo [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]].<ref name=\"2012AugGunn\" /> ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]], who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|''The Avengers'' sequel]],<ref name=\"2012AugWhedon\" /> was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying \"James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up.\"<ref name=\"2012SepWhedon\" />\n\n====Writing====\n[[Nicole Perlman]], who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009,<ref name=\"Screenplay\" /> was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on.<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> Out of those, Perlman chose [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]'s ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', due to her interest in space and science fiction,<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose ''Guardians'', because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that\". Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the ''Guardians'' universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in<!--not a mistake--> in early 2012 to contribute to the script.<ref name=\"Perlman\" /> Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because \"it didn't work\" for him; he would use the film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.<ref name=\"2014JulGunn\" />\n\nGunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no [[Walkman]]; he stated, \"In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works.\"<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /> The 2012 screenplay also had [[J'son (character)|J'son]] as an emperor and [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]]'s father just like in the comic books. When Marvel asked Joss Whedon to revise the script ahead of ''Age of Ultron'', Whedon particularly detested this reveal and suggested Marvel to not make Peter part of royalty;<ref name=\"PetersOriginalFather\" /> Whedon suggested Gunn to make the story \"weirder\" after reading the early draft.<ref name=\"MakeItWeirder\" /> In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,<ref name=\"2012AugMcCoy\" /> but was not credited in the final film.<ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" />\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of Peter Quill, as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" /> [[Glenn Howerton]] was Gunn's second choice for the role.<ref name=\"Howerton\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> [[Victoria Alonso]], an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon\u2014they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do [[rotoscoping|rotomation]], probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\"<ref name=\"2013FebAlonso\" /> In March 2013, Feige discussed ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone]] film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSalda\u00f1a\" /> [[Amanda Seyfried]] had been offered the role, but declined due to the excessive hours of make-up required for the role, and her uncertainty over the film's commercial viability.<ref name=\"SeyfriedGamora\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu Udonta (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yondu Udonta]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C. Reilly]] the role of [[Rhomann Dey]].<ref name=\"2013MayHitFix\" /> At the same time, it was disclosed that filmmakers were looking at actors including [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Alan Rickman]], and [[Ken Watanabe]], for another role, and that [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] were providing finishing touches to the script.<ref name=\"2013MayHitFix\" /> A few days later, [[Glenn Close]] was cast as the head of the [[Nova Corps]] in the film,<ref name=\"2013MayClose\" /> followed shortly by the casting of [[Karen Gillan]] as the film's lead female villain.<ref name=\"2013MayGillan\" /> By June 2013, [[Benicio del Toro]] was cast in the film, as part of a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"2013MayDelToro\" /> Later in the month, it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey.<ref name=\"2013JuneReilly\" />\n\nSpecial effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts of actors, such as Bautista, to experiment with materials used to create the characters. White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013, in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Irani Rael (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film\". During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something\". Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Salda\u00f1a, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean was first hired to play Kraglin Obfonteri, but James hired him as a stand-in on set for Rocket because he knew he could trust in him until they could figure out how to portray Rocket, though they knew Sean would not voice the character, with Cooper being cast to voice Rocket very late in development.<ref name=\"SeanGunnDiscussingFilm\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices\".<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"Salda\u00f1aAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = right\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = The [[Gardens by the Bay]] (top) in [[Singapore]] helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    = Gardens by the Bay South viewed from Sands Sky Park, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = Xandar in Guardians of the Galaxy (film).jpg\n|width2    = \n}}\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lola VFX; [[Cantina Creative]]; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;<ref name=\"Corlett\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\" /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep grooves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack){{!}}''Guardians of the Galaxy'' (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling#Blue Swede cover|Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants. The cassette, which is the first cassette [[Disney Music Group]] has released since 2003, comes with a digital download version of the album.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixCassette\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n===Promotion===\n[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|The cast and crew of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] (L-R: producer [[Kevin Feige]], Bautista, director [[James Gunn]], del Toro, Salda\u00f1a, Hounsou, Pace, Rooker, Gillan, and Pratt)]]\n\nAt Disney's [[Disney D23|D23]] Expo in August 2013, Feige presented footage first revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.<ref name=\"D23\" /> The first trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on February 18, 2014, with a special introduction by Chris Pratt.<ref name=\"USATodayFeb2014\" /> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the trailer delivered \"some spirited alien action, with exploding spaceships and muscled bad guys, not to mention a few purely comedic moments,\" while spotlighting \"a number of the offbeat characters.\"<ref name=\"LATimesTrailer\" /> ''[[Total Film]]'' noted the similarity of the trailer's opening clip to the 1981 film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which Gunn stated was a big influence for ''Guardians'',<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer1\" /> and made note of the \"edgy\" humor used throughout.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer5\" /> ''Total Film'' also noted the similarity of the trailer to the one debuted at Comic-Con and D23, with a few new shots featuring Nebula and the Collector.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer9\" /><ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer10\" /> Social media response to the trailer was strong, with 88,000 mentions across [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and various blogs in a 12-hour period.
