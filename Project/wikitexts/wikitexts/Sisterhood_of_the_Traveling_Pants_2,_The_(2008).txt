The original cast ([[Amber Tamblyn]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Blake Lively]] and [[Alexis Bledel]]) return to star in the film. It was directed by [[Sanaa Hamri]] and written by Elizabeth Chandler, who wrote the previous film. The film is based upon the fourth novel in the [[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants|book series]]: ''[[Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood|Forever in Blue]]'' (2007), but incorporates scenes and storylines from ''[[The Second Summer of the Sisterhood]]'' (2003) and ''[[Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood|Girls in Pants]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963526.html |title=Warner Bros. stitching new 'Pants' |author=Fleming, Michael |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=2007-04-20 |access-date=2008-08-02}}</ref>\n\nIt is the second installment of [[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (film series)|''The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' film series]] and was released in theaters on August 6, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nBest childhood friends [[Bridget \"Bee\" Vreeland|Bridget Vreeland]], [[Lena Kaligaris]], [[Tibby Rollins]], and [[Carmen Lowell]] have completed their first year of college and will spend their summer apart.\n\nBridget discovers her father had hidden letters from her grandmother Greta and doesn't accept that it was to protect her. She goes to Turkey to participate in an [[archaeological dig]] under Professor Nasrin Mehani. Finding remains of a woman who died at the same age as Bridget's mother saddens her.\n\nAfter reading her grandmother's letters, Bridget leaves the dig to visit her in Alabama. She learns her mother, who committed suicide, had denied having [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or any mental issues at all. Not allowing anyone into her life who challenged this or got her help, Bridget's father went along with it. But Greta could not, and moved away because her daughter wouldn't accept help.\n\nGreta tells Bridget her mother was sick and her suicide was not her father's fault, saying she is 'stronger' than her so will not be sick like her. Bridget thinks her mother should have stayed alive for her sake and feels unloved/ abandoned. Greta says that her mother's love for Bridget is why she hung on as long as she did. It allows Bridget to later reconcile with her father.\n\nWhile mourning the death of her grandfather Bapi in Greece, Lena meets her ex-boyfriend Kostas, who reveals he is married and expecting a baby with his wife. Lena returns to the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and begins dating Leo, the model for her [[life class]]. Kostas comes to see her, revealing that his marriage was [[annulled]] after his wife revealed that she had lied about being pregnant. Lena forgives him but refuses to take him back because she says they have changed. However, after spending time with Leo, she realizes they are incompatible and she still cares for Kostas.\n\nTibby works at a video store in New York while retaking a screenwriting class at [[New York University]] that requires her to finish her script. While having sex with her boyfriend Brian, the condom breaks. Afraid that she might be pregnant, Tibby withdraws from everyone. Breaking up with Brian, she reluctantly gives Lena's younger sister Effie permission to date him, despite the age difference.\n\nLena brings Tibby a requested pregnancy test, but she gets her period before needing it. Tibby drives to Vermont, hoping for Carmen's support, but leaves after they argue over who ignores who more. She goes to Brian's and apologizes, confessing she had been afraid dealing with change. Realizing he still loves Tibby, he breaks up with Effie.\n\nCarmen attends an actor workshop in Vermont, prompted by fellow Yale student and friend Julia. During auditions for ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', Ian, an actor, encourages Carmen to try out. She ultimately wins the part of Perdita, causing Julia to become envious. Carmen grows more confident when her talent is seen by the director Bill and the other actors, including Ian, with whom she begins a flirtatious friendship.\n\nOne night, Julia says she is going on a date with Ian, upsetting Carmen and causing her to falter in rehearsals. When her mother Christina goes into labor early, Carmen reconciles with Tibby and asks her to help. Ian comforts Carmen, revealing he only went out with Julia because she begged.\n\nCarmen overhears Julia tell Bill to replace her saying she doesn\u2019t have what it takes, but he refuses. Regaining her confidence, she performs successfully, and kisses Ian after the play. While packing to leave, she chastises Julia for her backstabbing, ending their friendship.\n\nEffie, upset with Brian breaking up with her and how Lena seems to love her friends more than her own sister, steals the Pants and loses them in Greece while visiting her grandmother. Bridget, Lena, Tibby, and Carmen disagree if the Pants are worth saving, so Lena travels to Greece to look for them.\n\nDiscovering from Effie that Lena refused to take Kostas back when he visited her in Rhode Island, the other three follow with Carmen's stepdad's almost expired frequent flier miles to help search for the Pants and convince Lena to give Kostas a second chance. Lena sees Kostas and he says he has a place to study at the London School of Economics, but they part. Later, Lena looks for Kostas on his boat and they kiss.\n\nAlthough they do not find the Pants, the summer ends in Greece with the four friends renewing their mutual commitment to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amber Tamblyn]] as [[Tibby Rollins]]\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] as [[Lena Kaligaris]]\n* [[America Ferrera]] as [[Carmen Lowell]]\n* [[Blake Lively]] as [[Bridget \"Bee\" Vreeland|Bridget Vreeland]]\n* [[Michael Rady]] as Kostas Dounas\n* [[Leonardo Nam]] as Brian McBrian\n* [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] as Leo\n* [[Tom Wisdom]] as Ian\n* [[Lucy Hale]] as Effie Kaligaris, Lena's younger sister\n* [[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]] as Julia Beckwith\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Prof. Nasrin Mehani\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Greta Randolph, Bridget's maternal grandmother\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Christina\n* [[Ernie Lively]] as Franz Vreeland, Bridget's father\n* [[Carly Rose Sonenclar]] as Katherine Rollins\n* Maria Konstandarou as Yia Yia, Lena's maternal grandmother\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Bill Kerr (''uncredited'')\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] started on June 3, 2007.
