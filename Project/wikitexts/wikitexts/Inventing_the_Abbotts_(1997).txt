The film focuses on two brothers and their relationship with the wealthy Abbott sisters.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe lives of two closely linked families dangerously intersect in a small Illinois town in the 1950s. Two brothers, J.C. and Doug Holt are being raised by their single, working mother in Haley, Illinois. Their father Charlie was a reckless risk-taker who lost his life when J.C. was two years old and Doug wasn't even born, after driving on a frozen lake over a bet made with Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd had just acquired Charlie's patent for a steel file-drawer in return for almost nothing, consequently becoming one of the town's wealthiest and most-admired citizens. Lloyd and his distant wife, Joan, are the parents of three beautiful daughters, Alice, Eleanor and Pamela. The parties for the girls' birthdays and other milestones are among the most waited events in the town.\n\nThinking his father's death was Lloyd's fault, and that the money raised from the patent was unfairly stolen from his family, J.C. seeks revenge on Lloyd through the calculated seduction of the Abbott daughters. First he hooks up with Eleanor, the wildest of the three. As a consequence of their relationship, she's sent away to a mental hospital, and will end up never returning to Haley again. Meanwhile, Doug, who initially admires his brother's libertine lifestyle, starts harboring reciprocated feelings for the youngest Abbott, Pamela. The two awkwardly circle each other, but she protests his early, fumbling sexual advances.\n\nDuring a summer home from college, J.C. seduces the oldest Abbott daughter, Alice, who's divorcing her abusive husband after the birth of their daughter. The relationship between J.C. and Alice also leads to heartbreak, as well as to Lloyd taking extreme measures to keep them apart.\n\nAmidst the complicated dynamics brought about by their siblings, Doug and Pamela meet again by chance while attending college at [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]] and [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], respectively. Their reunion is once again thwarted by the reveal that J.C. has in the meantime started a sexual relationship with Pamela, too. This creates a severe fracture between the two brothers.\n\nWhen Doug and J.C. come back home for their mother's funeral, they find the document confirming their late father had sold his patent for the very car he drove to his death on the lake. This knowledge doesn't comfort J.C., who still finds it deeply unfair that they were denied the wealth of the Abbots for futile reasons. In the end, Doug convinces Lloyd of his true love for Pamela and the two finally find each other for good. The adult Doug who's narrating the story recounts how they married one year later and eventually gave birth to two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Pamela Abbott\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Doug Holt\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as John Charles \"J.C.\" Holt\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Eleanor Abbott\n* [[Will Patton]] as Lloyd Abbott\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Helen Holt\n* [[Joanna Going]] as Alice Abbott\n* [[Barbara Williams (actress)|Barbara Williams]] as Joan Abbott\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Peter Vanlaningham\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as The Narrator / Older Doug Holt\n* [[Zoe McLellan]] as Sandy\n\n== Production ==\nThough the film is set in rural Illinois, it was mostly shot in the region of Northern California, including the areas of [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]], [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], and [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=INVENTING THE ABBOTTS |url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/InventingTheAbbotts/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 17, 2021 |website=www.filminamerica.com}}</ref> The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] stood in for scenes set at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n''Inventing the Abbotts'' was not well received by critics.
