After a bomb explodes in her dressing room, her manager Bill Devaney seeks out professional bodyguard Frank Farmer, a former [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent who served on the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] presidential details, to protect her. Frank reluctantly accepts Devaney's offer, but he feels Rachel is a spoiled [[diva]] who is oblivious to the threats against her life.\n\nRachel soon accuses Frank of being paranoid, complaining that his extensive protection techniques are intrusive. However, Frank and Rachel grow closer when he rescues her from danger after a riot erupts at one of her concerts. Her existing bodyguard, Tony, resents Frank's presence, leading to a brawl between the two in Rachel's kitchen. Though Frank tries to remain professional, he and Rachel sleep together; he breaks off the affair the next day, realizing it compromises his ability to protect her. Hurt, Rachel begins to defy Frank's security measures.  Then, to make Frank jealous, Rachel flirts with his former Secret Service colleague, Greg Portman, whom she meets at a [[Miami]] party.\n\nWhen her stalker places a threatening phone call, Rachel finally recognizes the seriousness of the situation and her need to trust Frank completely. Frank, Rachel, her son Fletcher, her older sister Nicki, and her driver, Henry, then travel to a large lakefront cabin in the mountains, the home of Frank's father, Herb. The next day, Frank rescues Fletcher from a small motorboat just before it blows up. After Frank secures the house for the night, a drunk Nicki, upset that Fletcher could have died, admits to Frank that she hired a hitman to kill Rachel during a fit of jealousy, but that the letters from the stalker came before that. She has paid in full and does not know the killer's identity. Abruptly, the hitman breaks into the dark house and fatally shoots Nicki. Frank pursues the killer into the woods; he shoots at the assailant, misses, and the assailant escapes. Frank learns that the stalker had been apprehended earlier that day, and was in custody when Nicki was killed.\n\nA few days after Nicki's funeral is the Academy Awards ceremony, where Frank gives Rachel a panic button in the shape of a cross to immediately alert him to any trouble. Despite this, a plethora of backstage technical issues hamper Frank's efforts to monitor the proceedings closely. While presenting an award, Rachel freezes and runs offstage, angry at Frank for embarrassing her with overprotective measures. Later, Rachel is announced as the winner for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], but as she comes on stage to accept the award, Portman is revealed to be the hitman, masquerading as the bodyguard for the ceremony's host. Frank notices Portman pointing a gun disguised as a camera at Rachel; as Portman prepares for the fatal shot, Frank runs onstage and leaps in front of Rachel, taking the bullet meant for her and setting off chaos amongst the audience. Immediately regaining his balance, Frank shoots and kills Portman while the gun is aimed at Rachel. Frank is left wounded, and Rachel calls for help, all the while urging him to stay with her as he slowly passes out.\n\nFrank recovers from the shooting and bids farewell to Rachel at the airport, both knowing their relationship would never work out. After the plane starts to take off, Rachel suddenly orders the plane to stop, jumps out and runs to Frank for one last passionate kiss. Sometime later Rachel performs \"I Will Always Love You\" on a stage, while elsewhere Frank is at an annual dinner keeping a vigilant eye on his next assignment while a priest is seen holding a cross similar to the one he gave Rachel.\n\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Frank Farmer\n* [[Whitney Houston]] as Rachel Marron\n* [[Gary Kemp]] as Sy Spector\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Bill Devaney\n* [[Ralph Waite]] as Herb Farmer\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as Greg Portman\n* [[Michele Lamar Richards]] as Nicki Marron\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Tony Scipelli\n* Christopher Birt as Henry Adams\n* [[DeVaughn Nixon]] as Fletcher Marron\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Ray Court\n}}\n\nIn addition, Tony Pierce plays the stalker, while the [[Academy Awards]] ceremony includes [[Robert Wuhl]] as the host, [[Richard Schiff]] as a stage manager, journalist [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]] as the red carpet M.C. and [[Debbie Reynolds]] as herself.

He wrote eight scripts in eight years, including ''The Bodyguard'' which Kasdan says was inspired by ''[[Yojimbo]]'' with Steve McQueen as the lead.<ref>Writer's Hot, but No Credits: FILM CLIPS SCHREGER, CHARLES. ''Los Angeles Times'' 6 Oct 1979: b6.</ref> \"I was interested in what kind of a guy would do that kind of work: to be willing to lay down his life for a salary, for someone he may care nothing about-maybe even have negative feelings about,\" said Kasdan.<ref name=\"com\">Tropic of Kasdan\nChute, David. Film Comment; ''New York'' Vol. 17, Iss. 5,  (Sep/Oct 1981): 49-56.</ref> Kasdan says it was the first really good script he wrote:\n<blockquote>I loved all my early scripts and I expected everybody else to love them. It wasn't until I wrote 'The Bodyguard' and sensed it was different that I realized I was writing an increased level of density. A good script has levels of action going on, unexpected turns. Movies are an economical form. Your script must communicate in the tersest possible way an emotional feeling, imply it in a mosaic of tiny scenes. An unknown screenwriter selling a speculative script must deliver a delight. An established writer gets a lot of rope. The producer reads his script and says, 'I don't feel any delight but he must know what he's doing.' A lot of times he doesn't, and you have a lousy movie.<ref>HOW HE BECAME HOLLYWOOD'S HOT WRITER\nHARMETZ, ALJEAN. ''The New York Times'' 1 Nov 1981: A.1.</ref></blockquote>\nKasdan wrote it in 1975 and the script succeeded in getting him an agent, but it took the agent two years to sell the script\u2014he says 67 people passed on it. Eventually the script was sold to [[John Calley]] for $20,000. Calley brought in [[John Boorman]] to direct. Kasdan admired Boorman and went to Ireland with the director where they did a treatment for a new movie. \"He completely changed it, but I still loved him,\" said Kasdan.<ref name=\"int\">{{cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/03/lawrence-kasdan-hollywood-interview.html|website=The Hollywood Interview|title=Lawrence Kasdan|date=March 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1978, the film was going ahead with [[Ryan O'Neal]] and [[Diana Ross]].<ref>Will wedding bells toll soon for Dyan?\nSmith, Liz.
