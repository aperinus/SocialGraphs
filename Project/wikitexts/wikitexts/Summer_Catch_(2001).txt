The film marked Tollin's feature film [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The setting is the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]],<ref name=\"lvangeldernyt\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/24/movies/film-in-review-summer-catch.html Van Gelder, Lawrence. \"Film in Review: ''Summer Catch'',\" ''The New York Times'', Friday, August 24, 2001.] Retrieved June 11, 2020</ref> but the majority of the film was shot in [[Southport, North Carolina]].<ref name=\"jleydonvariety\" />\n\n==Plot==\nRyan Dunne is a local baseball player who dreams of playing in the [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]]. He helps his dad with his landscaping business and takes care of Veteran's Field, where his team, the [[Chatham Anglers|Chatham A's]] play.\n\nRyan, in his dedication to making the pros, has sworn off girls and drinking to avoid distractions. This changes when he sees Tenley Parrish, as he and his father are mowing the Parrish family's lawn.\n\nThe next day, the A's have their first game of the season where rival Van Leemer shines pitching a shut-out, while Ryan is told to walk the stands for donations. That evening Ryan and Tenley have their first kiss.\n\nThe next night Ryan is pitching in his first game of the season. The game goes well for the A's until the last inning when he gives up a grand slam, allowing the other team to win the game. He returns home to find his dad drunk and upset about the loss.\n\nLater, Ryan visits Tenley, where he confides about his rocky relationship with his father and concerns about failing as a baseball player. The next night, they take an evening swim in her pool in the rain, falling in love, before being chased off by her dad.\n\nRyan is distracted by Tenley and feels a lot of pressure from scouts, family, the Parrish family, and friends. He is told that he's starting for an upcoming big game, where Ryan starts well, but comes apart later on. The loss causes him to be demoted to the bullpen in a relief position. Despite the bad outing, Hugh Alexander, a scout for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in attendance, shows interest in Ryan.\n\nEric Van Leemer and Dale Robin are kicked off the team not only for their bad behavior, but also for accidentally burning down a press box, so Ryan is designated to start the final game, as he has the freshest arm and the most rest.\n\nTenley tells Ryan that she's leaving for San Francisco for a job the following night, also the night of the final game. She tells him to let himself be great, before tearfully hugging him goodbye.\n\nInspired by Tenley's words of encouragement, Ryan pitches one of the best performances ever seen in the Cape League, dominating the game with a no-hitter. His friends, dad and brother, and several major league scouts, including Alexander, are in attendance. Late in the game, he notices that Tenley has stopped by on her way to the airport to watch him. He proceeds to strike out the current batter, marking his eleventh strike-out of the game, and looks back to see that Tenley has gone.\n\nRyan rushes to the airport where he catches Tenley before she boards her plane. They both profess their love for each other and she agrees to forgo her job in San Francisco and stay. Ryan's dad and brother soon arrive with the scout Alexander, to tell him that his team won the game with a combined no-hitter. Alexander offers Ryan a contract with the Phillies that will start him out at their minor league affiliate, which he happily accepts.\n\n[[mid-credits scene|Later]], everyone is gathered to watch Ryan in his Major League debut as a relief pitcher for the Phillies. He delivers his first pitch to [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], who launches it into the stands for a home run.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Ryan Dunne\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Tenley Parrish\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Sean Dunne\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Billy Brubaker\n* [[Jason Gedrick]] as Mike Dunne\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Dede Mulligan\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Coach John Schiffner\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Auggie Mulligan\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Rand Parrish\n* [[John C.

Other notable cameos in the movie include [[Kevin Youkilis]], [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Carlton Fisk]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film was also not filmed in New England because the spring season was too cold so the actual production site was in [[Southport, North Carolina]]. The Chatham A's baseball field that was used in the film was actually built from a field that had been abandoned for about 20 years. Within about eight weeks the field was complete with batting cages and a press box ready to film. Since the filming of the movie, the field has once again been abandoned and is simply an overgrown field.  The majority of the people cast for the roles of the teammates were actual minor-league baseball players. Only seven of the 35 people cast for the roles of the teammates were actors. The baseball players had to attend a four-week training camp during which they learned how to ignore the cameras on the field and to feel and act more as a team. All of the actors had to practice every day.\n\nPrinze was reportedly paid $2 million for his performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2000/05/01/freddie-prinze-jr-the-artist-known-as-prinze/|title=Freddie Prinze Jr.: The Artist Known as Prinze|first=Movieline|last=Staff|date=1 May 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 8% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10.
