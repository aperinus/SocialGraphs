The role of \"Frankie\" was played by [[Donna Douglas]] from ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' TV series. The film reached #40 on the ''Variety'' weekly national box office list for 1966. The budget of the film was estimated at $4.5 million. The director was [[Frederick De Cordova]], who in 1970 went on to become the director and producer of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nJohnny and girlfriend Frankie are performers on a [[Mississippi River]] riverboat, which also has a casino. Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a [[gypsy]] camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck.\n\nBack on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss.\n\nIn a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in [[New Orleans]], the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same [[Madame Pompadour]] costume.\n\nJohnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie scheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins $10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he discovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a window, into the street.\n\nBlackie, a dim-witted stooge who works for the boss, hears Braden drunkenly complain about how he has lost Nellie. Thinking he can be of help, Blackie switches the blank cartridge in Frankie's stage gun for a real bullet.\n\nThe boss tries to prevent the impending disaster, but arrives on stage too late and Johnny is shot for real. Frankie forgives his gambling as the love of her life appears to be dying, but he stands up, apparently unhurt. Johnny was saved because the bullet struck a lucky medallion he was wearing that Frankie had given him.\n\n==Primary cast==\n*[[Elvis Presley]] as  Johnny\n*[[Donna Douglas]] as  Frankie\n*[[Harry Morgan]] as Cully\n*[[Sue Ane Langdon]] as Mitzi\n*[[Nancy Kovack]] as Nellie Bly\n*[[Audrey Christie]] as Peg\n*[[Anthony Eisley]] as Clint Braden\n*[[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] as Blackie\n*[[Joyce Jameson]] as Abigail\n*[[Naomi Stevens]] as Princess Zolita (uncredited)\n*[[Dave Willock]] as the bartender (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nFilming started in May 1965 and took place in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Looking at Hollywood: 'Harlow' Being Shot as 'Instant Movie'|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=Apr 10, 1965|work=Chicago Tribune|page=a5}}</ref> Under his contract with United Artists, Presley was paid $700,000 plus 50% of the profits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=U.A.
