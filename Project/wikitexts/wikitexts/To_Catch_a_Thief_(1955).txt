When they come to his hilltop villa to question him, he slips their grasp and heads to a restaurant owned by his friend Bertani. The restaurant's staff are members of Robie's old gang, who have been paroled for their work in the [[French Resistance]] during World War II. They are angry at Robie because they are all under suspicion as long as the new Cat is active. When the police arrive at the restaurant looking for Robie, Foussard's daughter spirits him to safety; Danielle is a young woman who fancies him dearly.\n\nRobie realizes he can prove his innocence by catching the new Cat in the act. He enlists the aid of an insurance man, H. H. Hughson, who reluctantly discloses a list of the most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera. American tourists Jessie Stevens, a wealthy nouveau riche widow, and her daughter Frances, top the list. Robie strikes up a friendship with them. Frances feigns modesty at first, but kisses Robie at the end of the night before retiring to her room.\n\nThe day after, Frances invites Robie to a swim at the beach, where Robie runs into Danielle.  He keeps up his cover of being a wealthy American tourist, despite Danielle's jealous barbs about his interest in Frances. Frances accompanies Robie on a \"picnic\" to a villa where Robie suspects the new Cat might break in. Frances reveals that she knows Robie's real identity. He initially denies it, but concedes it that evening when she has invited him to her room to watch a fireworks display. They kiss passionately.\n\nThe next morning, Jessie discovers her jewels are gone. Frances accuses Robie of using her as a distraction so he could steal her mother's jewelry. The police are called, but by the time they reach Jessie's room, Robie has disappeared.\n\nLater, Robie is staking out an estate at night when he is attacked by an unknown assailant. A second attacker raises a wrench and appears to hit Robie, who falls off the estate's seawall into the water. But when the police reach the body in the water, it turns out to be Foussard, one of the staff at Bertani's restaurant.\n\nThe police chief publicly announces that Foussard was the jewel thief, but, as Robie points out privately in the abashed Hughson's presence, this would have been impossible because Foussard had a wooden leg, and could not climb on rooftops.\n\nFoussard's funeral is interrupted by Danielle's loud accusation that Robie is responsible for her father's death. Outside the graveyard, Frances apologizes to Robie and confesses her love. Robie asks Frances to arrange his attendance at a fancy [[masquerade ball]], where he believes the Cat will strike again.\n\nRobie accompanies Frances to the ball dressed as a masked [[Moors|Moor]]. The police hover nearby. Upstairs, the cat burglar silently cleans out several jewel boxes. When Jessie addresses the Moor as \"John\" and asks him to go and get her \"heart pills\", the authorities are tipped off as to his identity. Upon the masked Moor's return, the police wait as he and Frances dance together all night. When the masked Moor and Frances go to her room, the mask is removed: it was Hughson, who switched places with Robie to conceal Robie's exit.\n\nRobie lurks on the rooftop, and his patience is finally rewarded when he spots a figure in black which he sees is Danielle. The police throw a spotlight on him and demand he halt which gives Danielle the chance to slip away from him. He flees as they shoot at him, but he nonetheless manages to corner his foe with jewels in hand. She loses her footing on the roof, but Robie grabs her hand before she falls. While she hangs in his grasp, he forces her to confess to the police and admit that Bertani was the ringleader of this gang.\n\nRobie speeds back to his villa. Frances follows to convince him that she has a place in his life. He agrees but looks less than thrilled when she says, \"Mother will love it up here.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:To Catch a Thief1.jpg|thumb|Kelly as Frances Stevens]]\n* [[Cary Grant]] as John Robie (\"The Cat\")\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Frances Stevens\n* [[Jessie Royce Landis]] as Jessie Stevens\n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as H.

The film was the penultimate collaboration with [[Cary Grant]]; only ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) followed. It is also about a man with a mistaken identity who goes on a breakneck adventure to prove his innocence.\n\nThe costumes were by [[Edith Head]], including Kelly's memorable gold [[lam\u00e9 (fabric)|lam\u00e9]] gown for the film's costume ball.\n\nThe car driven by Grace Kelly was a metallic blue 1953 [[Sunbeam Alpine|Sunbeam Alpine Mk I]].\n\n===Locations===\n''To Catch a Thief'' was filmed largely in the [[Paramount Studios]], Hollywood, California, and on location in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] of southeastern France, on the Mediterranean coast. It included the resorts of [[Cannes]], [[Nice]], [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] and [[Saint-Jeannet, Alpes-Maritimes|Saint-Jeannet]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048728/locations | title = To Catch a Thief: Locations | publisher = [[IMDb]] | access-date = 30 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nCrucial to the film's success in shooting on location was the presence of unit production manager C.O. \"Doc\" Erickson. He had developed a reputation for his work on prior Paramount films that had relied on a great amount of location photography such as ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953) and ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954). Erickson thoroughly researched the logistics of shooting in the South of France and communicated with Bill Mull, the production manager on ''[[Little Boy Lost (1953 film)|Little Boy Lost]]'' (1953).<ref>Steinhart, Daniel.

The others were sold to Hitchcock in the early 1960s and are currently distributed by [[Universal Studios]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film drew mixed reviews from critics, with some enjoying Grant and Kelly in the lead roles as well as the French Riviera setting, while others expressed disappointment at the lack of suspense compared to earlier Hitchcock films.\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a positive review that the film \"comes off completely as a hit in the old Hitchcock style ...
