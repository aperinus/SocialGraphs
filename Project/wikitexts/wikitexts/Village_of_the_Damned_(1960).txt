The film is adapted from the novel ''[[The Midwich Cuckoos]]'' (1957) by [[John Wyndham (writer)|John Wyndham]].<ref name=Goble1999/> The lead role of Professor Gordon Zellaby was played by [[George Sanders]].<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Children of the Damned]]'' (1964), followed, as did a remake, also called ''[[Village of the Damned (1995 film)|Village of the Damned]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"tcmnotes\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe inhabitants of the British village of Midwich suddenly fall unconscious, as does anyone entering the village. The military establishes a cordon around Midwich and sends in a man wearing a gas mask, but he, too, falls unconscious and is pulled back with rope. The man awakens and reports experiencing a cold sensation just before passing out. The pilot of a military reconnaissance plane is contacted and asked to investigate. When he flies below 5,000&nbsp;feet, he loses consciousness and the plane crashes. A five-mile exclusion zone around the village is established for all aircraft. After approximately four hours, the villagers regain [[consciousness]], and all are apparently unaffected.\n\nTwo months later, all women and girls of child-bearing age in the affected area are discovered to be pregnant, sparking many accusations of both [[infidelity]] and [[extramarital sex]]. The accusations fade as the extraordinary nature of the pregnancies is discovered, with seven-month fetuses appearing after only five months. All the women give birth on the same day. Their children have an unusual appearance, including \"arresting\" eyes, odd scalp hair construction and colour (platinum blonde), and unusually narrow fingernails. As the children grow and develop at a rapid rate, it becomes clear they also have a powerful [[Telepathy|telepathic]] bond with one another. They can communicate with each other over great distances, and as one learns something, so do the others.\n\nThree years later, Professor Gordon Zellaby (Sanders), whose wife Anthea (Shelley) gave birth to one of the children, attends a meeting with [[MI5|British Intelligence]] to discuss the children. There he learns Midwich was not the only place affected; follow-up investigations have revealed similar phenomena in other areas of the world.\n\nAt age three, the children are [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]], physically and mentally the equivalent of children four times their age. Their behaviour has become even more unusual and striking. They dress impeccably, always walk as a group, speak in an adult manner, and behave maturely, but they show no [[conscience]] or [[love]], and demonstrate a coldness to others, causing the villagers to fear and be repulsed by them.\n\nThe children begin to exhibit the power to read minds and to force people to do things against their will. There have been a number of villagers' deaths since the children were born, many of which are considered unusual, and some citizens believe the children are responsible. This is confirmed when the children are seen killing a man by making him crash his car into a wall, and again when they force his suspicious brother to shoot himself.\n\nZellaby, whose \"son\" David is one of the children, is at first eager to work with them, trying to teach them while hoping to learn more about them. The children are placed in a separate building where they will learn and live. While the children continue to exert their will, Zellaby is informed that the [[Soviet government]] has fired a [[nuclear artillery|nuclear shell]] and destroyed the Russian village that was the only other location on Earth where mutant children still lived.\n\nZellaby compares the children's resistance to reasoning with a brick wall and uses this motif as self-protection against their [[Telepathy|mind reading]] after the children's inhuman nature becomes clear to him. He takes a hidden time-bomb to a session with the children and tries to block their awareness of the bomb by visualizing a brick wall. David scans his mind, showing an emotion (astonishment) for the first time. The children eventually manage to break down Zellaby's mental wall and discover the truth just a moment before the bomb detonates, consuming the building in flames and killing everyone in the house, including Zellaby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[George Sanders]] as Gordon Zellaby\n* [[Barbara Shelley]] as Anthea Zellaby\n* [[Martin Stephens (actor)|Martin Stephens]] as David Zellaby\n* [[Michael Gwynn]] as Alan Bernard\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Doctor Willers\n* [[Richard Warner (actor)|Richard Warner]] as Mr. Harrington\n* [[Jenny Laird]] as Mrs. Harrington\n* [[Sarah Long]] as Evelyn Harrington\n* [[Thomas Heathcote]] as James Pawle\n* Denis Gilmore as Keith Harrington ''(uncredited)''\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Charlotte Mitchell]] as Janet Pawle\n* Pamela Buck as Milly Hughes\n* [[Rosamund Greenwood]] as Miss Ogle\n* Susan Richards as Mrs. Plumpton\n* [[Bernard Archard]] as Vicar\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as P.C.

[[Stirling Silliphant]] wrote a script and [[Ronald Colman]] was contracted for the leading role, but MGM delayed the project, bowing to pressure from religious groups, including the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]], who objected to the depiction of virgin birth and the plot's blasphemous implications.<ref name=Burman/><ref name=Brode2003/><ref name=Bansak2003/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Starburst_Magazine_004_1978-11_Marvel-UK/page/n17?q=%22village+of+the+damned%22|page=17|magazine=Starbust|date=1978|title=Silliphant's Journey}}</ref> Colman died in May 1958.

Chicago Daily Tribune 27 Nov 1959: b8.</ref>\n\nSix weeks before filming was to begin, the project was passed to television director [[Wolf Rilla]]. He thought the script by Stirling Silliphant \"needed a lot of work to make it realistic. It was written by an American who had not gained a great deal of knowledge concerning English life; it just rang false.\"<ref>Taylor p 16</ref> Rilla was told he had a weekend to make changes so he and [[Ronald Kinnoch]], now the producer, collaborated. \"I still don't think the script was as good as it could have been but there simply wasn't time,\" said Rilla.<ref name=\"Taylor p 17\">Taylor p. 17</ref>\n\nThe film had a shooting schedule of six weeks and a budget of \u00a382,000.<ref name=\"Taylor p 17\"/> Most filming took place at MGM's Borehamwood Studio but it was also shot on location in the village of [[Letchmore Heath]],<ref name=Pykett2008/> near [[Watford]], approximately 12&nbsp;miles (20&nbsp;kilometres) north of London. Local buildings such as The Three Horseshoes Pub and Aldenham School were used during filming.<ref name=\"threehorseshoes\"/>\n\nRilla used a \"very low-key documentary manner. It made, I think, the strange happenings even stranger... the horrors were so much more horrible because they were so much more normal.\"<ref name=\"Taylor p 17\"/> The blonde wigs that the children wore were padded to give the impression that they had abnormally large heads.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe glowing-eye effect, when the children used their mental powers, was achieved by creating animated overlays of a bright white iris; this created a bright glowing iris with a black pupil when optically printed into the film. This technique was used mostly on [[freeze-frame shot]] to create the required effect; the only sequence of live motion processed in this way was the scene in which David tells Alan Bernard to \"leave us alone\" where the eye effect appears as David speaks. The other time David's eyes go from normal to glowing on screen (after one of the girl children is nearly run down by a car), a two shot of the girl and David, is a composite shot split by a slightly jagged black line; the half with the girl is live motion, and you can see her hair moving in the breeze, whereas the half with David is a freeze frame with the eye effect added.<ref>Taylor p 19</ref>\n\nA similar split screen effect is used during the first scene of a boy and girl using their powers to stop their 'brother' stealing a puzzle box; the close ups of the mother holding the boy as his eyes begin to glow and she turns to look at him are achieved as above this time without a black line separating the freeze frames of the boy from the live motion of the mother. The final effect of the children's eyes zooming out of the flames of their burning school house utilized multiple exposures of a model head with glowing eyes which the camera zoomed in on.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFor the original release of the film in Britain, censors removed the glowing eye effects.<ref name=Burman/><ref name=Sumner2010/> UK prints without the glowing eyes effects show that during the final sequence, in the close-ups, the kids widen their eyes as they attack Zellaby's mind, unlike the freeze frames with added glowing eyes used in the American prints. Another example is a slight smile that David makes after setting one of the villagers on fire in the UK print; the freeze frames of the American print do not contain such subtle detail. This print also has a credit for being filmed at MGM's British studios that is not on the American prints.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical release===\nGiven an [[History of British film certificates|'A' certificate]] by the British censors, the film opened in June 1960 at The Ritz cinema in [[Leicester Square]], London. According to director [[Wolf Rilla]], it soon attracted audiences, and cinema goers queued round the block to see it.<ref name=Burman/> In December of the same year it was released New York and Los Angeles;<ref name=TCM/> it became a [[sleeper hit]] for MGM in the US.<ref name=Bansak2003 />\n\n===Home media===\nMGM first released the VHS format on April 27, 1995. The film was also released on [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on August 10, 2004, and on Blu-ray by [[Warner Archive Collection]] on July 21, 2018.\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $1.4 million in the US and Canada and $775,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $860,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe 18 June 1960 edition of ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref name=eofftv/> praised the story as \"most ingenious\" and Rilla as applying \"the right laconic touch.\" Positive reviews also appeared in ''[[The Observer]]'' (by [[C. A. Lejeune|C.A. Lejeune]]): \"The further you have moved away from fantasy, the more you will understand its chill\"; and ''[[The Sunday People|The People]]'' (by Ernest Betts), \"As a horror film with a difference, it'll give you the creeps for 77&nbsp;minutes.\" [[Dilys Powell]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' stated on 20 June 1960: \"Well made British film: the effective timing, the frightening matter-of-factness of the village setting, most of the acting, and especially the acting of the handsome flaxen-haired children (headed by Martin Stevens) who are the cold villains of the piece.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAmerican critics were also in favour of the film. The ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' reviewer called it \"one of the neatest little horror pictures produced since [[Peter Lorre]] went straight\" and questioned the wisdom of MGM's low-profile release strategy. While not willing to call it a horror classic, [[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"as a quietly civilized exercise in the fear and power of the unknown this picture is one of the trimmest, most original and serenely unnerving little chillers in a long time.\"<ref name=NYTReview/> The film received a small but positive mention in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' which called it \"an absorbing little picture that you may yet be able to find on some double-feature bill.\"<ref name=SatReview/> Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \"[an] eerie, well-made chiller.\"<ref name=\"maltin14\"/> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Chilling performances and a restrained, eerie atmosphere make this British horror both an unnerving parable of its era and a timeless classic.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes\">{{cite web|title=Village of the Damned (1960)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1022823-village_of_the_damned/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=28 September 2022|archive-date=6 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006151110/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1022823-village_of_the_damned|url-status=live}}</ref> The climactic scene in which the children break down Zellaby's mental brick wall is #92 on the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] miniseries ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref name=\"Bravo\" />\n\n==Sequel and remake==\nAn MGM-British sequel, ''[[Children of the Damned]]'', directed by Anton M.
