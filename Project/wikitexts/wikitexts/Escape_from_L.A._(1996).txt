Declaring that God is punishing Los Angeles for its sins, a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] presidential candidate wins election to a [[President for life|lifetime term of office]]. He orders the United States capital relocated from [[Washington, D.C.]] to his hometown of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] and enacts a series of strict morality laws. Violators are given a choice between loss of U.S. citizenship and permanent deportation to the new Los Angeles Island, or repentance and [[Electric chair|death by electrocution]]. Escape from the island is made impossible due to a containment wall erected along the mainland shore and a heavy federal police presence monitoring the area.\n\nBy 2013, the U.S. has developed a superweapon known as the \"[[Damocles#Sword of Damocles|Sword of Damocles]],\" a satellite system capable of [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|targeting electronic devices anywhere in the world and rendering them useless]]. The president intends to use it to dominate the world by destroying hostile nations' ability to function. His daughter Utopia steals the remote control for the system and escapes to Los Angeles Island in order to deliver it to Cuervo Jones, a [[Peru]]vian [[Shining Path]] revolutionary. Cuervo has marshaled an invasion force of [[third world]] nations and is planning to attack and reclaim the U.S.\n\nFacing deportation for a series of crimes, [[Snake Plissken]] is offered a chance to earn a pardon by traveling to the island and recovering the remote, a task that a previous rescue team failed to accomplish. To force his compliance, the president has one of his officers infect Snake with a virus that will kill him within 10 hours and promises that he will receive the cure upon completing the mission. The president is not concerned with Utopia's safety, regarding her as a traitor.\n\nSnake is issued equipment and sent to Los Angeles in a one-man submarine. As he explores the island, he meets \"Map to the Stars\" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours and one of Cuervo's associates. Along the way, Snake is helped by Pipeline, a surfing enthusiast; Taslima, a woman deported for her [[Islam|Muslim]] faith; and Hershe Las Palmas (formerly Carjack Malone), a [[Transgender woman|trans woman]] and past criminal associate of Snake's.\n\nEddie captures Snake and turns him over to Cuervo, who uses the Sword of Damocles to shut down Lynchburg in retaliation for Snake's presence. Cuervo threatens to inflict the same fate on the rest of the U.S. unless his demands are met. Snake escapes, and teams up with Hershe and her soldiers. They take gliders to the Anaheim staging area, and fights Cuervo at the invasion staging area, the \"[[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Happy Kingdom]]\" in [[Anaheim]], taking the remote from him. Eddie alters the remote for his tours to match the real one. Snake, Eddie, Utopia, Hershe, and a group of Hershe's soldiers escape the island in a helicopter. Eddie shoots Cuervo, who fires a rocket launcher at them before dying. Eddie jumps out of the helicopter.  Snake and  Utopia  stay on and radios that the are coming in, after the rocket hits the helicopter. \n\nAt the crash site, the president and his officers find that both Snake and Utopia are carrying remotes and take the one held by Utopia (slipped into her pocket without her noticing), thinking that Snake has switched them. As Utopia is taken to the electric chair, Snake learns that the virus infecting him only causes a severe case of [[influenza]] that subsides within hours. The president tries to use Utopia's remote to neutralize an invasion force threatening [[Florida]], but it only plays a recorded introduction to one of Eddie's tours.\n\nFurious, the president orders his officers to kill Snake on the spot, but he proves to be only a hologram projected from a miniature camera that had been issued to him. Disgusted at the world's never-ending class warfare, he programs the real remote and triggers every satellite in the Sword of Damocles system, deactivating all technology on Earth. Utopia is saved when the power fails just before she can be electrocuted. Snake tosses the now-useless camera aside and lights a cigarette, then blows out the match and mutters, \"Welcome to the human race.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken|Lieutenant S.D.

him.\" While contrasting the film's then-futuristic plot elements against modern-day reality, Zilberman writes that the film's ending is more profound today, as Plissken would be annoyed by our fascination with technology, citing the example of two friends who ignore each other while transfixed with their smart phones.<ref>{{cite

Carpenter later reflected:\n<blockquote>''Escape from L.A.'' is better than the first movie. Ten times better. It's got more to it. It's more mature. It's got a lot more to it. I think some people didn't like it because they felt it was a remake, not a sequel... I suppose it's the old question of whether you like ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' or ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' better? They're essentially the same movie. They both had their strengths and weaknesses. I don't know\u2013you never know why a movie's going to make it or not. People didn't want to see ''Escape'' that time, but they really didn't want to see ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''... You just wait. You've got to give me a little while. People will say, you know, what was wrong with me?<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/its-always-the-story-the-craft-of-carpenter/|title=\"It's Always the Story\" - The Craft of Carpenter|website=creativescreenwriting.com|access-date=2015-12-25|archive-date=2015-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226072257/http://creativescreenwriting.com/its-always-the-story-the-craft-of-carpenter/|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe reiterated his statement in another interview: \"It is a better movie. It didn\u2019t do what the first one did for some reason. Maybe it was too dark, too nihilistic. I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t dig it as much as the first one. It did okay, but it just wasn\u2019t a hit.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.flashbackfiles.com/john-carpenter-interview |title=John Carpenter interview |access-date=2020-12-14 |archive-date=2021-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523184233/https://www.flashbackfiles.com/john-carpenter-interview |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAbout the cult following, Carpenter said: \u201cI\u2019m just delighted that it\u2019s gaining that popularity. I really dig Escape from L.A., and I always have.\u201c<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/>\n\n==Other media==\n===Escape from Earth===\nA sequel of the movie called Escape from Earth was meant to be produced after L.A. but the underperformance of the latter changed the plans. According to John Carpenter, Escape from Earth would have picked up with Snake Plissken right after the ending of Escape from L.A., which saw him activating a superweapon known as the \u201cSword of Damocles: \u201cEscape from Earth was kind of Snake Plissken in a space capsule, flying interstellar. So there\u2019d be a lot of special effects in it. Which I never care about too much. But that\u2019s what it would look like.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url=https://movieweb.com/john-carpenter-discusses-escape-from-new-york-threequel/ | title=John Carpenter Discusses Escape from New York Threequel, Backs Wyatt Russell as Snake Plissken | date=22 February 2022 }}</ref>\n\n===Comic books===\n[[Marvel Comics]] released the one-shot ''The Adventures of Snake Plissken'' in January 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicbookrealm.com/series/66/0/The+Adventures+of+Snake+Plissken |title=The Adventures of Snake Plissken #1 (Marvel) |publisher=Comicbookrealm.com |access-date=2010-06-30 |archive-date=2011-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708181027/http://comicbookrealm.com/series/66/0/The+Adventures+of+Snake+Plissken |url-status=live }}</ref> The story takes place sometime between ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.''. Snake has robbed Atlanta's [[Centers for Disease Control]] of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that's really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is Snake. After a brief battle, ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Snake punches the machine and destroys it, reasoning, \"I don't need the competition.\"\n\n===Cancelled video game===\nAn ''Escape from L.A.''
