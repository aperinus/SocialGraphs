He is attempting to get his environmentally friendly cleaning product, ScieoClean, in a major retail store. However, everywhere he visits dismisses him before he can end his pitch. \n\nAfter a disappointing sales pitch to [[Kmart (United States)|K-Mart]], he visits his mother, Joyce Brewster, in [[New Jersey]] before leaving on a cross-country trip to [[Las Vegas]], lying that his pitch went well so she won't worry. \n\nWhile there she reveals that he was named after Andrew Margolis, a boy she fell in love with in Florida, who she hoped would object to her marriage with Andy's father. However, he didn't and she felt she'd never mattered to him afterwards. After a little research, he finds Andrew Margolis is alive, unmarried and living in [[San Francisco]]. He invites his unknowing mother on the trip, saying he wants to spend some time with her.\n\nThe road trip quickly becomes hard for Andy as his mother meddles in his life. After their car breaks down in [[Tennessee]], Joyce calls Andy's ex-girlfriend Jessica, whom she insists he should get back together with, to pick them up. At a pregnant and married Jessica's house she reveals that Andy proposed to her before college and she turned him down, shocking an unknowing Joyce. \n\nAndy is glum afterward and Joyce apologizes for calling Jessica, which he half-heartedly accepts. In [[Texas]], he meets with [[Costco]] executive Ryan McFeer; however, Joyce stays at the meeting, criticizing the product's labeling and name along with Ryan until Andy snaps at him. At the motel that night, a depressed Andy begins drinking and Joyce attempts to make up with him; however, Andy snaps at her, only to have Joyce snap back and leave for a nearby bar. Later Andy attempts to retrieve his mother but gets in a fight with a bar patron over her, receiving a black eye in the process.\n\nAt a steak restaurant the next day, the two exchange apologies and Andy reveals that he is failing at selling ScieoClean. Joyce enters a steak-eating challenge where she is noticed by cowboy-businessman Ben Graw, who gives her tips to help her finish the challenge. Afterwards he reveals he does business in New Jersey and asks her to dinner. Joyce, who has not been in a relationship since Andy's dad died when he was eight, balks at the offer so Ben merely leaves his number and asks her to call if she reconsiders.\n\nAndy and Joyce begin to genuinely enjoy each other's company after, taking time to visit the [[Grand Canyon]] (which Joyce has always wanted to see) and having many other adventures.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Joyce has such a good time that she suggests Andy leave her while he visits San Francisco, forcing him to reveal that San Francisco is so she can meet Andrew Margolis. Joyce is very distraught as she believed Andy solely invited her to spend time with her. \n\nAndy makes his pitch at the [[Home Shopping Network]] but finds that his science-fact based pitch bores the executives. Seeing Joyce, he takes her advice by appealing to the Network's host family's safety. Andy drinks his product, proving that it is organic and safe for children. Afterwards the Network CEO approaches him and shows genuine interest in selling ScieoClean on the Network. Later, a jubilant Andy and Joyce decide to visit Andrew Margolis's house.\n\nHowever, when they arrive they see it's Andrew's son, Andrew Margolis Jr. (whom Andy mistakenly found instead of the father), that his father died five years ago. Seeing Joyce's grief he invites them inside, where he learns that his father and Joyce were close. She asks if Andrew's father ever mentioned her, but he says he never did as he only confided personal information to their mother, who is in Florida. However, he then introduces his sister, who is also named Joyce. Joyce is overjoyed, as she believes that you name your children after someone you cherished and want to remember. This shatters her belief that she didn't matter to Andrew.\n\nAfterwards they part ways at the [[San Francisco Airport]]; Andy to make his next sales pitch and Joyce back to New Jersey, where she arranges a date with Ben Graw. The two leave content and much closer than they had been.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Joyce Brewster\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Andrew \"Andy\" Brewster\n* [[Brett Cullen]] as Benjamin Graw\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Andrew Margolis, Jr.\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as Joyce Margolis\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as Amanda Darlingson\n* [[Colin Hanks]] as Rob O'Farrell\n* [[Yvonne Strahovski]] as Jessica\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as Jimmy\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Anita\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Gayle\n* [[Dale Dickey]] as Tammy\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Amy\n* [[Brandon Keener]] as Ryan McFee\n* [[Danny Pudi]] as Sanjay\n* [[Rick Gonzalez]] as Mark\n* [[Zabryna Guevara]] as K-Mart Executive\n* [[Robert Curtis Brown]] as K-Mart Executive\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Mature Singles Man\n* [[Steve Tom]] as OSH Executive\n* [[Creed Bratton]] as Suitor\n* [[Michael Cassidy (actor)|Michael Cassidy]] as Fake Andy\n* [[Eddie Shin]] as Chris Chung\n* [[Amanda Walsh]] as Lisa\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"I've met her only a couple of times so far but she's really funny and nice and really reminds me a lot of my actual mother, which is very odd; my girlfriend's like a huge Barbra Streisand fan.\"\n| source = \u2014 Seth Rogen on Barbra Streisand.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ayres | first= Tom | date = March 20, 2011 | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a310015/seth-rogen-streisand-reminds-me-of-mum.html | title = Seth Rogen: 'Streisand reminds me of mum' | publisher = DigitalSpy.com.uk}}</ref>\n| width = 35%\n| align = right\n}}\nThe film is based on a real-life trip by screenwriter Fogelman and his mother from [[New Jersey]] to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] years before.<ref name=\"jewishjournal-july2011\">{{cite news | url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywood/article/dan_fogelman_explores_romances_range_in_crazy_stupid_love_20110726/ | date = July 26, 2011 | title = First crush to midlife dating | work = [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]] | first =  Naomi | last = Pfefferman | access-date = December 14, 2012}}</ref> The film completed production in late spring or early summer (May\u2013July) 2011 under the working title ''My Mother's Curse''.<ref name=\"jewishjournal-july2011\" /> In late 2011, the film was renamed ''The Guilt Trip''.<ref name=\"firststage\">{{cite web|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/the-guilt-trip-moves-up-a-week-ride-along-to-arrive-2014-mlk-weekend/|title='Zero Dark Thirty' Confirmed For Platform Release, 'The Guilt Trip' Moves Up & 'Ride Along' Grabs 2014 Date|work=The Film Stage|first=Jonathan|last=Sullivan|date=2012-10-31|access-date=2012-10-31}}</ref> It was released December 19, 2012.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\nThis film marks Streisand's first starring role since ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barbra Streisand: 'My dog is like the daughter I never had...she speaks English' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/barbra-streisand-my-dog-is-like-the-daughter-i-never-hadshe-speaks-english-8513664.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/barbra-streisand-my-dog-is-like-the-daughter-i-never-hadshe-speaks-english-8513664.html |archive-date=2022-06-18 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Independent |date=27 February 2013 |access-date=Feb 28, 2013 |location=London |first=Gill |last=Pringle}}</ref> She appeared in supporting roles in ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Little Fockers]]'' in 2010, as well as in a number of television series.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Guilt Trip'' grossed $5.3 million in its opening weekend, coming in at No. 6.
