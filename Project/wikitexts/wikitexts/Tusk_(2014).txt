The film stars [[Michael Parks]], [[Lily-Rose Depp]], [[Justin Long]], [[Haley Joel Osment]], and [[Genesis Rodriguez]]. The film is the first in Smith's planned [[True North trilogy|''True North'' trilogy]], followed by ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"Pajiba\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/is-kevin-smiths-boxoffice-disaster-tusk-the-end-of-his-filmmaking-career-or-a-muchneeded-wakeup-call.php|title=Is Kevin Smith's Box-Office Disaster, 'Tusk,' the End of His Filmmaking Career or a Much-Needed Wake-Up Call?|work=Pajiba|date=September 21, 2014 |access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"BKit\" />\n\nThe film deals with an arrogant podcaster (Long) who travels to [[Canada]] for an interview, and in the process meets an eccentric retired sailor (Parks) with dark plans related to his obsession with a walrus named Mr. Tusk.\n\n''Tusk'' had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], before it was released on September 19, 2014, by [[A24]] and it received mixed reviews, with praise given to its atmosphere and production values but criticism for its inconsistent tone. The film was Smith's first major wide release since ''[[Cop Out (2010 film)|Cop Out]]'' (2010). However, some sources note that the divide amongst viewers and critics lends to a sort of cult status among some circles online.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/kevin-smith-tusk-2-movie-sequel-good-idea-reason/ |website=Screen rant|title=Kevin Smith's Tusk 2: Why the Director's Idea is the Sequel We Need |date=August 18, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/534091/kevin-smith-clerks-3-news/ |website=Slashfilm|title=Thanks to 'Tusk', Kevin Smith Has Funding for 'Clerks III' |date=September 29, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Wallace Bryton and Teddy Craft host a [[podcast]] called ''The Not-See Party'' in which they interview eccentric people. Wallace flies to [[Canada]] to interview an [[internet celebrity]] known as the ''[[Kill Bill]]'' Kid, who has gone viral for a video in which he accidentally severed his leg with a [[katana]]. Upon arriving in [[Manitoba]], he learns that the ''Kill Bill'' Kid has committed suicide. Determined to make the most of his trip, Wallace tries to find another person to interview. He finds a flyer from someone offering a room in his home for free and the guarantee of hearing interesting stories. Intrigued, he arrives at the mansion of Howard Howe, a retired seaman in a wheelchair.\n\nHoward tells the story of how a [[walrus]], whom he named \"Mr. Tusk\", rescued him after a shipwreck. Wallace passes out from the [[secobarbital]] laced in the tea Howard made for him. The next morning, Wallace wakes up to find himself strapped into a wheelchair and his left leg amputated. Howard reveals that he can still walk and lays out his plans; he plans to fit Wallace into a perfectly constructed walrus costume in an attempt to re-create Mr. Tusk. Ally and Teddy are engaged in affair, each ignoring their phones when Wallace calls them. After leaving voicemails for the pair, Wallace is knocked unconscious by Howard.\n\nNow aware that Wallace is in danger, Ally and Teddy fly to Canada. Back at the mansion, Howard continues to mutilate and alter Wallace, to whom he tells his backstory: a [[Duplessis Orphans|Duplessis orphan]] due to his parents' murder, he was physically and sexually abused for five years by the clergy who fostered him, leaving him with severe [[misanthropy]]. He attaches Wallace to a walrus costume made of human skin, complete with tusks made from Wallace\u2019s severed [[tibia bones]]. A local detective puts Ally and Teddy in touch with Guy LaPointe, a former [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]] inspector who has been hunting Howard for years. LaPointe explains that Howard, nicknamed \"the First Wife\", has been kidnapping and murdering people for years; he believes Wallace may still be alive, but not as they remember him.\n\nHoward [[classical conditioning|conditions]] Wallace to think and act like a walrus. Howard reveals that, shortly before being rescued, he had killed and eaten Mr. Tusk to survive. Overcome with guilt, he has spent the last 15 years turning his victims into his beloved savior in an attempt to relive their last day and give Mr. Tusk another chance at survival. With Howard dressed in his homemade pelt, the two engage in a fight that ends when Wallace impales Howard on his tusks. Howard dies satisfied to have fulfilled his life's mission at last. LaPointe, Ally, and Teddy enter the enclave as Wallace bellows victoriously. LaPointe aims a gun at him, much to Ally\u2019s horror.\n\nOne year later, Wallace, still living as a walrus, lives in a wildlife sanctuary. Ally and Teddy visit him and feed him a mackerel. In a flashback, Ally tells Wallace that her grandfather once told her that crying is what separates humans from animals. Ally tearfully tells Wallace she still loves him before leaving. Wallace cries as he bellows, implying that he has retained some of his humanity.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, LaPointe scolds himself for overeating when he met Teddy and Ally.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Parks]] as Howard Howe\n** Matthew Shively as Young Howard Howe \n* [[Justin Long]] as Wallace Bryton\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Ally Leon\n* [[Haley Joel Osment]] as Teddy Craft\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Guy LaPointe\n\nAdditional cast members include [[Harley Morenstein]] as a border agent and [[Ralph Garman]] as a detective. Smith and Depp's daughters [[Harley Quinn Smith]] and [[Lily-Rose Depp]] portray teenage convenience store clerks, who would later be featured as the leads of ''[[Yoga Hosers]]''. [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith]], Smith's wife, also makes an appearance as a waitress at Gimli Slider. [[Doug Banks]] plays the ''[[Kill Bill]]'' Kid, a parody of the ''[[Star Wars Kid]]'' viral video. [[Zak Knutson]] has an uncredited appearance as [[Ernest Hemingway]].\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film came during the recording of \"[[SModcast]] 259: The Walrus and The Carpenter\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter/|title=The Walrus and The Carpenter|publisher=[[SModcast]]|date=June 25, 2013|access-date=July 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701170309/http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter/|archive-date=July 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the episode, Smith with his longtime friend and producer [[Scott Mosier]] discussed an article featuring a [[Gumtree]] ad where a homeowner was offering a living situation free of charge, if the lodger agrees to dress as a walrus. The discussion went on from there, resulting in almost an hour of the episode being spent on reconstructing and telling a hypothetical story based on the ad. Smith then told his Twitter followers to tweet \"#WalrusYes\" if they wanted to see their hypothetical turned into a film, or \"#WalrusNo\" if they did not.
