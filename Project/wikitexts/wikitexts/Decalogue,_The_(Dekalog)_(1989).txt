Filmmaker [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]] was interested in the philosophical challenge, and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself. He used a different [[cinematographer]] for each episode except III and IX, in both of which [[Piotr Soboci\u0144ski]] was director of photography.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Behind the Camera: Poland's Best Cinematographers|url=http://www.facets.org/decalogue/cinematographers.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725120727/http://www.facets.org/decalogue/cinematographers.html|archive-date=25 July 2010|access-date=6 June 2017|website=[[Facets Multi-Media|Facets]]}}</ref>\n\nThe large cast includes both famous and unknown actors, many of whom Kie\u015blowski also used in his other films.
