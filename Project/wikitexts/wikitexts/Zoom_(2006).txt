Based upon the children's book ''Amazing Adventures from Zoom's Academy'' by Jason Lethcoe,<ref>Ballantine Books, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-345-48355-3}}</ref> the film stars [[Tim Allen]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Spencer Breslin]], and [[Rip Torn]]. A former superhero is dragged into training four superpowered youths to become superheroes and combat an approaching threat.\n\nReleased theatrically on August 11, 2006 by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was panned by critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], earning $12.5 million on a $75 million budget. ''Zoom'' was nominated for one [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]], [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for Tim Allen (also nominated for ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]'' and ''[[The Shaggy Dog (2006 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]''), but he lost to the Wayans brothers [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]] and [[Shawn Wayans]] for ''[[Little Man (2006 film)|Little Man]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the opening credits, a series of comic book panels recounts the adventures of Team Zenith, five young superheroes led by Jack Shepard (\"Captain Zoom\") and his older brother Connor Shepard (\"Concussion\"), who fought to protect the world from various threats. The American military sought to enhance the team's powers using an experimental form of radiation called \"Gamma-13\". This made Zoom faster and stronger but created a [[Psychosis|psychotic break]] in Concussion who becomes paranoid and delusional. Thinking Zoom and the team betrayed him, Concussion killed his teammates Marksman, Ace, and Daravia. Zoom defeated Concussion but lost his powers in the process.\n\n30 years later, Dr. Ed Grant, the scientist behind the original Zenith Project, discovers that Concussion is still alive. Zoom's actions propelled Concussion to a [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimensional rift]] who is now on a return trajectory. General Larraby, the military officer in charge of the Project, decides to form a new Zenith Team to fight him. Jack finds himself dragged back into the Project, this time as an instructor. Larraby gives Jack the choice of a lengthy prison sentence should he refuse or a payment of $500,000 for training the team. Jack reluctantly agrees to help. In their secret base Area 52 (a reference to [[Area 51]]), he meets Marsha Holloway, who is a beautiful but clumsy psychologist, a big fan of Zoom's, and knows of him only through the comic book adaptations of the team's adventures.\n\nThe project holds an audition of would-be members, and four are selected: Dylan West, a 17-year-old boy possessing invisibility, Summer Jones, a 16-year-old girl with telekinetic powers and empathic senses, Tucker Williams, a 12-year-old overweight boy who can enlarge and inflate his body parts himself at will, and Cindy Collins, a 6-year-old girl with super strength. At first, things do not go well, with Jack being bitter about the past, and his sarcastic attitude disappoints Marsha. Dylan keeps trying to escape, Tucker has self-esteem problems and trouble controlling his powers, and the kids are annoyed by Jack's attitude. The team eventually forces Jack to face the fact that he's not really putting his heart into their training. Slowly things begin to come together as the new team's abilities improve, and they adopt superhero identities: Cindy calls herself \"Princess,\" Tucker becomes \"Mega Boy,\" Dylan chooses \"Houdini\" and Summer takes the name \"Wonder\".\n\nOnly hours before Concussion is set to arrive on Earth, Dylan discovers a new ability, [[clairsentience|\"mindsight\"]], a rare power that allows him to discover where Concussion will arrive. In his vision, he also discovers the project's true purpose: The military is seeking to test new weaponry to subdue Concussion and will use the new Zenith team as a distraction; worse, the military does not believe the new team has sufficient power to hold him at bay and plans to bombard the children with Gamma-13. Zoom is horrified by the revelation and recruits Marsha to help him rescue the kids before they are bombarded with Gamma-13; during their escape, Marsha also reveals that she secretly possesses a form of rainbow-colored super breath. They make it to Concussion's arrival point and Jack opts to confront him powerless and alone, but the kids refuse to abandon him.\n\nWhen Concussion arrives, Larraby test fires a neutralizing net to trap Concussion, who easily blasts it away towards Cindy. Fearing for her safety, Zoom's powers return and he pulls her out of the way. Working together, Zoom recreates the original vortex using speed and his Gamma-13 energy, while the team and Marsha guide Concussion into it. Just before they send him back through, Dr. Grant yells to Zoom that if he closes the vortex, they can save Concussion. Zoom closes the vortex and the subsequent energy vacuum pulls the Gamma-13 from Connor which both restores his powers to normal and cures his psychosis. Zoom and Concussion are reunited.\n\nThree months later, Cindy is in a school play of ''[[Rapunzel]]'', using her strength to pull the \"prince\" up the tower when he can't make the climb. Tucker is the goalie on the soccer team. Dylan is dating Summer who is on the cheerleading team, using her telekinetic power to help build an upside-down pyramid. In addition, they still work together with Zoom as the new Zenith Team.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Jack Shepard/Captain Zoom, an ex-superhero with superhuman speed.\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as Dr. Marsha Holloway, a psychologist on the Zenith Project who blows rainbow-colored blasts of wind.\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Dr. Ed Grant, a scientist on the Zenith Project.\n* [[Spencer Breslin]] as Tucker Williams/Mega Boy, a overweight boy who can enlarge and inflate his body parts at will.\n* [[Rip Torn]] as General Larraby, the head of the Zenith Project.\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Summer Jones/Wonder, a teenager who possesses telekinesis and empathic senses.\n* [[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] as Cindy Collins/Princess, a little girl with superhuman strength.\n* [[Michael Cassidy (actor)|Michael Cassidy]] as Dylan West/Houdini, a teenager with invisibility and clairsentience.\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Connor Shepard/Concussion, Jack's older brother with concussive blasts who went insane upon being exposed to Gamma-13.\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] (uncredited) as Ace, a former member of Zoom's team.\n* [[Devon Aoki]] as Daravia, a former member of Zoom's team.\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Marksman, a former member of Zoom's team who also possessed clairsentience.\n* [[Cornelia Guest]] as Cindy's mother\n* [[Ridge Canipe]] and [[Danny McCarthy]] as Bullies\n* [[Thomas F.
