It is the fourth film in Smith's [[View Askewniverse]] series. [[Brian O'Halloran]] and [[Jeff Anderson]], stars of the first Askewniverse film ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'', appear in the film, as do Smith regulars [[Scott Mosier]], [[Dwight Ewell]], [[Walt Flanagan]], and [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]].\n\nThe story revolves around two [[fallen angel]]s who plan to employ an alleged loophole in [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]] to return to Heaven after being cast out by [[God]], but as existence is founded on the principle that God is [[infallible]], their success would prove God wrong, thus undoing all creation. The [[Desposyni|last scion]] and two prophets are sent by the [[seraph]] [[Metatron]] to stop them.\n\nThe film's irreverent treatment of [[Catholicism]] and the [[Catholic Church]] triggered considerable controversy, even before its opening. The [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] denounced it as [[blasphemy]]. Organized protests delayed its release in many countries and led to at least two death threats against Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A82630 |title=Mr. Smith Goes to Austin |author=Jones, Kimberley |work=Austin Chronicle |date=August 10, 2001 |access-date=2009-06-18}}</ref><ref name=\"Andy Seiler\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-08-24-kevin-smith.htm |title=Kevin Smith is seldom 'Silent' |author=Seiler, Andy |work=USA Today |date=October 24, 2001 |access-date=2010-07-19}}</ref> Despite this, ''Dogma'' was well received by critics, and grossed $44 million against its $10 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film in the View Askewniverse series to date.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Word count should not exceed 700. -->\n[[List of minor View Askewniverse characters#Bartleby and Loki|Bartleby]] and [[List of minor View Askewniverse characters#Bartleby and Loki|Loki]] are [[fallen angel]]s, eternally banished from Heaven to [[Wisconsin]] for insubordination, after an inebriated Loki resigned as the Angel of Death at Bartleby's suggestion. In a newspaper article that arrives anonymously, the angels discover a way home: Cardinal Ignatius Glick is rededicating his church in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]], in the image of the \"[[Buddy Christ]]\". Anyone who enters the church during the rededication festivities will receive a [[plenary indulgence]], remitting all sins. Were the banished angels to undergo this rite\u2014and then die after transmuting into human form\u2014God would have no choice but to allow them re-entry into Heaven. They are encouraged by the demon [[Azrael]] and the [[Styx|Stygian]] triplets, three teenage hoodlums who serve Azrael in hell.\n\n[[Bethany Sloane]], a despondent [[abortion clinic]] counselor, attends a service at her church in [[McHenry, Illinois]]. Donations are solicited for a campaign to stop a New Jersey hospital from disconnecting life support on John Doe Jersey, a homeless man who was beaten into a coma by the triplets. Metatron\u2014a [[seraph]], and the voice of God\u2014appears to Bethany in a pillar of fire and explains that if Bartleby and Loki succeed in re-entering Heaven, they will overrule the word of God, disprove the fundamental concept of God's [[omnipotence]], and nullify all of existence. Bethany, aided by two prophets, must stop the angels and save the universe.\n\nNow a target, Bethany is attacked by the triplets, who are driven off by the two foretold prophets, drug-dealing stoners [[Jay and Silent Bob]]. Bethany and the prophets are joined by Rufus, the 13th [[Twelve apostles|apostle]], and Serendipity, the Muse of creative inspiration, now working in a strip club in search of inspiration of her own. Azrael summons the Golgothan, a vile creature made of human excrement, but Bob immobilizes it with aerosol air freshener.\n\nOn a train to New Jersey, a drunken Bethany reveals her mission to Bartleby, who tries to kill her; Bob throws the angels off the train. Bartleby and Loki now realize the consequences of their scheme; Loki wants no part of destroying all existence, but Bartleby remains angry at God for his expulsion, and for granting free will to humans while demanding servitude from angels, and resolves to proceed.\n\nIn New Jersey, Bethany asks why she has been called upon to save the universe; why can't God simply do it himself? Metatron admits that God's whereabouts are unknown; he disappeared while visiting New Jersey in human form to play [[skee ball]]. The task falls to Bethany because\u2014she now learns\u2014she is the [[Brothers of Jesus|last scion]], a distant but direct blood relative of [[Jesus]].\n\nThe group cannot persuade Glick to cancel the celebration. Jay steals one of Glick's golf clubs. Their only remaining option is to keep the angels out of the church, but Azrael and the triplets trap them in a bar to prevent them from doing so. Azrael reveals that he sent the news clipping to the angels; he would rather end all existence than spend eternity in Hell. Bob kills Azrael with the golf club, which Glick had blessed to improve his game. Bethany blesses the bar sink's contents, and the others drown the triplets in the [[holy water]]. They race to the church, where Bartleby has killed Glick, his parishioners, and assorted bystanders. When Loki (who is now wingless and therefore mortal, with a conscience) attempts to stop him, Bartleby kills him as well.\n\nAll appears lost; Jay attempts to seduce Bethany before all existence ends. When he mentions John Doe Jersey, Bethany finally puts all the clues together. She and Bob race across the street to the hospital, as the others try to keep Bartleby from entering the church. But in doing so, Jay destroys his wings with automatic gunfire, making him mortal as well. Bethany disconnects John's life support, liberating God, but killing herself. Bartleby reaches the church entrance where he confronts God, manifested in female form, who annihilates him with her voice. Bob arrives with Bethany's lifeless body; God resurrects her and conceives a child\u2014the new last scion\u2014within her womb. God, Metatron, Rufus, and Serendipity return to Heaven, leaving Bethany and the prophets to reflect on the past, and the future.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.

The Story of Dogma'', which details the history and genesis of how ''Dogma'' came to be. His essay is available on the ''Dogma'' 2-disc Special Edition DVD.\n\nBefore Smith began writing ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'', he began noting down ideas for a film called ''God''. During his brief period in film school, he essentially wrote the scene introducing Rufus, but this version did not feature Jay and Silent Bob. During the development of ''Clerks'', Smith continued to jot down ideas for his ''God'' project, including having the main character be a high school jock, the conception of 13th Apostle, Rufus, and a muse named Serendipity; but, Smith didn't have a story to work off of.\n\nBy the time ''Clerks'' had been picked up for distribution, Smith began writing the first draft for the film. He felt calling the project ''God'' was inappropriate, and retitled it ''Dogma''. The first draft was completed in August 1994, with 148 pages accomplished, and more additions; the high school protagonist was changed to a stripper named Bethany who meets Jay and Silent Bob at a nudie booth, Azrael (or known throughout the script as the \"Shadowy Figure\") was introduced in the final 30 pages, and Bethany blew up the church in order to not let Bartleby and Loki pass through the archway. After Smith and ''Clerks'' producer [[Scott Mosier]] reread the draft, they decided that they didn't want ''Dogma'' to be their sophomore film; they didn't want to tackle a bigger scale picture until they felt ready to do it. Despite including the line \"Jay and Silent Bob will return in ''Dogma''\" at the end of ''Clerks'', Smith moved to [[Universal Studios]] in order to develop his next film, ''[[Mallrats]]''.\n\nDuring ''Mallrats{{'}}'' production, Smith revisited the ''Dogma'' script and made some changes; Bethany's job went from stripper to an abortion clinic and included an [[orangutan]] for Jay and Silent Bob to hang out with. In 1996, he dropped the orangutan and reworked Bethany to be played by his then-girlfriend [[Joey Lauren Adams]]. During that time, he was writing ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' and got [[Ben Affleck]] to agree to be in both projects. After ''Chasing Amy'' was released to critical and box-office success, Smith felt confident enough to make ''Dogma''.<ref name=\"Beginning\">{{cite news|title=''In the Beginning... The Story of Dogma''|author=Kevin Smith|date=October 25, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nSmith and  Mosier assembled a group of visual artists to realize their concept of a surreal, abstract environment \"somewhere between reality and unreality\": production designer Robert Holtzman, special effects supervisor Charles Belardinelli, creature effects supervisor Vincent Guastini, costume designer Abigail Murray, and director of photography [[Robert Yeoman]].<ref name = \"movie.com\"/>\n\n===Locations===\n\nPrincipal filming took place from April to June 1998. The triplets' attack on John Doe Jersey was filmed on the [[boardwalk]] in [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]]; all other scenes were shot in and around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The Mexican restaurant in which Metatron explains Bethany's mission was the Franklin Inn in [[Franklin Park, Pennsylvania|Franklin Park]], north of Pittsburgh. Serendipity's pole dance and the Golgothan confrontation took place at the Park View Cafe (since renamed Crazy Mocha) on East North Avenue in Pittsburgh.  The heroes plan their final strategy in the Grand Concourse Restaurant in the restored [[Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Station]].  St Michael's Church, site of the apocalyptic climax, is the [[Saints Peter and Paul Church (Pittsburgh)|Saints Peter and Paul Church]]\u2014currently vacant\u2014in [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dogma film locations |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/Dogma.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302145756/http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/Dogma.html |archive-date=March 2, 2013 |access-date=January 12, 2017 |website=movie-locations.com}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] was initially attached to play Loki. When that role went to [[Matt Damon]], due to his onscreen chemistry with Affleck in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', Lee received the Azrael role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[Mumford (film)|Mumford]]''. Smith envisioned [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as Rufus, but was convinced to hire [[Chris Rock]] after meeting him.  [[Alan Rickman]] was recruited to play Metatron.<ref name=\"Beginning\" /> [[Albert Brooks]] was offered the role of Cardinal Glick, but turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 June 2011 |title=The Lost Roles of Albert Brooks |url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-albert-brooks.html |website=Vulture}}</ref>\n\nCritics expressed surprise at the film's eclectic casting, which Smith said was done deliberately to emphasize contrasts between characters \u2014 Rickman as the powerful Metatron, for example, opposite Mewes as the hopelessly verbose stoner Jay, \"...{{nbsp}}a Shakespearean trained actor of the highest order next to a dude from New Jersey.\" Smith warned Mewes that he would have to take his acting to a higher level. \"I really impressed upon him that he had to be prepared for this movie.

The battle was to end with the triplet killing Bethany (temporarily), and God, newly liberated, transforming the Golgothan into flowers. Test audiences felt the scene had \"too much Golgothan\", and the film's run time already exceeded two hours, so the scene was eliminated.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Scenes That Never Were |url=http://www.dogma-movie.com/pics/hospital/hospitalnf.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.today/2012.07.28-120545/http://www.dogma-movie.com/pics/hospital/hospitalnf.html |archive-date=2012-07-28 |access-date=2009-06-18 |website=Dogma (official site)}}</ref>\n\nOne scene that gained infamy among Kevin Smith's fanbase was known as the \"''Fat Albert'' sequence.\" When Bethany and Rufus find Jay & Silent Bob in the strip club, a gang in the club (led by [[Dwight Ewell]]) grows jealous that the stripper is paying more attention to Jay & Silent Bob than them. The gang confronts Jay & Silent Bob, and, thanks to Jay's insults, the gang draws guns on Jay & Silent Bob. Jay & Silent Bob then defuse the situation by taking to the stage and performing the theme song from ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids|Fat Albert]].'' This whole incident makes Rufus realize that the stripper is the muse Serendipity, and she actually deescalated things by giving Jay & Silent Bob the idea. The scene was in the film when it screened at [[1999 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], but was removed from the film when it was released to theaters. The scene gained infamy as fans began speculating on Smith's View Askew message boards as to why it was removed. According to Smith on the ''Dogma: Special Edition'' DVD, he removed the scene because the feedback he received was that it ran on too long, and was not very funny.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Kevin Smith | date = 2001 | title = Dogma: Special Edition Deleted Scenes Introduction | type = DVD | publisher = Columbia TriStar Home Video}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThis film was originally scheduled for a November 1998 release, and to be released by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], but due to controversy,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/37986/miramax-disney-dogged-by-dogma|title=Miramax, Disney Dogged by \"Dogma\"|work=E!

I mean, the worst [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attack on American soil was religiously bent. In the wake of said attack, the leader of the \"Free World\" outed himself as pretty damned Christian. In the [[2004 United States presidential election|last election]], rather than [[Iraq War|a quagmire war abroad]], the big issue was whether or not [[gay marriage]] was moral. Back when I made ''Dogma'', I always maintained that another movie about religion wouldn't be forthcoming, as ''Dogma'' was the product of 28 years of religious and spiritual meditation, and I'd kinda shot my wad on the subject. Now? I think I might have more to say. And, yes, the Last Scion would be at the epicenter of it. And she'd have to be played by Alanis. And we'd need a bigger budget, because the entire third act would be the [[Apocalypse]]. Scary thing is this: the film would have to touch on [[Islam]]. And unlike the Catholic League, when those cats don't like what you do, they issue a death warrant on your ass. And now that I've got a family, I'm not as free to stir the shit-pot as I was when I was single, back when I made ''Dogma''. I mean, now I've gotta think about more than my own safety and well-being, but regardless \u2013 yeah, a ''Dogma'' follow-up's been swimming around in my head for some time now.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=41221 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323075259/http://viewaskew.com/theboard/viewtopic.php?t=41221 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2006 |title=The View Askewniverse Message Board |author=Smith, Kevin |date=November 27, 2005 |access-date=2009-06-18 }}</ref>}}\n\nWhen asked about the sequel in October 2017, Smith said it would not happen, as he no longer desired to make any new religious films.<ref>Kennedy, Michael (October 5, 2017).

Retrieved 2018-04-24.</ref>\n\nNear the same time as the cancellation, just weeks before the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Weinstein scandal]] broke to the public, [[Harvey Weinstein]] pitched to Smith about doing a sequel. Not much came from this pitch, but it was just a mere idea for Weinstein. According to Smith in an interview with ''[[Business Insider]]'', he recalls:\n\n{{blockquote|text=I said, 'Hey, how are you?' And he goes, 'You know, we have ''Dogma'', I just realized, and we got to get it out there again.' I said, 'We do! People online are always asking where they can get it. And he then goes, 'You know, that movie had a big cast, we might even be able to do a sequel.' And I was like, 'Yeah man, right on. I might think about that.' And he was like, 'We'll talk.' And a week later, the ''New York Times'' story breaks. I felt sick to my stomach.}}\n\nSmith believes that he only got the call because,  \"It was him looking to see who was a friend still because his life was about to shift completely.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/dogma-2-harvey-weinstein-kevin-smith/|title=Harvey Weinstein Pitched Dogma 2 to Kevin Smith Days Before the Sex Scandal Broke|author=Jeremy Dick|publisher=[[MovieWeb]]|date=October 3, 2019|access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDamon returned to reprise his role as a reborn Loki in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]''. In a fourth-wall breaking monologue, he explains after the events of ''Dogma'' God once again banished him to Earth, this time to the Mediterranean Sea where he was rescued by Italian fishermen after getting amnesia, describing the plot of Damon's film ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': he remarks that would make his current form his \"''reborn'' identity\".\n\nWhile promoting ''[[Clerks III]]'', Smith reiterated that Weinstein still owned ''Dogma'', and tried to buy the film's rights back once he was assured the money would not go directly to Weinstein, who is currently imprisoned. Despite increasingly larger offers from Smith's camp and a letter sharing how personal ''Dogma'' was for him, their offers were denied by Weinstein's lawyer. Smith described the film as a movie that is \"held hostage\" and shared his wish to both tour the film as a re-release and to produce a sequel if he would get the rights back.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Connell |first=Sean |date=September 9, 2022 |title=Kevin Smith Has A Plan For Dogma, But Harvey Weinstein Is Blocking It From Prison |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/kevin-smith-has-a-plan-for-dogma-but-harvey-weinstein-is-blocking-it-from-prison |access-date=September 12, 2022 |website=CinemaBlend}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films about angels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0120655|Dogma}}\n* {{tcmdb title|443006|Dogma}}\n* {{allrovi movie|180080|Dogma}}\n* {{mojo title|dogma|Dogma}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|Dogma|Dogma}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Dogma}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060820073647/http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/1999/11/09/catholics/index.html Why are Catholics so set on dogging \"Dogma\"?] at [[Salon.com|Salon]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120406194218/http://www2.citypaper.com/film/review.asp?rid=5941 God Stuff: Kevin Smith Chases Jehovah]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070110182540/http://www.fbi945movies.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=132290 Radio Interview with Kevin Smith] from FBi 94.5 Sydney Australia\n\n{{Kevin Smith}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dogma (Film)}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:Religious controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Christianity in popular culture controversies]]\n[[Category:Fiction about deicide]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Smith]]\n[[Category:Films critical of the Catholic Church]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Kevin Smith]]\n[[Category:Red Bank, New Jersey in fiction]]\n[[Category:Religious comedy films]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:1999 independent films]]\n[[Category:View Askew Productions films]]\n[[Category:View Askewniverse films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about God]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Howard Shore]]\n[[Category:Films about angels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1998]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Scott Mosier]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
