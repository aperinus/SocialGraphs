A group of eco-feminists led by Frida Waterfall protests the destruction of the environment, leading to an accident that leaves Frida's necklace lodged inside Fry's brain. The destruction upsets Leela, but Leo has bribed Professor Farnsworth to rubber-stamp the project. Leela saves a Martian muck leech, the last of its species, from the site.\n\nIn New Mars Vegas, Fry starts going mad when he cannot stop hearing the thoughts of everyone around him. He meets Hutch, a transient who advises Fry to wear a tinfoil hat to keep others' thoughts out of his head. Hutch warns Fry to beware the \"Dark Ones\".\n\nLeo reveals plans to build the Universe's largest miniature golf course, destroying 12% of the Milky Way in the process. Farnsworth and the crew survey the site, finding an asteroid in a violet dwarf star system teeming with primordial life. Nevertheless, Farnsworth approves Leo's project. Disgusted, Leela joins the eco-feminists, who sabotage the project.\n\n[[File:Into-the-wild-green-yonder-asteroid.JPG|thumb|left|The asteroid in the violet dwarf system.]]\nHutch introduces Fry to the \"Legion of Mad Fellows\", a secret society of tinfoil hat-wearing telepaths led by the Number 9 man. No. 9 tells Fry of two species that worked together to survive until one broke the cycle and caused an \"evolutionary arms race\", both species evolving to defeat the other. One became the extinct \"Encyclopods\" who evolved to preserve the DNA of endangered species so they could be restored should they become extinct. The other became the \"Dark Ones\", who want to destroy all life. The violet dwarf is the only surviving egg of the Encyclopods. Due to a resurgence in the life-giving force \"Chi\", the Encyclopod will soon be reborn. As Fry is immune to the Dark Ones' psionic powers he alone can save it from Leo Wong's plans to turn it into a golf course, and from the Dark Ones, who have evolved to the point that no one knows what they look like.\n\nTo end the sabotage, Leo enlists Zapp Brannigan and Kif Kroker, who then hire Bender to locate the eco-feministas. Fry infiltrates Leo's empire as a security guard. Amy is angered by her father's sexist jokes and joins Leela, while Bender bugs Fry's phone in case he communicates with Leela. Fry runs into Frida and has her take a message of support to Leela, but an unseen Dark One murders Frida.\n\nFarnsworth prepares to close Planet Express; with their delivery team missing they cannot continue. Leo Wong hires them to put up a fence around the construction site. Farnsworth cancels the closing and goes with Zoidberg and Hermes to do the job. They are captured by the eco-feminists, who commandeer the Planet Express ship. When the eco-feministas suspect Fry of murdering Frida, Fry and Leela arrange a rendezvous. They are ambushed by the ''Nimbus'', tipped off by Bender. The eco-feministas are imprisoned.\n\nAt a Legion meeting, No. 9 explains that Fry must stop the implosion of the violet dwarf and thwart the Dark One who is sure to be present. Though no one knows the Dark One's form, its mind cannot be read, allowing Fry to identify it. No. 9 gives Fry the Omega Device, which can temporarily disable the Dark One at close range.\n\nBender frees the eco-feministas from prison to uphold his record for most crimes committed at once. Hermes, Zoidberg, Scruffy, and a repentant Farnsworth rescue them.\n\nAt the ceremony, Fry cannot locate an unreadable mind; he concludes that he himself (having an unreadable mind) must be the Dark One. The eco-feministas disrupt the ceremony, but Fry convinces Leela to let him proceed. Fry activates the Omega Device, which creates a small dome around the two that seemingly has no effect. Leela's leech falls to the ground, revealing itself as the final Dark One. The violet dwarf system forms a giant [[sperm]] and flies into the star, creating an Encyclopod embryo which quickly matures, taking the form of a giant manta ray-like creature. The Dark One kills Hutch, whose dying act is to pull Frida's necklace from Fry's forehead, causing Fry to lose his telepathy. The Encyclopod kills the Dark One. No. 9 convinces the Encyclopod to preserve the Dark One's DNA, but Zoidberg eats the remains before it can. The Encyclopod preserves Hutch's DNA before leaving.\n\nZapp attempts to apprehend the escaped prisoners, but the crew of the Planet Express ship and the Eco-feminists escape along with Kif. Fry and Leela profess their love as the ''Nimbus'' chases the Planet Express ship toward a wormhole, which the Professor warns could take them trillions of light years away. Everyone agrees to go for it. Fry and Leela share a kiss as the ship enters the wormhole.\n\n===Ending===\nThe ending refers to the uncertain future of the show. The makers were not sure if the show would return to TV, so if it did not, it is implied that the ship was in fact taken trillions of light years away.\n\nThe show was picked up by [[Comedy Central]], and it is revealed in the next episode \"[[Rebirth (Futurama)|Rebirth]]\" that the wormhole sent the ship directly back to Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy West]] as [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J.

As in previous environmentally-minded episodes such as \"[[The Problem with Popplers]]\", \"[[A Taste of Freedom]]\" and \"[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]\", the Waterfall family makes an appearance, with Frida Waterfall reappearing along with a new member, Hutch (identifying himself as Frida's brother by removing her jewelry from Fry's head as Hutch dies), and in keeping with tradition both Frida and Hutch Waterfall meet an untimely end.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />  The Encyclopod's decision to preserve Hutch's DNA defines it as Hutch's successor and serves as a warning about the fragility of the existence of the human species.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" /> With dark matter [[Bender's Game|now useless as fuel]] the Planet Express ship has been modified to run on [[whale oil]], an alternative introduced in \"[[Bendin' in the Wind]]\".<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />\n\nFry was originally frozen and [[The Why of Fry|brought to the future]] by [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]] because a Nibblonian prophecy foresaw that he and his unique, Delta-wave-deficient mind (a consequence of him [[Roswell That Ends Well|being his own grandfather]]) would be required to save the universe.<ref name=\"DXC TWOF\">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X|date=2003|title=Futurama season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"The Why of Fry\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In ''Yonder'' Fry is once again appointed for such a task (though by the Legion of Mad Fellows instead of the Nibblonians), due to his immunity from the Dark Ones' psionic attacks.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />\n\nThe No. 9 man, a recurring background character throughout the series, is given a significant role in the film, though quite different from the role in the series for which he was originally conceived.<ref name=\"MG ITWGY\">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2009|title=Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder commentary| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Futurama-cast.png|thumb|right|This screenshot shows every character, at the time of the movie, from the ''[[Futurama]]'' series.]]\n\nAs [[fan service]], the climactic scene of the film features a scene with up to 200 characters on screen at once; most minor characters from ''Futurama''<nowiki/>'s history can be seen (Unit 2013 appearing twice) with the exception of the children (like Dwight and Cubert), who were removed when the production team realized that [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Morbo|Morbo]] mentions that there are no children present. In the DVD commentary, producer [[David X. Cohen]] notes that [[Rough Draft Korea]], ''Futurama'''s overseas animation studio, charged a significant premium because of the difficulty of animating this scene.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />\n\nIn the final scene of the film, Amy and Kif are reunited [[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|after being estranged]]. After years of Fry trying to win her over, Leela finally returns Fry's love in full; Cohen notes that there was considerable debate among the ''Futurama'' writers about how to end the movie, and that ''Futurama'' creator [[Matt Groening]] himself pushed for the actual conclusion.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />\n\nThe film was initially intended to end the series. After ''Futurama'' was renewed, its creators were unsure if the storylines in the film would be continued. Groening stated that he wanted to ignore the film's ending and move on with the show. Cohen felt differently, stating that the revelations at the end should be resolved, even if the resolutions were brief, which they were in the premiere of the new season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Iverson |first1=Dan |title=SDCC 09: The Future of Futurama |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/07/25/sdcc-09-the-future-of-futurama |website=IGN |access-date=February 14, 2022 |date=July 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe ''Futurama'' staff began working on the film in 2006, and at two different points labor issues affected the production process. According to producer Lee Supercinski, the studio realized that they were going to receive the animatic of the film from [[Rough Draft Studios]] two weeks before the deadline for the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. As a result, the writers were forced to make revisions to the script without having completely reviewed the animatic; no writing was done during the strike.<ref name=\"LS ITWGY\">{{cite video | people=Supercinski, Lee|date=2009|title=Futurama: Into The Wild Green Yonder commentary| medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>  The ''Futurama'' studio then received the colored film in June 2008, weeks before a proposed [[Screen Actors Guild#Predicted strike of 2009|Screen Actors Guild]] strike deadline, again forcing the writers to revise the script without completely reviewing the picture.<ref name=\"LS ITWGY\" />\n\nAware that ''Into the Wild Green Yonder'' could have been the final ''Futurama'' episode at the time of writing, the writers inserted numerous references to that fact. The title screen displays the message \"The Humans Shall Not Defeat Us\" in Alien Language 1; according to Cohen, the message is a defiant statement regarding the possible end of the series.<ref name=\"Total Film\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-odd-things-we-now-know-about-futurama/|title=Film features: 9 Odd Things We Now Know About ''Futurama''| author=White, James| date=2009-02-20| website=TotalFilm|publisher=GamesRadar| access-date=2022-02-14}}</ref>  Midway through the movie, a shot of the exterior of the Planet Express building draped with a banner reading \"Going Out Of Business Forever!

Writer Ken Keeler adapted the name from ''[[Cyprinodon salinus]]'', the scientific name of the [[Death Valley pupfish]], which like the Martian muck leech lives in the desert and is nearly extinct.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\" />\n\nThe opening musical theme is a [[Frank Sinatra]]-style number sung by ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] as the Planet Express ship flies around the casinos of Mars Vegas while the opening cartoon is the 1929 ''[[Aesop's Fables (film series)|Aesop's Sound Fables]]'' cartoon ''The Fly's Bride''.<ref name=\"DXC ITWGY\"/>\n\n<!----\n===DVD===\n\nThe DVD features an audio commentary track, a storyboard animatic for Part 1 of the movie, and a collection of deleted scenes.
