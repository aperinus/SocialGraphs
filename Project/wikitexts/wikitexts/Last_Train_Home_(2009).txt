It won the Best Documentary Feature at 2009 [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]] and has been distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]] in the US.\n\n==Synopsis==\nEvery spring, China's 130 million migrant workers travel back to their home villages for the [[Chinese New Year|New Year]]'s holiday. This exodus is the world's largest human migration.\n\nWorking over several years, director Lixin Fan travelled with one couple who has embarked on these annual treks for almost two decades. Like many of China's rural poor, the Zhangs left their native village of Huilong, {{ill|Da'an, Guang'an|lt=Daan Town|zh|\u5927\u5b89\u9547 (\u5e7f\u5b89\u5e02)}}, [[Guang'an District]] in [[Sichuan]] province and their newborn daughter to find work in [[Guangzhou]] in a garment factory for 16 years and see her only once a year during the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]]. Their daughter Qin, now a restless and rebellious teenager, resents her parents' absence and longs for her own freedom away from school and her rural hometown, much to the dismay of her parents. She eventually leaves school, against the wishes of her parents, to work in the city.\n\n==Developments since the film==\nIn a March 2010 follow-up interview, director [[Lixin Fan]] reveals that the Zhangs are still working in the factory and Qin telephoned, but did not visit, for the New Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lam|first=Kempton|title=Interview with Lixin Fan, director of \"Last Train Home\"|newspaper=Examiner|date=March 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, Fan said that Qin was now a vocational student in Beijing, and that while Qin's mother is back on the farm, her father still works at the factory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film Update |access-date=November 21, 2011 |date=September 27, 2011 |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/lasttrainhome/film_update.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111071353/http://www.pbs.org/pov/lasttrainhome/film_update.php |archive-date=November 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2012, an update on the family was released:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We always kept contact with the family after we finished filming. The girl, she quit that job at the bar and went to find a new job. She's floating around. I knew she had a job at a hotel as a bartender and she went back to the factory for a small while and she came to study in a vocational school in Beijing last year for a few months, and then she quit again. Now she's working in a small city in Hubei. She's 22 now, so a big girl. She doesn't [get back for Spring Festival]. She still resents her parents very much. She thinks she never received any love from the parents, so she'll deliberately avoid them during Chinese New Year.\n\nThe little brother is now 16 years old. He was doing really great in school, he got really good marks. He's second-year in high school [Chinese high schools go three years]. He got a few No. 1s in the past few years. His parents were really happy.\n\nMother, she lost her job. She [technically] quit, but it's because of the financial crisis, [which] brought down the salaries so much. The factory usually doesn't fire you, it just drops the salary to a level that makes you quit by yourself. So she went back to the village to take care of the son. So now it's the father working alone in Guangzhou in the factory. So I think it's a really sad thing to see: by the end of this documentary, you see this family has been shattered into smaller pieces. Although the daughter did \"succeed\" in finding her own independence in the city.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n==Awards==\n* 2009: Won Best Feature Documentary at the 22nd annual [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] (IDFA)<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/canadian-documentary-wins-international-prize/article1382157/ The Globe and Mail: \"Canadian documentary wins international prize\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205211814/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/canadian-documentary-wins-international-prize/article1382157/ |date=2009-12-05 }}</ref>\n* 2009: Won Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise Best Quebec film award at the [[Rencontres internationales du documentaire de Montr\u00e9al]] (RIDM)\n* 2010: Won Best Documentary Feature Film award at [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]] (APSA)\n* 2010: Won [[San Francisco International Film Festival|Golden Gate Award]] in the Investigative Documentary Feature Category at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] (SFiFF)\n* 2010: Official Selection at [[Sundance Film Festival]]\n* 2010: Official Selection at [[New Directors/New Films Festival]]\n* 2010: Won Best Documentary Feature at the [[RiverRun International Film Festival]]<ref>[http://www.riverrunfilm.com/about/awards/2010-award-winners 2010 Award Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724233708/http://www.riverrunfilm.com/about/awards/2010-award-winners |date=2011-07-24 }} - RiverRun International Film Festival</ref>\n* 2010: Won Grand Prix at [[EBS International Documentary Festival]]\n\nThe film won the [[Genie Award]] for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Feature Length Documentary|Best Feature Length Documentary]] at the [[31st Genie Awards]] in 2011.<ref>Bruce Kirkland, \"Incendies best ; Edges Barney's Version for top picture Genie and in total awards\".
