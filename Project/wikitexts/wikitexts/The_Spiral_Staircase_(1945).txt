Adapted from [[Ethel Lina White]]'s British novel ''Some Must Watch'' (1933) by screenwriter [[Mel Dinelli]], the film follows a [[muteness|mute]] young woman in an early-20th century [[Vermont]] town being terrorized by a serial killer who targets disabled women.\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on February 6, 1946. For her performance in the film, Barrymore received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The-Spiral-Staircase.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Dorothy McGuire in ''The Spiral Staircase'']]\nIn a small village in 1906 [[Vermont]],<ref name=beatrice/> the [[muteness|mute]] Helen attends a [[silent film]] screening in the parlor of a local inn. During the screening, a crippled woman staying at the inn is murdered in her room by a man hiding in the closet; her murder is the third in a string of [[serial killer|serial killing]]s in the community. Dr. Parry, a friend of Helen's, drives her to the Warren home, a large estate outside town where Helen is employed as a live-in companion for the bedridden Mrs. Warren. Also residing in the house are Mrs. Warren's stepson Albert, a local professor; her son, Steven; and a live-in staff: Mrs. Oates, a housekeeper; her husband Mr. Oates, a handyman; Blanche, a secretary who is having an affair with Steven; and Nurse Barker, Mrs. Warren's verbally-abused nurse.\n\nAt the house, a cloaked figure watches from the woods as Helen ascends the driveway. Inside, Helen finds Mrs. Oates in the kitchen, who discusses the murder and expresses fear for Helen, as the killer appears to be targeting \"defenseless\" women. While walking up the staircase, Helen pauses in front of a mirror to examine herself, and while doing so, the eye of an unknown person watches her from the shadows. In the midst of a rainstorm, the constable stops by and warns Albert to keep watch over Helen. After Mrs. Warren loses consciousness, Dr. Parry is summoned to the home. Nurse Barker discovers a bottle of [[diethyl ether|ether]] has gone missing, and Albert sends Mr. Oates to retrieve some in town. Meanwhile, Mrs. Warren regains consciousness, and urges Dr. Parry to take Helen with him. He offers to take Helen to [[Boston]] and help her work through the trauma of her parents' death, which triggered her muteness. She agrees to go, and Dr. Parry makes plans to return later in the evening after completing another house call.\n\nAfter an argument with Steven, Blanche asks Helen if she can leave with her that night. Helen agrees, and Blanche goes to the basement to retrieve her suitcase, where she is attacked and murdered. Helen later finds her corpse in the basement, and is confronted by Steven. Frightened that he is responsible, she locks him in a closet and flees upstairs. She attempts to wake Mrs. Oates who has passed out, drunk on [[brandy]]. Helen attempts to call Dr. Parry, but is unable to speak to the telephone operator.\n\nAlbert finds Helen frantic, and she writes on a notepad that Blanche has been murdered. As he follows Helen up the staircase to Mrs. Warren's room, Albert confesses to killing Blanche out of jealousy. He then reveals himself as the serial murderer, professing his goal of killing the \"weak and imperfect of the world.\" Helen flees in terror, locking herself in Mrs. Warren's bedroom, where she finds Mrs. Warren unconscious. Meanwhile, the constable returns to the house, and is answered at the front door by Albert; he leaves a message for Helen letting her know that Dr. Parry is unable to return that night, and that they will have to go to Boston the following day. As the constable leaves, Helen attempts to get his attention by smashing the bedroom window, but he is unable to hear it amidst the wind and thunder. Helen returns to the basement to free Steven, but finds Albert waiting in hiding. He chases her as she ascends the staircase to the second floor, but the two are met by Mrs. Warren, armed with a gun. Mrs. Warren shoots Albert multiple times in the chest, killing him, and in the midst of the gunfire, Helen screams in horror.\n \nMrs. Warren orders Helen to retrieve Steven, and she frees him from the basement closet. Mrs. Warren embraces Steven, and dies on the staircase in his arms. Downstairs, Helen emotionally calls Dr. Parry on the telephone\u2014she is now able to fully speak.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Helen\n* [[George Brent]] as Professor Albert Warren\n* [[Ethel Barrymore]] as Mrs. Warren\n* [[Kent Smith]] as Dr. Parry\n* [[Gordon Oliver]] as Steven Warren\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Blanche\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Mrs. Oates\n* [[Sara Allgood]] as Nurse Barker\n* [[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Mr. Oates\n* [[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]] as Constable\n* [[Erville Alderson]] as Dr. Harvey (uncredited) \n* [[Robert Siodmak]] as The Killer's 'Eye' (uncredited)\n\n==Analysis==\nSince its release, ''The Spiral Staircase'' has been subject to significant [[film criticism]] and academic discussion, particularly in regard to the film's visual motifs and blending of [[horror film|horror]] and [[film noir]].{{sfn|Golden|2015|pages=90\u20133}} Although characterized by contemporaneous press as a \"mystery romance,\"<ref name=detroit>{{cite news|work=Detroit Free Press|location=Detroit, Michigan|title=PARTNERS IN FEAR|page=12|date=February 5, 1946|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99201306/}}</ref> the film has been noted by contemporary critics for its prominent Gothic horror elements.{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=89}} It has also been cited as one of numerous progenitors to the [[slasher film]],<ref>{{cite web|work=[[NJ.com]]|title=From monstrous metaphor to brainless splatter, the slasher film devolves|author=Whitty, Stephen|date=March 8, 2009|access-date=December 22, 2017|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/03/from_monstrous_metaphor_to_bra.html}}</ref> specifically for its female-centric cast{{sfn|Olney|2015|p=61}} and [[point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] cinematography deployed during scenes in which the killer stalks his victims.{{sfn|Hutchings|2017|p=300}}\n\nFilm scholar Amy Golden notes several significant visual allusions in the film, such as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929) and [[Maya Deren]]'s ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943).{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=90}} Golden cites the film as a \"quintessential example of 1940s horror.\"{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=90}} Writer Denis Grunes in 2007 suggested the film is \"in fact a masked allegory of the passage of [[silent film|silent cinema]] into sound,\" citing the mute protagonist's predicament as evidence.{{sfn|Golden|2015|p=92}} This notion was also suggested by film scholar Amy Lawrence in her 1991 book ''Echo and Narcissus: Women's Voices in Classical Hollywood Cinema''.{{sfn|Lawrence|1991|p=6}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nAdapted from the [[Ethel Lina White]] novel ''Some Must Watch'' (1933), ''The Spiral Staircase'' was screenwriter [[Mel Dinelli]]'s first screenplay.<ref name=trivia/> RKO Pictures had acquired the rights to produce the film from independent producer [[David O.
