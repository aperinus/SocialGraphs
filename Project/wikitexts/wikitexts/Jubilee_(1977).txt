It stars [[Jenny Runacre]], [[Ian Charleson]] and a host of [[punk rock]]ers. The title refers to the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] in 1977.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-07-20 |title=Stuart Jeffries recalls Derek Jarman's dystopian cinematic punk satire, Jubilee |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/20/popandrock4 |access-date=2022-07-25 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>\n\nNumerous punk icons appear in the film including [[Adam Ant]], [[Toyah Willcox|Toyah]], [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]] (a [[Malcolm McLaren]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9), [[Nell Campbell]], [[Hermine Demoriane]] and [[Jayne County]]. It features performances by Jayne County and [[Adam and the Ants]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Crampton |first=Luke |title=The Q Book of Punk Legends |last2=Rees |first2=Dafydd |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd |year=1996 |location=Enfield |pages=9\u201316}}</ref> There are also [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] appearances by [[the Slits]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. The film was scored by [[Brian Eno]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Queen Elizabeth I]] is transported forward in time to the film's present day by the occultist [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], who commands the spirit guide [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] (a character from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'') to bring them there. Elizabeth arrives in the shattered Britain of the 1970s and moves through the social and physical decay of the city, observing the sporadic activities of a group of aimless [[nihilist]]s - mostly young women, including [[Amyl nitrate|Amyl Nitrate]], Bod, Chaos, Crabs and Mad.\n\nAn early scene, set in a [[Squatting|squat]], introduces the audience to this group of characters and also to Sphinx and Angel, two [[incest]]uous [[bisexual]] brothers. Amyl Nitrate instructs a group of young women about history \u2014 in so doing, valorising the violent criminal activity of [[Myra Hindley]] \u2014 before reminiscing about her time as a ballet dancer. Bod, a sex-hating anarchist, has just strangled and killed Queen [[Elizabeth II]], stealing her crown in an arbitrary street [[robbery]].\n\nFrom there the group move on to a caf\u00e9, where Crabs picks up a young musician named the Kid, Mad tears up some postcards, and Bod attacks a waitress with a bottle of ketchup. Bod contacts impresario Borgia Ginz. On meeting Ginz, however, she is surprised to find Amyl performing a pastiche of \"[[Rule Britannia]]\". Sphinx and Angel establish a relationship with Viv, a young former artist, whom they take to meet Max, an ex-soldier. In exchange for sexual favours, Crabs takes the Kid to see Ginz, who auditions the Kid's band and signs them up under the name \"Scum\". Sphinx and Angel try to talk the Kid out of this, but he just laughs at their lecturing. Ginz is branching out into property management and has purchased \"abandoned\" properties such as [[Westminster Cathedral]] and [[Buckingham Palace]], which are transformed into musical venues.\n\nMeanwhile, Mad, Bod and Crabs asphyxiate Happy Days, one of Crabs' [[one-night stand]]s, with red plastic sheeting. They proceed to break into the flat of androgynous rock star Lounge Lizard, whom Bod throttles to death. A fight breaks out between Kid and a policeman, at a disco session in Westminster Cathedral. After the gang all watch Kid's TV debut together, Viv and the three males pay a visit to Max's [[Bingo (United Kingdom)|bingo]] hall, where violent police activity causes the death of Sphinx, Angel and the Kid. Revenge attacks on the two police officers responsible follow. One of them is [[castrated]] to death by Mad and Amyl; the other, who has just started an affair with Crabs, is blown up on his doorstep with a petrol bomb by Bod.\n\nFinally, Ginz takes the four women off to [[Dorset]] - \"the only safe place to live these days\" - an unreconstructed right wing aristocratic enclave, where he signs a recording contract with the gang. Interspersed with these displays of contemporary anarchic violence, Dee, Ariel and Elizabeth try to interpret the signs of anarchic modernity around them, before they undertake a pastoral and nostalgic return to the sixteenth century at the film's end.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jenny Runacre]] \u2013 Queen Elizabeth I / Bod\n* [[Nell Campbell|Little Nell]] \u2013 Crabs \n* [[Toyah Willcox]] \u2013 Mad\n* [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]] \u2013 Amyl Nitrate\n* [[Hermine Demoriane]] \u2013 Chaos\n* [[Ian Charleson]] \u2013 Angel\n* [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]] \u2013 Sphinx\n* Linda Spurrier \u2013 Viv\n* [[Jack Birkett|Orlando]] \u2013 Borgia Ginz \n* [[Jayne County]] \u2013 Lounge Lizard \n* [[Richard O'Brien]] \u2013 John Dee\n* [[Adam Ant]] \u2013 Kid\n* [[Helen Wellington-Lloyd]] \u2013 Lady-in-waiting\n* [[Claire Davenport]] \u2013 First Customs Lady\n* [[Barney James]] \u2013 Policeman\n* [[Lindsay Kemp]] \u2013 Cabaret performer\n* [[Gene October]] \u2013 Happy Days\n* [[David Brandon (actor)|David Haughton]] \u2013 Ariel\n* [[Siouxsie Sioux]] \u2013 herself\n* [[Steven Severin]] \u2013 himself\n\n==Influences==\nThe film is heavily influenced by the 1970s [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetic in its style and presentation. Shot in grainy colour, it is largely plotless and episodic. Location filming took advantage of London neighbourhoods that were economically depressed and/or still contained large amounts of rubble from the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Critic Archive |title=Brows Held High: Jubilee |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8v27teHaSiU |url-status=live |date=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/8v27teHaSiU |archive-date=11 December 2021 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nThe film had many critics in British punk circles.
