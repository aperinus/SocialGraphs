Lewis. Directed by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] and [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] (the latter in his feature [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]) from a screenplay by [[Len Blum]], Lorne Cameron, [[David Hoselton]], and Kirkpatrick, the film features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Steve Carell]], [[William Shatner]], [[Wanda Sykes]], and [[Nick Nolte]]. The film's plot follows a raccoon named RJ who must reclaim food for a bear, ultimately manipulating a group of animals that had recently awakened from hibernation in order to speed up the process.\n\n''Over the Hedge'' was released in the United States on May 19, 2006 by [[Paramount Pictures]], marking its first contribution with DreamWorks Animation. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and grossed $340 million on an $80 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILM#PLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nOne night, in [[Indiana]], RJ the raccoon tries to steal food from Vincent, a bear that has stockpiled for his hibernation. However, Vincent wakes up and catches RJ, and the food is destroyed in the ensuing confrontation. Angry, Vincent gives RJ an ultimatum: he will hunt down and eat RJ if the food is not replaced in one week. RJ agrees and realizes he needs help to pay Vincent back.\n\nThe next morning, a family of woodland animals, consisting of [[ornate box turtle]] and leader Verne, hyperactive [[American red squirrel]] Hammy, [[striped skunk]] Stella, [[North American porcupine]] parents Lou and Penny, and children Spike, Bucky and Quillo, and [[Virginia opossum]] father and daughter Ozzie and Heather, awaken from their hibernation on the first day of spring. They find that much of the forest they lived in has been turned into a [[housing development]], which is separated from the little forest remaining by a giant [[hedge]]. The animals wonder how they will forage for enough food for the following winter. RJ meets them and encourages them to traverse the hedge and steal food from the humans. Despite Verne's concerns, the animals join RJ in stealing and stockpiling human food, not knowing he intends to pay off his debt. Gladys Sharp, the neighborhood [[Homeowner association|Home Owners Association]] president, takes notice of the animal problem and hires exterminator Dwayne LaFontant to get rid of them.\n\nVerne tries to return the food to avoid Dwayne. RJ tries to stop him, but the food ends up destroyed due to an encounter with the excitable dog Nugent. Verne tries to convince the family to not listen to RJ, but inadvertently insults their intelligence in the process, angering them and causing them to leave him in favor of RJ. That night, Gladys has Dwayne cover her yard in animal traps, including an illegal contraband device called the De-Pelter Turbo which turns the entire yard into a death trap when activated.\n\nVerne apologizes to RJ for his actions and reconciles with the other animals. On the night before the moon is full, RJ sees that Gladys has bought a massive stockpile of food and enlists the help of the animals to invade her home and steal it. Hammy successfully disables the De-Pelter Turbo while Stella steals the collar of Gladys' Persian cat Tiger, which enables entry into the house's [[pet door]], by posing as a cat and seducing him. The animals stockpile another wagon full of food, but right as they are about to leave at sunrise, RJ sees a can of chips called Spuddies and becomes determined to get them, as Vincent specifically requested them. While trying to justify his effort to get the chips, RJ lets slip his true intention for the food. At the same time, Gladys comes downstairs and finds the animals. Stella sprays the entire house and alerts Dwayne. RJ manages to escape with the food, while the others are caught by Dwayne, who takes them away in his truck to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] them.\n\nRJ gives the food to Vincent as promised, but as he sees the exterminator truck driving off, he feels remorse for his actions. Determined to save them, RJ sends the food wagon careening into the car, knocking out Dwayne and freeing the animals, but enraging Vincent. Spike, Bucky, and Quillo take control of the car and drive it back home, and RJ rejoins the family after Verne convinces the others to forgive him. They crash the truck into Gladys' home and return to the hedge, but are attacked from both sides of it by Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne. RJ manages to come up with a plan. He gives Hammy an energy drink, making the squirrel hyperactive enough to move at warp speed, which he uses to go and reactivate the De-Pelter Turbo, and RJ lures Vincent into leaping over the hedge to get him. But he puts on Verne's shell, protecting him from Vincent's jaws, and Verne pulls him out with a fishing line. Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne are caught in the De-Pelter Turbo, resulting in them being blasted with a massive dose of radiation (which somehow manages to be seen in the observable universe) and trapped in a cage left in the ensuing crater.\n\nVincent is captured by animal control and shipped off to the [[Rocky Mountains]], while Gladys is arrested for possessing the Turbo, and Dwayne is chased by Nugent while attempting to escape. RJ joins the woodland creatures' family permanently as well as Tiger, who remains in love with Stella even after learning she is a skunk, as he cannot smell. The animals' food storage is quickly replenished by Hammy, who finally finds the nuts he stored before the previous winter.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1    = Bruce Willis Cannes 2006.jpg\n| alt1      = Bruce Willis\n| image2    = Avril Lavigne Cannes 2006.jpg\n| alt2      = Avril Lavigne\n| footer    = [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Avril Lavigne]] at the film's premiere at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]\n}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as RJ, a [[raccoon]] who is duplicitous, selfish, a con artist, and extremely intelligent.

He asked the screenwriting duo of [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]] to write the screenplay for the project for Bluth and Goldman's [[Fox Animation Studios]]; however, in February 2001, due to the disappointing performance of its recent film ''[[Titan A.E.]]'' and its closure in 2000, it was later picked up by [[DreamWorks Animation]] under the leadership of its CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] when Fox put the film in turnaround. In July 2002, [[Jim Carrey]] was announced to co-star with [[Garry Shandling]] in the film. However, in October 2004, he dropped out, and was replaced with [[Bruce Willis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Comics2Film: Over The Hedge |url=https://www.comics2film.com/OverTheHedge.shtml |website=Comics2Film |access-date=28 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010407074904/https://www.comics2film.com/OverTheHedge.shtml |archive-date=7 April 2001 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack for the film was released on May 16, 2006, by [[Epic Records]].

It can be found on the film's [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases, as well as the ''[[Madly Madagascar]]'' DVD as a bonus feature. It features [[Steve Carell]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Madison Davenport]], [[Shane Baumel]], Sami Kirkpatrick, and [[Garry Shandling]] reprising their roles from the film. \n\n=== Plot ===\nThe camera switches off. Spike, Bucky and Quillo, Lou and Penny's three baby porcupines with filming RJ who holds a piece of cardboard which has the words, \"RJ's Wild World of Nature\", a made-up nature show. Their subject is Hammy when he discovers a [[boomerang]]. RJ and the kids hide in the hedge and watch Hammy as he first sees the [[boomerang]] and \"calls [[wikt:dibs|dibs]].\" He tries to eat it but hates the taste and throws it away. The boomerang hits him in this order:\n\n* Hammy is first hit and hisses like a cat at the boomerang (the kids giggle during this time but RJ dismisses it) before throwing it away again.\n* Hammy throws it again and barely dodges it but stands up and laughs triumphantly, to be hit again.\n* Hammy continuously dodges it and starts throwing the boomerang without stopping but soon realizes he is actually throwing a [[cookie]], a [[cupcake]], and an [[ice cream cone]] which prove distractive as he is hit again.\n* He scurries up a tree but the boomerang freezes next to him. He shouts \"Begone! I don't believe in you!\" but the boomerang keeps spinning around the tree, forcing him to shout \"All right, I believe in you!\" He then buries the boomerang in a deep hole and proceeds to cover it up.\n* He is hit again and finally chops it into pieces with an [[axe]], puts it in a [[trunk (luggage)|trunk]], devilishly burns it with a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]] then stomps on the hot ashes but then steps off before he is continuously hit again, until an annoyed Hammy cries \"Aww c'mon!\"\n\nRJ then asks the audience if they should tell him that the kids actually had a lot of boomerangs in a box. Verne then appears and figures out what they are doing and throws the camera away and informs them that humans do the same thing. Hammy finds the camera in the meantime and claims it. RJ and the kids then inform Verne they will not do it again.\n\nThe crew (joined by Hammy) later perform another so-called \"Unrated Version\" episode which shows Verne bathing without his shell on. He then finds out what they are doing and chases RJ away through the hedge.
