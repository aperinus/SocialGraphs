The movie's narrative spans the years 1961 to 1985. It stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Steve Zahn]], [[Brittany Murphy]], and [[James Woods]]. It was the last film directed by [[Penny Marshall]]. Although the film is co-produced by Beverly Donofrio, many of its details differ from the book.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1961, 11 year-old Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio rides with her father, [[Wallingford, Connecticut]] police officer Leonard. She asks for a bra for Christmas to get the attention of a boy, but he tells her she is too young and to focus on books.\n\nIn 1965, intelligent but na\u00efve, Bev's dream is to go to college in New York City to become a writer. Joining her friends Fay and Tina at a party, Fay's older boyfriend, Bobby, is being [[Vietnam War|deployed to Vietnam]] while Bev gives a love letter to popular boy, Sky. He reads it aloud, so she flees to the bathroom where she's consoled by Ray, a stranger, who defends her honor by fighting with Sky.\n\nBev and Ray, with Fay and Bobby, flee the party and go to a lookout, where Bobby and Fay have sex. Bev is overcome by Ray's kindness, so they do too. On duty, Leonard catches and takes them to the police station, and Bev claims that they only kissed.\n\nBev tells Ray she's pregnant and initially turns down his offer to get married but later agrees to a hasty wedding to placate her parents. At the reception, everyone is avoiding Bev, so Fay publicly announces she is also pregnant. As Fay's father wanted her to put the baby up for adoption, she and Bobby will get married instead.\n\nThe girls celebrate that they will be mothers together, but lament missing out on their childhood, the prom, and an education. Bev has a son, Jason (upsetting her, as she wanted a girl), while Fay has daughter Amelia. Bev continues studying. When Jason is three, her interview for a college scholarship goes badly when she has to take Jason along. Although the interviewer praises her writing, he fears she is too distracted.\n\nLater, Fay reveals that she and Bobby are getting divorced as he met someone else. Bev tells her she's not sure if she loves Jason because his birth has cost her so much. When he almost drowns in Fay's pool, Bev vows to be more attentive.\n\nAt Jason's seventh birthday party, several people from Bev's high school come: Tina is engaged and going to [[New York University|NYU]]; and Tommy, who had a crush on Bev, just graduated from [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]]. He suggests she move her family to [[California]] to get her degree as the state offers financial aid. Although initially agreeing, Ray confesses to being a heroin addict and spending their savings on drugs. Bev helps him detox, but he sneaks out to get more drugs. Saying he can't quit, she tells him to leave. Ray agrees, but young Jason chases after him, telling Bev he hates her.\n\nTwo years later, Bev and Fay help Lizard (Ray's friend) to dry [[marijuana|weed]] in Bev's oven to get money to study in [[California]]. Jason, still bitter, tells Grandpa Leonard, who arrests the mothers. Fay's brother bails them out, but only if Fay and Amelia move with him and cut off contact with Bev, so she blames Jason.\n\nIn 1985, Bev and Jason are driving to see Ray. She has a college degree and needs Ray to sign a waiver to publish her memoir. On the way, Jason tells her he wants to transfer from NYU to [[Indiana University]], but Bev refuses as he must get the education she couldn't.\n\nJason calls his now-girlfriend Amelia with the bad news, who is dejected but not angry. Arriving at Ray's trailer, Bev explains why they are there. When his wife, Shirley, demands $100,000, Bev storms out. Jason follows, calling her selfish for only caring about her book when he finally got to see his father again. He accuses her of being a bad mother and she stomps off. Ray tells Jason leaving was the best thing he could have done for him and that is why he turned out so well. He sneaks the signed papers to him.\n\nJason finds Bev, who insists she was a great mother who sacrificed everything for him. He reveals he is transferring to be with Amelia and apologizes for ruining her life. Bev softens, telling him she is proud and that he is the best thing in her life. Feeling responsible for her mistakes and poor choices, she gives him her car to drive to [[Indiana]].\n\nStranded, Beverly calls her father Leonard for a ride. Complaining that Jason blames her for everything wrong in his life, she realizes that she herself has done the same to him. Together, they sing a song from her childhood as they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Drew Barrymore]] as [[Beverly Donofrio|Beverly \"Bev\" Donofrio]]\n**[[Mika Boorem]] as Bev Donofrio, age 11\n*[[Marisa Ryan]] as Janet Donofrio\n**Olivia Morgan Scheck as Janet Donofrio, age 12\n**Celine Marget as Janet Donofrio, age 8 \n*[[Steve Zahn]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Hasek\n*[[Brittany Murphy]] as Fay Forrester\n*[[Adam Garcia]] as Jason Hasek-Donofrio\n**Joseph M.

It holds a 49% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 109 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"''Riding in Cars with Boys'' suffers from mixing grit and pathos with cuteness and comedy. Ironically, many critics found Zahn's character more compelling and three-dimensional than Barrymore's\".<ref>{{citation|title=Riding in Cars With Boys (2001)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/riding_in_cars_with_boys|access-date=August 24, 2021|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"A film like this is refreshing and startling in the way it cuts loose from formula and shows us confused lives we recognize ...
