It stars [[Catherine Mary Stewart]], [[Robert Beltran]], and [[Kelli Maroney]] as survivors of a comet that has turned most people into either dust or zombies.  ''Night of the Comet'' grossed $14.4 million in the US on a $700,000 budget.  It has a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] approval rating of 79% and has since become a [[cult film]], influencing the creation of [[Buffy Summers]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe Earth is passing through the tail of a comet, an event which has not occurred in 65 million years and coincided with the [[extinction event]] that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's passage, eleven days before Christmas, large crowds gather outside to watch and celebrate.\n\nEighteen-year-old Regina \"Reggie\" Belmont works at a movie theater in southern California. She is annoyed to find the initials DMK have the sixth highest score on the theater's ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' video game; all the other high scores are hers. She stays after the theater closes to help her boyfriend Larry, the theatre's projectionist, sneak back in so he can loan out a film reel for illegal duplication for his own profit. He offers to pay for her assistance from what he expects to earn when the other party returns the film reel in the morning. Reggie and Larry spend the night in the steel-lined projection booth and have sex.\n\nMeanwhile, Reggie's 16-year-old sister Samantha \"Sam\" argues with their stepmother Doris, who Sam implies is cheating on her father, who is away on active military duty. After this escalates to a physical altercation, Sam spends the night in a steel backyard shed.\n\nThe next morning, a gloomy reddish haze covers the sky, and there are no signs of life but piles of red dust and heaps of clothing everywhere. Unaware that anything has occurred, Larry goes outside and is killed by a [[zombie]] wielding a pipe wrench. After playing the video game to replace DMK's initials with her own, Reggie goes looking for Larry outside, mistaking the red overcast sky as bad smog. She quickly encounters the zombie, but escapes on Larry's motorcycle. She heads home to find her sister, and they surmise that because they both spent the night in steel containers, they were saved from the comet's effects.\n\nThe sisters race to the local radio station after they hear a [[disc jockey]] on air, only to find it was a pre-recorded show. They come across another survivor there, Hector Gomez, who spent the night in the back of his steel truck. When Sam talks into the microphone, she is heard by researchers in an underground installation out in the desert. As they listen to Reggie, Sam and Hector debate what to do, the scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will eventually disintegrate into dust themselves. Hector leaves to check if any of his family survived, but promises to return as soon as possible.\n\nReggie and Sam then go shopping for guns and clothing at a mall. After a firefight with some evil stock boys, the girls are taken prisoner, but are saved by a rescue team sent by the scientists. Reggie is taken back to their base. Audrey White, a disillusioned scientist, offers to dispose of Sam, whom she diagnosed as having been exposed to the comet due to her developing rash, and to wait for Hector to return. After she fakes [[Euthanasia|euthanizing]] Sam by injecting her with only a sedative, she kills the other remaining scientist. When Hector returns after an encounter with a zombie child, Audrey briefs him on the situation and then gives herself a [[lethal injection]] (as she herself has been exposed). Sam and Hector set out to rescue Reggie.\n\nBack at the base, it is revealed that the researchers had suspected and prepared for the comet's effects, but inadvertently left the ventilation system open and the fans running during the comet's passage. The deadly dust permeated their base. Reggie, who has become suspicious, escapes and discovers that the dying scientists have hunted down and rendered healthy survivors brain-dead. They harvest their untainted blood to keep the disease at bay while they desperately search for a cure. Reggie saves a young boy and a girl before they are processed, then unplugs the other victims from their life support machines. Sam and Hector arrive and rescue the trio and blow up the scientists.\n\nEventually, rain washes away the red dust, leaving the sky clear. Reggie pairs up with Hector, and they assume parental roles with the kids. Sam feels left out. Frustrated, she ignores Reggie's warning about crossing a deserted downtown street against the still-operating signal light, claiming there is nobody else left. Sam is almost run over by a sports car driven by Danny Mason Keener, a survivor about her own age. After apologizing, he invites her to go for a ride. As they drive off, the car is shown sporting the initials \"DMK\" on the [[vanity plate]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Regina \"Reggie\" Belmont\n* [[Kelli Maroney]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Belmont\n* [[Robert Beltran]] as Hector Gomez\n* [[Sharon Farrell]] as Doris, Reggie and Sam's stepmother\n* [[Mary Woronov]] as Audrey White\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Dr. Carter, the leader of the think tank\n* Peter Fox as Dr. Wilson, one of the researchers\n* John Achorn as Oscar\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Larry Dupree\n* [[Devon Ericson]] as Minder\n* [[Lissa Layng]] as Davenport\n* [[Janice Kawaye]] as Sarah, the young rescued girl\n* Chance Boyer as Brian, the young rescued boy\n* Ivan E.

For the women, he was inspired by [[Ginger Rogers]]. Further inspiration came from real-life teenage girls whom he met while filming PBS specials. Without telling the girls details about the script's premise, he asked them to describe how they would react to an apocalyptic event. The girls saw the scenario as an exciting adventure and only saw a downside to the experience when Eberhardt brought up the subject of dating. Using their answers, Eberhardt wrote the script to be lighthearted and adventuresome. Eberhardt initially had trouble convincing the studio to let him direct it, but they relented when he held out, as [[Atlantic Releasing Corporation]] was looking to immediately invest $700,000. Atlantic also wanted to capitalize on the success of their 1983 hit ''[[Valley Girl (1983 film)|Valley Girl]]'' and the popularity of quirky drive-in films like ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]''. The producers, Andrew Lane and Wayne Crawford, clashed with Eberhardt during filming; Eberhardt would later say that they did not understand the film and resented being assigned to such a low-budget B movie. Early in the production, they attempted to have him replaced. Regardless, Eberhardt praised their producing skill and said the film could not have been made without their help. [[Heather Langenkamp]] auditioned for the role of Samantha \"Sam\" Belmont and was the number one choice on the casting list but the part ultimately went to [[Kelli Maroney]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Horror Movies of the 1980s|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|author-link=John Kenneth Muir|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|isbn=9780786455010|pages=397\u2013402|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ1vcmaOd7wC&pg=PA397}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nAtlantic released ''Night of the Comet'' in the US on November 16, 1984, earning $3,580,578 in its opening weekend, coming in at third place.
