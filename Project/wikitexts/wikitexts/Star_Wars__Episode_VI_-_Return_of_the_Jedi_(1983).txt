It was agreed to in long discussions in January and November 2014. --> is a 1983 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film directed by [[Richard Marquand]]. The screenplay is by [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[George Lucas]] from a story by Lucas, who was also the executive producer. The sequel to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977){{EpIV}} and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), it is the third<!-- Do NOT add \"and final\", that should be obvious for the third installment of a trilogy--> installment in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]], the third film to be produced, and the sixth chronological film in the \"[[Skywalker Saga]]\". The film stars [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[David Prowse]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], [[Peter Mayhew]] and [[Frank Oz]].\n\nSet one year after ''The Empire Strikes Back'', the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] is constructing a [[second Death Star]] to exterminate the [[Rebel Alliance]]. With intel that the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] will be onboard, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in hopes of both destroying it and the Emperor. Meanwhile, Rebel hero [[Luke Skywalker]], now a [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]], struggles to bring his father, [[Darth Vader]], back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\nFollowing Lucas and Kasdan's discussion on making ''Return of the Jedi'', the film went into production. [[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983. It grossed $374 million during its initial theatrical run, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Overall, the film was well-received by critics, with strong praise going to the special effects and action sequences, performances, John Williams' score, and emotional weight, but criticism was directed at the screenplay, lack of fresh ideas, and the controversial appearance of [[Ewok|Ewoks]], which critics argue was an unsubtle commentary on the [[Vietnam War]]. While retrospective reviews have remained positive, ''Return of the Jedi'' is widely considered to be the weakest film in the original trilogy. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades, which has also brought its total gross to $475 million. The United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nA year after [[Han Solo]]'s capture,{{efn|As depicted in the 1980 film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hunt|first=James|date=2019-06-28|title=Star Wars: What Happened Between The Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi?|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-canon-between-empire-return-jedi/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-14|website=[[Screen Rant]]|language=en-US}}</ref>}} [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue Han, who is still frozen in carbonite. Disguised as the [[bounty hunter]] Boushh, [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be eaten by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[sarlacc]], a deadly beast entombed in the desert floor that digests its prey over the course of a millennium. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and his friends, and they battle Jabba's men aboard the crime lord's sail barge. During the chaos, [[Boba Fett]] falls into the sarlacc after Han inadvertently damages his [[jet pack]], and Leia strangles Jabba to death with her chains. The group destroy Jabba's sail barge and escape.\n\nAs the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his [[Jedi]] training with [[Yoda]], whom he discovers is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once the Jedi knight Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and reveals that there is another Skywalker, before vanishing and becoming one with [[the Force]]. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s [[Force spirit]] then tells Luke that Leia is his twin sister, and that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]]. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team which includes Luke, Leia and Chewbacca to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so will allow the Rebel Fleet to destroy the Death Star. The team uses a stolen Imperial shuttle to arrive undetected and encounters a tribe of [[Ewok]]s, gaining their trust after an initial conflict. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and fails to convince him to reject the dark side of the Force.\n\nVader brings Luke to the Emperor, who intends to turn him to the dark side, and reveals that his friends and the Rebel Fleet are headed into a trap. On Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the Rebel assault on the second Death Star, finding its shield still active, and the Imperial fleet waiting for them.\n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its superlaser, destroying a Rebel starship. He tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attempts to attack him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke does not. In retaliation, Luke defeats Vader, severing his [[prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor orders Luke to take Vader's place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself to be a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor begins torturing Luke to death with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader betrays the Emperor by throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death,<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but he is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his redeemed father's last request, Luke removes Anakin\u2019s mask and after a brief talk, he dies peacefully in Luke's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer|Imperial command ship]], Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor and escape before the station explodes. Meanwhile, Luke escapes in a shuttle. On Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother. Luke burns Vader's empty armor on a pyre and reunites with his friends. As the Rebels celebrate their victory, Luke notices the Force spirits of {{nowrap|Obi-Wan}}, Yoda, and Anakin watching nearby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = Left to right: [[Mark Hamill]] (pictured in 2019), [[Harrison Ford]] (2017), and [[Carrie Fisher]] (2013)\n| image1 = Mark Hamill (48419236062) Cropped.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Mark Hamill\n| image2 = Harrison Ford by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Harrison Ford\n| image3 = Carrie Fisher 2013 cropped retouched.jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Carrie Fisher\n}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, Han's friend and Darth Vader's son who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot in the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], captain of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' who becomes a General in the Rebellion; Luke's friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is a leader of the Rebellion, Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Administrator of Cloud City who has become a General in the Rebellion; Han's old friend and the previous owner of the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion and longtime companion of R2-D2\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend, co-pilot of the ''Millennium Falcon'', and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as\n** [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid in the service of the Rebellion, loyal to Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO\n** [[Paploo]], an Ewok who distracts Scout troopers by hijacking a speeder bike\n* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as [[Palpatine|The Emperor]], the founder and supreme ruler of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and Darth Vader's [[Sith]] master.

Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' had made him an even bigger star. Kazanjian (who also produced ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'') convinced Ford to return: \n<blockquote>I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for ''Return of the Jedi.'' Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal. When Phil returned to the office several weeks later he called me back and said I had taken advantage of his son in the negotiations. I had not.

Kazanjian estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' had been big hits.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> The project was given the [[working title]] ''Blue Harvest'' with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented [[price gouging]] by service providers.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/>\n\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> where the film occupied all nine stages. The shoot commenced with a scene later deleted from the finished film where the heroes get caught in a sandstorm as they leave Tatooine.<ref name=\"hearn\"/> (This was the only major sequence cut from the film during editing.)<ref name=\"ProdDir3\"/> While attempting to film Luke Skywalker's battle with the [[rancor]] beast, Lucas insisted on trying to create the scene in the same style as [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'' films by using a stunt performer inside a suit. The production team made several attempts, but were unable to create an adequate result. Lucas eventually relented and decided to film the rancor as a high-speed puppet.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> In April, the crew moved to the [[Yuma Desert]] in [[Arizona]] for two weeks of Tatooine exteriors.<ref name=\"hearn\"/> Production then moved to the [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests of northern California<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hesseltine |first1=Cassandra |title=Complete Filmography of Humboldt County |url=http://humboldt.filmhumboldtdelnorte.org/filmography |website=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission |publisher=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission |access-date=October 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013206/http://humboldt.filmhumboldtdelnorte.org/filmography|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> near [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]] where two weeks were spent shooting the Endor forest exteriors, and then concluded at ILM in [[San Rafael, California]] for about ten days of [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] shots.

George Lucas and his employees could not hear many of the sound effects they had mixed. For instance, during one of the classic Princess Leia scenes, her theme was nowhere to be heard. The timeless soundtrack and sound effects that made Star Wars so memorable were not there. To make matters worse, the background noise in the theater became so bad that it muffled the majority of the sound from the film when it was played through the theater's commercial sound system. Many theaters at the time had poor room acoustics with mono surround sound. Lucas would solve the problem by ensuring that the theaters played his movies would project all of the intended sound he heard during the mix. Therefore, he decided to create a new company called [[THX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@thxltd/star-wars-george-lucas-a-disappearing-cello-the-story-of-thx-cinema-certification-81f6aeabb640|title=Star Wars, George Lucas & A Disappearing Cello: The Story of THX Cinema Certification|date=February 21, 2017}}</ref> Harrison Ford altered some scenes during the shoot, causing Billy Dee Williams to forget some of his lines, which was a source of frustration for Marquand. Marquand and Anthony Daniels also clashed somewhat, leading to the latter recording his [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#ADR/post-sync|ADR]] with Lucas instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Anthony |title=I Am C-3PO: The Inside Story |date=2019 |publisher=DK |isbn=9781465492562}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nMeanwhile, [[special effect]]s work at ILM quickly stretched the company to its operational limits. While the R&D work and experience gained from the previous two films in the trilogy allowed for increased efficiency, this was offset by the desire to have the closing film raise the bar set by each of these films.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> A compounding factor was the intention of several departments of ILM to either take on other film work or decrease staff during slow cycles. Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20&nbsp;hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983. Of about 900 special effects shots,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> all [[VistaVision]] [[Compositing|optical effects]] remained in-house, since ILM was the only company capable of using the format, while about 400 [[negative pulldown|4-perf]] opticals were subcontracted to outside effects houses.<ref name=\"ProdDir2\">{{cite web |title=Return of the Jedi: Production and Direction, p. 2 |work=American Cinematographer |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg2.htm |access-date=August 19, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184927/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/jedi/pdir/pg2.htm| archive-date=September 30, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref> Progress on the opticals was severely delayed for a time when ILM rejected about {{convert|100000|ft|m|disp=flip}} of film when the [[film perforations]] failed image registration and steadiness tests.<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Return of the Jedi (soundtrack)}}\n[[John Williams]] composed and conducted the film's musical score with performances by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

[[Sony Classical Records]] acquired the rights to the classic trilogy scores in 2004 after gaining the rights to release the second trilogy soundtracks (''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Attack of the Clones]]''). In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of ''Return of the Jedi'' along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film.
