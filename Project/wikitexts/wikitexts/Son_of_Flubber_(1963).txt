The sequel to ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961), [[Fred MacMurray]] reprises his role from the first film as Ned Brainard, a scientist who has perfected a high-bouncing substance, Flubber (\"flying rubber\") that can levitate an automobile and cause athletes to bounce into the sky. In addition to MacMurray, [[Nancy Olson]], [[Keenan Wynn]], [[Ed Wynn]], [[Elliott Reid]] and [[Tommy Kirk]] also co-star, reprising their roles from ''The Absent-Minded Professor''. The film was shot in [[black and white]], but a [[film colorization|colorized]] version was released on VHS in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Ned Brainard's discovery of Flubber has not quite brought him or his college the riches he thought.\n\nThe Pentagon has declared his discovery \"top secret\" and the IRS has slapped him with a huge tax bill, even though he has yet to receive any money from his invention. Ned thinks he may have found the solution in the form of \"Flubbergas\", or the \"son of Flubber\", which can actually change the weather. His wife Betsy becomes fed up with all the stress and files for divorce; the professor's old rival, Professor Shelby, starts trying to woo her again.\n\nBrainard's experiments with a ray projector device are making it rain inside people's houses all over town.  When Brainard feels threatened by Professor Shelby's attentions towards his wife, Brainard uses it to make it rain insides Shelby's car, complete with thunder and lightning, to frighten the man, causing his car to crash right into the same police car that he wrecked in ''the Absent-Minded Professor''.\n\nThe Flubbergas also helps Medfield College's football team win an important game, but it has one unfortunate side effect: Flubbergas only works on makeshift clouds, but when it comes to real clouds, there is no rain at all, instead, It shatters the glass all over town. This places Brainard on the lam from Alonzo P. Hawk, who is planning to close Medfield College, and whose insurance company must pay the claims for the broken glass. Mr. Hawk traces the damage to Ned, and threatens legal action after Ned rejects his offer to become partners in a glass company scam.\n\nAt home, Ned's wife Betsy is jealous of the attentions lavished on him by an old high school girlfriend Shelby brings around to help him win Betsy's affections. She dumps Shelby after Ned is arrested.\n\nOn trial, Ned's future seems hopeless as he is faced with the various property damage lawsuit. A prosecutor urges Ned to return to his classroom and give up his science experiments. However, the county [[Agricultural extension|agricultural extension agent]] shows the court that crops all around the town have experienced accelerated growth because of Ned's experiments, because of what the agent names \"Dry Rain\".\n\nThe professor is acquitted and he and Betsy are reunited.\n\nDriving home in their flying car, Betsy tells Ned she is now crazy about his science experiments, and soon they share a kiss. In the last scene, the football filled with Flubbergas flies into outer space.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n*[[Fred MacMurray]] as Professor Ned Brainard\n*[[Nancy Olson]] as Betsy Brainard, nee Carlisle\n*[[Keenan Wynn]] as Alonzo P.

They also each appeared in \"The Absent Minded Professor\".\n\nPlans to make a sequel to ''The Absent-Minded Professor'' were announced in November 1961.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MacMurray Set in 'Professor' Sequel: Disney Film About King Arthur; Peter Finch and Wife Co-star|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=Nov 4, 1961|work=Los Angeles Times|page=B6}}</ref> According to Walt Disney's daughter, her father (who abhorred sequels) made the film only because there were unused gags from ''The Absent-Minded Professor''.\n\nThe scene, where the Professor makes it rain into Shelby's car, causing the accident with a police car, is very similar to the scene in ''The Absent-Minded Professor'', where the Professor repeatedly jumps on top of Shelby's car, honking his Model T horn, causing an accident with the same police car.\n\nThe football game was filmed on a field constructed in a studio, with players suspended by wires.<ref>{{Cite news|title=DISNEY IMPROVES ON FLYING TACKLE: Football Players Soar in the Air in 'Son of Flubber'|author=BOSLEY CROWTHER|date=May 5, 1962|work=New York Times|page=18}}</ref>\n\nMedfield College, which was also the setting for the earlier film ''The Absent-Minded Professor'', was later used for Disney's [[Dexter Riley (film series)|Dexter Riley trilogy]]: ''[[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes]]'' (1969), ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Strongest Man in the World]]'' (1975), with all three starring [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Cesar Romero]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Son of Flubber'' was a critical and commercial success.
