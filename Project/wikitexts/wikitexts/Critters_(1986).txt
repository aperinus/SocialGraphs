It stars [[Dee Wallace]], [[M. Emmet Walsh]], [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]] and [[Scott Grimes]] in his film debut. The plot follows a group of small, furry aliens with carnivorous behavior escaping from two shape-shifting bounty hunters, landing in a small countryside town to feast on its inhabitants.\n\nAlthough widely believed to have been inspired by the success of [[Joe Dante]]'s 1984 film ''[[Gremlins]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860411/REVIEWS/604110301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Critters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/horror/dvd_stalk_asylum_masters_of_horror.html|title=DVD Stalk: Asylum, Masters of Horror, Critters, and Region Free Horror Highlights|work=dvdtalk.com}}</ref> Herek has refuted this in interviews, pointing out that the script was written by Muir long before ''Gremlins'' went into production and subsequently underwent rewrites to reduce the apparent similarities between the two films.<ref>Excerpt from interview with Stephen Herek, ''Critters'' UK VHS liner notes (Cinema Club edition)</ref> The film grossed $13.6 million during its release in the United States, and spawned a [[Critters (franchise)|''Critters'' franchise]] consisting of three sequels and a web series titled ''[[Critters: A New Binge]]'' released on [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]]. The fifth entry ''[[Critters Attack!]]'' serves as a reboot of the series.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn an [[asteroid]] prison, a group of dangerous aliens known as Krites are set to be transported to another station. The Krites engineer an escape and hijack a ship, prompting the warden to hire two shape-changing bounty hunters to pursue them to Earth. Studying life on Earth via various satellite television transmissions, the first bounty hunter assumes the form of rock star Johnny Steele, while the second remains undecided, thus retaining his blank, featureless head.\n\nOn a rural [[Kansas]] farm, the Brown family sits down to breakfast. Father Jay and mother Helen send teenage daughter April and younger son Brad off to school while waiting on mechanic Charlie McFadden. A former baseball pitcher, Charlie has become the town drunk and crackpot, with claims of alien abductions foretold by messages through his fillings.\n\nPlaying with [[Explosive device|overly potent]] self-made fireworks and Charlie's [[slingshot]], Brad takes the blame when Charlie accidentally shoots April and for Brad\u2019s punishment he gets no dinner for the day. On the roof that evening, Brad mistakes the Critters' crashing spaceship for a [[meteorite]]; Jay and Brad investigate and interrupt the creatures consuming a cow. The creatures thereafter kill and feed on a local police officer (later the second bounty hunter take his form and more the bounty hunters take his police car), and later besiege the farm and cut its electrical connection. While checking the circuit breaker, Jay is attacked by one of the Critters and, being severely wounded, just barely manages to escape.\n\nIn the barn, April is about to have sex with her boyfriend Steve when he is killed by the one of the Critters; the creature itself is slain when it devours one of Brad's lit firecrackers. The remaining Critters sabotage the Browns' and Steve's cars, forcing the Browns to hole up inside the main house. Meanwhile, the two bounty hunters search the town for the Critters, causing a panic at the church and bowling alley, with the second hunter assuming the form of various townspeople, including Charlie. Brad escapes the farm to get help and runs into the bounty hunters, and upon learning of their true nature and intentions, he leads them to the Critters' location.\n\nThe last surviving Critters kidnap April and return to their ship when the bounty hunters arrive, and attempt to flee. Charlie and Brad manage to rescue April, but Brad drops a large firecracker he intended to use to destroy the ship when the Critters discover their escape. Just as the Critters take off and destroy the farmhouse out of spite, Charlie throws a [[Molotov cocktail]] made from his whiskey bottle into the ship, causing a fire which detonates the cracker and kills the Critters. The bounty hunters leave in their ship after giving Brad a handheld device to contact them in case of future invasion, and also restore the house. Unbeknownst to them, Critter eggs can be seen in the barn inside a chicken's nest that seem to be ready to hatch.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Helen Brown\n* [[M.

Herek loved Muir's script and felt it would be fun to make a film that was \"a very smart homage to 50's B-movies.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Behind Critters, the classic cult film |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/critters-making-comedy-horror-cult-classic/}}</ref> After working on the script, he successfully pitched it to Sho Films.<ref name=afi/> Despite being set in Kansas, principal photography began in Valencia, California in July 1985 on a six-week shooting schedule.<ref name=afi/>\n\nSpecial effects coordinator Chuck Stewart hired Joseph Lombardi as a consultant for the scene of the barn exploding, where they rigged second-floor ceiling with [[Primacord]] that carried an explosive charge inside it.<ref name=afi/> The sequence of the Critter swallowing a [[cherry bomb]] was controlled by puppeteers who were positioned below in a hayloft to operate the stomach and eye movements.<ref name=afi/> Crew member Dwight Roberts commented that it took some effort to coordinate the Critters\u2019 bulging stomach and eyes as it kneeled over in the hay due to the number of people needed to articulate it.<ref name=afi/>\n\nThe role of Charlie was specifically written for [[Don Opper]], a close friend of Muir and Herek.
