The film was written and directed by [[Mark Waters]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|directing debut]]), produced by [[Robert Berger (producer)|Robert Berger]], and stars [[Parker Posey]], [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]], [[Tori Spelling]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] and [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]]. It was released in the United States by [[Miramax Films]] on October 10, 1997. ''The House of Yes'' received a divided critical reaction, with Posey winning a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Award]] and Spelling receiving a [[Razzie Award]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Thanksgiving]] in 1983, Marty Pascal travels from [[New York City]] to [[McLean, Virginia]], to visit his family: mother Mrs. Pascal, younger brother Anthony, and twin sister \"Jackie-O\". Jackie-O, recently released from a [[psychiatric hospital]], is obsessed with [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and emulates her style of dress and hairstyle. Marty surprises his family with news he is engaged; he introduces his fianc\u00e9e Lesly, a waitress at a doughnut store. Lesly's arrival disrupts the family's gathering, and Jackie-O conspires to break the couple up.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Marty and Jackie-O were involved in an [[incestuous]] relationship as teenagers. Jackie-O convinces Marty to play their favorite childhood \"game\", involving using a gun loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] to re-enact the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]]; the \"game\" serves as foreplay for sex. A horrified Lesly witnesses the encounter and speaks to Anthony, who had tried to warn her of the nature of Marty and Jackie's relationship. He convinces Lesly that he is a virgin and dying of a [[brain tumor]], leading to a brief and awkward sexual encounter.\n\nIn the morning, Lesly confronts Marty about what she witnessed. Marty breaks down and begs Lesly to return to New York with him. Jackie-O convinces Marty that she will let him leave if he agrees to play the game one final time. Armed with the gun, Jackie-O recalls the events that led to their absent father's departure; Marty claims that he walked out on the family the day of the Kennedy assassination, but Jackie-O believes that he was shot by Mrs. Pascal and buried in the backyard. Jackie-O fires the gun at Marty, now loaded with real bullets, killing him. Footage of Jackie Kennedy is then shown as Lesly screams. Lesly runs from the house and a flashback of Jackie-O in her costume as a teen is being filmed by Marty as she asks him to \u201cstop it.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Parker Posey]] as \"Jackie-O\" Pascal\n** [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as young \"Jackie-O\"\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as Marty Pascal\n** David Love as the voice of young Marty\n* [[Tori Spelling]] as Lesly\n* [[Freddie
