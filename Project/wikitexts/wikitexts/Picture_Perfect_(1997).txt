The film centers around a young advertising executive's life which becomes increasingly complicated when, in order to impress her boss, she pretends to be engaged to a man she just met. ''Picture Perfect'' was released on August 1, 1997, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $44.3 million against an $18 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nKate is struggling in the advertising business in [[New York City]]: she cannot move forward despite her talent. Her boss, Mr. Mercer, passes her up for a promotion because she is \"not stable enough\". Her co-worker, Darcy, invents a story claiming Kate is engaged to Nick, a freelance videographer who lives in [[Massachusetts]], with whom Kate had her picture taken during a friend's wedding.\n\nAll seems to work out well for Kate and she gets her promotion, but after Nick saves a little girl from a fire and winds up in the news, Kate is asked to bring her alleged fianc\u00e9 to dinner with Mercer and his wife. She goes to Boston to ask Nick to do it and to \"break up\" with her during the evening. Nick, who likes Kate, agrees to please Kate. Meanwhile, Sam, a colleague that Kate had always wanted, takes notice of her because she is engaged, and they have sex on two occasions.\n\nNick arrives in New York and stays at Kate's apartment, and as they get to know each other, she starts to like him. When they are out at the dinner with Mercer, Nick compliments Kate and expresses his desire for a future with her. Kate just wants their \"fight\" to happen, and after unsuccessfully trying to incite Nick at the dinner table, she pays a restaurant employee to call her mobile phone and makes out that Nick is having an affair with an ex-girlfriend. Nick figures it out and finally plays along. Next day, after his attempt to woo Kate fails, he returns to Boston.\n\nA week later, Kate finds a special gift which Nick had left her, and it prompts her to admit the fake to Mercer and her co-workers, stating that she was dressing for the job she wanted (repeating a line that Mercer had used on her earlier regarding her instability). When she tells him she is quitting, Mercer admits how he had exaggerated his own past at one point in his life. He lets Kate keep her job, and suggests she take a few days off to go to see Nick.\n\nKate walks in while Nick is recording a church wedding and he rebuffs her attempts to patch things up, until she interrupts the ceremony at a crucial point. Watched by the entire wedding assembly, she apologizes for the way she treated him. He invites her to stay for the wedding reception and dinner afterwards, and they embrace, as the congregation applaud them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Kate Mosley\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Nick\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Sam Mayfair\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Rita Mosley\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Darcy O'Neil\n* [[Matthew Sussman]] as Darcy's Husband\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Mr. Mercer\n* [[Faith Prince]] as Mrs. Mercer\n* [[Anne Twomey (actor)|Anne Twomey]] as Sela\n* [[John Rothman]] as Jim Davenport\n* Meg Gibson as Mrs. Davenport\n* [[Paul Cassell]] as Brad\n* Marcia DeBonis as Rosie\n* [[Amelia Campbell]] as Susan\n* [[Faran Tahir]] as Sajit\n* [[Ivar Brogger]], [[Peter McRobbie]] and [[Jenna Stern]] as The Ad Executives\n* [[Bellina Logan]] as Agency Receptionist\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Agency Researcher\n* [[Andrea Bendewald]] as Pregnant Friend\n* David Cromwell as Minister\n* Jessica Cushman as Bride\n* [[Kaley Cuoco]] as Little Girl at the wedding\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Date (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner [[Tom Fleischman]] is the [[re-recording mixer]] of the film.
