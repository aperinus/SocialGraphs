Diana works as a real estate agent, while David hopes to establish himself as an architect by designing their dream home. The couple invest everything they have in David's project, purchasing beachfront property in [[Santa Monica]] and beginning construction, but the [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|recession]] leaves Diana without houses to sell and David without a job. In desperate need of $50,000 to save their land from being repossessed, they travel to [[Las Vegas]], determined to win the money.\n\nAt a casino, Diana catches the eye of billionaire John Gage, while David wins over $25,000 at [[craps]]. Reveling in their winnings, Diana assures David that she loves him regardless of the money. The next day, they lose everything at [[roulette]]; leaving the casino, they notice a crowd gathered to watch Gage play [[poker]]. Gage asks Diana to join him for good luck, and she makes a winning craps roll on his $1 million bet. As thanks, Gage insists on paying for the Murphys' stay, gifting them a lavish hotel suite and a dress he saw Diana admire. After an enjoyable evening together, Gage offers the couple $1 million to allow him to spend a night with Diana, but she and David refuse.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, the Murphys agree to Gage's proposal, and David contacts his lawyer, who prepares a contract for the arrangement. Leaving Diana with Gage, David has a change of heart and races to stop them, but arrives just as they depart by helicopter. Gage flies Diana to his private yacht, and offers her a chance to void their deal and return to her husband if he loses a toss of his lucky coin. He wins the toss, and Diana spends the night with him.\n\nAgreeing to forget the incident, the Murphys return home, and learn their property was [[foreclosure|foreclosed]] and resold. Overcome with jealousy, David accuses Diana of continuing to see Gage after finding his business card in her wallet, which she denies knowing about. Discovering that it was Gage who bought out their land, Diana angrily confronts him, and rejects his attempts to pursue her. When she informs David, their tension reaches a breaking point and they separate; Diana later tells him to keep all the money.\n\nWeeks later, Gage visits Diana at work and renews his advances. Initially resistant, she eventually consents to spending time with him, and a romance develops between them. Haunted by happy memories of his wife, David hits rock bottom, leading to a public confrontation with Gage and Diana. He pulls his life back together and finds a teaching position, and Diana files for divorce. Finding her at a zoo benefit with Gage, David donates the entire $1 million in a charity auction bid, then makes his peace with Diana and signs their divorce papers.\n\nRealizing that Diana will never love him the way she loves David, Gage lies to her that she is merely the latest member of his \"million-dollar club\" of women. Seeing through his deception, she gratefully ends their relationship; before parting ways, he gives her his lucky coin, which she realizes is double-headed. Diana returns to the pier where David proposed to her seven years earlier, finding him there. Repeating their unique declaration of love, they join hands.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Robert Redford]] as John Gage<ref>{{cite news|title=For Some, the Signs Are Unsettling|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1993-04-18|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-18/entertainment/ca-24113_1_robert-redford-indecent-proposal-women-s-rights|access-date=2010-10-24|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein|archive-date=2018-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030021407/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-18/entertainment/ca-24113_1_robert-redford-indecent-proposal-women-s-rights|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Diana Murphy\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as David Murphy\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Mr. Shackleford, Gage's chauffeur\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Jeremy Green\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Day Tripper\n* [[Rip Taylor]] as Mr. Langford<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8G-_BAAAQBAJ&q=Rip+Taylor+as+Mr.+Langford&pg=PT146|title=Demi Moore - The Most Powerful Woman in Hollywood|first=Nigel|last=Goodall|publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]|location=[[Edinburgh]]|year=2000|isbn=978-1840182699|access-date=2020-10-05|archive-date=2020-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105174117/https://books.google.com/books?id=8G-_BAAAQBAJ&q=Rip+Taylor+as+Mr.+Langford&pg=PT146|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwJubSLM60EC&dq=Rip+Taylor+as+Mr.+Langford&pg=PT63|title=Screen World 1993|volume=44|first=John A.|last=Willis|author-link=John A.
