Its plot follows six people who seek shelter during a storm in the mansion of an elderly puppetmaker and his wife, only to find that the various puppets and dolls in the home contain the imprisoned spirits of criminals. It was produced by [[Charles Band]] and [[Brian Yuzna]] through Band's [[Empire Pictures]].\n\nThe film grossed $3.5 million worldwide against a budget of $2 million and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA violent thunderstorm strands young Judy, her father David, and her stepmother Rosemary in the English countryside. Seeking shelter, the trio break into a nearby mansion, where they meet the owners, a kindly older couple named Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke. Learning that Judy has \"''lost''\" her beloved stuffed bear Teddy (in fact, the cruel Rosemary threw Teddy into the bushes), Gabriel gives Judy a doll named [[Punch and Judy|Mr. Punch]]. Three more people arrive at the mansion, also seeking shelter from the storm: Good-natured American businessman Ralph and English hitchhikers Isabel and Enid. Gabriel invites them all to stay the night.\n\nJudy soon discovers that the mansion is full of beautifully detailed [[toy]]s and [[doll]]s like Mr. Punch; Gabriel explains that he and his wife are toy makers. Judy and Ralph are both overjoyed, and the latter is something of a child at heart who has never given up his love and fondness of toys.\n\nIsabel and Enid are actually [[Thief|petty thieves]] who hitchhiked with Ralph intending to [[Pickpocketing|pick his pocket]]. That night, Isabel sneaks out of her room to [[Burglary|rob the mansion]]. Instead, she is brutally attacked by dolls who caught her in the midst of her thievery who then drag her into the darkness. Judy, in the hallway, briefly sees the attack and she rushes to tell her father David. However, David is a neglectful and uncaring father; both he and Rosemary accuse Judy of making up stories. Instead, Judy convinces Ralph to check out the hallway with her. Ralph is initially very skeptical, but he eventually begins believing Judy after her Mr. Punch doll briefly speaks to them.\n\nRosemary is later attacked by the dolls; in the midst of escaping them, she ends up accidentally overleaping out of a window to her death. Enid searches for Isabel and finds her almost entirely transformed into a doll version of herself. A horde of toys attack and kill Enid as she attempts to escape. Meanwhile, Ralph gets accidentally caught in a trap the dolls set for the other adults before Judy convinces them to save him; because he is her friend and has done nothing wrong. David discovers Rosemary's dead body placed in his bed and believes that Ralph killed her.\n\nNow safe from the dolls, Judy and Ralph enter the workshop where the irate David finds them. Ralph tries to explain that the dolls attacked the others for their actions, but David refuses to listen, knocking both his daughter and Ralph unconscious in his rage. Then, Mr. Punch comes to life and attacks David. Other dolls intervene, dragging the unconscious Ralph and Judy away to safety as Mr. Punch is destroyed by David after a fierce struggle.\n\nThe Hartwickes appear and explain that they are a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] couple who see toys as the heart and soul of childhood. Gabriel and Hilary dislike the bitterness of adults, and when people seek shelter at their mansion, the dolls serve as a test for the visitors. People like Ralph (who appreciate the joy of childhood) and children like Judy are spared and leave the house with a fuller appreciation of life. However, those who refuse to change their ways (like David, Rosemary, Enid, and Isabel) can never leave and have to start all over and play a new role in the world as toys forever. As the Hartwickes explain this, the incredulous yet insane and threatening David is slowly (and agonizingly) transformed into a doll to replace Mr. Punch.\n\nThe next morning, the Hartwickes convince the reawakened Ralph and Judy that the night's events were just a dream. Gabriel reads a fake letter from David explaining to Judy that he and Rosemary are changing their names and leaving the country with Enid and Isabel. Judy will be able to stay permanently with her caring mother in Boston and that \"''David''\" has left Judy and Ralph enough money to buy plane tickets to [[Boston, New York|Boston]]. Ralph and Judy leave the house, and as they drive away, Judy hints to him that if he would like to stay with her and her mother, he could be Judy's new father. Ralph seems interested in the idea.\n\nThe film ends with dolls of David, Rosemary, Enid, and Isabel sitting on a shelf while outside another car with a set of [[Dysfunctional family|obnoxious parents]] gets stuck in mud near the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* Ian Patrick Williams as David Bower\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Rosemary Bower\n* Carrie Lorraine as Judy Bower\n* [[Guy Rolfe]] as Gabriel Hartwicke\n* [[Hilary Mason]] as Hilary Hartwicke\n* [[Bunty Bailey]] as Isabel Prange\n* Cassie Stuart as Enid\n* [[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as Ralph Morris\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Stuart Gordon]] came across [[Ed Naha]]'s script for ''Dolls'' at [[Empire Pictures]] and became interested in directing it.<ref name=GallaDire>{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John Andrew |chapter=Stuart Gordon |title=Film Directors on Directing |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1989 |pages=96\u201397 |isbn=9780275932725 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/92}}</ref> Inspired by the book ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' by [[Bruno Bettelheim]], Gordon conceived the film as horror [[fairy tale]] in the vein of \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\".<ref name=GallaDire/>\n\n''Dolls'' extensively uses [[stop motion]] animation by [[David W.

He also opined that dolls are intrinsically not frightening due to their cute appearance, writing, \"The haunted house looks magnificent, but so what, if it's not haunted by great and frightening creatures? At some point ''Dolls'' remains only an idea, a concept. It doesn't become an engine to shock and involve us.\" He gave it two out of four stars.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 27, 1987 | last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Dolls movie review & film summary (1987) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dolls-1987 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\nAin't It Cool News reviewed the DVD, calling it \"a movie that really stands above the type of film you might expect from this era, with this subject matter.\"<ref>[https://aintitcool.com/node/47172 A Movie A Day: DOLLS (1987) Toys are very loyal and that is a fact.] Ain't It Cool News</ref> HorrorNews.net's Jeff Colebank listed the toymaking couple as one of the 13 Best Horror Movie Couples, stating that Rolfe was \"the creepiest toymaker of them all\".<ref>[https://horrornews.net/30203/list-the-13-best-horror-movie-couples-serial-murder-edition/ The 13 Best Horror Movie Couples (serial murder edition)] HorrorNews.net</ref> ''[[Allmovie]]''{{'}}s review of the film was mildly favorable, calling it \"a serious-minded, lovingly-crafted modern fairy tale that only misses classic status by a few clumsy, low-budget moments.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allmovie.com/movie/dolls-v14236/review |title=Dolls (1987) |author=Robert Firsching |work=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=July 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''Dolls'' was released to DVD by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] on September 20, 2005, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and by the Scream Factory division of Shout!

The initial story would have followed Judy and Ralph back to Boston in which Ralph would have married Judy's mother and they would become a family. One day Judy would receive a box sent from England that contained the toy makers, Gabriel and Hilary, as dolls.
