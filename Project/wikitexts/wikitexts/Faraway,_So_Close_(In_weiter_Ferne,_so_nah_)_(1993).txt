({{lang-de|'''In weiter Ferne, so nah!'''}}) is a 1993 German [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Wim Wenders]]. The screenplay is by Wenders, [[Richard Reitinger]] and Ulrich Zieger. It is a sequel to Wenders' 1987 film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''.{{refn|group=n|name=\"Sequel\"|Although Wenders rejected the notion of the [[sequel]],<ref name=\"Willman\"/> critics<ref name=\"Howe\"/><ref name=\"Corliss\"/> and scholars{{sfn|Jesinghausen|2000|p=80}}{{sfn|Detweiler|2017}} recognized it as such nevertheless. Writer Andrew Tate described it as a \"semisequel\" instead.{{sfn|Tate|2011|p=23}}}} Actors [[Otto Sander]], [[Bruno Ganz]] and [[Peter Falk]] reprise their roles as angels who have become human. The film also stars [[Nastassja Kinski]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Heinz R\u00fchmann]], in his last film role.\n\nThe story follows the angel Cassiel, who unlike his friend Damiel, chose not to become human in the original despite being told of the joys of life. Cassiel only becomes human in the [[German reunification|reunified]] Berlin, but quickly becomes involved in a criminal enterprise that threatens his newfound life and his friends.\n\nWenders opted to pursue the project, desiring to make a film set in Berlin after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]]. Sander also wished to pursue a storyline in which his character becomes human, and contributed ideas for the plot. ''Faraway, So Close!'' won the ''[[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix du Jury]]'' at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]], but enjoyed less critical success than its predecessor.\n\n==Plot==\nCassiel and Raphaella, two [[angel]]s, observe the busy life of reunited [[Berlin]]. Due to their divine origin, they can hear the thoughts of the people around them, and try to console a dying man. Cassiel has been following his friend Damiel (a former angel), who senses his presence and talks about his experiences as a human. He owns a [[pizza parlor]] named Casa dell'angelo (Angel's House) and has married Marion, a [[trapeze]] artist whom he met when an angel. She works in a local bar in [[West Berlin]], and the two have a young daughter, Doria.\n\nCassiel follows Raissa Becker, an 11-year-old girl who lives in the former [[East Berlin]]. He observes her life and notices that she and her mother Hanna Becker are being followed by [[Philip Winter]], a detective who works for Anton Baker. The latter is an American [[arms trafficking|arms dealer]] and pornographer who owns a transport company.\n\nCassiel follows Hanna Becker (and Winter) to an abandoned building in the outskirts of East Berlin. As Raphaella and Cassiel sit on top of the [[Brandenburg Gate]], he expresses a desire to experience human life. Visiting Raissa, he finds her alone at her flat and leaning over the balcony railing. As she falls, Cassiel tries to save her and suddenly becomes human, catching the child. He has to adjust to the transformation, learning to modulate the volume of his voice and to negotiate streets and avoid being hit by cars. His only possession is an angel's armor, which became tangible when he leaped into humanity. In the [[Rapid transit|underground]] (subway), Cassiel is tricked into gambling by Emit Flesti, losing his armor and money won during the game. Raphaella begs Flesti to give Cassiel time to understand what it is to be a human; he agrees but does not promise to stop hunting him.\n\nArrested and detained, Cassiel struggles to satisfy police demands for identification. He cannot give (or comprehend) his name or address, but refers the police to his friend's pizza shop. Damiel arrives at the station and takes his now human friend home. Tricked by Flesti into drinking alcohol, he becomes [[alcoholism|addicted]] and robs a shop with a gun taken from a teenager, who had been planning to kill his abusive  stepfather. Cassiel begins begging to make his way and feigns a car accident with Baker to compel him to pay for the forging of a passport and birth certificate he has ordered under the name Karl Engel (Charles Angel). Baker hires Cassiel as his [[valet]], to pass him cards for cheating his fellow gangsters at poker. Stopping by Casa dell'Angelo to return items borrowed from Damiel, Cassiel encounters Flesti again. He is collecting money from Damiel, after having loaned him money to set up the business. After Cassiel saves Baker's life, Baker makes Cassiel his partner. But after learning the true nature of his business, Cassiel decides to leave Baker's service and stop him. Winter is killed by Flesti.\n\nWith the help of former angel [[Peter Falk]], Cassiel gets into Baker's airport storage area. His team takes all the weapons and destroy the pornography copying machines. They send the weapons to a [[barge]] owned by other friends. Once having completed the plan, Cassiel feels ready to live as a human, but Flesti reports that Baker's rival, Patzke, has hijacked the barge with Baker's and Cassiel's friends inside. Becker is also captured and reunites with his sister, Hannah, on board.\n\nFlesti reveals himself as [[Father Time|Time]] and says that he has to make Cassiel understand he does not belong in the human world; he has a word written on his forehead. At a boat lift, Cassiel gets on the barge and frees Raissa, moments before being killed. Flesti slows time so the rest can take over the barge and save the entire party. Cassiel's friends are saddened by his death, but when Damiel hears a ring in his ear, he understands that Cassiel has been reinstated as an angel and is near, and Damiel laughs in joy.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Mikhail Gorbachev Vancouver March 1993.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Ex-[[President of the Soviet Union|Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] appeared as himself.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Otto Sander]] as Cassiel{{refn|group=n|name=\"DamielCassiel\"|While working on the original, Wenders found the names [[Cassiel]] and Damiel in an encyclopedia about angels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1290-on-wings-of-desire |title=On Wings of Desire |last=Wenders |first=Wim |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=9 November 2009 |access-date=5 July 2017}}</ref>}} \n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Damiel{{refn|group=n|name=\"DamielCassiel\"}}\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Raphaela\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Tony Baker\n* [[R\u00fcdiger Vogler]] as [[Philip Winter]]{{refn|group=n|name=\"Winter\"|In Wenders' filmography, beginning with ''[[Alice in the Cities]]'', Vogler played a character named Phillip Winter numerous times, though the various Winters may not be the same character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/criterion-offers-loose-trilogy-wim-wenders-king-ro-237372 |title=Criterion offers a loose trilogy from Wim Wenders, king of the road movie |last=D'Angelo |first=Mike |date=28 May 2016 |access-date=9 June 2016 |work=[[The A.V.
