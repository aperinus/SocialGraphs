Directed by [[Kazuki Akane]], the film is a re-telling of the 26-episode anime [[television series]] ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]''.  While the plot of the film has some similar elements to the original television series, the characters differ in varying degrees from the television counterparts, with many completely redesigned and bearing little resemblance to the originals. The world of Gaea has a more Asian design than the heavily European influenced television series.<ref name=\"AnimeEncyc\">{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Clements |author2=Helen McCarthy |author2-link=Helen McCarthy |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |page=115 |edition=1st }}</ref>\n\nThe film was licensed for [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] release by [[Bandai Entertainment]], which gave the film a theatrical release on January 25, 2002. A [[soundtrack]] and two drama CDs have also been released in Japan by [[Victor Entertainment]] in relation to the series.\n\n==Plot==\nHitomi Kanzaki is in crisis. Her life has lost its meaning, and she is plagued by unusual dreams. She is depressed and wants nothing more than to disappear. After falling out with her only friend, she is mysteriously summoned to another world, Gaea, where she finds herself inside Escaflowne, a doomsday weapon destined to come to life at the appearance of a prophesied \"wing goddess\". The world of Gaea is facing its own crisis: relentless conquest by the Black Dragon Clan, the rebels against which become convinced that Hitomi is the prophesied goddess who will revive Escaflowne.  Never certain of her identity in Gaea, Hitomi finds her destiny as she becomes closer to the rebel leader, Lord Van, and helps to bring about the fall of his vengeful brother Lord Folken, the master of the Black Dragon Clan.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With character re-designs by [[Nobuteru Y\u016bki]], the film focuses on the relationship between Van and Hitomi and their personal issues. The characters themselves are also given different personalities, with the film Hitomi changing from a cheerful girl in love to a depressed, suicidal schoolgirl who is suffering from self-induced feelings of loneliness and alienation.<ref name=\"animeondvdrev\">{{cite web | last=Beveridge |first=Chris| date=2005-04-15 | title=Escaflowne Movie: Standard Edition |url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/995.php | publisher=AnimenOnDVD.com | access-date=2006-07-31 }}</ref> Van is also depicted as being more lonely and emotionally reserved, as well as being far more aggressive and willing to slay any perceived enemies than his more pacifistic series counterpart.\n\nAlthough the ''Vision of Escaflowne'' series had been produced by Sunrise, the animation for the film was handled primarily by studio Bones, a company founded by a number of ex-Sunrise staff. It was the first Bones feature film production. Studio co-founder [[Hiroshi \u014csaka]] and character designer Nobuteru Y\u016bki split the animation director duties, with \u014csaka heading up production at Bones. Some of the film's action sequences were assigned to the studio's animators as talent showcases, notably including Yutaka Nakamura (who animated nearly a minute and a half of the opening sword fight without assistance).\n\nThe soundtrack was, as with the ''Vision of Escaflowne'' series, composed mostly by [[Yoko Kanno]] in collaboration with [[Hajime Mizoguchi]].\n\n==Release==\nThe first European presentation was on January 19, 2001, during the Future Film Festival in Bologna (Italy). The North American theatrical premiere was on January 25, 2002, in select cities, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and Vancouver. The North American television premiere was September 10, 2005, on the [[Cartoon Network]] programming block [[Adult Swim]], after airing on [adult swim] on demand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-08-04/escaflowne-the-movie-on-cartoon-network|title=Escaflowne the Movie on Cartoon Network|work=Anime News Network|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n[[Bandai Visual]] released the film to DVD in a two-disc limited edition set on April 25, 2001.
