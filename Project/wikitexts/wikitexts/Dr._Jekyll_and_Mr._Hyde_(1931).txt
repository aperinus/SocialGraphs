The film is an adaptation of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', the 1886 [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] tale of a man who takes a potion which turns him from a mild-mannered man of science into a [[homicide|homicidal]] maniac.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success upon its release. Nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], March won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], sharing the award with [[Wallace Beery]] for ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll]] ([[Fredric March]]), a kind English doctor in [[Victorian era|Victorian London]], is certain that within each man lurks impulses for both good and evil. He is desperately in love with his fianc\u00e9e Muriel Carew ([[Rose Hobart]]) and wants to marry her immediately. But her father, Brigadier General Sir Danvers Carew ([[Halliwell Hobbes]]), orders them to wait. One night, while walking home with his colleague, Dr. John Lanyon ([[Holmes Herbert]]), Jekyll spots a bar singer, Ivy Pierson ([[Miriam Hopkins]]), being attacked by a man outside her boarding house. Jekyll drives the man away and carries Ivy up to her room to attend to her. Ivy tries to seduce Jekyll but, though he is tempted, he leaves with Lanyon.\n\nWhen Sir Danvers takes Muriel to Bath, Jekyll begins to experiment with drugs that he believes will unleash his evil side. After imbibing a concoction of these drugs, he transforms into Edward Hyde\u2014an impulsive, sadistic, violent, amoral man who indulges his every desire. Hyde finds Ivy in the [[music hall]] where she works. He offers to financially support her in return for her company. They stay at her boarding house where Hyde rapes and psychologically manipulates her. When Hyde reads in the paper that Sir Danvers and Muriel are planning to return to [[London]], Hyde leaves Ivy but threatens her that he'll return when she least expects it.\n\nOvercome with guilt, Jekyll sends \u00a350 to Ivy. On the advice of her landlady, Ivy goes to see Dr. Jekyll and recognizes him as the man who saved her from abuse that night. She tearfully tells him about her situation with Hyde, and Jekyll reassures her that she will never see Hyde again. But the next night, while walking to a party at Muriel's where the wedding date is to be announced, Jekyll spontaneously changes into Hyde. Rather than attend the party, Hyde goes to Ivy's room and murders her.\n\nHyde returns to Jekyll's house but is refused admission by the butler. Desperate, Hyde writes a letter to Lanyon instructing him to take certain chemicals from Jekyll's laboratory and take them home. When Hyde arrives, Lanyon pulls a gun on him and demands that Hyde take him to Jekyll. With no other choice, Hyde drinks the formula and changes back into Jekyll before a shocked Lanyon.\n\nAware that he cannot control the transformations, Jekyll goes to the Carew home and breaks off the engagement. After he leaves, he stands on the terrace and watches Muriel cry. This triggers another transformation and, as Hyde, he enters the house and assaults Muriel. Sir Danvers tries to stop him, but Hyde beats him to death with Jekyll's walking stick then flees back to Jekyll's laboratory where he takes the formula again and reverts to Jekyll.\n\nLanyon recognizes the broken cane left at the crime scene and takes the police to Jekyll's home. Jekyll tells them that Hyde has already left, Lanyon insists that Jekyll and Hyde are one and the same. The stress causes another transformation into Hyde and, after a fierce struggle, Hyde is shot by the police. Dying, he transforms back into Jekyll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fredric March]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Miriam Hopkins]] as Ivy Pierson\n* [[Rose Hobart]] as Muriel Carew\n* [[Holmes Herbert]] as Dr. John Lanyon\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Brigadier-General Danvers Carew\n* [[Edgar Norton]] as Poole\n* [[Tempe Pigott]] as Mrs. Hawkins\n* [[Arnold Lucy]] as Utterson ''(uncredited)''\n* Colonel McDonnell as Hobson ''(uncredited)''\n<small>'''Source:<ref name=\"afi\">{{AFI film|7380}}</ref>'''</small>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:DrJekyllandMrHyde1931E.png|thumb|336px|[[Wally Westmore]]'s iconic make-up transformed [[Fredric March]]'s [[Doctor Jekyll]] into the grotesquely simian [[Mr Hyde]].]] \nThe film was made prior to the full enforcement of the [[Production Code]] and is remembered today for its strong sexual content, embodied mostly in the character of the bar singer, Ivy Pierson, played by [[Miriam Hopkins]]. When it was re-released in 1936, the Code required 8 minutes to be removed before the film could be distributed to theaters. This footage was restored for the [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022835/alternateversions Alternate versions for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)]</ref>\n\nThe secret of the transformation scenes was not revealed for decades (Mamoulian himself revealed it in a volume of interviews with Hollywood directors published under the title ''The Celluloid Muse''). Make-up was applied in contrasting colors. A series of colored filters that matched the make-up was then used which enabled the make-up to be gradually exposed or made invisible. The change in color was not visible on the [[black-and-white]] film.<ref name=tcmart>Miller, Frank [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/13756/dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde#articles-reviews \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)\" (article)] [[TCM.com]]</ref>\n\n[[Wally Westmore]]'s make-up for Hyde \u2014 simian and hairy with large [[canine teeth]] \u2014 influenced greatly the popular image of Hyde in media and comic books. In part this reflected the novella's implication of Hyde as embodying repressed evil, and hence being semi-evolved or simian in appearance. The characters of Muriel Carew and Ivy Pierson do not appear in Stevenson's original story; Ivy Pierson's character is original to the film, while Muriel [Agnes] Carew does appear in the 1887 [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1887 play)|stage version]] by playwright [[Thomas Russell Sullivan]].\n\n[[John Barrymore]] was originally asked by Paramount to play the lead role, in an attempt to recreate his role from the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920 film)|1920 version of Jekyll and Hyde]], but he was already under a new contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Paramount then gave the part to March, who was under contract and who bore a physical resemblance to Barrymore. March had played a John Barrymore-like character in the Paramount film ''[[The Royal Family of Broadway]]'' (1930), a story about an acting family similar to the [[Barrymore family|Barrymores]]. March, following stage tradition, overplayed both Jekyll and Hyde to emphasize their contrasts<ref>{{cite book |last=Brottman |first=Mikita |author-link=Mikita Brottman |title=High Theory / Low Culture |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2005 |location=New York City |pages=117 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWfIAAAAQBAJ |isbn=1-4039-6640-0}}</ref> and would go on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance of the role.<ref name=tcmart />\n\nWhen [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[remake|remade]] the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|film]] 10 years later with [[Spencer Tracy]] in the lead, the studio bought the negative and the rights to both the Mamoulian version and the earlier 1920 silent version, paying $1,250,000.

Alfred Rushford Greason wrote that \"the picture doesn't build to an effective climax\" because it was too slow and labored in getting there, and that while the initial transformation sequence \"carries a terrific punch\", its effect became lessened with successive uses. However, Greason credited March with \"an outstanding bit of theatrical acting\", declared the makeup \"a triumph\", and said that the sets and lighting alone made the film worth seeing \"as models of atmospheric surroundings.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Greason |first=Aldred Rushford |date=January 5, 1932 |title=Jekyll and Hyde |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |page=19 }}</ref>\n\n[[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported that the film \"has its full storage of horror\" and was \"well acted\".
