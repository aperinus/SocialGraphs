It was released in the [[United States]] on November 27, 2007. It was the first ''Futurama'' production since the original season four finale \"[[The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings]]\". ''Bender's Big Score'', along with the three follow-up films, comprise [[Futurama (season 5)|season five]] of ''Futurama'', with each film being separated into four episodes of the broadcast season. ''Bender's Big Score'' made its broadcast premiere on [[Comedy Central]] on March 23, 2008.<ref name=\"Futon Critic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7549 |title=Comedy Central's \"South Park\", \"Li'l Bush\", More to Return in March |author=The Futon Critic Staff |date=February 7, 2008}}</ref> The film was written by [[Ken Keeler]], based on a story by Keeler and [[David X. Cohen]], and [[film director|directed]] by [[Dwayne Carey-Hill]].\n\nSpecial appearances include [[Coolio]] as [[Kwanzaa]]-bot, [[Al Gore]] as himself, [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Chanukah]] Zombie, [[Tom Kenny]] as Fry's older brother Yancy, and [[Sarah Silverman]] returning as Fry's ex-girlfriend Michelle (having previously voiced the role in \"[[The Cryonic Woman]]\").\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\nTwo years after Box Network executives canceled Planet Express' contract, the executives are fired and Planet Express is back \"on the air.\" As the crew celebrates, [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] is decapitated, causing his wife [[List of Futurama characters#LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]] to leave him. His head is placed in a jar while his body is repaired. Lars, who performs the procedure, flirts with [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], much to [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]]'s chagrin.\n\nDuring a delivery to a nude beach planet, Leela discovers a tattoo of [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] on Fry's buttocks. Alien scammers (Nudar, Fleb and Schlump) obtain the crew's personal information and infect Bender with an obedience virus, allowing them to seize control of Planet Express. The scammers discover that Fry's tattoo has a code that allows time travel into the past. [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]] warns the scammers against using the code.\n\n[[File:Benderbigscoreships.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bender destroys New York while being pursued by Swedish authorities in 2308, one of the many moments of continuity with previous episodes.]]\nThe scammers have Bender use the code to steal valuable objects from Earth's past, storing them in a cave beneath the Planet Express building. Hermes has Bender retrieve an earlier version of his body so he can win back his wife. Leela and Lars date, further depressing Fry.\n\nOnce the scammers have history's treasures, they decide to eliminate the time code by killing Fry. Fry uses the code to escape to [[Space Pilot 3000|January 1, 2000, just after he was frozen]]. The scammers send Bender after him. Bender arrives before Fry, creating a duplicate of himself when he has to use the bathroom. Another Bender from \"way at the end\" appears, opens Fry's cryogenic tube and puts the tattoo on his butt. When Fry arrives, the first duplicate of Bender inadvertently initiates a self-destruct due to not going to the bathroom. Fry shoves that Bender into another tube, then escapes. The original Bender spends twelve years hunting Fry before seemingly killing him by blowing up his apartment.\n\nBender reports his success to the scammers, who erase the time code and the virus. The crew holds a memorial for Fry, but he suddenly appears. Fry says he created a duplicate of himself, which remained in the past while he accidentally fell into his cryo-tube. When Fry (plus the Fry that was originally frozen) awoke 1,000 years later, the present Fry froze himself until the current year. The Fry in 2000 spent the years before Bender's attack working at Panucci's Pizzeria, then at an aquarium caring for Leelu, an orphaned narwhal. He also spent time with his family and tended to his beloved dog Seymour Asses. Nibbler removes the tattoo from Fry to keep the scammers from further abusing it. Leela and Lars decide to marry, but during the wedding, Hermes is again decapitated. [[List of Futurama characters#Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] says that Hermes' body would have died anyway; time paradox duplicates are doomed to die prematurely. Lars panics and breaks up with Leela.\n\nThe scammers trick [[Richard Nixon (Futurama)|Earth President Richard Nixon]] into giving Earth to them. Exiled to Neptune, the population assembles a fleet with the aid of Robot Santa, Kwanzaabot and the Hanukah Zombie. Hermes has his brain wired into the ship's battle computer, allowing him to destroy the scammers' fleet and win back his wife.\n\nFry arranges for Leela to meet with Lars at the cryogenic lab. Having survived the attack, Nudar ambushes them. Lars tricks Nudar into approaching the Bender duplicate on self-destruct and holds him against the duplicate, who explodes, killing them. The explosion reveals the Bender tattoo on Lars.\n\nDuring Lars' funeral, the Planet Express crew learn from his video will that he was the duplicate of Fry who survived Bender's attack in 2012; the explosion changed his appearance and voice. Lars froze himself to return to the future and be with Leela. When he learned that time paradox duplicates were doomed, he canceled the wedding to spare Leela the pain of his death.\n\nBender removes Lars' tattoo and travels to 2000 to place it on Fry in the cryogenic tube so that the events that transpired \"make any sense at all\". Upon returning, Bender emerges with all the duplicates from his stealing sprees. Nibbler urges everyone to evacuate the universe before swallowing himself. The Bender duplicates explode, causing a tear in the fabric of space, leading to the events of \"[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]\".\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Billy West]] as [[Philip J.

The song \"I May As Well Jump\" (also referred to as \"Street Song\") exposited the dissatisfaction of most of the characters with the ways their lives were progressing at that point in the plotline, except for Lars and Leela, who were contrastingly delighted to announce their happiness and their upcoming marriage. The song \"This Trinity's Goin' to War\" (also referred to as \"This Toyshop's Goin' to War\") exposited the plans of Robot Santa, Chanukah Zombie, and Kwanzaa-bot to provide military support to assist in the liberation of Earth. The movie also contains a cover of [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]'s \"30 Century Man\" performed by The Jigsaw Seen.\n\n==Release==\n''Bender's Big Score'' made its broadcast premiere on Comedy Central on March 23, 2008.<ref name=\"Futon Critic\" /> The film was broken into four separate episodes which served as the first part of ''Futurama''{{'}}s fifth season, followed by ''[[The Beast with a Billion Backs]]'', ''[[Bender's Game]]'', and ''[[Into the Wild Green Yonder]]''. The TV movie was screened in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Sky1]], which started airing ''Bender's Big Score'' on October 26, 2008. After being aired in four separate episodes, the next three movies were aired, with each of them being broken up into four episodes; creating a fifth season comprising 16 episodes overall. ''Bender's Big Score'' aired in Canada on October 12, 2008 on the [[Global Television Network]].\n\nIn the broadcast premiere, the extended opening from the film is placed before the scene where Hermes is decapitated as opposed to after it. The first two scenes in the montage of Leela and Lars' dates were cut. The original opening subtitle \"IT JUST WON'T STAY DEAD!\" is kept as the opening subtitle of the first part. The three additional opening captions are: \"Watch, Rinse, Repeat\", \"Apply directly to the foreclaw\" (a reference to [[HeadOn]]), and \"Last Known Transmission of the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble Telescope]].\" The billboard scene in all four is identical to the single scene in the film, a snippet from \"[[Space Pilot 3000]]\" where Fry gets frozen.\n\n===Home media===\n''Futurama: Bender's Big Score'' is the first [[carbon neutral|carbon-neutral]] DVD to be released by 20th Century Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/a-carbon-neutral-futurama.html|title=A Carbon Neutral Futurama|first=Josh|last=Peterson|date=November 16, 2008|website=[[TreeHugger]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gei.newscorp.com/case-studies/futurama-into-the-wild-green-y.html |title=Case Studies: Futurama's DVDs Go Carbon Neutral |website=GEI.NewsCorp.com |access-date=2012-09-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519091502/http://gei.newscorp.com/case-studies/futurama-into-the-wild-green-y.html |archive-date=May 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The studio worked to reduce the carbon impact of DVD manufacture and distribution.
