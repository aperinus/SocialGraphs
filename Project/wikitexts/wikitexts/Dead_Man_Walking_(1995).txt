He is a prisoner on [[death row]] in [[Louisiana]], and she visits him as his spiritual adviser after corresponding with him.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success; it grossed $83 million on a budget of $11 million and received praise for the performances of Penn and Sarandon, as well as Robbins' direction. Sarandon's performance won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], while Robbins, Penn and [[Bruce Springsteen]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], respectively, for the single \"Dead Man Walkin'\".\n\n==Plot==\nMatthew Poncelet, who was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for the murder of a teenage couple, has been on death row at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] for six years. He committed his crimes with Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] without parole. As his scheduled execution date approaches, Poncelet asks Sister Helen Prejean, with whom he has corresponded, to help him with a final appeal.\n\nSister Helen decides to visit Poncelet, who is arrogant, [[Sexism|sexist]] and [[Racism|racist]], and does not even pretend to feel remorse. He protests his innocence and insists Vitello killed the two teenagers. Convincing an experienced attorney to take on Poncelet's case ''[[pro bono]]'', Sister Helen tries to have his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. After many visits, she establishes a relationship with him. At the same time, she gets to know Poncelet's mother, Lucille, and the families of the two victims. The victims' families do not understand Sister Helen's efforts to help Poncelet and claim that she is \"taking his side\". They desire \"absolute justice\" i.e. his life for those of their children.\n\nSister Helen's application for commutation is refused. Poncelet asks Sister Helen to be his spiritual adviser through his execution, and she agrees. Sister Helen tells Poncelet that his redemption is possible only if he takes responsibility for what he did. Just before he is taken from his cell, Poncelet tearfully admits to Sister Helen that he had killed the boy and raped the girl, before Vitello killed her. As he is prepared for execution, he appeals to the boy's father for forgiveness and tells the girl's parents that he hopes his death brings them peace.\n\nPoncelet is executed by [[lethal injection]] and given a proper burial. The murdered boy's father attends the funeral ceremony; although he is still filled with hate, he soon begins to pray with Sister Helen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as [[Helen Prejean|Sister Helen Prejean]]\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Matthew Poncelet\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Hilton Barber\n* [[Raymond J.
