The film, which was written by Kevin Bisch, features Smith as Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens, a professional \"date doctor\" who makes a living teaching men how to woo women. Unfortunately, while helping his latest client woo the woman of his dreams, he finds out that his game doesn't quite work on the gossip columnist with whom he's smitten. [[Columbia Pictures]] released ''Hitch'' on February 11, 2005, and was a box office hit, grossing $371.6 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAlex \"Hitch\" Hitchens ([[Will Smith]]) is a professional \"date doctor\" who coaches other men in the art of wooing women, with the main focus of having genuine long-term relationships. He is very successful at what he does.\n\nWhile coaching one of his clients, Albert Brennaman ([[Kevin James]])\u2014who is smitten with a client of his investment firm, [[celebrity]] Allegra Cole ([[Amber Valletta]])\u2014Hitch finds himself falling for Sara Melas ([[Eva Mendes]]), a gossip columnist and cynical workaholic. While Albert and Allegra's relationship progresses, Hitch has difficulty connecting with Sara, none of his romantic methods work on her. Throughout the entire process, he keeps his career secret, claiming to be a generic \"consultant\".\n\nHitch meets with Vance Munson ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), a shallow [[Misogyny|misogynist]] attempting to get Hitch to help him land a one-night stand with Casey Sedgewick ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), Sara's coworker and best friend. Although Hitch refuses to help, Vance smugly misleads her into believing that he has used Hitch's services. After finding out Hitch's true identity, Sara publishes an [[Investigative journalism|expos\u00e9]], causing Albert to vandalize a newsstand in rage and get arrested, Allegra breaking up with Albert, and Hitch's reputation to suffer.\n\nAt a [[speed dating]] event that Hitch sneaks into, Sara and Casey confront him and cite Vance as their source. Hitch explains that not only did he refuse to work with him but also the extent to which women must protect themselves from men like Vance unintentionally makes establishing genuine relationships with good men difficult enough to create a demand for Hitch's services.\n\nAfter receiving some criticism from Albert about treating love as a job instead of an actually legitimate feeling, Hitch then tries to salvage Albert and Allegra's relationship by confronting her. When she mentions how Albert's quirks won her over, Hitch realizes he does not really do anything significant besides giving his clients confidence and allowing them to get the attention of the women they love. And most of his customers, particularly Albert, really were successful by just being themselves. After Albert mistakenly thinking that Hitch is taking Allegra from him, Allegra reconciles with Albert, and Hitch and Sara repair their relationship.\n\nAlbert and Allegra get married, and Hitch helps introduce Casey to a man after she gives the [[Heimlich maneuver]] to an elderly woman who was choking on a grape. A dance party then begins with Albert, Allegra, Sara, and Hitch, which ends with Albert accidentally ripping his pants open to do the splits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Alex \"Hitch\" Hitchens\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Sara Melas\n* [[Kevin James]] as Albert Brennaman\n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Allegra Cole\n* [[Julie Ann Emery]] as Casey Sedgewick\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Mr.O'Brian \n* [[Adam Arkin]] as Max \n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Speed Dating Guy\n* [[Robinne Lee]] as Cressida Baylor\n* [[Nathan Lee Graham]] as Geoff\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Ben\n* [[Jeffrey Donovan]] as Vance Munson\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Mandy\n* [[Kevin Sussman]] as Neil\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Tanis\n\n==Production==\nThe production budget was $55\u201370 million.<ref name=\"numbers\" /><ref name=\"Walls\" /><ref name=\"mojo\" /> Smith has said that actress Eva Mendes, a Latina, was offered the female lead because the producers were worried about the public's reaction if the part was played by a [[White people|white]] actress, creating a studio fear of a potential interracial taboo, or a [[Black people|black]] actress, creating a studio fear that two black leads would alienate the white audiences.
