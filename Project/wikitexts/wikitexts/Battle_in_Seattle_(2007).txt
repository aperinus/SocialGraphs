The story is loosely based on [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|the protest activity]] at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]]. The film premiered on May 22, 2008 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film depicts the [[1999 WTO protests|protest in 1999]], as thousands of activists arrive in [[Seattle, Washington]] in masses to protest the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]]. Protesters believe the [[World Trade Organization]] contributes to widening the [[economic inequality|wealth gap]] between the rich and the poor, while the WTO claims to be fixing the disparity and decreasing world hunger, disease, and death.\n\nThe movie takes an in-depth look at several fictional characters during those five days in 1999 as demonstrators protested the meeting of the WTO in Seattle's streets. The movie portrays conflicts between the peaceful protesters and people committing property destruction whose actions were widely covered by the media. Although the protest began peacefully with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, police began teargassing the crowd after it refused to clear the streets and the situation escalated into a full-scale riot and a [[State of Emergency]] that pitted protesters against the [[Seattle Police Department]] and the [[Washington National Guard]].\n\n==Cast==\nThough the film is based on actual events, the characters are fictional.<!-- This is clearly stated in the opening credits.
