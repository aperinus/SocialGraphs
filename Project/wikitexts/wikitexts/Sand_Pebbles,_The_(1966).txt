It tells the story of an independent, rebellious [[U.S. Navy]] [[Machinist's Mate|machinist's mate, first class]], aboard the fictional [[river gunboat]] USS ''San Pablo'', on [[Yangtze Patrol]] in 1920s China.\n\nThe film features [[Steve McQueen]], [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Richard Crenna]], [[Candice Bergen]], [[Mako (actor)|Mako]], [[Simon Oakland]], [[Larry Gates]],  and [[Emmanuelle Arsan|Marayat Andriane]]. [[Robert Anderson (screenwriter)|Robert Anderson]] adapted the screenplay from the 1962 [[The Sand Pebbles|novel of the same name]] by [[Richard McKenna]].\n\n''The Sand Pebbles'' was a critical and commercial success at its general release. It became [[1966 in film|the fourth highest-grossing film of 1966]] and was nominated for eight [[39th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] and eight [[24th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], with Attenborough winning the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture#1960s|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1926, [[Petty officer, first class]] Jake Holman transfers to the [[Yangtze River Patrol]] gunboat USS ''San Pablo''. The ship is nicknamed the \"Sand Pebble\" and its sailors are \"Sand Pebbles\".\n\nThe crew has hired [[coolies]] to do most of the work. Holman, as chief [[Machinist's Mate]], takes hands-on responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the ship's engine, upsetting the head engine room coolie, Chien. Holman also earns the antipathy of most of his fellow sailors, but does become close friends with Frenchy, a seasoned yet sensitive sailor.\n\nWhile the ship is under way on patrol, Holman discovers a serious problem with the engine. He informs the captain, [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Collins, that they must stop for repairs, but Collins refuses until executive officer Bordelles declares a mechanical emergency. Chien insists on making the repairs, and Holman acquiesces so that Chien can save face. Chien is killed when the locked engine slips into gear, and chief coolie Lop-eye Shing blames Holman. Holman selects Po-Han to take on Chien's work; in time, the two become friends.\n\nPo-Han is harassed by a large, bullying sailor named Stawski, resulting in a [[boxing]] match on which the crewmen place bets. Holman is in the corner of his friend Po-Han, who, despite being badly beaten by Stawski, eventually prevails. His victory leads to more friction between Holman and the rest of the crew.\n\nWhen news comes of an incident involving British [[gunboats]], Collins orders the crew not to return any fire from the Chinese, to avoid a diplomatic incident. Lop-eye Shing purposely sends Po-Han ashore, where he is predictably chased down the beach, captured, and [[lingchi|slowly tortured]] by a mob. When Collins is unable to buy Po-Han's release, Po-Han begs for someone to kill him; Holman disobeys orders and shoots his friend.\n\nThe ''San Pablo'' remains moored on the [[Xiang River]] at [[Changsha]], due to low water levels, through the winter of 1926\u201327. It must deal with increasingly hostile crowds surrounding it in numerous smaller boats. Lt Collins also fears a mutiny.\n\nFrenchy has saved an educated Chinese woman, Maily, from prostitution by paying her debts. He marries her and regularly swims ashore to visit, but dies of [[pneumonia]] one night. Holman finds Maily sitting by Frenchy's corpse. Some Chinese men burst in, beat Holman, and kill Maily for which they frame Holman. The next day several Chinese demand Holman be turned over to them as the \"murderer\" of Maily and her unborn baby. When the demand is rejected, the Chinese blockade the gunboat. The crew fear for their safety and demand that Holman surrender to the Chinese. Order is not restored until Collins fires a [[Lewis gun]] across the bow of one of the Chinese [[sampan]]s.\n\nWith spring's arrival, the crew can restart river patrols, but the [[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]] results in orders to return to the coast. Collins disobeys and travels upstream of [[Dongting Lake]] to evacuate idealistic, [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] missionary Jameson and his school-teacher assistant, Shirley Eckert, from a remote mission. Holman had met Eckert in [[Hangkow]] months earlier, and the two had fledgling romantic feelings for each other.\n\nThe ''San Pablo'' must break through a boom made up of [[Junk (ship)|junks]] linked by a massive bamboo rope blocking the river. A boarding party is sent to cut the rope. Fighting breaks out in which twelve US crewmen and many more Chinese are killed. Holman chops through the rope, with an axe, while under fire. He is forced to kill a young Chinese militiaman who attacks him, then recognizes him as a friend of Jameson and Eckert. The ship continues upriver.\n\nCollins leads Holman, Crosley, and Bronson ashore. Jameson refuses rescue, claiming that he and Eckert have renounced their US citizenship. Collins orders Holman to forcibly remove Eckert and Jameson, but Holman declares he is going to stay with them. [[Chinese nationalism|Nationalist]] soldiers suddenly attack, killing Jameson. Collins orders the patrol to take Eckert to the ship, and remains behind to provide covering fire. Collins is killed, ironically leaving the normally rebellious Holman in command. Holman and Eckert have a tearful parting, finally declaring their love for each other, with Holman assuring her he will be following shortly. Holman kills a dozen soldiers but is fatally shot just when he is about to rejoin the others. His last bewildered words are, \"I was home. What happened. What the hell happened?\"\n\nEckert and the remaining two sailors reach the ship, and the ''San Pablo'' sails away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast in closing credits order --->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Machinist's Mate 1st Class Jake Holman\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Frenchy Burgoyne\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Collins\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Shirley Eckert\n* [[Emmanuelle Arsan|Marayat Andriane]] as Maily\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako Iwamatsu]] as Po-han\n* [[Larry Gates]] as Jameson\n* [[Charles Knox Robinson III|Charles Robinson]] as [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Bordelles\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Stawski\n* [[Ford Rainey]] as Electrician's Mate 2nd Class Harris\n* [[Joe Turkel]] as Gunners Mate 2nd Class Bronson\n* [[Gavin MacLeod]] as Signalman 2nd Class Crosley\n* Joseph Di Reda as Yeoman 2nd Class Red Dog Shanahan\n* [[Richard Loo]] as [[Major]] Chin\n* [[Barney Phillips]] as [[Chief Petty Officer]] Franks\n* [[Gus Trikonis]] as Gunners Mate 3rd Class Restorff\n* Shepherd Sanders as Machinist's Mate 1st Class Perna\n* [[James Jeter]] as [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|Boatswain's Mate]] 2nd Class Farren\n* Tom Middleton as [[United States Navy Hospital Corpsman|Pharmacist's Mate]] Jennings\n* [[Paul Chun|Paul Chinpae]] as Cho-jen\n* Tommy Lee as Chien\n* [[Beulah Quo]] as Mama Chunk\n* [[James Hong]] as Victor Shu\n* Stephen Jahn as Quartermaster Haythorn\n* Jay Allan Hopkins as Wilsey\n* Steve Ferry as Lamb\n* Ted Fish as [[Chief Petty Officer]] Wellbeck\n* [[Loren Janes]] as Coleman\n* Glenn Wilder as Waldron\n}}\n\nFormer child actor and career naval officer [[Frank Coghlan, Jr.]] was the [[technical advisor]] to the film regarding the [[U.S. Navy]], and made an uncredited appearance as one of the American businessmen stripping Maily.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nFor years [[Robert Wise]] had wanted to make ''The Sand Pebbles'', but the film companies were reluctant to finance it. ''The Sand Pebbles'' was eventually paid for, but because its production required extensive [[location scouting]] and pre-production work, as well as being [[monsoon]]-affected in Taipei, its [[Producer (film)|producer]] and [[Director (film)|director]] Wise realised that it would be over a year before principal photography could begin. At the insistence of the [[film industry|film company]], Wise agreed to direct a \"fill-in\" project, [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']], a film that became one of the most popular and acclaimed films of the 1960s.\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe film company spent $250,000 building a replica [[gunboat]] named the ''San Pablo'', based on the {{USS|Villalobos|PG-42|6}}\u2014a former [[Spanish Navy]] gunboat that was seized by the US Navy in the [[Philippine Islands]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898\u201399)\u2014but with a greatly reduced draft to allow sailing on the shallow [[Danshui River|Tam Sui]] and [[Keelung River]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesandpebbles.com/mcqueen/mcqueen.htm|title=Steve McQueen - The Sand Pebbles|work=thesandpebbles.com|access-date=June 14, 2015|archive-date=February 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220131551/http://thesandpebbles.com/mcqueen/mcqueen.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> A seaworthy vessel that was actually powered by [[Cummins]] diesel engines,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesandpebbles.com/jim_fritz/jim_fritz.htm|title=Jim Fritz - Recollections of The Sand Pebbles (1966)|work=thesandpebbles.com|access-date=June 14, 2015|archive-date=May 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522182523/http://www.thesandpebbles.com/jim_fritz/jim_fritz.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> the ''San Pablo'' made the voyage from Hong Kong to Taiwan and back under her own power during shooting of ''The Sand Pebbles''.

Its filming, which began on November 22, 1965, at [[Keelung]], was scheduled to take about nine weeks, but it ended up taking seven months.  The cast and crew took a break for the Christmas holidays at [[Tamsui, Taipei]].\n\nAt one point a 15-foot camera boat capsized on the Keelung River, setting back the schedule because the soundboard was ruined when it sank. When the filming was finally completed in Taiwan, the government of the Republic of China held several members of the crew, including McQueen and his family, supposedly \"hostage\" by keeping their passports because of unpaid additional taxes. In March 1966 the filming moved to Hong Kong and the Shaw Brothers studio for three months, mainly for scenes in [[Sai Kung Town|Sai Kung]] and [[Tung Chung]], and then, in June, it travelled  to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to finish its interior scenes at the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studios]].\n\nDue to frequent rain and other difficulties in Hong Kong, the filming was nearly abandoned. When he returned to Los Angeles, McQueen fell ill because he had an abscessed molar. He had not wanted to see a dentist until he returned to California. His dentist and physician ordered him to take an extended period of rest\u2014one that halted production again for weeks.\n\nSome filming took place on the dreadnought-type battleship [[USS Texas (BB-35)|USS Texas]] but these scenes were cut from the final film and have been lost.\n\n==Themes and background==\nThe military life of the ''San Pablo'''s crew, the titular 'sand pebbles', portrays the era's culture and [[colonialism]] on a small scale, through the sailors' relations with the [[coolie]]s who run their gunboat and the [[bargirl]]s who serve them off-duty, as well as on a large scale, with the West's [[gunboat diplomacy]] domination of China.\n\nAlthough the 1962 novel antedated extensive US activity in [[Vietnam]] and was not based on any historic incidents, by the December 1966 release of the film it was seen as an explicit statement on the US's extensive combat involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in reviews published by ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name=\"crowther\" /> and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesandpebbles.com/life/life_mag.htm|title=Life magazine review of The Sand Pebbles|last=Schickel|first=Richard|date=January 6, 1967|website=www.thesandpebbles.com|access-date=2018-02-01|archive-date=June 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623111940/http://www.thesandpebbles.com/life/life_mag.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nIt rained the night of the premiere, December 20, 1966, at the [[Rivoli Theatre (New York City)|Rivoli Theatre]] in New York City.
