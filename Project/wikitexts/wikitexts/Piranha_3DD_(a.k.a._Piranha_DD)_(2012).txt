A [[sequel]] to the 2010 film ''[[Piranha 3D]]'', it is part of the [[Piranha (film series)|''Piranha'' film series]] and was directed by [[John Gulager]] from a screenplay by [[Marcus Dunstan]] and [[Patrick Melton]]. It stars [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Matt Bush (actor)|Matt Bush]], [[David Koechner]], [[Chris Zylka]], [[Katrina Bowden]], [[Gary Busey]], [[Christopher Lloyd]] and [[David Hasselhoff]]. After the events on Lake Victoria, the prehistoric school of bloodthirsty piranhas transforms into a newly opened [[water park]].\n\n''Piranha 3DD'' was eventually released in the United Kingdom on May 11, 2012, and the United States on June 1, 2012, by [[Dimension Films]]. The film was critically panned by critics, who criticized its plot, characters, acting, the use of 3D and direction. A [[box office failure]], it had grossed $8.5 million worldwide against a $5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA year after the massacre in Lake Victoria, [[Arizona]] by piranhas, an eradication campaign has left the lake uninhabitable and the town has been largely abandoned. At Cross Lake, two farmers search the waters. Piranha eggs that have been laid inside a dead cow hatch, and the farmers are killed and eaten.\n\nMaddy, a marine biology student, returns home for the summer to the [[water park]] she co-owns. She finds that the other owner, her stepfather Chet plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark that involves nudity, which Maddy disapproves of. At a party at the waterpark Maddy encounters her ex-boyfriend Kyle and Barry, Ashley, and Shelby. Shelby and her boyfriend Josh go [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in the lake, where a piranha enters her vagina. Ashley and Travis begin to have sex in their van, but Ashley trips the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake. Handcuffed to the van during foreplay and unable to escape, Travis is devoured while Ashley, on the roof, calls for help. With no one around, the van sinks into the lake and she is eaten by the piranhas.\n\nMaddy consoles Shelby about their friends when they are attacked by a swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one and then Maddy, Kyle, and Barry take it to marine expert, Carl Goodman, to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving between lakes and that they could evolve to become terrain-viable. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the pipes connecting the lake and the water park. While Shelby and Josh are having sex, the piranha in Shelby's vagina bites Josh's penis forcing him to chop it off. Both are hospitalized but survive. Kyle is revealed to be corrupt and taking bribes from Chet, who is pumping water from an underground river into the water park. Chet orders Kyle to keep Maddy from finding out about his plans.\n\nThe adult water park opens. Among the guests are Deputy Fallon and former cameraman Andrew Cunningham. Fallon is there in hopes of overcoming his fear of the water after they were attacked a year ago and had lost his legs. Maddy attempts to shut the waterpark down, but is stopped by Chet and Kyle. The piranhas then make their way to the area and attack, killing many of the water park visitors. Fallon attaches a [[shotgun]] [[prosthesis]] to his legs to take out the piranhas, while [[David Hasselhoff]] rescues a young boy named David. An uncaring Chet refuses to help any survivors, including his girlfriend Kiki, who is eaten, and tries to escape with the money he got. He reluctantly offers some cash to a young girl whose mother is dead, but then accidentally reverses over her with his golf cart; he shows no regards to this however. As Chet attempts to drive off to safety, he is inexplicably decapitated by a low-hanging flag ribbon when he is distracted by a fleeing woman in a bikini.\n\nMaddy instructs Barry to begin draining the pools while she attempts to save those still in the water. However, while she is rescuing people, she becomes caught in the suction and is dragged down to the bottom of the pool. After Kyle refuses to save her because of his fear of piranhas and despite being unable to swim, Barry leaps down and brings her to the surface, whereupon Maddy is revived. Thankful for saving her, she shares a kiss with Barry, who reveals to have a crush on her.\n\nAnother employee, Big Dave, pours [[chlorine]] into the pipes, followed by a lit joint. The resulting explosion kills most of the piranhas. Kyle is also killed by a falling [[trident]]. The celebrations are cut short when Maddy takes a phone call from Mr. Goodman, who informs them that the piranha left with him is evolving and is now, after escaping its tank, now being able to move on land, to which Maddy replies she knows. A lone piranha emerges from the pool and decapitates David while he tries to photograph it and the film ends with the survivors taking pictures of David's corpse on their phones.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Maddy\n* [[Matt Bush (actor)|Matt Bush]] as Barry\n* [[David Koechner]] as Chet\n* [[Chris Zylka]] as Kyle\n* [[Katrina Bowden]] as Shelby\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Clayton\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Carl Goodman\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Himself\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Deputy Fallon\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Big Dave\n* [[Paul Scheer]] as Andrew Cunningham\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as Mo\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Josh\n* [[Meagan Tandy]] as Ashley Sorby\n* Paul James Jordan as Travis Mitchell\n* Sierra Fisk as Bethany\n* [[Matt Lintz|Matthew Lintz]] as David (Freckled Boy)\n* [[Sylvia Jefferies]] as Young Mother\n* [[Irina Voronina]] as Kiki\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the release of ''[[Piranha 3D]]'', [[Josh Stolberg]] and Peter Goldfinger expressed interest in working on a third ''Piranha'' film, pitching their own ideas for a sequel. However, the duo was cut out from working on ''Piranha 3DD'' by [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] because their plans for the sequel were deemed too expensive, whereas the Weinsteins desired to make a low-budget sequel. Stolberg and Goldfinger ultimately got a co-producer credit in the film despite not working on it. However, an unused scene from their original ''Piranha 3D'' script, which had a car full of people sinking into Lake Havasu, which was cut for budgetary reasons, was repurposed and filmed for ''Piranha 3DD''.<ref name=\"StolbergInterview\" />\n\nIn October 2010, [[Dimension Films]] announced that they had secured [[John Gulager]] to direct the film, based on a script by ''[[Saw 3D]]'' scribes [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]]. Filming was intended to take place between January 17 and February 18 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], with a release date set for August 2011,<ref name=\"DeadlineDirectorWriter\"/> but this became impractical because of cold weather and the requirement for most of the cast to be wearing little or no clothing.<ref name=\"StarMarch2\"/> In March 2011, production on the film was delayed, and [[Joel Soisson]] was brought in to produce the film and rewrite the Dunstan-Melton script.<ref name=\"MovieHoleFilming\"/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] on April 25, 2011,<ref name=\"ColliderFilming\"/><ref name=\"USAToday\"/> with parts of filming occurring at Jungle Rapids water park and Shaw-Speaks community center. Soisson stated that in choosing a shooting location he was looking for an \"iconic America town\" that \"could be anywhere\". Soisson also indicated that tax rebates and the variety of geography in North Carolina had convinced them to choose the location over the alternative of Louisiana.<ref name=\"SoissonInterview\"/>\n\nFilming was completed on May 27, 2011, after 33 days,<ref name=\"StarNewsFilming\"/> with three weeks of filming occurring at the Jungle Rapids water park.<ref name=\"PanabakerInterview\"/> The film was shot using 3D rigs, as opposed to converting the film to 3D in post-production.<ref name=\"BD3DFilming\"/> ''Piranha 3DD'' was [[cinematographer]] Alexandre Lehmann's first 3D film.<ref name=\"StarOnlineJune62011\"/> Devin C. Lussier and Martin Bernfeld were hired to edit the film.<ref name=\"DreadJohnGulager\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was initially scheduled to be released on November 23, 2011,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\"/> but a several month delay in the commencement of filming meant the November deadline could not be met.<ref name=\"StarMarch2\"/> A month prior to the scheduled November release, the date was pushed back to an unspecified 2012 release.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate2\"/> On March 3, 2012, it was announced that the film would be released simultaneously to theaters and through [[video on demand]] services.<ref name=\"Release3\"/> On March 14, it was announced that the film would be released on June 1, 2012, in the United States.<ref name=\"IGNRelease\"/> The movie was released on May 11, 2012, in the UK.<ref name=\"Runtime\"/> In the United States, it received a [[limited release]], being shown in only 75 theaters.<ref name=\"ShockRelease\"/>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film made a small impact during its debut weekend of release in the United Kingdom. Its box receipts during its opening weekend were just \u00a3242,889, placing it at number 8. A lower-budget film that was not a new release, ''[[Salmon Fishing in the Yemen]]'', reached #7, one place above ''Piranha 3DD''.<ref name=\"AvengersBO\"/> By the end of its limited run, it garnered a total UK box office of $688,269.<ref name=\"gross\"/>\n\nThe film did not do well in North America either. It grossed $376,512 during its 3-week run.<ref name=\"gross\"/> In total, ''Piranha 3DD'' did significantly better internationally, accumulating 95% of its $8,493,728 gross overseas, and narrowly scraping a profit.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released in the United States in a 3D [[Blu-ray]] \"combo pack\", Blu-ray, and [[DVD]], with all three editions containing digital copies, on September 4, 2012. In the United Kingdom, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray 3D (with a 2D Blu-ray version included) on September 3, 2012. The film was distributed earlier to rent via [[Redbox]]. The DVD is known as '''''Piranha DD'''''.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Piranha 3DD'' holds an approval rating of 13% based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 3.30/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"It strains to up the gore and self-awareness of its predecessor, and\u2014despite some game celebrity cameos\u2014the result is a dispiriting echo of 2010's horror-comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/piranha_3dd|title=Piranha 3DD (2012)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=January 24, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 24 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/piranha-3dd|title=Piranha 3DD

movie] ups the self-parody so much that it's practically a Wayans Brothers spoof, albeit with fewer jokes.\"<ref name=\"Felperin\"/> Ben Rawson-Jones gave the film a scathing review, with a rating of 1/5 stars, and was highly critical of the use of 3D and direction, despite his enjoyment of the [[Piranha 3D|original film]].<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref
