It is the sixth installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], the second installment in the trilogy of ''Wolverine'' films after ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (2009), and a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]/[[standalone sequel|sequel]] to ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006). Directed by [[James Mangold]] from a [[screenplay]] written by [[Scott Frank]] and [[Mark Bomback]], based on the 1982 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], it stars [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film series character)|Logan / Wolverine]], alongside [[Rila Fukushima]], [[Tao Okamoto]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]], [[Famke Janssen]], and [[Will Yun Lee]]. Following the events of ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', Logan travels to Japan, where he engages an old acquaintance in a struggle that has lasting consequences. Stripped of his healing powers, Wolverine must battle deadly samurai while struggling with guilt over [[Jean Grey]]'s death.\n\nThe film's development began in 2009 after the release of ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine''. [[Christopher McQuarrie]] was hired to write a screenplay for ''The Wolverine'' in August 2009. In October 2010, [[Darren Aronofsky]] was hired to direct the film. The project was delayed following Aronofsky's departure and the [[T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in March 2011. In June 2011, Mangold was brought on board to replace Aronofsky. Bomback was then hired to rewrite the screenplay in September 2011. The supporting characters were cast in July 2012 with [[principal photography]] beginning at the end of the month around [[New South Wales]] before moving to [[Tokyo]] in August 2012 and back to New South Wales in October 2012. The film was converted to [[3D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''The Wolverine'' was released by [[20th Century Fox]] in various international markets on July 24, 2013, and in the United States two days later. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences, cinematography, and Jackman's performance, though criticism was directed towards the climax. The film earned $414 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film in the series.\n\nAn unrated extended cut of the film referred to as the \"Unleashed Extended Edition\" was released on Blu-ray, featuring more blood and violence, extended action scenes, as well as additional footage during moments of character interaction.<ref name=\"Gilchrist\">{{cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|title=James Mangold's 'The Wolverine' extended cut provides new depth to the film|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/james-mangolds-the-wolverine-extended-cut-provides-new-depth-to-the-film|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225801/http://www.hitfix.com/news/james-mangolds-the-wolverine-extended-cut-provides-new-depth-to-the-film|archive-date=2013-12-02|work=[[HitFix]]|access-date=November 22, 2013|date=November 20, 2013}}</ref> A third film titled ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' was released on March 3, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn August 1945, [[Logan (film series character)|Logan]] is held in a Japanese [[POW camp]] near [[Nagasaki]]. During the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|city's atomic bombing]], Logan saves an officer named [[Ichiro Yashida|Ichir\u014d Yashida]] by shielding him from the blast.\n\nIn the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in the [[Yukon]], tormented by hallucinations of [[Jean Grey]], whom he was forced to kill to save the world.{{efn|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''}} He is located by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], a [[Mutant (comics)|mutant]] with the ability to foresee people's deaths, on behalf of Ichir\u014d, now the CEO of a technology [[zaibatsu]]. Ichir\u014d, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. In Tokyo, Logan meets Ichir\u014d's son [[Shingen Yashida|Shingen]] and granddaughter [[Mariko Yashida|Mariko]]. There, Ichir\u014d offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Ichir\u014d's life and alleviating Logan of his near-immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Believing he is acting on his friend\u2019s best interests however, Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, Ichir\u014d's physician [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Dr. Green]] introduces something into Logan's body, but Logan dismisses it as a dream.\n\nThe next morning, Yukio informs Logan that Ichir\u014d has died. At the funeral, [[Yakuza]] gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as quickly as they should. After fighting off more Yakuza on a [[Shinkansen|bullet train]], Logan and Mariko hide in a local [[love hotel]]. Meanwhile, Ichir\u014d's bodyguard [[Kenuichio Harada|Harada]] meets with Dr. Green who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko. Logan and Mariko travel to Ichir\u014d's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. In Tokyo, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying, and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Mariko's fianc\u00e9, corrupt Minister of Justice Noburo Mori. Mori confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have the Yakuza kidnap Mariko because Ichir\u014d left control of the company to Mariko, and not Shingen.\n\nMariko is brought before Shingen at Ichir\u014d's estate when ninjas led by Harada attack and whisk her away. Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichir\u014d's X-ray machine, discover a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen attacks but Yukio holds him off long enough for Logan to recover and kill him. Logan follows Mariko's trail to the village of Ichir\u014d's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the [[Silver Samurai]], an electromechanical suit of [[Japanese armour]] with energized [[katana]]s made of [[adamantium]]. Mariko escapes from Harada, who believes he is acting in Mariko's interests, and manages to free Logan from the machine. Harada sees the error of his ways and is killed by the Silver Samurai while helping Logan escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Yukio arrives and kills Dr. Green. As Logan fights the Silver Samurai, the Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws and begins to extract his healing abilities, revealing himself to be Ichir\u014d, who had faked his death. Ichir\u014d regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichir\u014d with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichir\u014d. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let her go. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan as he prepares to leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Logan returns to the United States two years later and is approached at the airport by [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (film series character)|Erik Lehnsherr]], who warn him of a [[Sentinel (comics)|weapon]] humans are creating that would bring the end to the mutant race.{{efn|Later depicted in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/07/26/the-wolverine-after-credits-scene/ | title=Post credit scene explanation | date=July 26, 2013 | publisher=hypable.com | access-date=28 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-wolverine/26587/exploring-the-wolverines-post-credits-scene | title=Explanation to post credit scenes | date=July 25, 2013 | publisher=Den of geek | access-date=28 December 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film series character)|Logan / Wolverine]]: A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], whose prodigious healing abilities and [[adamantium]] infused skeleton combine to make him virtually immortal.<ref name=\"Vilkomerson\"/>\n* [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Shingen Yashida|Shingen]]: Ichir\u014d's son<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Sandra|title=The Wolverine 3D review: Much pain, little gain for superhero|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-wolverine-3d-review-much-pain-little-gain-for-superhero-20130724-2qinb.html|work=Movies|date=July 24, 2013|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref> as well as Mariko's father and corporate rival,<ref name=\"Sanada\"/> who is proficient in [[kendo]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoare|first=James|title=THE WOLVERINE'S HIROYUKI SANADA ON SHINGEN AND SAMURAI|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/the-wolverines-hiroyuki-sanada-on-shingen-and-samurai-films/|work=Movies|date=July 12, 2013|publisher=SciFiNow UK|access-date=12 July 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Tao Okamoto]] as [[Mariko Yashida|Mariko]]: Ichir\u014d's granddaughter, whose life becomes threatened as a result of her grandfather's [[Will and testament|will]]. \n* [[Rila Fukushima]] as [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]]: A mutant who has [[precognitive]] abilities and one of the deadliest assassins in Ichir\u014d's clan.<ref name=\"Sanada\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Rila Fukushima on Yukio in THE WOLVERINE|url=http://www.comicsblend.com/rila-fukushima-on-yukio-in-the-wolverine/|work=Movies|publisher=Comics Blend|access-date=18 June 2013|archive-date=December 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104414/http://www.comicsblend.com/rila-fukushima-on-yukio-in-the-wolverine/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Hoare>{{cite web|last=Hoare|first=James|title=The Wolverine's Rila Fukushima on the \"Bad-Ass\" Yukio|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/46309/the-wolverines-rila-fukushima-on-the-bad-ass-yukio/|work=Movies|date=July 18, 2013|publisher=SciFiNow UK|access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Trumbore\"/> \n* [[Svetlana Khodchenkova]] as [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]: A mutant, who has an immunity to toxins.<ref name=\"ewpics\"/><ref name=\"Khodchenkova\"/>\n* [[Brian Tee]] as Noburo: A corrupt [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|minister of justice]], who is engaged to Mariko.<ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n* [[Haruhiko Yamanouchi]] as [[Silver Samurai|Yashida]]: Shingen's father,<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Mariko's grandfather and the founder of Yashida Industries, a powerful technology [[zaibatsu]].\n** [[Ken Yamamura]] portrays young Yashida when saved by Logan during the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.<ref name=\"Sanada\"/>\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as [[Kenuichio Harada|Harada]]: A former lover of Mariko and head of the Black Ninja Clan, sworn to protect the Yashida family.<ref name=\"TotalFilm\"/><ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as [[Jean Grey (film series character)|Jean Grey]]: A mutant, former member and former medical doctor of the X-Men who was killed by Logan.<ref name=\"Janssen\"/>\n\nArchive audio of [[Lynn Collins]] from ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' is used to represent her character [[Silver Fox (comics)#Film|Kayla Silverfox]] during a dream being had by Logan, while [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Ian McKellen]] reprise their roles as [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Charles Xavier / Professor X]] and [[Magneto (film series character)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]] in [[cameo appearance]]s during the mid-credits scene.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\nJackman also portrayed Wolverine in the previous [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]].

Aronofsky's debut picture under the pact would have been ''The Wolverine''.<ref name=\"Fleming3\"/>\n\nIn March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of directing the film, saying in a statement, \"As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, it became clear that the production of ''The Wolverine'' would keep me out of the country for almost a year...

They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12-foot-tall [[animatronic]] bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it had been hit by poisoned arrows fired by hunters.<ref name=\"fxguide\">{{cite web |date=August 7, 2013 |last=Failes |first=Ian |title=Claws and effects: The Wolverine |url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/claws-and-effects-the-wolverine/ |publisher=[[FX Guide]] |access-date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor a fight scene taking place on top of a speeding bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a [[greenscreen]]. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor [[Martin Hill (visual effects artist)|Martin Hill]] said the team adopted a \"[[Google Street View]] method\", explaining \"But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45-degree angle [[Red Epic]] [cameras] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required.\"<ref name=\"fxguide\"/>\n\nThe Silver Samurai, rendered by Weta Digital, was based on a model that had been [[3D printing|3D printed]] and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer [[Shane Rangi]], wearing a [[motion capture]] suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, \"He's pretty much chrome.
