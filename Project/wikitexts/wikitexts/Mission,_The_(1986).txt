The Guaran\u00ed are not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general and, when Gabriel sends a priest to make contact with them, they tie the priest to a wooden cross and send him to his death over the [[Iguazu Falls]]. Father Gabriel himself then travels to the falls, climbs to the top and, in an attempt to make a connection with them through music, plays his [[oboe]]. One of the Guaran\u00ed warriors, seeing that the stranger and his music are European, breaks the oboe, throws it down into the water, and stalks off. Father Gabriel does not react, however, and the remaining Guaran\u00ed (who were captivated by the music) allow him to live and take him to their village.\n\nMercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guaran\u00ed community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza. After returning from another kidnapping trip, his assumed fianc\u00e9e, Carlotta, confesses to Mendoza that she is actually in love with his younger half-brother Felipe. Mendoza later finds them in bed together and, in a fit of rage, kills Felipe in a [[duel]]. Although he is acquitted of the killing of Felipe, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable [[penance]]. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. After initially tense moments upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, since they recognize their former persecutor, the natives soon come to forgive a tearful Mendoza and cut away his heavy bundle.\n\nFather Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaran\u00ed. Moved by the Guaran\u00ed's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague, Father John.\n\nWith the protection offered to Missions under Spanish law, the Jesuit missions have been safe. However, the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] (1750) reapportioned South American land on which the Jesuit missions were located, transferring the area to the Portuguese, who allowed slavery. The Portuguese [[Colonialism|colonials]] seek to enslave the natives and, as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit priest, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain.\n\nUnder pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese representative Hontar, Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|condemned by the Portuguese]] and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success, both in converting the Indians and, in some cases, economically. At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the missions and instructs the Guaran\u00ed that they must leave, because \"it is God's will.\" The Guaran\u00ed question the validity of his claim and argue God's will was to settle and develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of [[excommunication]], state their intention to defend the mission alongside the Guaran\u00ed if the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the European art of war and, once more, takes up his sword.\n\nWhen a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, John, and the Guaran\u00ed. Although they put up a good fight, they are no match for the military force. Father John is killed while luring the Portuguese commander into a trap. Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded after the soldiers destroy a trap, allowing them to enter the village. Upon seeing the church service at the mission village, the soldiers become reluctant to fire. When the soldiers enter the mission village, they encounter the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaran\u00ed women and children who march in a religious procession. Father Gabriel leads, carrying a [[monstrance]] with the Blessed Sacrament. Ignoring this, the Spanish commander orders the attack. Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaran\u00ed, including women and children, are systematically gunned down. After Father Gabriel is shot, a man picks up the Blessed Sacrament and continues leading the procession. Only a handful of children escape into the jungle.\n\nIn a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Hontar, Hontar laments, saying what has happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\" Altamirano rejoins: \"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\" Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings. They set off up the river, going deeper into the jungle, with the thought that the events will remain in their memories. A final title declares that many priests have continued to fight for the rights of indigenous people into the present day. The text of [[John 1|John 1:5]] is displayed: \"The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness hath not overcome it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Rodrigo Mendoza\n*[[Jeremy Irons]] as Father Gabriel\n*[[Ray McAnally]] as Cardinal Altamirano\n*[[Aidan Quinn]] as Felipe Mendoza\n*[[Cherie Lunghi]] as Carlotta\n*[[Ronald Pickup]] as Hontar\n*[[Chuck Low]] as Don Cabeza\n**[[Fred Melamed]] provides Don Cabeza's voice (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Will|title=Fred Melamed on Casual, the Coens, and making Larry David laugh|url=https://www.avclub.com/fred-melamed-on-casual-the-coens-and-making-larry-dav-1798243399|website=[[The A.V.

A significant subtext is the impending [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuits]], of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit. Altamirano, speaking in hindsight in 1758, corresponds to the actual [[Andalusia]]n Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano, who was sent by Jesuit Superior General [[Ignacio Visconti]] to Paraguay in 1752 to transfer territory from Spain to Portugal. He oversaw the transfer of [[Misiones Orientales|seven missions]] south and east of the [[R\u00edo Uruguay]], that had been settled by Guaran\u00ed and Jesuits in the 17th century. As compensation, Spain promised each mission 4,000 [[peso]]s, or fewer than 1 peso for each of the approximately 30,000 Guaran\u00ed of the seven missions, while the cultivated lands, livestock, and buildings were estimated to be worth 7\u201316 million pesos. The film's climax is the [[Guaran\u00ed War]] of 1754\u20131756, during which historical Guaran\u00ed defended their homes against Spanish-Portuguese forces implementing the Treaty of Madrid. For the film, a re-creation was made of one of the seven missions, [[S\u00e3o Miguel das Miss\u00f5es]].<ref name=\"saeger\">James Schofield Saeger (1995) \"The Mission and Historical Missions: Film and the Writing of History.\" ''The Americas'', Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 393\u2013415.</ref>\n\nFather Gabriel's character is loosely based on the life of Paraguayan [[saint]] and [[Jesuit]] [[Roque Gonz\u00e1lez de Santa Cruz]]. The story is taken from the book ''The Lost Cities of Paraguay'' by Father [[C. J. McNaspy]], S.J., who was also a consultant on the film.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/obituaries/c-j-mcnaspy-79-jesuit-musicologist-author-and-linguist.html | work=The New York Times | first=Wolfgang | last=Saxon | title=C.

The battle at the end of the film evokes the eight-day [[Battle of Mboror\u00e9]] in 1641, a battle fought on land as well as in boats on rivers, in which the Jesuit-organised, firearm-equipped Guaran\u00ed forces stopped the Paulista raiders.<ref name=\"saeger\"/>\n\n===Historical inaccuracies===\nThe historical Altamirano was not a cardinal sent by the Pope, but an emissary sent by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, [[Ignacio Visconti]], to preserve the Jesuits in Europe in the face of attacks in Spain and Portugal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~histweb/scothist/brown_k/film/closed/reviews/mission.html|title=The Mission|work=st-andrews.ac.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024113653/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~histweb/scothist/brown_k/film/closed/reviews/mission.html|archive-date=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Historical critiques===\nScholar James Schofield Saeger has many objections to the portrayal of the Guaran\u00ed in the movie. The film in his opinion is a \"white European distortion of Native American reality.\" Indians are treated as \"mission furniture.\" The film asserts that the Guaran\u00ed accepted Christianity immediately although in reality native religious beliefs persisted for  several generations. The film also glosses over the frequent resistance by Guaran\u00ed to Jesuit authority as witnessed by several revolts and the refusal of many Guaran\u00ed to live in the missions.<ref name=\"Saeger\">{{cite journal |last1=Saeger |first1=James Schofield |title=The Mission and Historical Missions: Film and the Writing of History |journal=The Americas |date=1995 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=393, 394, 400\u2013401, 408.409 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1008228 |access-date=20 April 2022}}</ref> The movie also portrays Jesuit-led armed resistance to Spanish attempts to force the missions to move in the 1750s.  In reality the revolt was carried out only by the Guaran\u00ed after the Jesuits had turned over control of the missions to the colonial governments of Spain and Portugal. A Jesuit ordered that the missions be abandoned and also ordered the Guaran\u00ed to cease making weapons. The Guaran\u00ed defied him and embarked on an armed, but ultimately unsuccessful revolt. However, several Jesuits remained in the missions with the Guaran\u00ed during their suppression by the colonials and the Spanish and Portuguese accused them of inciting the Guaran\u00ed to resist.<ref name=\"Hemming\">{{cite book |last1=Hemming |first1=John |title=Red Gold: The conquest of the Brazilian Indians, 1500-1760 |date=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0674751078 |pages=470\u2013474}}</ref>\n\n==Filming locations==\nThe film was mostly filmed in [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]].

Later, Morricone defines ''The Mission'' theme as a duet between the 'Spanish' and \"Guaran\u00ed\" themes. The soundtrack was recorded at [[Lansdowne Studios|CTS Lansdowne Studios]] in [[London]].{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nOther themes throughout the movie include the 'Penance', 'Conquest', and 'Ave Maria Guaran\u00ed' themes.
