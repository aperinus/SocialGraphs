They debate whether to destroy the Earth or make humanity a member of the council. As a test, they will give one random human limitless power, \"absolutely anything\". After ten days, if the powers were used for evil, Earth will be destroyed.\n\nThe chosen human is Neil Clarke, a teacher struggling under Headmaster Robinson school in [[London]]. Neil has a crush on his neighbour, Catherine West. Oblivious to his new power, Neil wishes for aliens to destroy the classroom of students hated by him, which indeed causes an alien spaceship to kill everyone in that classroom.\n\nPerplexed, Neil tests himself to find out that he can do anything. To fix the deaths of his students he wishes that \"everyone who died come back to life\", causing all dead people to rise as [[zombie]]s; he reverses this, asking that the explosion never happened, reversing all previous wishes. Next day he wishes for another teacher, Miss Pringle, to worship his friend Ray, who is too shy to tell her he likes her.\n\nNeil uses his power for petty personal gains and to give his [[Mongrel|dog]] Dennis the ability to speak. One night, the galactic power glitches, failing to make Catherine fall in love with Neil, but then coincidentally Catherine knocks at his door. They spend the night together and her stalker ex-boyfriend, Colonel Grant sees them.\n\nCatherine hears Dennis shouting that he loves Neil, making her think that Neil has a [[Gay men|boyfriend]]. Ray says that Miss Pringle doesn't love him romantically, instead she worships him as a god. Catherine locks Grant in her apartment. Neil breaks Grant's arm and then fixes it, revealing his ability to grant wishes whenever he says a wish and makes a hand gesture. Grant kidnaps Neil, tying him up and gagging him to prevent his escape, and then forces him to grant some selfish or absurd wishes (such as giving all pasty-white English people huge ears and duck feet), threatening to shoot Dennis.\n\nCatherine and Ray rescue Neil who reverses all of the wishes, including Miss Pringle's now violently fanatical worship of Ray, who was close to being ritually killed by her and the cult she created. Catherine angrily tells Neil that she could never love anyone so controlling. Disheartened, Neil decides to use his powers to solve the world's problems; he grants everyone in the world as much food as they want, says that wars shouldn't happen for any reason, grants every person their own dream house and wishes for the reversion of [[global warming]].\n\nHowever, this backfires when worldwide obesity flares, all land is taken over for houses, several countries declare war for no reason (as opposed to \"any reason\"), and the planet falls into a global ice age. Neil reverses all these wishes. Disheartened with his personal life and futile attempts to make the world a better place he attempts suicide, but as he jumps into the [[River Thames|Thames]], Dennis jumps in after him and Neil is forced to rescue the dog and by consequence himself. Afterward, Dennis says that Neil should give the power to him, as he never thinks of anything selfish. Neil does so.\n\nMeanwhile, the aliens decide that Earth is not worthy. It turns out that the galactic council has a inverted understanding of morality - it sees dominance as good, and weakness as evil, with Neil trying to end wars and make the life of others better being a sign of weakness. They decide to destroy Earth, but Dennis wishes that the source of power be destroyed, causing the doom weapon of the council to bounce back to the alien ship, killing them all. With no power left, but full of confidence, the next day Neil asks Catherine out, to which she agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in order of opening credits billing -->\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Neil Clarke<ref name=\"screendaily1\">{{cite web|last=Wiseman |first=Andreas |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/lionsgate-uk-takes-absolutely-anything/5070128.article?blocktitle=LATEST-FILM-NEWS&contentID=40562 |title=Lionsgate UK takes Terry Jones' sci fi comedy Absolutely Anything &#124; News &#124; Screen |website=Screen Daily.com |access-date=2014-03-29}}</ref>\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Catherine West<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Ray<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Colonel Grant Kotchev<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Robert Bathurst]] as James Cleverill\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as Headmaster, Mr. Robinson<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Joanna Lumley]] as Fenella<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* Marianne Oldham as Rosie\n* [[Emma Pierson]] as Miss Pringle\n* [[Meera Syal]] as Fiona Blackwell\n* Mojo the Dog as Dennis the Dog\n* [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] as Himself (cameo)\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[John Cleese]] as Chief Alien<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Nasty Alien<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Salubrious Gat<ref name=\"gfm\">{{cite web |last=Films |first=GFM |url=http://www.gfmfilms.co.uk/news/eric-idle/ |title=Eric Idle |publisher=GFM Films |access-date=2014-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084020/http://www.gfmfilms.co.uk/news/eric-idle/ |archive-date=19 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Terry Jones]] as Scientist Alien{{efn|Terry Jones also played a van driver in the film.}}<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Kindly Alien<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dennis the Dog<ref name=\"screendaily1\"/>\n<!-- end of opening credits -->\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn a March 2014, interview with ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', [[Terry Jones]] spoke about the plot of the film.

G. Wells]] story \"[[The Man Who Could Work Miracles (story)|The Man Who Could Work Miracles]]\", but said that it \"just changed out of all recognition from that\".<ref name=\"empireonline1\"/> He also explained that the script for the film has been around for 20 years, saying: \"I just think it's my own baby really. But I wrote it with [[Gavin Scott]], and we've been writing it for 20 years, then Mike Medavoy rang up in 2010 or so and asked what scripts I had hidden in my bottom desk drawer. So I pulled out Absolutely Everything \u2013 not literally, of course \u2013 and here we are.\"<ref name=\"empireonline1\"/> He also spoke about the character Dennis the Dog, saying: \"I think he's going to steal the show. We've got a real dog, Mojo, who is very obedient, and a wonderful dog, a mongrel, but CGI work will be done. Simon Pegg is a big dog fan, and him and Mojo get on very well. Before [[Douglas Adams]] died, he looked over the script and he said that Dennis the Dog's scenes were the funniest scenes...\"<ref name=\"empireonline1\"/> He also spoke about the designs of the alien characters, saying: \"James Acheson is doing the costumes, and he has already got a wonderful array of aliens of different sizes and shapes. The story behind the aliens is they intercept the Voyager space craft as it leaves the solar system [and] comes into intergalactic space \u2013 well, it isn't really intergalactic space, but we pretend it is, anyway \u2013 and they say they have to assess one Earthling at random by giving them these powers.
