The title is taken from the [[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|song of the same name]] by [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Kim Weston]], which is played in the closing credits. The storyline is similar to the 1881 novel, ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' by [[Mark Twain]], which in turn is based on the 1949 book ''[[Lisa and Lottie]]'' by [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]. The film was distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] through their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label.\n\n== Plot ==\nAmanda Lemmon is a nine-year-old orphan who is being sought after by the Butkises, a reclusive, secretive family known to \"collect\" kids via adoption. She actually wants the likeable warm-hearted Diane Barrows, her social worker, to adopt her instead. Diane would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary, unmarried status, and social worker position. While at summer camp, Amanda meets a rich girl named Alyssa Callaway, who looks just like Amanda. She's just come home from boarding school, only to find that her billionaire father and the camp's owner, Roger, is about to marry Clarice Kensington, an overbearing, self-centered, gold-digging socialite.\n\nAmanda and Alyssa soon become acquainted, each longing for the other's life and decide to switch places. While Amanda adapts to Alyssa's wealthy lifestyle and Alyssa gets to experience summer camp, they get to know the other's parental figure and discover that Roger and Diane would be perfect for each other. Desperate to set them up, they arrange many meetings between them, hoping that they'll fall in love.\n\nRoger and Diane do seem to hit it off upon meeting, as she is pleasantly surprised with his kind and humble nature despite his wealth, and he, with her help, is able to work up the courage to visit the camp again, which he has not done since his first wife (and Alyssa's mother) died, due to painful memories of her untimely death.\n\nUpon having spied Roger and Diane laughing and swimming together in the lake one afternoon, Clarice manipulates Roger into moving the wedding up from the next month to the next day and Amanda, while posing as Alyssa, finds out that she plans on sending her off to boarding school in Tibet afterward. Alyssa ends up being adopted by the Butkises without Diane's knowledge while posing as Amanda.\n\nRoughly two hours before the wedding, Amanda proves to the family butler, Vincenzo, that she is not Alyssa. He visits Diane at the orphanage and tells her about the switch. Diane arrives at the Butkises\u2019 residence via helicopter to pick up the real Alyssa and get her to the wedding. Diane discovers the only reason the Butkises had adopted so many kids was to put them to work in their salvage yard as slave laborers. Furious, Diane reclaims Alyssa (disguised as Amanda) and threatens to report the Butkises to social services, giving their other adopted children hope for salvation.\n\nVincenzo and Amanda try their best to stall the wedding. As Roger hesitates to say \"I do,\" he recalls all the good times he had with Diane and realizes that he has fallen in love with her, and he therefore cannot marry Clarice. All of a sudden, Diane bursts into the church with Alyssa behind her. At that moment, Roger confesses his love for Diane to Clarice, who furiously slaps him. She tries to do the same to \"Alyssa\", blaming her for sabotaging their wedding, but is stopped by Vincenzo. As she storms down the aisle, the real Alyssa steps out from behind Diane, and Clarice claims that there is a \"conspiracy\", thinking that there are two Alyssas. She tries to slap the real Alyssa, but Diane steps forward in time, barking at her, \"Back off, Barbie\", and calmly informs her that she has something in her teeth. Humiliated, Clarice moves to storm out of the church again, but Alyssa deliberately steps on her wedding gown, causing the skirt to rip off and exposing her white knickers to the whole church.\n\nAn incredulous Roger learns that Alyssa has been with Diane, while he had Amanda, all this time and it becomes apparent to them that the girls had orchestrated their meet-ups all along, about which they are extremely smug. After some encouragement from them, Roger and Diane share a kiss, and the four of them board a horse-drawn carriage, driven by Vincenzo, to take a ride through [[Central Park]].\n\n==Cast==\n* Diane Barrows ([[Kirstie Alley]]) is a social worker who takes care of the orphans. She especially loves Amanda and would like to adopt her but does not make enough money to be allowed to do so. Amanda also especially likes her. She also wants to find love and thinks she might have a chance after meeting Roger.\n* Roger Callaway ([[Steve Guttenberg]]) is a very wealthy widower. He owns Camp Callaway, which he founded with his late wife, and currently resides in a large home across the lake from it. He begins to have doubts about marrying Clarice after he meets Diane and they click.\n* [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] as Amanda Lemmon\n* [[Ashley Olsen]] as Alyssa Callaway\n* Vincenzo ([[Philip Bosco]]) is the Callaways' butler, best friend, and right-hand man as well as a father figure to Alyssa since the day she was born.\n* Clarice Kensington ([[Jane Sibbett]]) is a [[socialite]] and [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]], the opposite of Diane.
