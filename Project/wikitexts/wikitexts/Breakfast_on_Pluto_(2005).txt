The film stars [[Cillian Murphy]] as a [[transgender]] [[Child abandonment|foundling]] searching for love and her long-lost mother in small town Ireland and London in the 1970s.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe film is divided into 36 chapters. In the fictional Irish town of Tyrellin, bordering Northern Ireland in the late 1970s, cartoon robins narrate as Patrick Braden's mother, Eily Bergin, leaves her baby on the doorstep of the local parochial house, where his father, Father Liam, lives. \n\nPatrick is placed with an unloving foster mother. Male at birth, young Patrick is later shown donning a dress and lipstick, which angers her foster family. Patrick is accepted by her close friends, Charlie, Irwin, and Lawrence, as well as by Lawrence's father, who tells Patrick that Eily looked like blonde American movie star [[Mitzi Gaynor]].\n\nIn Patrick's late teens, Patrick gets into trouble in school by writing explicit fiction imagining how she was conceived by her parents and inquiring about where to get a sex change. Patrick comes out as transgender, renames herself Kitten, also going by Patricia, and approaches Father Liam in [[Confession (religion)|confession]], asking about Eily, but is rebuffed. \n\nKitten runs away from home, catching a ride with a [[glam rock]] band, Billy Hatchet and the Mohawks, and flirting with leader Billy. He installs the lovestruck, homeless Kitten in a trailer, where she discovers he's hiding guns for the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]]. \n\nMeanwhile, Irwin has begun to work with the IRA, much his now-girlfriend Charlie's dismay. Kitten dismisses Irwin's politics as \"serious, serious, serious,\" but after Lawrence is killed by police detonating a suspected IRA car [[bomb]], she tosses their gun cache into a lake. \n\nBilly abandons Kitten to flee the IRA, forcing her to face the \"serious, serious, serious,\" men alone. Her lack of connection to their politics saves her from being murdered.\n\nKitten next journeys to London searching for Eily, but initial inquiries prove fruitless. Penniless, she shelters in a tiny cottage in a park, only to find that it's a children's entertainment park for [[The Wombles]]. \n\nKitten gets a job as a singing, dancing Womble, but immediately loses it when her sponsor and co-worker punches their boss. Forced into prostitution, she is violently attacked by her first client, saving herself from strangulation by spraying him in the eyes with [[Chanel No. 5]].\n\nAt a diner, magician Bertie Vaughan asks her what she is writing in her notebook. She explains it's the story of \"The Phantom Lady\" who was \"swallowed up\" by the big city, then reveals it's about the mother she is seeking. Bertie hires her to be his magician's assistant, turning her life story into a hypnosis act. \n\nTaking a romantic day trip, Kitten explains that she is transgender as Bertie tries to kiss her which he already knew. Soon, Charlie finds Bertie's show and takes Kitten away.\n\nKitten goes to a club frequented by British soldiers and dances with one, only to be injured when the club is bombed by the IRA. Police discover that Kitten is transgender and Irish, so she is arrested as a suspected terrorist. \n\nBeaten and deprived of sleep, she writes a hyperbolic statement, shown in a fantasy spy film spoof sequence. The police's attitude softens, realising she is innocent, and they release her. With no place to go, Kitten begs to stay in the station, but is tossed into the street.\n\nKitten is again forced to turn tricks, but is saved by one of the cops who interrogated her. He brings her to a [[peep show]] where she transforms herself into a blonde. Her repentant father finds her and in a scene mirroring their confessional one, professes his love and tells Kitten where to find Eily. \n\nShe goes to her house posing as a telephone company market researcher and discovers a younger half-brother whose name is also Patrick. She faints upon meeting Eily, but after reviving does not reveal her identity.\n\nWhen Irwin is killed by the IRA, Kitten goes home to tend to a pregnant Charlie and reconcile with her priest father. The town reacts against the unwed mother and her transgender friend living with him by firebombing the parish house. Kitten and Charlie flee to London. \n\nIn the final scene, they run into pregnant Eily and little Patrick at the doctor's office, where Charlie is getting post-natal care. Kitten is friendly, but still doesn't reveal who she is.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Patrick/Patricia \"Kitten\" Braden\n* Conor McEvoy as young (10-year-old) Patrick Braden\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Bertie Vaughan\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as John Joe Kenny\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Father Liam\n* [[Gavin Friday]] as Billy Hatchett\n* [[Ruth Negga]] as Charlie\n* [[Laurence Kinlan]] as Irwin\n* [[Seamus Reilly]] as Lawrence Feely\n* [[Eva Birthistle]] as Eily Bergin\n* [[Ian Hart]] as PC Wallis\n* [[Steven Waddington]] as Inspector Routledge\n* Ruth McCabe as Ma Braden\n* [[Charlene McKenna]] as Caroline Braden, Kitty's stepsister\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as 1st Biker (who introduces song \"Breakfast on Pluto\")\n* [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]] as Schoolmaster Peepers Egan\n* [[Bryan Ferry]] as Mr Silky String\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Squaddie at Disco\n* Emmet Lawlor McHugh as young Irwin\n* Bianca O'Connor as young Charlie\n* [[Paraic Breathnach]] as Benny Feely\n* [[Mary Coughlan (singer)|Mary Coughlan]], housekeeper\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTo prepare for the lead role of Kitten, Murphy studied women's body language and for a few weeks met with a drag queen who instructed him and took him out clubbing with friends.<ref name=\"TONY 2005\">Kaufman, Anthony.

In the book, the protagonist is called \"[[Pussy]]\", but Jordan and McCabe rename her \"Kitten\" in the film. Unlike the highly sexual Pussy, who is sexually involved with numerous male and female characters in some rather [[Kink (sexual)|kinky]] situations as well as a few long-term relationships, Kitten doesn't even kiss another character on the lips. One sexual encounter for hire is strongly implied, but Kitten is not shown being overtly sexual with anyone on screen. Kitten's flirtatious relationships with the series of male characters she meets throughout the film are never shown or strongly implied to have been consummated, leaving the yearning main character unrequited.\n\nThe seaside scene between Kitten and Bertie was considered by some to be an allusion to director Jordan's earlier film ''[[The Crying Game]]'',<ref name=\"Stein\">Stein, Ruthe.

Retrieved 18 July 2007.</ref> which also involved a transgender major character, the IRA, and actor Stephen Rea. In ''The Crying Game'', Rea's character doesn't realise that the woman he has fallen for and becomes sexually involved with is transgender. In ''Breakfast on Pluto'', Kitten confesses that she's \"not a girl\" before Rea's character can kiss her, and he says kindly that he already knew, but does not follow through with the kiss.\n\nThe author of the novel upon which the film is based, co-screenwriter [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]], has a cameo in the film as Kitten's creative writing teacher.<ref name=\"IMDb cast\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411195/fullcredits#cast Full cast and crew for ''Breakfast on Pluto''] IMDb</ref> Declan Burke also played his part as the leading extra.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 57% based on 116 reviews, with an average score of 6.10/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1153341-breakfast_on_pluto|title=Breakfast on Pluto (2005)|via=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nFor his portrayal of Kitten, Murphy won the 2007 [[IFTA Award]] for Best Actor<ref name=\"IFTA news\">[http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/eva-and-cillian-take-film-accolades/article/20070210035709990004 \"Eva and Cillian take film accolades\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213012625/http://entertainment.aol.co.uk/eva-and-cillian-take-film-accolades/article/20070210035709990004 |date=13 February 2007 }}, AOL Entertainment U.K., 12 February 2007.
