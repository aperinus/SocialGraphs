The movie begins with the actual footage of Grant and his friends being detained by BART Police at the Fruitvale station in Oakland on January 1, 2009, at 2:15&nbsp;a.m., right before the shooting.\n\nGrant and his girlfriend Sophina argue about Grant's recent infidelity. He unsuccessfully attempts to get his job back at a grocery store. He briefly considers selling some [[marijuana]] but decides to dump the stash. Grant later attends a birthday party for his mother, Wanda, and agrees to take the BART train to see fireworks and other New Year's festivities in San Francisco since she worries about him driving.\n\nOn the return train, Katie, a customer at the grocery store where Grant used to work, recognizes Grant and calls out his name. This causes a man Grant knew in prison to notice him, and a fight breaks out. The BART police respond to the scene. Grant is among the passengers the BART police attempt to arrest. While being restrained by officers Caruso and Ingram, he is shot in the back by Ingram. A stunned Caruso demands to know what happened. Grant is rushed to the hospital and dies shortly after emergency surgery.\n\nTitle cards at the end describe the aftermath: Grant's killing sparked a series of protests and riots across the city after several witnesses recorded the incident with cellphones and video cameras. The BART officers involved were fired, and \"Ingram\" (the officers' names were changed) was later tried and found guilty of [[involuntary manslaughter]], claiming he mistook his gun for his [[Taser]] and served an 11-month sentence. The final footage is of a gathering of people celebrating Grant's life on January 1, 2013, with Grant's daughter, Tatiana, standing among them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael B.
