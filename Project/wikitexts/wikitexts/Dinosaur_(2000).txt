The 39th Disney animated feature film,{{ref|1|1}} the film was directed by [[Ralph Zondag]] and Eric Leighton (in his feature directorial debut), it features the voices of [[D.B. Sweeney]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Max Casella]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Samuel E. Wright]], [[Julianna Margulies]], Peter Siragusa, [[Joan Plowright]] and [[Della Reese]], it follows a young ''[[Iguanodon]]'' who was adopted and raised by a family of [[Archaeolemur|lemur]]s on a tropical island. After surviving a devastating meteor shower, the family moves out for their new home and befriends a herd of [[dinosaur]]s along the way while on a journey to the \"Nesting Grounds\". However, they face harsh circumstances with its Darwinistic leader while being hunted down by numerous predators, such as ''[[Carnotaurus]]''.\n\nThe initial idea was conceived in 1986 by [[Phil Tippett]] and [[Paul Verhoeven]], which they conceived as a darker, naturalistic film about dinosaurs. The project underwent numerous iterations with multiple directors attached. In 1994, Walt Disney Feature Animation began development on the project and spent several years developing the software to create the dinosaurs. The characters in ''Dinosaur'' are computer-generated. However, most of the backgrounds are live-action and were filmed on location. A number of backgrounds were found in various continents such as the Americas and Asia; various [[tepui]]s and [[Angel Falls]] also appear in the film. With a budget of $127.5 million, ''Dinosaur'' was reportedly the most expensive computer-animated film at the time.<ref name=\"Newsweek\">{{cite magazine|last1=Ansen|first1=David|last2=Chang|first2=Yahlin|url=https://www.newsweek.com/building-better-dinosaur-160247|title=Building a Better Dinosaur|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|pages=58\u201364|date=May 15, 2000|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-may-12-fi-29176-story.html|title=Disney Chief Lets Out Roar Amid Anxiety Over Costly 'Dinosaur'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 12, 2000|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Dinosaur'' was released on May 19, 2000 to mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's opening sequence, soundtrack, and animation, but criticized the story for its lack of originality.<ref>{{cite book|first=James B.|last=Stewart|title=DisneyWar|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/|url-access=registration|year=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/355/mode/2up 356]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80993-1|author-link=James B.

Current word count is 600. -->\nA ''[[Carnotaurus]]'' attacks a mixed-species herd of dinosaurs, destroying an ''[[Iguanodon]]'' nest before killing a ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. The lone surviving ''Iguanodon'' egg is stolen by smaller predators, and, after a series of mishaps, arrives at an island inhabited by [[archaeolemur|prehistoric lemurs]] and hatches. Plio, the daughter of lemur patriarch Yar, names the baby Aladar and raises him alongside her daughter Suri, despite Yar's initial objections.\n\nSeveral years later, a fully grown Aladar watches the lemurs take part in a mating ritual, in which Plio's awkward teenaged brother Zini is unsuccessful. Moments after the ritual ends, they are interrupted by a [[meteor]] crashing into the Earth, creating an explosive shockwave which destroys the island. Aladar and Yar's family flee across the sea to the mainland. Being the only survivors, they mourn the others, before moving on.\n\nWhile crossing the burnt wasteland, they are attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptors]]''. They escape by joining a multi-species herd of dinosaur refugees heading for the communal Nesting Grounds. Falling afoul of callous ''Iguanodon'' herd leader Kron, they retreat to the end of the line and befriend the old ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' Eema, her pet ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' Url who acts like a dog, and her equally elderly friend Baylene, the only ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' in the group. They travel for days without water to the site of a lake, only to find it seemingly dried up. Kron orders the herd to move on and let the weakest perish, but Aladar stays behind with a sick Eema. He and Baylene dig until they find her some water. The rest of the herd follows suit, and Kron's sister Neera, impressed by Aladar's compassion, begins to grow closer to him, while Kron fears he wants to take over.\n\nMeanwhile, two ''Carnotaurus'' have been tracking the herd. Kron's ''[[Altirhinus]]'' lieutenant Bruton reports the approaching predators, after surviving an attack during a scouting mission. Kron quickly ushers the herd away from the lake, deliberately leaving Bruton, Aladar, the lemurs, and the elderly dinosaurs behind, hoping that they will slow their pursuers down. Aladar and Neera are against this, but Kron quickly silences Aladar and forces Neera to leave him. The abandoned group takes shelter in a cave as night falls, but the predators catch up to them and attack. Bruton sacrifices himself to cause a cave-in that kills one of the ''Carnotaurus'', forcing the survivor to retreat.\n\nThe group ventures deeper into the cave, but they reach a dead end. Though Aladar briefly loses hope, Baylene uses her strength to smash through the wall, and they arrive at the Nesting Grounds on the other side. Eema notices that a landslide has blocked off the usual entrance to the valley. Aladar rushes off to warn Kron, and finds him trying to lead the herd over the landslide, unaware of the sheer drop on the other side. Kron fights Aladar, taking Aladar's warnings as a challenge to his leadership, until Neera, fed up with Kron's illogical behavior, intervenes. Realizing Kron's selfishness and recklessness, the herd follows Aladar, while Kron stubbornly tries to climb the rocks by himself.\n\nThe hungry ''Carnotaurus'' arrives, but Aladar rallies everyone to stand together in defiance against it. The ''Carnotaurus'' is frightened off, and pursues Kron instead. Aladar and Neera rush to save him, but fail to get there in time. Aladar manages to push the ''Carnotaurus'' over the sheer drop to its death; he and Neera mourn Kron, then lead the herd to the nesting grounds. Sometime later, a new generation of dinosaurs hatches - among them Aladar and Neera's children - and the lemurs find more of their kind.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[D. B. Sweeney]] as Aladar, a young brave, determined and compassionate ''[[Iguanodon]]'' who is adopted by a family of [[lemurs]], and helps the herd of dinosaurs migrate and survive. He is the adopted son of Plio, grandson of Yar, nephew of Zini, and elder brother of Suri. \n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Plio, a wise ''[[Archaeolemur]]'' who cares for her family. She is the daughter of Yar, elder sister of Zini, mother of Suri, and adoptive mother of Aladar.\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Yar, an ''Archaeolemur'' whose occasional gruff demeanor is just a front covering his compassionate nature. He is the father of Plio and Zini, grandfather of Suri, and adoptive grandfather of Aladar.\n* [[Max Casella]] as Zini, a wisecracking and somewhat hapless teenage ''Archaeolemur'' who fancies himself a ladies man. He is the brother of Plio, son of Yar, and uncle of Suri and (by adoption) Aladar.\n** Evan Sabara voices Zini as a child. \n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Suri, a sweet, fun-loving young ''Archaeolemur''. She is Aladar's adoptive younger sister, Plio's daughter, Zini's niece, and Yar's granddaughter.\n* [[Samuel E.

Being the animal equivalent of a [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]], he is arrogant and insecure, and he has little regard for the lives of the weak.\n* [[Julianna Margulies]] as Neera, Kron's sister.

Verhoeven responded positively to the idea and suggested an approach inspired by ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953) in which \"you follow a lead character through a number of situations and moving from a devastated landscape into a promised land.\" Veteran screenwriter [[Walon Green]] was then brought in to write the script. Verhoeven then drew two storyboards and calculated the project's preliminary budget to be $45 million. When the idea was pitched to then-Disney chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], he suggested that the project should be budgeted at $25 million.<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\">{{cite magazine|last=Plesset|first=Ross|url=https://archive.org/details/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2031%20No%201-2%20%28Feb%201999%29/page/n41/mode/2up/|title=Phil Tippett: Dinosaur|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|volume=31|issue=1\u20132|pages=43\u201345|date=February 1999|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Connelly |first=Brendon |date=2022-02-07 |title=Disney's Dinosaur, and how its origins go back to RoboCop |url=https://www.filmstories.co.uk/features/disneys-dinosaur-and-how-its-origins-go-back-to-robocop/ |access-date=2022-08-28 |website=Film Stories |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the project began development in Disney's live-action division in which Verhoeven and Tippett had originally planned to use [[stop motion]] animation techniques such as puppets, scale models, and miniatures.<ref name=\"SFGate\">{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Peter|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Digital-Animation-Evolves-Disney-s-Dinosaur-a-2759935.php|title=Digital Animation Evolves: Disney's 'Dinosaur' a giant step forward|newspaper=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|date=May 14, 2000|access-date=July 16, 2019}}</ref> The film's original main protagonist was a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' named Woot and the main antagonist was originally a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' named Grozni, with a small mammal named Suri as a supporting character.

Smith became involved in the film and briefly became the director following Verhoeven's and Tippett's departure. Reflecting on his tenure, Smith said that \"Jeanne Rosenberg was still writing the script, but it was in trouble. Disney wanted a cute story of dinosaurs talking, and I didn't like the idea. I thought it should be more like [[Jean-Jacques Annaud|Jean Annaud]]'s ''[[The Bear (1988 film)|The Bear]]''. I wanted to have actual lemurs in it. They actually existed at the time of dinosaurs...We actually located a guy who trains them.\" However, Katzenberg called Smith to help on ''[[Honey, I Blew Up the Kid]]'' (1992) in which he was replaced by [[David W. Allen]] who had just finished directing ''[[Puppet Master II]]'' (1990).<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\" />\n\nAfter multiple months were spent auditioning lemurs to portray Suri and creating visual development, Allen's version also fell into [[development hell]].

They figured, 'Well, maybe, we should wait until we can do it digitally.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"Cinefantastique\" /> In late 1994, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] began development on the project and they began shooting various tests, placing computer-generated characters in miniature model backdrops.
