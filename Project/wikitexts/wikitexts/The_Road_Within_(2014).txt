While there, he rooms with Alex ([[Dev Patel]]), a Briton with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], and meets Marie ([[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]]) who is in recovery for [[anorexia nervosa]].\n\nAfter a child films Vincent with his cellphone and Vincent attacks him, he and Marie are called into the office of Mia Rose, a doctor, where she chastises them and Marie steals her car keys. When Alex discovers Marie and Vincent running away in the middle of the night, he attempts to warn Rose and is kidnapped by them. The three of them head towards the ocean where Vincent hopes to scatter his mother's ashes. However Vincent does not remember the exact location of the beachside trip he and his mother made years ago. The trio finally settle on [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] as their destination.\n\nRose informs Vincent's father, Robert, that his son has gone missing, and rather than allow the police to apprehend them, she and Robert attempt to track them down. Along the way, Marie and Vincent start a relationship with one another.\n\nWhen they finally reach the ocean, Marie collapses before they can reach the water. Marie is hospitalized and while there, the three are reunited with Rose and Robert. Marie, who is being force-fed and has been restrained, asks Vincent to run away with her, but Vincent refuses. Instead he has a conversation with his father, who apologizes for treating him poorly, and decides to stay in Santa Cruz so he can be near Marie. Rather than leave with Rose, Alex decides to stay with him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Sheehan]] as Vincent\n* [[Dev Patel]] as Alex\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Marie\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Robert\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Mia Rose\n\n==Development==\nWells was inspired to remake the movie based only on the trailer for ''Vincent Wants to Sea''.
