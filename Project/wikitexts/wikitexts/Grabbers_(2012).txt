After discovering mutilated whale corpses, the quiet community slowly comes to realise that they're under attack by bloodsucking tentacled aliens of various sizes that came from a ball of green light that fell from the sky, dubbing them \"Grabbers\". When Paddy ([[Lalor Roddy]]), the town drunk, inexplicably survives an attack, the local marine ecologist, Dr. Smith ([[Russell Tovey]]), theorizes that his high [[blood alcohol content]] proved toxic to the Grabbers, who survive on blood and water. O'Shea contacts the mainland, but an oncoming storm prevents any escape or help. The group also realizes the rain will allow the remaining large male Grabber to move about the island freely. Seeking to keep calm in the town, Nolan and O'Shea organize a party at the local pub, intending to keep the island's residents safe but unaware of the danger. Initially hesitant to join in a celebration when no good reason can be offered, the people enthusiastically agree when Brian Maher (David Pearse), the pub owner, offers free drinks. O'Shea volunteers to stay sober so that he can coordinate the town's defenses, and everyone else becomes drunk.\n\nIn a drunken stupor, Nolan reveals that she has come to the island to escape the shadow of her more-favoured sister. When they are alone in a squad car, Nolan confesses to O'Shea that she has feelings for him despite turning down his advances earlier. Smith wanders outside the pub and tries to get a picture of the beast, reasoning that his inebriated state will protect him from being eaten. Instead, the monster throws him into the air and kills him. Nolan and O'Shea escape to the pub, where they try to protect the townspeople. Nolan drunkenly reveals the danger they are in while trying to reassure everyone that nothing is trying to kill them. Panicked, they retreat to the second level of the pub, and baby grabbers take over the first floor. Nolan accidentally sets the pub on fire while trying to sneak out, but she and O'Shea manage to draw the attention of the adult.\n\nO'Shea and Nolan drive to a construction site, and the monster follows them. There, they hope to strand the monster on dry land, as it needs water to survive. Before they can successfully set a trap, the monster arrives and attacks O'Shea. Although wounded, he survives the attack, and Nolan uses the heavy construction equipment to mount a counter-attack, pinning it at the base of a pit. The monster grabs O'Shea, but before it can eat him he dumps a bottle of Paddy's [[poit\u00edn]] into its mouth, sickening it and causing it to release him. Nolan then ignites nearby explosives with a flare gun, killing the Grabber. As the storm clears up, O'Shea throws away his flask, and they return to town. Unknown to anyone, more Grabber eggs are buried on the beach, and they are about to hatch.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Garda Ciar\u00e1n O'Shea\n* [[Ruth Bradley]] as Garda Lisa Nolan\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Dr. Smith\n* [[Lalor Roddy]] as Paddy Barrett\n* [[David Pearse]] as Brian Maher\n* [[Bronagh Gallagher]] as Una Maher\n* Pascal Scott as Dr Jim Gleeson\n* [[Ned Dennehy]] as Declan Cooney\n* [[Clelia Murphy]] as Irene Murphy\n* Louis Dempsey as Tadhg Murphy\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Skipper\n* Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Gruag\u00e1in as Father Potts\n* Darran Watt as Tommy ( Islander )\n\n==Release==\nThe film premi\u00e8red at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120107/grabbers |title=Grabbers&nbsp;\u2013 Online Film Guide &#124; Sundance Institute |publisher=Filmguide.sundance.org |date= |accessdate=10 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326055941/http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120107/grabbers |archive-date=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and played at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/films/2012/grabbers |title=Grabbers \u2013 Edinburgh International Film Festival 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2012|work=Edinburgh International Film Festival}}</ref>  The film continued its festival run across the world screening at [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], [[Taormina Film Fest]], [[Fantasia Film Festival]], [[PIFAN]], [[Sitges]], [[Toronto After Dark Film Festival]], [[Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival]], [[London FrightFest Film Festival]] and held its Irish premi\u00e8re in July 2012 as the opening film of the 24th Galway Film Fleadh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4285034&tpl=archnews |title=Irish Feature 'Grabbers' To Open Galway Film Fleadh |accessdate=23 June 2012|work=[[Irish Film and Television Network]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 72% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an average rating of 6.23/10.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://rottentomatoes.com/m/grabbers/ |title= Grabbers |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= 2020-04-10 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 62 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Grabbers |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/grabbers |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date= 2020-04-10 }}</ref>\n\nDamon Wise of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' film magazine described it as \"a romantic but surprisingly scary monster movie that feels like a lost [[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]] flick, shaken and stirred with a dash of ''[[The Guard (2011 film)|The Guard]]''. ... a finely crafted tribute to a long-lost style of filmmaking [that] stands up in its own right too.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/empireblogs/words-from-the-wise/post/p1190 |title=Sundance 2012: Sixth Report|last=Wise|first=Damon|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=10 November 2012}}</ref> Matt Glasby of ''[[Total Film]]'' rated it 3/5 stars and called it \"a bright, breezy Irish monster mash boasting gorgeous cinematography, appealing performances and great SFX\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Glasby|first=Matt|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/grabbers|title=Grabbers |date=13 December 2012|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> Gareth Jones of [[DreadCentral]] rated it 4/5 stars and said, \"it is one hell of a good time that offers plenty of laughs, excellent characters and performances, and big slimy monsters.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/reviews/grabbers-2012-0|title=Grabbers (2012)|last=Jones|first=Gareth|work=[[DreadCentral]]|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> Jordan Hoffman of US cable channel [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] summed the film up as \"a delightful romp\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/01/grabbers-review-sundance |title=\"Grabbers\"&nbsp;\u2013 First impressions from the Sundance sci-fi hit&nbsp;\u2013 IFC |publisher=Ifc.com |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=10 November 2012}}</ref> while Upcoming Movies gave it four stars and called it a \"fun, monster movie roller coaster\" with a \"mix of laughs and scares\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upcoming-movies.com/Articles/sundance-2012-grabbers-review-four-stars-clever-monsters-and-an-irish-twist-boost-family-friendly-monster-tale/ |title=Sundance 2012: GRABBERS Review: (Four Stars).
