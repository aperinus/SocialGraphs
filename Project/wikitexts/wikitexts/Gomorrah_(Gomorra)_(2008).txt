It deals with the [[Casalesi clan]], a [[crime syndicate]] within the [[Camorra]] \u2014 a traditional [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] based in [[Province of Naples|Naples]] and [[Province of Caserta|Caserta]], in the [[southern Italy|southern Italian]] region of [[Campania]].\n\nThe film was released in Italy on 16 May 2008, and premiered in North America at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 11 September 2008, followed by release in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] on 13 February 2009. It received critical acclaim, winning the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] and seven [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]], including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[David di Donatello for Best Director|Best Director]] (for Garrone). It also won five awards at the 2008 [[European Film Awards]].\n\nA 2014 [[Gomorrah (TV series)|TV series of the same name]] is loosely based on the same book, but is otherwise unrelated to the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rees |first=Jasper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11011682/Gomorrah-Sky-Atlantic-review-ugly-in-a-good-way.html |title=Gomorra, Sky Atlantic, review: 'ugly, in a good way' |publisher=Telegraph |date=2014-08-04 |access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Naples]], Summer [[2004]]. Some [[gangster]]s are relaxing in a tanning salon. An assassination occurs between clans of the [[Di Lauro clan|Di Lauro Camorra syndicate]] which rule [[Scampia]]-[[Secondigliano]], and triggers the so-called ''Faida di Scampia'' ([[Scampia feud]]) (in reality the war started in October 2004 and ended in September 2005 with the arrest of [[Paolo Di Lauro]]) which forms the backstory of the entire movie. The ''Faida'' erupts between members of the Di Lauro syndicate and the so-called ''scissionisti'' (secessionists), who are led by [[Raffaele Amato]], brother of two of the men killed in the opening scene.\n\nThe film intertwines five separate stories of people whose lives are touched by [[organized crime]].\n\n'''Don Ciro'''<br>Don Ciro is a timid [[intermediary|middleman]] who distributes money to the families of imprisoned Di Lauro clan members. After the feud develops within the clan, he is ambushed by a pair of angry secessionists during a delivery. Fearing for his life, he later offers to defect to their side. They refuse his offer, and tell Ciro that he has to \"pay\" for his life by selling some of his former associates. He leads them to the location where he is given the money for distribution. The pair raid the place, killing everyone but Ciro, and take most of the money, leaving some cash on the table for Ciro. Ciro, still somewhat blood-spattered, walks off past several bodies to an uncertain future.\n\n'''Tot\u00f2'''<br>Tot\u00f2 is a 13-year-old grocery delivery boy who witnesses some drug dealers abandon a bag of drugs and a gun while evading the police at ''Sette palazzi'' in [[Scampia]]. He returns the items to the gang, and asks to join. His initiation in a [[Naples underground geothermal zone|cavern]] consists of him being shot while wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] as a test of courage. As the feud intensifies, families in the neighborhood whose loyalties are suspect are ordered to move out or suffer violence; Tot\u00f2's fellow gang members receive similar threats. Later, while hanging out with his gang in the streets of [[Scampia]], one of his gang is killed in a drive-by. The gang members decide to stand their ground and exact violent retribution by selecting a woman, Maria, as their next victim, as her son has joined a clan of [[Scissionisti di Secondigliano|Secondigliano secessionists]]. Tot\u00f2, who has delivered groceries to Maria, is forced to lure her out of her apartment, where his comrades execute her.\n\n'''Roberto'''<br>Roberto is a graduate who works in [[waste management]]. His boss, Franco provides a low-cost [[toxic waste]] disposal service that allows northern industrialists to dispose of materials like [[chromium]] and [[asbestos]] in the [[Naples waste management crisis|countryside of southern Italy]]. Franco and Roberto orchestrate the illegal disposal of the waste at abandoned quarries and other environmentally-sensitive sites. During one such operation, a drum of toxic chemicals is accidentally spilled on a driver. Franco refuses to call an ambulance, and hires children to drive the trucks when the workers refuse to continue their work. Later, Franco and Roberto meet a family of farmers who, desperate to extinguish their debts, decide to allow the burial of chemical substances in their countryside. An elderly farmer gifts Roberto a basket of peaches, but Franco later tells him to throw them away because they are contaminated. Roberto then decides to quit his job and tells Franco he cannot bring himself to poison the earth, to which Franco says that he shouldn't think he is the better man, because he solving problems others had caused, and allowed people to repay their debts. Roberto walks alone on a desolate countryside road.\n\n'''Pasquale'''<br>Pasquale is an [[haute couture]] tailor who works for Iavarone, a garment factory owner with ties to the Camorra. Pasquale takes a night-job training Chinese garment workers. As they are competing with Camorra-controlled firms, the Chinese drive him to and from work in the trunk of their car. His secret work is discovered nonetheless, and his Chinese associates are killed in a drive-by. He survives the attack, but resigns his job. Later, working as a truck driver, he is in a transport caf\u00e9 where he spots [[Scarlett Johansson]] on TV wearing one of his dresses. He smiles wryly as he drives away.\n\n'''Marco''' and '''Ciro''' aka '''Sweet Pea'''<br>Marco and Ciro are two young wannabe-gangsters who try to operate their own small racket independently of the local clan. Impressed by mafia portrayals from Hollywood movies, they quote lines and spontaneously reenact scenes from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' in [[Walter Schiavone]]'s villa while dropping references to [[Tony Montana]], [[Miami]], and [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Colombian drug cartels]]. Their first score is robbing African immigrants during a drug purchase at the Hotel Boomerang, [[Castel Volturno]]. The word of the incident gets to the local mob chieftain, who summons them and warns them under threat of violence not to repeat such behavior in the future. Ignoring him completely, they spy Camorra gangsters hiding a stash of weapons. They steal the weapons and amuse themselves by firing off rounds by the banks of a [[Regi Lagni]] canal [[estuary]] in the [[marshland]]. Once they run out of money, they use their guns to rob a [[video arcade]], and spend their stolen funds at a strip club. The gangsters, angered, find them and threaten to kill them if they don't return the weapons within a day. The pair prove stubborn. Zio Vittorio, one of the local gangsters, approaches them in a bar with an offer to come work for him. He offers them \u20ac10,000 if they return the weapons and murder Peppe 'O Cavallaro, in fact uncle Bernardino. They accept the [[Hitman|contract]], which turns out to be a trap, as they are ambushed and killed by Giovanni, Bernardino, Vittorio and others at the location of their supposed target, an abandoned beach resort next to Regi Lagni canal estuary. The last scene shows their dead bodies being carried away by a front end loader.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Toni Servillo]] as Franco \n* Gianfelice Imparato as Don Ciro\n* [[Maria Nazionale]] as Maria\n* Salvatore Cantalupo as Pasquale \n* Gigio Morra as Iavarone\n* Salvatore Abruzzese as Tot\u00f2\n* Marco Macor as Marco \n* [[Ciro Petrone]] as Ciro\n* Carmine Paternoster as Roberto\n* Giovanni Venosa as Don Giovanni\n* Vittorio Russo as Zio ('Uncle') Vittorio\n* Bernardino Terracciano as Zio ('Uncle') Bernardino\n* Simone Sacchettino as Simone\n* Salvatore Ruocco as Boxer\n* Vincenzo Fabricino as Pitbull\n* Vincenzo Altamura as Gaetano\n* Italo Renda as Italo\n* Francesco Pirozzi as Michele\n* Antonio Aiello as Farrel\n* Vincenzo Caso as Enzo\n* Salvatore Russo as O'Lungo\n* Antonio Spina as O'Zi Bi\n* Francesco Paesano as O'Chiatto\n* Leonardo Caforio as Gigante\n* Luigi Caputo as Luigi\n* Salvatore Striano as Salvo\n* Carlo Del Sorbo as Don Carlo\n* Vincenzo Bombolo as Bombolone\n* Claudio De Lucia as Paolo\n* Alfonso Santagata as Dante\n* Zhang Ronghua as Xian\n* Long Guoquine as Long\n* Maria De Fortis Nadi as Serena\n* Anna Sarnelli as Tot\u00f2's mother\n}}{{small|Source:<ref>{{Cite web|title=GOMORRA (2008)|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8cab8674|access-date=2021-08-25|website=BFI|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn the opening weekend, the film was the most watched in Italy, with a collection of \u20ac1,825,643.<ref>[https://movieplayer.it/film/boxoffice/italia/2007/?settimana=2008-05-18 BOXOFFICE ITALIA 16 - 18 MAGGIO 2008]</ref> The film grossed \u20ac10.2 million in Italy, making it the top 10 grossing movie in the 2007\u201308 season.
