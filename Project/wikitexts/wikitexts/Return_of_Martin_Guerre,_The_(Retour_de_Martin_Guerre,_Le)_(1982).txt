It was based on a case of imposture in 16th century France, involving [[Martin Guerre]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film relates a historical case of alleged [[identity theft]]. Martin Guerre leaves his young wife in a small French village to go fight in a war, and to travel. Eight or nine years later, Martin (played by Depardieu) returns to resume his life. The man is initially acknowledged and welcomed by the wife, family, and friends because he knows the intimate details of his former life.\n\nAs time passes, however, vagabonds identify Martin as Arnaud of the neighbouring village of [[Thil, Haute-Garonne|Tilh]],<ref>While the modern spelling of the village name is ''Thil'' in French, it is ''[[:oc:Tilh (Nauta Garona)|Tilh]]'' in local [[langue d'oc]]. This was evidently the spelling used at the time of the story, as witnessed by the spelling of ''Arnaud du Tilh''. This is also the spelling used by Natalie Zemon Davis in her book on Martin Guerre.</ref> but the villagers dismiss these claims as lies. But when Martin makes a demand for money he's owed by his uncle, the uncle is outraged and attacks Martin. This leads to a trial on his identity, with his life at stake, since if he is not Martin he and Martin's wife Bertrande are adulterers and their children bastards. This trial constitutes most of the film.\n\nMartin argues well, and the villagers are divided on whether the man is in fact Martin, Bertrande siding with him. After several elevations of the proceedings up to a court in the [[Parlement]], the judge, [[Jean de Coras]], prepares to acquit Martin primarily on the strength of the testimony of Bertrande.\n\nAt the last minute, another witness appears in court, bearing an even stronger resemblance to the young Martin and casting everything into doubt once more. The impostor confesses that he was a soldier with the real Martin, who said he was never going back to his village, upon which the impostor decided to take his place. Even Bertrande changes her mind and says the new witness is Martin. Arnaud is sentenced to death.\n\nSome time later, De Coras visits the village to tell Bertrande that she has been acquitted and is innocent of conspiracy with Arnaud. But he has deduced that she recognized the impostor from the very beginning and asks her why she claimed he was Martin. She says that he was a better husband and man, and they had a good life together. De Coras asks her then why she changed her mind at the last minute. She says she saw in Arnaud's eyes that the case had become hopeless and that he wanted her to feign ignorance so as to live for herself and her children.\n\nArnaud is led to the gallows, repenting all the while. A voiceover closes the historical framework by mentioning that de Coras was executed some years later for his Protestant beliefs.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was nominated for [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] by the U.S. [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1983/ |title=1983 Award Winners |date=2016 |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |access-date=17 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Book==\nIn 1983, a book of the same name was published by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], an American historian of early modern France and professor at [[Princeton University]].  She had served as a consultant and helped write the screenplay for the film.\n\n==Remake and musical==\n''[[Sommersby]]'' is a 1993 Hollywood remake of the film in English, transposed to the [[American Civil War]] and starring [[Richard Gere]] and [[Jodie Foster]].\n\nA West End (London) [[musical theatre|musical]] produced by [[Cameron Mackintosh]], ''[[Martin Guerre (musical)|Martin Guerre]]'', was loosely based on the film with additional material from historical accounts.  Again, the historical setting is transposed, in this case to the period of religious turmoil between the [[Huguenot]]s and the Catholics in sixteenth century France.\n\nThe first feature film from [[East Timor]], ''[[Beatriz's War|A Guerra Da Beatriz]]'' (\"Beatriz's War\") was released in 2013. It is a re-telling of the story of Martin Guerre, but set in the 1980s, during the Indonesian occupation of Timor Leste. It stars Irim Tolentino, who co-wrote the script with the director, Bety Reis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aguerradabeatriz.com/beatrizs-war-in-australian-cinemas/|title=Beatriz's War in Australian Cinemas : A Guerra da Beatriz|website=www.aguerradabeatriz.com}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and roles==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] - \"Martin Guerre\" (Arnaud du Tilh)\n* [[Nathalie Baye]] - Bertrande de Rols\n* [[Maurice Barrier]] - Uncle Pierre Guerre\n* [[Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu]] - Martin Guerre\n* [[Isabelle Sadoyan]] - Catherine Bo\u00ebre\n* [[Rose Thi\u00e9ry]] - Raimonde de Rols\n* [[Chantal Deruaz]] - Jeanne\n* [[Maurice Jacquemont]] - Judge Rieux\n* [[Roger Planchon]] - [[Jean de Coras]]\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] - Antoine\n* [[Philippe Babin]] - Jacques\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Chassigneux]] - Guillemette\n* [[Adrien Duquesne]] - Sanxi Guerre\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] - Augustin\n\n==Awards==\n*'''Nominee''' Best Costume Design [[Academy Award]] (Anne-Marie Marchand)\n*'''Nominee''' Best Foreign Language Film [[BAFTA]] award\n*'''Winner''' Best Original Screenplay [[Cesar Award]] (Jean-Claude Carriere, Daniel Vigne}\n*'''Winner''' Best Music [[Cesar Award]] (Michel Portal)\n*'''Winner''' Best Production Design [[Cesar Award]] (Alain Negre}\n*'''Nominee''' Most Promising Actor [[Cesar Award]] {Dominique Pinon)\n*'''Winner''' Best Foreign Film [[National Board of Review]]\n*'''Winner''' Best Actor [[National Society of Film Critics]] (G\u00e9rard Depardieu)\n*'''Winner''' Best Foreign Film Kansas City Film Critics Circle\n\n==Notes and links==\n===See also===\n*[[Middle Ages in film]]\n*[[Microhistory]]\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Davis, Natalie Zemon.
