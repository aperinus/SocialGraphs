On his way from such a kill, a team including Espinoza ([[Luis Da Silva|Da Silva]]) tries to kill Munch; his ex-partner and trainer, Ed Hopper ([[Tim Roth|Roth]]), reconsiders his involvement immediately beforehand, and remains only to listen and confirm his assessment of the situation.\n\nMartha McKay ([[Anna Kendrick|Kendrick]]) is asked out by Munch and they are smitten. Munch dodges an assassination attempt by Espinoza, and they spend the night chastely. The next evening, they meet for dinner, where Munch reluctantly kills Espinoza when attacked. Over hot chocolate, he shows Martha his belief that underlying all physical objects lies a current that can be [[precognition|precognitively]] anticipated, and both of them have it. Munch throws a kitchen knife high in the air and catches it safely as it falls between them. Martha freaks out until he throws a knife at her, which she catches by the blade without being cut. They then have an intimate night.\n\n\"Von\" Cartigan ([[James Ransone|Ransone]]) is the sole survivor of a prior spree in which Munch killed the Pirrello heroin syndicate, and, as Munch shoots those who hire him, with his partner Johnny Moon ([[Michael Eklund|Eklund]]) tries to set up his brother Richard ([[Anson Mount|Mount]]) to be killed. Instead, a middleman is sent who Munch kills in front of Martha, frightening her enough to ask him to give her some space. Richard sends Moon, Von, and 10 other hitmen to Martha's, including a gunman named Steve ([[RZA]]).\n\nHopper meets Martha at her apartment, but is subdued by Francis, his former partner. Steve gets Munch with [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshot]]. From cover, Munch shoots one of Von's hired men dead, [[psychological warfare|talks another]] into leaving, and [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] the remainder. Having previously shown Von mercy at the Pirrello job, and, getting ready to kill Von, he's again hit by Steve (whom he respects for his skills) with a bat while Moon grabs Martha. Hopper arrives and shoots the kneecapped men dead, but while his back is turned, Francis escapes.\n\nRichard enlists Von and Johnny to stay and defend their house, defeating their plans to rule the family as sole survivors; in frustration, they abuse Martha in response to her mockery. After kicking her against a wall, she says she will kill them if Munch doesn't, as she now feels \"motivated.\" Outside, Munch takes Steve by surprise; chatting, Steve tells him how many are inside, and they share [[gummy bear]]s. Munch distracts Von and Richard's bodyguards and shoots them when threatened, but declines to shoot either Von or Richard themselves. In frustration, Von begins [[stream of consciousness|monologuing]] about his desire to kill his brother. When Munch leaves, both leap for the gun, but Von successfully kills Richard. In another room, Richard's [[consigliere]] Bruce ([[Jaiden Kaine|Kaine]]) confronts Munch but is disarmed. Bruce mistakenly arms a grenade, and Munch helps him disarm it without them both dying.\n\nMunch rescues and begins to escape with Martha, but is shot with [[bean bag round|beanbag ammunition]] by Hopper. Moon grabs Martha and tells her he puts more dangerous people off their game by killing their weaker loved ones. Her precognitive combat abilities awaken, and she dodges Moon's attacks, then strikes him with his own knife and kills him with a statue. While escaping, she disarms and shoots Von with his own gun.\n\nHopper and Munch confront each other, Hopper handcuffs himself to Munch, intending to \"re-program\" Munch into a killer. Munch shoots the handcuffs off. Before Hopper can shoot Munch in the back, Steve shoots Hopper dead, and is ecstatic to learn of Hopper's $5 million bounty. Munch meets Martha at the entrance, notes her [[Mydriasis#Trauma|dilated pupils]], and asks Steve to help him get them to the hospital.\n\nTwo months later, two military-style teams are pursuing Munch and Martha as they visit different countries for Martha's [[paleontology|paleological]] interests; Munch shows a sign to a sniper asking \"where's the girl?\" as the scene cuts to Martha, who has snuck up to shoot the sniper.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Francis Munch / Mr. Right \n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Martha McKay\n**Gigi Johnson as Young Martha McKay\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Hopper / Knox\n* [[James Ransone]] as Von Cartigan\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Richard Cartigan\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Johnny Moon\n* Katie Nehra as Sophie\n* [[RZA]] as Steve \"Shotgun Steve\"\n* [[Jaiden Kaine]] as Bruce\n* Douglas M.
