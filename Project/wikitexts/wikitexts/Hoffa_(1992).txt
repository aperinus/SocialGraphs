[[Jack Nicholson]] plays Hoffa, and DeVito plays Robert Ciaro, an amalgamation of several Hoffa associates over the years. The film features [[John C. Reilly]], [[Robert Prosky]], [[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]], [[Armand Assante]], and [[J. T. Walsh]] in supporting roles. The film was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] and released on December 25, 1992. The film received mixed reviews and grossed just $29 million against its $35 million budget, with critics praising Nicholson's performance but criticizing the film's story.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/59268-HOFFA?sid=304e65a1-2262-465e-b6f9-47a74a06f17e&sr=11.3257065&cp=1&pos=0|access-date=2021-07-13|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn July 30, 1975, Jimmy Hoffa and his longtime friend Bobby Ciaro are impatiently waiting in the parking lot of a roadhouse diner. The film moves in vignettes from Hoffa's early years, when Hoffa was an [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] union organizer working for the various trucking firms and laundries around [[Detroit]]. In 1935, Hoffa is shown approaching a parked truck, inside of which driver Ciaro is taking a nap. Hoffa pitches the benefits of joining the [[Teamsters]] and gives Ciaro a business card, on which he has written: \"Give this man whatever he needs.\" A few days later, Ciaro reports to work to find Hoffa attempting to persuade his fellow drivers to unionize. Hoffa blurts out that he already spoke to Ciaro, getting him fired. He later accosts Hoffa with a knife, but Hoffa's associate and bodyguard Billy Flynn forces him to drop it at gunpoint. Ciaro assists Hoffa and Flynn in the arson of a laundry whose owner refuses to cooperate with the Teamsters. Flynn accidentally sets himself on fire and dies of his injuries. He is succeeded by Ciaro as Hoffa's right-hand man.\n\nDuring a Teamsters strike that quickly turns into a street brawl with non-union workers, Hoffa escapes and is taken to see Detroit's top [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss, Carl D'Allesandro, with the [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] Ciaro acting as translator. A partnership is soon formed between the Teamsters and the Mafia, and when Hoffa becomes president of the Teamsters in 1957, he makes several illegal loans to the mob using union funds. At a Congressional hearing, Hoffa is questioned by [[Robert F. Kennedy]] over allegations that the Teamsters are controlled by organized crime. Kennedy and Hoffa engage in a loud and bitter feud, especially after [[John F. Kennedy]] is elected [[President of the United States|President]] in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and Bobby becomes [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]].\n\nDuring a hunting trip with D'Allesandro, he and Hoffa discuss an embezzlement scheme involving the Teamsters [[pension fund]]. Having no paper with them, the plans are sketched on the back of a hunting license. Hoffa is then betrayed by Teamsters official Peter Connelly, who not only testifies at Hoffa's trial for labor racketeering but also provides the prosecution with a crucial piece of evidence: the license. Hoffa surrenders to federal officials and receives a long sentence while Connelly's uncle, [[Frank Fitzsimmons]], assumes control of the Teamsters. Ciaro is also convicted, but obtains early release from prison and immediately begins working for Hoffa's release. D'Allesandro suggests that the Teamsters endorse [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] for President in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], and in exchange, Hoffa will receive a presidential pardon.\n\nHoffa is pardoned by the Nixon administration, but learns that one of the conditions of his release is that he cannot have any involvement with the Teamsters for at least ten years. Hoffa meets with D'Allesandro and asks him to have Fitzsimmons killed, resulting in a failed attempt to assassinate him with a car bomb. D'Allesandro believes that Hoffa is \"too hot\" and declines to help him any further. In response, Hoffa has Ciaro deliver a message to D'Allesandro that unless Fitzsimmons is dealt with, Hoffa will go to the press and reveal every illegal action he has carried out on his behalf. D'Allesandro replies that he will meet with Hoffa at a nearby diner the next day to work out a plan.\n\nHoffa and Ciaro spend several hours waiting in the diner's parking lot, but D'Allesandro never arrives. A union driver has been waiting for hours in the dining room, allegedly for a part for his truck. He and Ciaro start talking, and the driver offers to bring Hoffa his coffee. The [[hit man|\"driver\"]] then pulls out a silenced pistol and shoots Hoffa dead in his car; Ciaro rushes to help him and gets shot three times in the chest. The shooter drives off in a separate car while two other men exit his truck, put Ciaro's body in Hoffa's car, and drive it into the back. The truck then departs, leaving not a single trace of Hoffa's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Jimmy Hoffa]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Bobby Ciaro\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Carl \"Dally\" D'Allesandro\n* [[J.T.

The screenplay was later retitled ''Hoffa'' and filming was originally projected to commence in the spring of 1984, but no progress occurred. In 1989 [[Joe Isgro]], [[Edward R. Pressman]], and [[Caldecot Chubb|Chaldecot Chubb]] purchased the rights to Moore's screenplay and hired [[David Mamet]] to rewrite it for $1 million. Pressman considered [[Barry Levinson]], [[Oliver Stone]], and [[John McTiernan]] to direct the film. Levinson was the frontrunner but chose to decline after Mamet refused to make script changes. Pressman hired [[Danny DeVito]] to direct in April 1990. [[Jack Nicholson]] was hired to play Hoffa after [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Robert De Niro]] also auditioned. DeVito secured a $50 million budget for the film by forgoing his salary and signing as [[Guarantor|co-guarantor]] for the film. Production was originally set to begin in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] in January 1992 but was delayed because of Nicholson and DeVito's commitments to other films. It would ultimately last between February and June 1992 in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], and soundstages in [[Los Angeles]].  [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[TCF Center|Cobo Arena]], the Detroit Produce Terminal, the [[Detroit Public Library]], the ''[[The Detroit News|Detroit News]]'' staff room, the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]], and the [[Spiegel Office Building]] were used as shooting locations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film premiered at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Theater]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] on December 11, 1992.<ref name=\":0\" /> It received a wider release on Christmas Day 1992, in 1,066 theaters.
