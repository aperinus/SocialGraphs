He is bitter, arrogant, self-absorbed, and uninterested in his students. This becomes a problem when he parks illegally on campus. The car is [[Vehicle impoundment|impounded]] and he does not pay the fine before getting to the college impound lot, watched by a disgruntled former student. Lawrence has a trauma-induced [[seizure]] after falling from the top of a fence after retrieving his briefcase from inside the impounded car.\n\nIn the emergency room, he is treated by Dr. Janet Hartigan ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]), a former student he does not remember. Lawrence has to get about, but is unable to operate his car. His brother Chuck is without a place to sleep and a job, so Vanessa sets up what he characterizes as a [[Win-win game|\"win/win\" solution]].\n\nAt a follow-up appointment, another doctor tells Lawrence that Janet had been his student. He sees Janet again outside the hospital as he is leaving, and, since Chuck has failed to show up, she offers to take him home. When they arrive, he asks Janet to later meet for coffee and she agrees, fulfilling her old student crush on the professor. Vanessa confronts Janet, warning her about Lawrence's fragility. At dinner, Lawrence monopolizes the conversation and Janet walks out.\n\nLawrence visits the emergency room to see Janet again and she acquiesces to a second, \"face to face conversation.\" After their wineless date, they return to Janet's place where they consummate their mutual attraction, but while spending the night, Janet is struck by a sudden bout of feminine insecurity, and feigns being called in to work and does not return any of his subsequent calls. On another night, in the midst of a contentious family [[Christmas]] dinner at the Wetherholds', Janet arrives unannounced with a cake, because Larry there had invited her earlier.  \n\nAfter Chuck gets Vanessa drunk to celebrate her early acceptance into [[Stanford University]], she makes a pass at him, which he rejects.  He then moves in part-time with Lawrence's son, James, in his [[college dormitory]].\n\nJames' girlfriend, Missy ([[Camille Mana]]), who is one of his father's students, tells Lawrence that James has had a poem accepted by ''[[The New Yorker]]''. In contrast, Lawrence's latest book has been universally rejected. A new title, ''You Can't Read!'' (Vanessa's idea) helps sell the book to [[Penguin Group]], a largely non-academic publisher. To Lawrence's dismay, however, the book is largely re-worked and edited by the publisher, only vaguely resembling his original work. Janet accompanies Lawrence on a trip to [[New York City|New York]] to meet with the publisher, where she learns she is pregnant with their child. Finding him preoccupied by his book's publishing and an ongoing campaign to become [[chairman]] of the English Department, Janet is again upset by Lawrence's self-absorption and breaks up with him without telling him the news.\n\nBack in [[Pittsburgh]], Lawrence is confronted by both James and Chuck, who both point to his apparent lack of interest in his children's lives. Encouraged by Chuck, Lawrence goes to the hospital to reconcile with Janet, who reveals her [[pregnancy]]. He has meanwhile dropped his bid to become department head and has become a more involved parent and professor.\n\nDuring the end credits, Lawrence and Janet cradle [[twin]] babies: a boy named Sonny and a girl named Cher.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Dennis Quaid Smart People.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Dennis Quaid on the set of ''Smart People'' at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Pittsburgh, PA.]]\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lawrence Wetherhold\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Janet Hartigan, Lawrence's love interest later 2nd wife\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Chuck Wetherhold, Lawrence's adoptive younger brother\n* [[Elliot Page]] as Vanessa Wetherhold, Lawrence's youngest daughter\n* [[Ashton Holmes]] as James Wetherhold, Lawrence's oldest son\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Nancy\n* [[Camille Mana]] as Missy Chin, James' girlfriend\n* [[David Denman]] as Dr. William Strouse\n* [[Scott A.
