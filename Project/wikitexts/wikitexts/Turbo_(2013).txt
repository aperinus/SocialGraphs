However, his obsession with racing makes him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet.\n\nAfter nearly getting killed by a [[lawnmower]] in an attempt to retrieve a fallen tomato, a disappointed Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star, (later revealed to be an airplane) that he could be fast. Suddenly, he is sucked into the [[supercharger]] of a [[Chevrolet Camaro]], fusing his molecules with [[nitrous oxide]]. When he wakes up, he possesses [[Speedster (fiction)|superspeed]] and other characteristics of a real car. However, his first attempt to try out his new powers ends with him crashing a boy's tricycle into the garden in which many other snails worked at, resulting in him and Chet getting fired from the garden crew.\n\nChet angrily scolds Theo for his recklessness, and is snatched by a crow, but is pursued and rescued by Theo at a rundown [[strip mall]] called \"Starlight Plaza\". There, they are captured by Tito Lopez, a [[taco truck]] driver who works at the Plaza, and are brought to a [[snail race]] held by him and his co-workers. Theo wins the race in a matter of seconds, astounding both the humans and snails alike, earning the respect of the snails, led by Whiplash, and firmly establishing the name \"Turbo\" as his own. Chet, on the other hand, is not happy with his brother's new ability and wants him to return to normal. Tito dreams of reviving Starlight Plaza, with Turbo as a main attraction, much to his brother and coworker Angelo's annoyance. The snails manage to divert and strand a tour bus to see Turbo's superspeed, bringing impressive business. With this success, Turbo convinces Tito to enter him in the Indy 500 as a competitor, and his coworkers agree to put up the entrance fee and accompany them to [[Indianapolis]].\n\nTito is initially refused entry into the race, but a chance meeting with Gagn\u00e9 allows Turbo to show off his speed, qualifying for the race via achieving a speed of 226&nbsp;mph, becoming a sensation on [[social media]] and forcing the CEO of [[IndyCar]] to reluctantly let Turbo compete. The night before the race, Turbo gets into a heated argument with Chet, who is still unwilling to respect his brother's wishes, so he sneaks out to meet Gagn\u00e9, who reveals his true colors by demoralizing him and warning him to back out of the race. In the race the next day, the racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave Turbo in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and his crew give Turbo a pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Turbo uses his small size to his advantage and rapidly gains ground, but Gagn\u00e9 cheats and knocks him against the wall, damaging his shell and weakening his superspeed.\n\nWith one lap to go and Turbo in the lead, Gagn\u00e9 drives over [[road debris|debris]] on the last turn and overtakes Turbo, inadvertently causing a crash involving most of the competitors, including Turbo, who wakes to find his shell punctured and his superspeed gone, causing him to give up and hide in his shell. Surprised at seeing his brother losing hope, Chet, with a change of heart, braves several dangers to meet with Whiplash's crew and encourage Turbo to continue. Turbo, inspired by the crew's support, resumes the race. Gagn\u00e9 desperately pursues him by dragging his wrecked car, but Turbo narrowly wins and Gagn\u00e9 loses his status.\n\nStarlight Plaza thrives from Turbo's fame, all the businesses become spectacular successes and hold elaborate snail races. Whiplash's crew are given special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is the track referee and paramedic, and the garden snails have also received special shells of their own. Turbo discovers that his shell has healed, and his superspeed has returned, now ready to race once again.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, one of the snails from the garden is finally able to tuck into his shell, only to realize that he is too big to come out.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Theo/Turbo, the protagonist, a [[garden snail]] who dreams of becoming a racer and the next Indianapolis 500 champion and obtains superspeed during a car race.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |title='Leafmen,' 'Turbo' set for 2013 debut |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040669 |access-date=February 8, 2012 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"ColliderCroodsTurboPeabody\">{{cite news|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title=DreamWorks Presents Sneak Peeks at The Croods, Turbo and Mr. Peabody & Sherman|url=https://collider.com/dreamworks-croods-turbo-mr-peabody-and-sherman/215763/|access-date=December 5, 2012|newspaper=Collider.com|date=December 4, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Chet, Turbo's older brother.<ref name=\"ColliderCroodsTurboPeabody\" /><ref name=\"Holly1\">{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Paul Giamatti, Samuel L.

The night before, Soren conceptualized ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' with snails, and won the competition. The studio bought the idea, and let it \"simmer\" for more than five years.

I think that a snail is inherently an underdog. It's smashed, eaten by people, the butt of slow jokes around the world. It just seemed loaded with obstacles.
