The film is based on a [[screenplay]] by Hiroshi Takahashi which in turn is based on the short story \"Lemon Heart\" from the ''[[Birthday (short story collection)|Birthday]]'' [[anthology]] by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]. ''Ring 0: Birthday'' was nominated for the 2001 edition of [[Fantasporto]], but lost to ''[[Amores perros]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present, a girl calls her friend to tell her about how she watched the cursed videotape. She recounts about how she experienced a nightmare, where she witnessed Sadako being murdered by Dr. Ikuma.\n\nThirty years prior, Akiko Miyaji, the fianc\u00e9 of a fellow reporter who was killed during Shizuko's infamous ESP demonstration, interviews Shizuko's daughter, Sadako's former elementary school teacher Sudo about Sadako's [[nensha]] powers. Sudo recounts how Sadako was withdrawn as a child and predicted her classmates drowning in the ocean during a field trip. Meanwhile, 19-year-old Sadako joins an acting troupe as an [[understudy]]. Her natural charisma infuriates lead actor, Aiko Hazuki, whose relationship with the troupe director, Yusaku Shigemori, sours due to the latter's newfound favor for Sadako. Aiko is later found murdered by a figure in white so Sadako takes her place. Sadako and troupe sound director, Hiroshi Toyama, are attracted to each other, much to the disappointment of Toyama's girlfriend, costume designer Etsuko Tachihara. While praised by Shigemori and Toyama, the other troupe members grow to distrust and fear Sadako, as they suspect that she is the one who caused Aiko's death and other supernatural occurrences, including an apparition of a girl in white with long hair similar to Sadako.\n\nAkiko is told by Sudo that Shizuko descended to madness before her suicide ever since moving to live with Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, and that Sudo heard strange childlike noises in the attic. Etsuko, wanting to discover Sadako's origins, contacts Sadako's psychiatrist, but he refuses to answer and throws away Sadako's r\u00e9sum\u00e9; the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is taken by Akiko's assistant, allowing him and Akiko to locate Sadako in the troupe. When they start to photograph her, she telekinetically breaks the camera; the two discover that all the photographs contain ghostly faces and a girl with long hair, confirming Akiko's suspicion of the existence of \"two\" Sadakos. Shigemori, obsessed with Sadako, says he will kill her if she tries to kill him. Toyama interrupts and Shigemori is killed through a cut that also wounds Toyama. Sadako heals him just by touching him and later is able to make a disabled man regain his ability to walk. The two confess their love and promise to leave the troupe and live together after finishing their last play.\n\nThe play is a disaster as Sadako, influenced by recordings of her mother's demonstration played by Etsuko, sees visions of her mother during the demonstration and kills her psychiatrist. The troupe members beat her to death. They visit Ikuma, who tells them that Sadako split into two beings resembling each of her parents; the malevolent one who resembled her unknown father is kept from growing by Ikuma in the attic. Before they can kill it, both Sadakos merge with each other and escape with Toyama. In her merged form, Sadako kills all the troupe members, including Toyama. Akiko and Etsuko hide in Ikuma's house. Rather than face Sadako's wrath, Akiko shoots Etsuko and herself.\n\nSadako is found by Ikuma, recovered and tearfully mourning her own actions. Ikuma drugs her and chases her outside to the well. Despite her pleas, he brains her with an axe and throws her down the well before breaking down in tears. Sadako has a dream of meeting Toyama again and screams as the well stone is slid in place, trapping her inside.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Yukie Nakama]] as [[Sadako Yamamura]]\n*[[Seiichi Tanabe]] as Hiroshi Toyama\n*[[Kumiko As\u014d]] as Etsuko Tachihara\n*Takeshi Wakamatsu as Yusaku Shigemori\n*Ryushi Mizukami as Wataru Kuno\n*Kaoru Okunuki as Aiko Hazuki\n*Yasuji Kimura as Togashi\n*[[Daisuke Ban]] as Heihachiro Ikuma\n*Masako as Shizuko Yamamura\n*[[Mahito \u014cba]] as Takashi Yamamura\n*Kazue Tsunogae as Mrs. Sudo\n*[[Atsuko Takahata]] as Kaoru Arima\n*[[Yoshiko Tanaka]] as Akiko Miyaji}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1999, [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]] was finishing his written sources for the ''Ring'' series by including a fourth titled ''Birthday'' which collects three short stories that filled in details of the story.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} [[Asmik Ace]] decided to hire ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]'' and ''[[Ring 2]]'' screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi to adapt the story ''Lemonheart'' from ''Birthday''.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} ''Birthday'' captured the life of the character of [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]] just before she consigned to her fate seen in the later ''Ring'' series.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} Producer Takasige Ichise offered [[Hideo Nakata]] the chance to direct, who passed on the offer.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}}\n\nThe director for the film was [[Norio Tsuruta]].{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=43}} Tsuruta had previously worked on direct-to-video horror scripts such as ''Honto ni atta kowai hanashi'' (''Scary True Stories'') in 1991, and wrote and directed the sequel.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=45}} After working on various television and direct-to-video works, Tsuruta got to work with screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi on the segment \"The Curse\" on the television special ''Haunted School F''.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=45}} Takahashi lobbied for Tsuruta to take on the film.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=45}} Tsuruta referred to the film as \"a tragedy\" with a theme about \"a young woman who is oppressed  because she is different from everyone else.
