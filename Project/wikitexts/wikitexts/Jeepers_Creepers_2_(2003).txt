Additionally, [[Francis Ford Coppola]] returned to the franchise as an executive producer.\n\nProduced by [[Myriad Pictures]] and [[American Zoetrope]], filming for ''Jeepers Creepers 2'' took place in Tejon Ranch, and [[Long Beach, California]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visimag.com/shivers/h100_feat03.htm|title=Feature: Jeepers Creepers 2 {{!}} A Shivers exclusive set report|date=October 8, 2002|issue=100|author=Alan Jones|website=[[Shivers (magazine)|Shivers]]|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109203823/https://www.visimag.com/shivers/h100_feat03.htm|archive-date=January 9, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref> The film was theatrically released by [[United Artists]] in the United States on August 29, 2003, where it was met with mostly negative reviews from critics.

Film plots must be 700 words or less, and this is currently 376 words long. -->\nThree days after the events of the [[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|first film]] and a day after the events of the [[Jeepers Creepers 3|third film]], the Creeper abducts a young Billy Taggart in front of his father Jack Sr. and older brother Jack Jr. in its 22nd day of feeding. The next day, a school bus carrying a high school basketball team and cheerleaders suffers a [[blowout (tire)|blowout]], after one of the tires is hit by a hand-crafted [[shuriken]] made of bone fragments. Later a cheerleader named Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner who attempt to warn her about the Creeper before it blows out another tire and disables the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and coaches Charlie Hanna and Dwayne Barnes. When the Creeper returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty Braddock, Andy \"Bucky\" Buck, and Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every 23rd spring for 23 days to eat humans and she tells the other students.\n\nAfter hearing several police reports, the Taggarts go hunting for the Creeper and soon make radio contact with the school bus. The Creeper attacks Bucky, but Rhonda stabs it through the head with a [[Javelin throw|javelin]]. Dante begins prodding the Creeper's wing, only for it to grab and decapitate him. The Creeper tears off its injured head and uses Dante's severed head to replace its own. The students decide to leave the bus to find help, but the Creeper returns and chases them into a field, where it kills Jake and takes Scotty.\n\nWhen the Creeper attacks Jonny, Chelsea, and Bucky on the bus again, the Taggarts and their dog, Mac, arrive and Jack shoots it with a homemade harpoon, which the Creeper fights him off, managing to escape after flipping over the bus. Rhonda, Izzy Cohen, and Double D find a truck and attempt to escape but are chased by the Creeper again. Izzy pushes Rhonda out of the truck before causing the vehicle to crash, injuring both Double D and the Creeper, who loses an arm, a leg, and a wing, although Izzy crawls from the wreckage before the truck explodes. The Creeper continues to pursue Double D by leaping towards him and, when it has Double D pinned down, Jack shows up and shoots the Creeper in the head with the harpoon. He repeatedly stabs the Creeper in its heart but it goes into a hibernation state before it can die.\n\n23 years later, three teenagers drive out to the Taggart farm, where the Creeper is a [[sideshow]] attraction called \"A Bat Out of Hell\" and the middle-aged Jack Jr. is charging entrance fees. They see an elderly Jack Sr. watching it with the harpoon at his side and when they ask him if he is waiting for something, he looks up at the Creeper and says \"About three more days, give or take a day or two\".\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from the [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b88f6262f|title=Jeepers Creepers II (2002)|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031173706/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b88f6262f|archive-date=January 9, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref>\n<!-- SOME NAMES ARE UNCAPITALIZED PER WP:FILMCAST AND ARE LISTED PER THE ENDING CREDITS -->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ray Wise]] as Jack Taggart\n*[[Jonathan Breck]] as the Creeper\n*Garikayi Mutambirwa as Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis\n*[[Eric Nenninger]] as Scott \"Scotty\" Braddock\n*[[Nicki Aycox]] as Minxie Hayes\n*Travis Schiffner as Izzy Bohen\n*Lena Cardwell as Chelsea Farmer\n*[[Billy Aaron Brown]] as Andy \"Bucky\" Buck\n*Marieh Delfino as Rhonda Truitt\n*[[Diane Delano]] as Bus Driver Betty\n*[[Thom Gossom Jr.]] as Coach Charlie Hanna\n*Tom Tarantini as Coach Dwayne Barnes\n*[[Al Santos (actor)|Al Santos]] as Dante Belasco\n*Josh Hammond as Jake Spencer\n*Kasan Butcher as Kimball \"Big K\" Ward\n*[[Drew Tyler Bell]] as Jonny Young\n*Luke Edwards as Jack \"Jackie\" Taggart Jr.\n**Jon Powell as an older Jack Jr.\n*[[Shaun Fleming]] as Billy Taggart\n*[[Justin Long]] as Darry Jenner\n}}\nAdditionally, voice actor [[Bob Papenbrook]] appears as the man in the station wagon near the start of the film, while Marshall Cook, Joe Reegan, and Stephanie Denise Griffin star as the group seen at the end.<ref name=\"BFI\"/> Writer and director [[Victor Salva]] also makes a small, uncredited [[cameo appearance]] on the cover of a magazine briefly shown on the bus.<ref name=\"Poho\">{{cite web|url=http://pohocounty.blogspot.com/2009/06/return-to-poho-county.html|title=Return to Poho County|date=June 13, 2009|author=[[Victor Salva]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210109031745/http://pohocounty.blogspot.com/2009/06/return-to-poho-county.html|archive-date=January 9, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=January 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Jeepers Creepers 2'' opened in 3,124 theaters and had a U.S. domestic gross of $35.6 million.
