Produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], the film is the [[standalone sequel]] to ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]'' (2011) and the fifth installment in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]]. It stars <!-- Order based on the BOTTOM BILLING of the poster -->[[Johnny Depp]], [[Javier Bardem]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Brenton Thwaites]], [[Kaya Scodelario]], and [[Kevin McNally]]<!-- Order based on the BOTTOM BILLING of the poster -->.\n\nThe filmmakers cited the series' first installment, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003), as inspiration for the script and tone of the film, with critics describing the film as a \"[[Reboot (fiction)|requel]]\". Pre-production for the film started shortly before ''On Stranger Tides'' was released in early 2011, with [[Terry Rossio]] writing the initial script. In early 2013, [[Jeff Nathanson]] was hired to write a new script for the film, with Depp being involved in Nathanson's writing process. Initially planned for a 2015 release, the film was delayed to 2016 and then to 2017, due to script and budget issues. [[Principal photography]] started in Australia in February 2015, after the Australian government offered Disney $20 million in [[tax incentive]]s, and ended in July 2015.\n\n''Dead Men Tell No Tales'' premiered in Shanghai on May 11, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 26. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $795 million worldwide against a production budget between $230\u2013320 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nThirteen years after the battle of [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]]'s maelstrom,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007)}} a twelve-year-old [[Henry Turner (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Henry Turner]] boards the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' and informs his father, [[Will Turner|Will]], that the curse which binds Will to the ''Dutchman'' and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the [[Trident of Poseidon]]. Henry intends to recruit Captain [[Jack Sparrow]] to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the ''Dutchman'' then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident.\n\nNine years later, Henry is a sailor in the [[Royal Navy]]. The ship sails into the supernatural [[Devil's Triangle]] and stumbles upon the wreck of the ''Silent Mary'', whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate-hunter, Captain [[Armando Salazar]], attacks, killing the entire crew but leaving Henry as the sole survivor so that he can deliver a message to Jack, who killed Salazar and his crew decades ago by leading them to the Devil\u2019s Triangle and inadvertently cursed them.\n\nOn [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], a young astronomer named [[Carina Smyth]] is sentenced to death for [[witchcraft]] but escapes and crosses paths with Jack as he and his crew botch a bank robbery, suffering from a spell of [[Luck|bad luck]]. Jack later trades his compass for a drink, an act that destroys the Devil's Triangle and frees Salazar and his crew once more. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Carina and Jack stall the execution process, but they escape with the help of Henry and Jack's crew, setting sail on the ''Dying Gull''. Carina deciphers the clues in her diary, discovering that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain [[Hector Barbossa]] hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar has killed several pirates at sea and is destroying Barbossa's fleet. Barbossa talks his way out of being killed by offering to help find Jack and learns that the Trident could lead him to a \"treasure\". Salazar agrees, wanting revenge on Jack. Salazar pursues the ''Dying Gull'', forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the miniaturized ''[[Black Pearl]]''{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|In which the ship was shrunk by [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]] \"five winters\" earlier, during the events of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]'' (2011).}} to its original size. They continue their journey to the island, with Barbossa taking command of the ''Pearl'' once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter.\n\nThe ''Pearl'' approaches the Trident's island and evades a Royal Navy warship until it is destroyed by the ''Silent Mary'' before the ''Pearl'' runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean which opens a path to the Trident on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and possesses him to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back, and Jack distracts Salazar, allowing Henry to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the Trident's destruction causes the divided sea to close in on them. The ''Pearl'' lowers its anchor to lift the group to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary's cover, a trident star formation. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape.\n\nSometime later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will appears, free from the ''Dutchman''. His wife, [[Elizabeth Swann]], appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. Henry and Carina kiss. Jack watches from the ''Pearl'' before sailing away into the horizon, captain once again, while also adopting Captain Barbossa's monkey.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Will and Elizabeth are asleep in their bed, when [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] appears in their room. When he prepares to strike the couple, Will wakes up. Assuming he had a nightmare, he goes back to sleep, oblivious to the wet [[barnacle]]s on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members{{!}}List of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' cast members|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters|l2=characters}}\n<!-- Order based on the BOTTOM BILLING of the poster -->\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Captain [[Jack Sparrow]]: <br /> The former Captain of the ''Black Pearl'' who travels with Henry and Carina in search of the Trident of Poseidon.<ref name=\"Cast Depp\"/> R\u00f8nning wanted to focus on relatable characters, as in the first film, \"where Jack is not the [lead ... but] comes in and crashes the party every now and then,\"<ref name=\"Total Film.
