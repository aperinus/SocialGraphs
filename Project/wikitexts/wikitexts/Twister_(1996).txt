It was produced by Crichton, [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Ian Bryce]], with [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Walter Parkes]], [[Laurie MacDonald]], and [[Gerald R. Molen]] serving as [[executive producer]]s. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Helen Hunt]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Jami Gertz]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Alan Ruck]], [[Todd Field]], and [[Jeremy Davies]] as a group of amateur but spirited [[Storm chasing|storm chasers]] trying to deploy a [[tornado]] research device during a [[Tornado outbreak|severe outbreak]] in [[Oklahoma]]. ''Twister'' was officially released in theaters on May 10, 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koco.com/article/wakita-museum-ready-to-celebrate-25th-anniversary-of-iconic-movie-twister/36388377|title=Wakita museum ready to celebrate 25th anniversary of iconic movie 'Twister'|date=May 10, 2021|access-date=May 31, 2021|archive-date=June 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602215632/https://www.koco.com/article/wakita-museum-ready-to-celebrate-25th-anniversary-of-iconic-movie-twister/36388377|url-status=live}}</ref> It is notable for being the first film to be released on DVD in the United States.\n\n''Twister'' grossed $495&nbsp;million worldwide and became the [[1996 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1996]]; it sold an estimated 54.7&nbsp;million tickets in the U.S.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\" /> It received generally positive reviews from critics, as some praised the visual effects and sound design, but others criticized the screenplay. The film received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], but lost both to ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn a rural [[Oklahoma]] farm in 1969, young Jo Thornton and her family take shelter from a massive [[Fujita scale|F5 tornado]] that closes in on their home; Jo's father attempts to hold down the shelter door but gets sucked into the twister and is killed, and their farmhouse is completely destroyed. Twenty-seven years later, Jo is a [[meteorologist]] obsessed with tornadoes and leader of a rag-tag team of storm chasers. She is on the brink of divorce from retired storm chaser-turned-anchorman Bill. Bill travels to rural Oklahoma to get Jo to sign their divorce papers, also introducing his new fianc\u00e9, reproductive therapist Dr. Melissa Reeves. Though Bill has no intention of staying, he discovers that Jo has created \"Dorothy\", a capsule-like device filled with weather sensors that he conceptualized but never saw realized. Dorothy would be revolutionary for tornado research, but has to be dangerously deployed in the damage path of a tornado. Jo's team rushes off to chase a developing storm, while Bill and Melissa are forced to pursue them when Jo packs the unsigned papers.\n\nWhile getting a damaged tire replaced at a repair shop, he encounters Jonas Miller, a rival storm chaser and former colleague of Bill's, who has stolen his idea for a Dorothy-like device and plans to deploy his corporate-sponsored version first to receive sole credit. Enraged, Bill agrees to give Jo one day for her team to successfully deploy Dorothy. As the team pursues a developing F1 tornado, Bill accidentally gets Jo's vehicle stuck in a ditch, eventually crashing it into a small bridge. They seek shelter under the bridge as the tornado destroys the truck, along with one of the four Dorothy prototypes. With more storms developing, Bill uses his own truck, a [[Dodge Ram]], and leads the team to pursue an intensifying F2 tornado. Once again they encounter Jonas's team, but Bill uses his instinct to accurately predict a sudden change in the tornado's path. While driving across a bridge, they encounter two waterspouts that ambush their truck and thrash it about violently before dissipating. Bill and Jo are unscathed, though Melissa is traumatized.\n\nThe team talks Jo into visiting her aunt Meg's house in the nearby town of [[Wakita, Oklahoma|Wakita]]. Over [[steak and eggs]], Bill explains Jo's childhood story to Melissa, while Meg infers Jo is still in love with Bill and advises her to stay with him. The team learns of a developing twister and they scramble to pursue it. Jo and Bill intercept the tornado, but it turns out to be a violent F3 with highly unpredictable movements, knocking over powerlines that crush Dorothy II. With the truck damaged, Bill forces them to retreat, but Jo has a mental breakdown over the failure and argues about her motivations, her past, and her father. Bill admits he still has feelings for her, not realizing that their entire conversation is overheard by Melissa through the CB radio.\n\nThat night, the crew repair their vehicles in a shop next to a drive-in screening of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', where Jo finally signs the divorce papers to assuage Bill's conflicted feelings. However, the surprise appearance of an F4 tornado forces the team to seek shelter under the garage. The tornado obliterates the theater, destroys two of the team's vehicles, and injures several people, including one of the team members before proceeding directly towards Wakita. The team realizes that Meg is in grave danger and scramble to rescue her. Before they leave, Melissa gently breaks up with Bill and assures him that Jo still needs him.\n\nWakita, having no warning of the oncoming tornado due to its [[civil defense siren|tornado sirens]], is left in ruins. Though her home is flattened, Meg is rescued with minor injuries and encourages Jo to continue with her work so that future warnings will be more effective. With a record-breaking F5 tornado forecasted by the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] to form the next day, Bill and Jo are inspired by Meg's wind vanes to add aluminum \"wings\" to the last two Dorothy prototype sensors, making them more aerodynamic. The next day, the team pursue the correctly predicted, mile-wide F5 tornado. Their first attempt to deploy the unanchored Dorothy fails when it is destroyed by an airborne tree. Meanwhile, Jonas attempts to deploy his device, ignoring Bill and Jo's warnings to stay away from the tornado. As a result, his driver Eddie is impaled by a transmitter tower and their vehicle is swept away, killing them both in a fiery explosion. With the last remaining Dorothy affixed to the truck's bed, the two sacrifice Bill's truck by driving it directly at the tornado, setting the cruise control, and jumping out. Dorothy is successfully deployed with immediate results. However, Jo and Bill are forced to outrun the tornado on foot after it shifts toward them. They hide in a nearby pump house and, strapping themselves to deep pipes, they ride out the tornado, getting an incredible view of its core. After the tornado dissipates, they celebrate their success with the rest of the crew and rekindle their love.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Dr. Joanne \"Jo\" Harding, an eccentric meteorologist and storm-chaser. Before Hunt was cast, [[Laura Dern]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Kate Mulgrew]] were considered.\n** [[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] as Young Jo Thornton\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Dr. William \"Bill/The Extreme\" Harding, a former storm-chaser known for his bizarre \"tornado whispering\" methods, now a TV weather reporter. Before Paxton was cast, [[Tom Hanks]] was the original choice for the role, but had to drop out before allowing Paxton, his ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' co-star, to land in the role. Other actors such as [[Michael Keaton]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[John Travolta]], [[Richard Gere]], [[John Cusack]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Val Kilmer]] were all considered.\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Dr. Jonas Miller, a storm-chasing rival of Jo and Bill's who also leads a team of storm chasers. Before Elwes was cast, [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Christopher McDonald]] and [[Peter Greene]] were all considered.\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Dr. Melissa Reeves, a reproductive therapist and Bill's fianc\u00e9e. Before Gertz was cast, [[Mira Sorvino]] was considered, but she refused to dye her hair brown for the part.\n* [[Lois Smith]] as \"Aunt Meg\" Greene, Jo's loving aunt and mother figure to Jo's Team.

Three one-time Oklahoma City television meteorologists\u2014[[Gary England]], then-chief meteorologist at [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated television station]] [[KWTV-DT|KWTV]]; Jeff Lazalier, then a weekend meteorologist at [[NBC]]-affiliated television station [[KFOR-TV]]; and [[Rick Mitchell (meteorologist)|Rick Mitchell]], then-chief meteorologist at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated television station [[KOCO-TV]]\u2014all appear as themselves within the movie's local television news reports. The opening scene in which England appears via archival footage provided by KWTV, takes place in 1969, when England was an oceanographer for [[New Orleans]]-based A.H. Glenn and Associates; he would not be hired by KWTV until October 1972. Additionally, the [[weather radio]] operator heard toward the beginning of the movie was voiced by Andy Wallace, then-chief meteorologist at ABC-affiliated television station [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]].<ref name=GE>{{cite web|title=Gary England|url=http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=7449859|website=KWTV-DT|access-date=October 22, 2012|archive-date=May 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520221111/http://www.news9.com/Global/story.asp?S=7449859|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n===Writing and pre-production===\n''Twister'' was produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], with financial backing from [[Warner Bros.

Steven Spielberg was intrigued by the idea and presented the concept to writer [[Michael Crichton]]. Crichton and his wife, Anne-Marie Martin, were paid a reported $2.5 million to write the screenplay, which made ''Twister'' the single most expensive screenplay ever written at that time. \n\nSpielberg himself was originally attached to direct the project, and directors such as [[James Cameron]], [[John Badham]], [[Tim Burton]], and [[Robert Zemeckis]] were also in talks to helm the film before [[Jan de Bont]] signed on to ''Twister'' after leaving ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' due to creative differences.<ref name=\"Daly\">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|title=The War of the Winds|last=Daly|first=Steve|date=May 10, 1996|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=June 14, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018030610/https://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/twister-set-got-stormy/|archive-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref> He recently had a huge hit after directing his first film, ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', which was released in 1994.

Also, one of the main characters, Bill Harding, was set to be played by [[Tom Hanks]], however, he dropped out of the film and would later work on ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'' as writer and director instead, saying that \"an action movie wasn't what I wanted to do at that point in my career.\" While working on ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', Hanks suggested the role to his co-star, [[Bill Paxton]]. He was hired based in part on the recommendation of his friend and frequent collaborator James Cameron, and De Bont liked that Paxton was actually experienced with Oklahoma.<ref name=\"80sKids\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eightieskids.com/facts-about-1996s-twister-that-will-blow-you-away/|title=Twister: 20 Facts About The 1996 Blockbuster That Will Blow You Away|date=April 30, 2021 }}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Helen Hunt]] chose not to play Terry Carmichael in ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' and would instead play Jo Thornton-Harding after [[Laura Dern]] declined on playing that role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eightieskids.com/things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-1996-action-film-broken-arrow/|title=10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About John Woo's Broken Arrow|date=October 8, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nThe production was plagued with problems: [[Joss Whedon]] was brought in to rewrite through the early spring of 1995. When Whedon contracted [[bronchitis]], [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought in to work on script revisions. Whedon later returned and worked on revisions right through the start of shooting in May 1995, then left the project after he got married. Two weeks into production, [[Jeff Nathanson]] was flown to the set and worked on the script until principal photography ended.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> After the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] occurred on April 19, 1995, filming of ''Twister'' was suspended while the cast and crew worked with relief efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/2503583/twister-crew-enjoys-clear-sky|title=\"Twister\" Crew Enjoys Clear Sky}}</ref>\n\nThere was a scene where Dusty was laughing heartily and leaning back, lifting one of his legs.

After primary filming had wrapped, additional pick-up shots and reshoots, which included the opening scene and additional footage of the drive-in tornado, took place in [[Bolton, Ontario]] and Schomberg, Ontario.\n\nHalfway through filming, both Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt were temporarily blinded by bright electronic lamps used to make the sky behind the two actors look dark and stormy. Paxton remembers that \"these things literally sunburned our eyeballs. I got back to my room, I couldn't see\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> To solve the problem, a Plexiglas filter was placed in front of the beams. The actors took eye drops and wore special glasses for a few days to recuperate. After filming in a particularly unsanitary ditch (for the first tornado chase scene, in which Bill and Jo are forced to shelter from an approaching F1 tornado under a short bridge), Hunt and Paxton needed hepatitis shots. During the same sequence, Hunt repeatedly hit her head on a low wooden bridge, so exhausted from the demanding shoot that she stood up so quickly her head struck a beam.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> During one stunt in which Hunt opened the door of a vehicle speeding through a cornfield, she momentarily let go of the door and it struck her on the side of the head. Some sources claim she received a concussion in the incident. De Bont said, \"I love Helen to death, but you know, she can be also a little bit clumsy\". She responded, \"Clumsy? The guy burned my retinas, but I'm clumsy ... I thought I was a good sport. I don't know ultimately if Jan chalks me up as that or not, but one would hope so\".<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nSome crew members, feeling that De Bont was \"out of control\", left the production five weeks into filming.<ref name=\"Daly\" /> The camera crew led by [[Don Burgess (cinematographer)|Don Burgess]] claimed De Bont \"didn't know what he wanted till he saw it. He would shoot one direction, with all the equipment behind the view of the camera, and then he'd want to shoot in the other direction right away and we'd have to move [everything] and he'd get angry that we took too long ... and it was always everybody else's fault, never his\".<ref name=\"Daly\" /> De Bont claims that they had to schedule at least three scenes every day because the weather changed so often, and \"Don had trouble adjusting to that\".<ref name=\"Daly\" />\n\nWhen De Bont knocked over a camera assistant in a fit of rage who missed a cue, Burgess and his crew walked off the set, much to the shock of the cast. They remained in place for one more week until [[Jack N. Green]]'s crew agreed to replace them. Two days before principal filming ended, Green was injured when a hydraulic house set (used in the scene in which Jo and Bill rescue Meg and her dog, Mose, from her tornado-destroyed home in Wakita), designed to collapse on cue, was mistakenly activated with him inside it. A rigged ceiling hit him in the head and injured his back, requiring him to be hospitalized.
