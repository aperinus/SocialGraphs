Halfway through Calvin's speech, a group of bullies led by Trevor Olson throws the naked [[Obesity-associated morbidity|morbidly obese]] nerd Robbie Weirdicht (who was taking a shower in the locker room) into the gymnasium where the [[school assembly]] is taking place. Everyone starts laughing except for Joyner and his girlfriend, Maggie Johnson, who are the only ones sympathetic towards Weirdicht; the former even going as far as to quickly cover Weirdicht with his varsity jacket in a moment of compassion. Weirdicht thanks Calvin and flees in embarrassment.\n\n20 years later, Joyner is married to Maggie and works as a [[forensic accountant]], but he is dissatisfied with his career. Maggie suggests they see a therapist to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Joyner receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who invites Joyner to meet at a bar. Stone reveals himself to be Weirdicht. Joyner is shocked to see that Weirdicht has transformed from a morbidly obese nerd into a muscular, fit, confident man with advanced [[hand-to-hand combat]] skills.\n\nStone asks Joyner to review some online transactions, and Joyner discovers a multimillion-dollar [[auction]] with bidders from radical countries, with the final bids set to conclude the following day. Stone avoids Joyner's questions and spends the night on his couch. The next morning, a team of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents led by Pamela Harris arrives at Joyner's house in search of Stone, who already escaped. Harris tells Joyner that Stone is a dangerous rogue agent who [[Homicide|murdered]] his former partner, Phil Stanton.\n\nHarris tells Joyner that Stone intends to sell satellite codes to the highest bidder. Soon after, Stone abducts Joyner and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the codes but needs Joyner's skills to locate the meeting place. After an attack by a bounty hunter, Joyner flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the [[Family therapy|marriage counselor]]'s office. Harris intercepts him and tells him that Stone is the Black Badger. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Stone's location.\n\nJoyner then arrives to meet Maggie for their marriage counseling session, where he finds Stone posing as the counselor. Stone convinces Joyner to help him, so he sets up a meeting with Trevor Olson, who is able to track the offshore account for the [[auction]] so they can get the deal's location. Olson apologizes for bullying Stone, but fabricates his apology before once again antagonizing Stone. Harris calls Joyner and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Stone. Joyner reluctantly betrays Stone, and the CIA arrests him.\n\nAs Harris [[torture]]s Stone to get him to confess, Joyner helps Stone escape. Joyner finds that the deal is happening in a [[Boston]] underground parking garage and helps Stone steal a plane. Stone enters alone, while Joyner sees Harris entering a short while later. He assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her only to find Stone meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Stone shoots Joyner, grazing his neck, to keep him safe. Stanton arrives, having faked his death, and reveals himself as the Black Badger.\n\nA fight breaks out, and Stanton reveals his plan to frame Stone for the crime. Stone kills Stanton by ripping his throat out. Joyner and Stone make it in time to their 20th year high school reunion. Upon arriving, Joyner reconciles with Maggie and promises to improve their marriage. The new prom king is announced to be Stone; Joyner reveals to Maggie that he hacked the school's voting system to make it happen. Olson shows up to bully Stone again, but Stone finally stands up for himself and punches him unconscious.\n\nStone gives an acceptance speech in which he reveals he is Weirdicht, cites the importance of overcoming obstacles, and praises Joyner as his best friend. He then relives his most embarrassing incident on his own terms by stripping off all his clothes. Stone then encounters his high school crush Darla, whom he proceeds to dance with. Maggie is now pregnant, and Joyner has joined the CIA as Stone's co-worker. As a gift for his first day on the job, Stone returns Joyner's varsity jacket.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Calvin Joyner: A former popular star athlete that went to high school with Robbie, now working as an accountant.\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Bob Stone / Robbie Weirdicht: A formerly bullied, overweight, morbidly obese, friendless, socially awkward high school student-turned-big bodied CIA agent and hand-to-hand combatant.\n** Sione Kelepi as Young Robbie Weirdicht (body double)\n* [[Amy Ryan]] as Agent Pamela Harris: A CIA agent who suspects Bob is a rogue agent.\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Phil Stanton: Bob's former partner, who is believed to be dead after apparently being killed in action.\n* [[Danielle Nicolet]] as Maggie Joyner: Calvin's high school sweetheart now turned wife.\n* [[Timothy John Smith (actor)|Timothy John Smith]] as Agent Nick Cooper.\n* [[Megan Park]] as the waitress in the bar.\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as the buyer: A man who wants to buy US satellite codes.\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Trevor Olson: A former high school student who bullied Robbie in the past.\n** Dylan Boyack as Young Trevor\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Darla McGuchian (uncredited): Robbie's former high school crush.\n* [[Kumail Nanjiani]] as Jared: the airport security guard.\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as Steve\n\n== Production ==\nThe script was greenlit by [[Universal Pictures]] in 2010, and Thurber was selected to direct and started to write the script together with [[Ike Barinholtz]] and David Stassen.
