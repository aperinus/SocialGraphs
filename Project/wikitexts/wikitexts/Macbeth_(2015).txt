The story follows a Scottish general's rise to power after receiving a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Like the play it was adapted from, the film dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.\n\n''Macbeth'' premiered on 23 May 2015 at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] where it was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]].<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/61306.html|title=2015 Official Selection|work=Cannes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418084150/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/61306.html|archive-date=18 April 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/61347.html|title=Screenings Guide|date=6 May 2015|work=Festival de Cannes|access-date=8 May 2015}}</ref> The film was theatrically released by [[StudioCanal]] on 2 October 2015 in the [[United Kingdom]] and on 18 November 2015 in France. It received generally positive reviews from film critics who praised both Fassbender and Cotillard's performances, as well as those of the rest of the cast, visual style, script, direction and war sequences. Despite the positive critical reaction, the film grossed just $16&nbsp;million worldwide against its production budget of $20&nbsp;million.\n\n==Plot==\n===Act I===\nThe film starts with the Macbeths grieving at their child's funeral. Then, Macbeth leads King Duncan's troops into a civil war battle. He emerges victorious, despite losses, including boy soldiers. Three women with a girl and infant approach Macbeth and Banquo, hailing Macbeth as [[Thane (Scotland)|Thane]] of [[Cawdor]] and future King, and Banquo as a father of Kings, before disappearing.\n\n===Act II===\nDuncan hears of Macbeth's victory and executes the Thane of Cawdor for traitorously allying with [[Norsemen|Norse]] invaders, giving Macbeth his title. Macbeth tells his wife of the prophecies. Lady Macbeth prays to the dark spirits for guidance. When Macbeth says Duncan will stay overnight, she urges him to kill the King to fulfill the prophecy. A feast is held, where the King pronounces Malcolm his heir. Macbeth hesitates but Lady Macbeth persuades him to kill Duncan while she drugs his servants. After the feast, Macbeth sees a boy soldier's ghost, who gives him a dagger and leads him towards Duncan's tent whom Macbeth slays. Malcolm enters and, seeing the body, flees. Shaken, Macbeth goes to his wife, giving her two daggers. Lady Macbeth rebukes him for not leaving them and puts them in the sleeping servants' hands. She meets Macbeth in the church where they wash their hands, saying they have washed their deed away.\n\nIn the morning, Macduff finds Duncan dead and Macbeth slaughters the servants to prevent their denial. Macduff and noble Lennox believe Malcolm's flight is suspicious and admire Macbeth's summary justice. With Malcolm gone, Macbeth is crowned. Afterwards, he sourly complains to his wife that killing Duncan was for nothing as Macbeth has no heirs, so the crown will pass to Banquo and his son, Fleance, as prophesied. He invites them to a banquet but discovers they plan to leave, as Banquo is suspicious. Macbeth sends assassins: Banquo is killed, but Fleance escapes.\nDuring the evening, Macbeth mentions Banquo not attending as promised. Macbeth asks the assassins for news and is enraged that Fleance has escaped. Then, Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost. Afraid, he talks to it. Lady Macbeth says her husband is unwell, but Macbeth continues to rave, prompting Macduff and his wife to leave. Lady Macbeth dismisses the guests and takes Macbeth away.\n\n===Act IV===\nMacbeth talks to the witches. They show him a vision of slain soldiers who tell him to beware Macduff, and that Macbeth shall be King until [[Great Birnam Wood]] comes to the royal castle at [[Dunsinane Hill]]. The boy soldier's ghost who gave him the dagger tells Macbeth that he will not be slain by man born of a woman. The King is found wandering by Lennox who tells him that Macduff has fled. Anxious and enraged, Macbeth orders the death of Macduff's family and servants. The family are [[burned at the stake]], while a distraught Lady Macbeth watches. Afterwards, she washes the dagger.\nMeanwhile, Macduff meets Malcolm, who is gathering troops. Ross and Angus inform Macduff about his household's murder. Grief-stricken and angry, Macduff swears revenge.\n\n===Act V===\nGuilt-ridden, Lady Macbeth returns to the church, lamenting their deeds and her bloody hands (in a [[soliloquy]] often referred to as \"[[Out damned spot]]!\"). She sees her child's ghost, which she urges to sleep. Then she wanders in the hills and sees the witches.\n\nIn the castle, Macbeth is rumoured mad, and all fear his anger and [[tyranny]]. He is told of his wife's  death. Speaking the famous soliloquy, starting \"[[tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow]]\" (also known by the lines in it beginning \"Out, out, brief candle!\"), he carries her body in despair. Seyton brings news Malcolm is leading an army and Macbeth demands his armour.\n\nMacduff fires Birnam Wood: with smoke blowing towards them, the prophecy is fulfilled. Macbeth sallies out and duels with Macduff. Macbeth is confident, as \"no man born of woman\" can kill him. Macduff states he was [[Caesarean section|untimely ripped]] from his mother's womb and, using Macbeth's distraction, stabs him. Macbeth regrets his mistakes, knowing redemption is impossible. Macbeth refuses to bow before Malcolm, allowing himself to be killed. The witches, observing, leave. Malcolm is hailed King and all go to his castle. Malcolm leaves the throne room while Fleance takes Macbeth's sword and charges through the empty battlefield, disappearing into the smoke.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]\n*[[Marion Cotillard]] as [[Lady Macbeth]]\n*[[Paddy Considine]] as [[Banquo]]\n*[[Sean Harris]] as [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]\n*[[Jack Reynor]] as [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]] \n*[[Elizabeth Debicki]] as [[Lady Macduff]]\n*[[David Thewlis]] as [[King Duncan]]\n*[[David Hayman]] as Lennox\n*[[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] as Menteith\n*Brian Nickels as [[Thane of Cawdor]]\n*Ross Anderson as Rosse\n*[[James Harkness (actor)|James Harkness]] as Angus\n*Seylan Mhairi Baxter, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon and Amber Rissmann as the [[Three Witches|Witches]]\n*Lochlann Harris as [[Fleance]]\n*[[Hilton McRae]] as Macdonwald\n*Scott Dymond as Seyton\n*[[Rebecca Benson]] as Maidservant\n*Gerard Miller as Macbeth's messenger\n*Roy Sampson as Doctor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe production company behind ''Macbeth'' is [[See-Saw Films]]; the film was distributed by [[StudioCanal]] worldwide.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place over seven weeks in England and Scotland,<ref>{{cite news|last=Sandwell|first=Ian|title=Macbeth starts shoot|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/macbeth-starts-shoot/5066286.article?referrer=RSS|access-date=8 February 2014|publisher=screendaily.com|date=6 February 2014}}</ref> beginning on 6 February 2014 in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard Roll on 'Macbeth'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/international/michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-roll-on-macbeth-1201089254/|access-date=8 February 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=6 February 2014}}</ref> On 21 February, filming took place at [[Hankley Common]] in [[Elstead]], Surrey.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Jennifer|title=Inverness comes to Hankley Common for Macbeth filming|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/inverness-comes-hankley-common-macbeth-6730213|access-date=23 February 2014|publisher=getsurrey.co.uk|date=21 February 2014}}</ref> On 26 February, the cast and crew were spotted on set at [[Bamburgh Castle]] in Northumberland with almost 200 extras.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood A-lister Michael Fassbender filming in Northumberland|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/hollywood-a-lister-michael-fassbender-filming-6748107|access-date=16 May 2014|publisher=chroniclelive.co.uk|date=26 February 2014}}</ref> Other locations used include [[Quiraing]] in [[Skye]], and [[Ely Cathedral]] in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Michael|title=Filming of \"Macbeth\" begins on Skye|url=http://www.whfp.com/2014/02/21/3099/|publisher=whfp.com|access-date=23 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419031740/http://www.whfp.com/2014/02/21/3099/|archive-date=19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=DAY|first=JORDAN|title=Setting up for filming of Macbeth at Ely Cathedral gets underway|url=http://www.ely-news.co.uk/News/Setting-up-for-filming-of-Macbeth-at-Ely-Cathedral-gets-underway-20140317152633.htm|access-date=16 April 2014|publisher=ely-news.co.uk|date=17 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ely: Macbeth Filming Underway|url=http://www.heart.co.uk/cambridge/news/local/ely-macbeth-filming-underway/|access-date=16 April 2014|publisher=heart.co.uk|date=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nBamburgh 2006 closeup.jpg|Bamburgh Castle.\nQuiraing in Skye island in summer 2012 (7).JPG|Quiraing.\nEly Cathedral Lady Chapel, Cambridgeshire, UK -

The exception, Tynan continued, immediately contradicting his claim, was [[Laurence Olivier]], who in a [[Macbeth (unfinished film)#Stratford-upon-Avon stage production|1955 production]] 'shook hands with greatness.' With his Macbeth, Mr. Fassbender, who routinely shakes hands with greatness in films that don't remotely do the same, produces a man whose anguish eventually becomes a powerful counterpoint to his deeds, partly because he's already dead by the time he utters his first word.
