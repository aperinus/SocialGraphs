It stars [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]] as American [[astronaut]]s who are stranded in [[outer space|space]] after the mid-orbit destruction of their [[Space Shuttle]], and attempt to return to [[Earth]].\n\nCuar\u00f3n wrote the screenplay with his son [[Jon\u00e1s Cuar\u00f3n|Jon\u00e1s]] and attempted to develop the film at [[Universal Pictures]]. Later, the distribution rights were acquired by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. [[David Heyman]], who previously worked with Cuar\u00f3n on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004), produced the film with him. ''Gravity'' was produced entirely in the United Kingdom, where British [[visual effects]] company [[Framestore]] spent more than three years creating most of the film's visual effects, which involve over 80 of its 91 minutes.\n\n''Gravity'' opened the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 28, 2013, and had its North American premiere three days later at the [[Telluride Film Festival]]. Upon its release, ''Gravity'' was met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its direction and visuals. Considered one of the best films of 2013, it appeared on numerous critics' year-end lists, and was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] in their annual ''Movies of the Year'' list.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2013/12/afi-awards-2013-film-winners-full-list-649223/ |title=AFI Awards 2013: Top 10 Films List Is Good News For Major Studios |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=December 9, 2013 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref> The film became the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth highest-grossing film of 2013]] with a worldwide gross of over $723 million, against a production budget of around $100 million.\n\nThe film earned accolades from numerous critics and guilds.

Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission, to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a [[Extravehicular activity|spacewalk]], [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in [[Houston]] warns ''Explorer''{{'}}s crew about a rapidly expanding cloud of [[space debris]] accidentally caused by the Russians having shot down a presumed defunct spy satellite (see [[Kessler syndrome]]) and orders the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more communication satellites are knocked out by the debris.\n\nHigh-speed debris strikes the ''Explorer'' and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the Explorer, soon discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which is in orbit about {{convert|900|mi||-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.\n\nOn their way to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two [[Soyuz TMA|Soyuz]] spacecraft, the remaining Soyuz spacecraft exhibiting damage with its parachute having been deployed in space rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby [[Tiangong-1|Tiangong]] space station,{{refn|name=Distinction|group=N|This Tiangong Space Station discussed here is [[Tiangong-1]].}} {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on}} away, in order to board the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou]] spacecraft to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; the duo's tether snaps on one of the station's solar panels. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.\n\nStone enters the space station via the [[airlock]] of the ''[[Pirs (ISS module)|Pirs]]'' module. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski or Earth, and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong, but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.\n\nAfter an attempt at radio communication with an [[Inuit|Inuk]] on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose [[consciousness]], there is a knock on the window, and Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's [[Retrorocket|soft landing rockets]] to propel the capsule toward Tiangong, before himself disappearing. Realizing Kowalski's appearance was an [[hallucination]], Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong.\n\nUnable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong. Stone manages to enter Tiangong{{'}}s Shenzhou capsule just as the station enters the upper atmosphere, undocking the capsule just in time.\n\nThe Shenzhou capsule [[atmospheric entry|re-enters the atmosphere]] successfully, despite having sustained debris damage during its descent, and lands in a lake. Radio communication from Houston informs Stone that she has been tracked on radar and that rescue crews are on their way. Stone opens the hatch but is unable to exit due to water rushing in. She takes a deep breath and holds it until the capsule sinks, allowing her to swim through the hatch. She sheds her [[Sokol space suit]] that is weighing her down, and crawls onto the beach before standing up triumphantly and walking away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 130\n| width2    = 151\n| footer    = [[Sandra Bullock]] in 2013 (left) and [[George Clooney]] in 2016\n| image1    = Sandra Bullock (9189702847).jpg\n| alt1      = Sandra Bullock\n| image2    = George Clooney 2016.jpg\n| alt2      = George Clooney\n}}\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Dr. Ryan Stone,<ref name=\"VeniceFilmReview\" /> a medical engineer and mission specialist from [[Lake Zurich, Illinois]], who is on her first space mission.<ref name=\"sandra\" /> According to Cuar\u00f3n, Stone is \"a character who lives in her own bubble\", and in the film \"she's trapped in her space suit.\"<ref name=\"Wired\"/> Bullock's role was extremely demanding and daunting.

space{{mdash}}the vanguard of human civilization{{mdash}}and ends with an [[allegory]] of the dawn of mankind when Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuar\u00f3n said, \"She's in these murky waters almost like an [[amniotic fluid]] or a [[primordial sea|primordial soup]], in which you see [[amphibians]] swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she's a bit curved until she is completely erect.

According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |title=Here's what 'Gravity' gets right and wrong about space |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/21/heres-what-gravity-gets-right-and-wrong-about-space/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n* By the time [[Tiangong-1]] was launched in 2011, the [[Space Shuttle]] had been [[Space Shuttle retirement|retired from service]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131027-why-gravity-is-junk-science |title=Why Gravity is junk science |first=Quentin |last=Cooper |website=BBC Future |date=October 28, 2013}}</ref>\n* Stone is shown not wearing [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|liquid-cooled ventilation garments]] or even socks, which are always worn under the EVA suit to protect against extreme temperatures in space.
