However, in the chauvinistic world of early 17th century Italy, women are forbidden to paint human nudes or enter the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Academy of Arts]]. Orazio allows his daughter to study in his studio, although he draws the line at letting her view nude males. She is direct and determined, and bribes the fisherman Fulvio with a kiss to let her observe his body and draw him.\n\nArtemisia seeks the tutelage of [[Agostino Tassi]] (Mike Manojlovic), who is painting frescoes in the same building as her father, to learn from him the art of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. Tassi is a man notorious for his night-time debauchery. The two hone their skills as artists, but they also fall in love, and begin having sexual relations. Artemisia's father discovers the couple together and files a lawsuit against Tassi for rape. During the subsequent trial, Artemisia's physical state is investigated by two nuns, and then she is [[torture]]d by cords wound round her fingers. Nevertheless, Artemisia denies being raped, and proclaims their mutual love. Tassi himself, devastated by her plight, admits to raping her in order to stop her ordeal.\n\nMerlet said of her film, \"I didn't want to show her as a victim but like a more modern woman who took her life into her own hands.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Valentina Cervi]] - [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]\n* [[Michel Serrault]] - [[Orazio Gentileschi]]\n* [[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]] - [[Agostino Tassi]]\n* [[Luca Zingaretti]] - Cosimo Quorli\n* [[Emmanuelle Devos]] - Costanza\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierrot]] - Roberto\n* [[Brigitte Catillon]] - Tuzia\n* [[Yann Tr\u00e9gou\u00ebt]] - Fulvio\n* [[Maurice Garrel]] - The Judge\n* [[Liliane Rov\u00e8re]] - The Rich Merchant's Wife\n* [[Jacques Nolot]] - The Lawyer\n\n==Controversy==\nThe film focuses on the incident of Artemisia's rape and its immediate aftermath, and was initially advertised as \"a true story\" by Miramax Zoe, its American distributor. However,\n\n<blockquote>In the transcript (of Gentileschi's testimony at the trial, based on records preserved in an archive in Rome),  Gentileschi describes the rape in graphic detail and states that Tassi continued to have sex with her... with the understanding that he would protect her honor by eventually wedding her ... In the movie, by contrast, she's a willing partner in lust. During the trial, she says only that \"I love him\"; \"he loves me\"; \"he gives me pleasure.\" In the movie, Gentileschi refuses to testify that she was raped, even under torture, a sacrifice that prompts a devastated Tassi to make a sham confession ... Just as problematic....is the way the movie ascribes Gentileschi's creative maturation to the influence of, of all people, the man whom history records as her assailant ... At the same time, many inconvenient details \u2013 most glaringly, Tassi's relentless campaign during the trial to smear Gentileschi as a slut \u2013 didn't make it into the movie ...<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.salon1999.com/ent/movies/feature/1998/05/15feature.html| first=Alyssa| last=Katz| title=Was It Rape Or Was It Love?| magazine=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]| date=May 15, 1998| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201202615/http://www.salon1999.com/ent/movies/feature/1998/05/15feature.html| archive-date=December 1, 2008| access-date=August 31, 2022 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nArt historian [[Mary Garrard]] and feminist [[Gloria Steinem]], incensed by the misinformation in the film, organized a campaign to inform audiences for \"Artemisia\" that what they were seeing was not, as was promised in early advertisements, \"The Untold True Story of an Extraordinary Woman.\". They put up a website attacking the film as untruthful in presenting what they say was Artemisia's rape by her teacher, Agostino Tassi. At the New York premiere screening of the film on April 28, Gloria Steinem and other women in the audience circulated a fact sheet prepared by Steinem and Garrard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.efn.org/~acd/Artemisia.html |title=On Artemisia Gentileschi |access-date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122122458/http://members.efn.org/~acd/Artemisia.html |archive-date=2012-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This intervention led Miramax to retract its claim that that film presents a \"true\" story. Steinem and Garrard's stated intention was not to interfere with the filmmaker's creative freedom, nor with Miramax's distribution of the film, but rather to counter its historical distortions with concrete factual information about the subject.<ref>http://songweaver.com/art/artemesia.html{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref>\n\n===The other side===\nFeminist [[Germaine Greer]] points out in her chapter on Artemisia in her book on women painters, ''The Obstacle Race'', that the rape trial transcripts are not transparent, and that there is evidence that supports Merlet's construction. The rape trial records may be found in an appendix to Garrard's book. Garrard interprets them one way (Artemisia was raped, didn't love Tassi); Greer interprets them differently (Artemisia was raped, but came to love her rapist); Merlet offers a third interpretation (Artemisia loved her rapist from the start). Garrard's account was savaged by a number of feminist reviewers, and most recently challenged by [[Griselda Pollock]] in ''Differencing the Canon'':\n\n<blockquote>Merlet's film is, I would argue, not really a biography, for there is no analysis of the impact of the early death of the artist's mother and her bereavement, no exploration of how she made a massively successful career in Italy and beyond after the horrors of the trial and her torture, how she married and mothered several daughters who also became artists, how she negotiated with some of the major patrons of her time for the commissions on which she lived and through which she, not their father, accumulated dowries for her daughter. No one wants to tell that story.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.impetustoanalysis.com/2010/02/artemisia-gentileschi/ |title=Artemisia Gentileschi |website=Maine College of Art \u2013 Impetus to Analysis: Practitioners |access-date=2010-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027083843/http://www.impetustoanalysis.com/2010/02/artemisia-gentileschi/ |archive-date=2010-10-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n(Artemisia had only one daughter who survived to adulthood, Prudentia, but as she was known by another name, Palmira, some scholars have erroneously concluded they were two different women.)\n\n==Critical receptions==\n''New York Times'' film critic [[Stephen Holden]] was very favourable towards the film:\n\n<blockquote>This handsomely photographed film, whose indoor scenes recreate the heavy [[chiaroscuro]] of [[Caravaggio]] paintings, takes a decidedly 90s view of a woman whom feminist art historians rescued from obscurity in the 1970s. If the central character emerges as a feminist heroine for flouting patriarchical taboos, she also happens to be a tantalizing sex kitten whose artistic curiosity smacks of voyeurism. As portrayed by Valentina Cervi, Artemisia is two distinctly different entities. One is a gorgeous early-17th-century sex kitten. The other is a fearlessly ambitious teen-age prodigy who is so sure of her talent that she breaks the rules of female decorum and dares go where no ''nice'' woman of her time and station has gone before. These two Artemisias don't really fit together, but they make for a ripely sensuous portrait of the artist as a saucy but virtuous siren.<ref>{{cite news| title=FILM REVIEW; Agony and Ecstasy, Especially Ecstasy| first=Stephen| last=Holden| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=May 8, 1998| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=950DE3DB1231F93BA35756C0A96E958260| access-date=August 31, 2022| url-access=subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] also liked the film:\n\n<blockquote>''Artemisia'' is as much about art as about sex, and it contains a lot of information about techniques, including the revolutionary idea of moving the easel outside and painting from nature. It lacks, however, detailed scenes showing drawings in the act of being created (for that you need ''[[La Belle Noiseuse]]'', [[Jacques Rivette]]'s 1991 movie that peers intimately over the shoulder of an artist in love). And it doesn't show a lot of Artemisia's work. What it does show is the gift of Valentina Cervi, who is another of those modern European actresses, like [[Juliette Binoche]], [[Irene Jacob]], [[Emmanuelle B\u00e9art|Emmanuelle Beart]] and [[Julie Delpy]], whose intelligence, despite everything else, is the most attractive thing about her.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980615/REVIEWS/806150301/1023| newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| title=Artemisia| first=Roger| last=Ebert| author-link=Roger Ebert| date=June 15, 1998| access-date=August 31, 2022}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n[[Daphne Merkin]] wrote in the ''New Yorker'':\n\n<blockquote>This controversial and confused new film, written and directed by Agn\u00e8s Merlet, is ostensibly about the seventeenth-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi, but it is really the silliest form of late-twentieth-century iconography. The movie, which stars the fetching Valentina Cervi, makes a sexy love story out of Artemisia's relationship with her teacher, Agostino Tassi (played by Miki Manojlovic): it's art lessons as foreplay. \"Let yourself go,\" Tassi tells his young pupil, as though he is quoting from Masters and Johnson, and Artemisia not only expertly guides him in bed but insists that he gave her pleasure when he raped her. Although the real Artemisia did flout the conventions of her time by insisting on painting from live models, it's hard to believe that she proceeded with the air of defiant entitlement she's given here. Once you accept the film on its own fraudulent terms, however, it's quite engaging-not least because of the erotic subtext.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/artemisia_merlet| magazine=[[The New Yorker]]| title=Film Review: Artemisia| date=June 1, 1998}}{{dead link|date=August 2022}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Other works inspired by the artist's life==\n* Alexandra Lapierre:[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802138578 ''Artemisia: A Novel'']\n* Sally Clark: [http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/clark-sally.html ''Life Without Instruction''], a play by the Canadian playwright\n* Cathy Caplan:[http://www.playscripts.com/play.php3?playid=437 ''Lapis Blue Blood Red''], a play which opened off-Broadway in 2002\n* Susan Vreeland:[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0142001821 ''The Passion of Artemisia: A Novel'']\n* Rauda Jamis: [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1982847M/Artemisia_ou_La_renomme%CC%81e ''Artemisia ou La Renomm\u00e9e''  1990] (in French, not translated in English yet)\n* Anna Banti:[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803262132 ''Artemisia'']\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Mieke Bal]], ed: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226035824 ''The Artemisia Files; Artemsia Gentileschi for Feminists and Other Thinking People''].
