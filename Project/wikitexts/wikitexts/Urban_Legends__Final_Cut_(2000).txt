In addition to directing, Ottman also edited the film and composed its score. A sequel to ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998), it is the second installment in the [[Urban Legend (film series)|''Urban Legend'' film series]]. It follows a film student being stalked by a serial killer in a [[fencing]] mask, who begins murdering the crew members of her [[thesis]] film about [[urban legend]]s.\n\nFilmed in late 1999, ''Urban Legends: Final Cut'' was released in the United States on September 22, 2000 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. Although it made only roughly half of its predecessor's gross, it was still successful, grossing $38.6 million on a budget of $14 million. The film was universally panned by critics upon release, and was followed by the [[direct-to-video]] sequel ''[[Urban Legends: Bloody Mary]]'' in 2005.\n\n== Plot ==\nAmy Mayfield, a student at a prestigious film school, is unsure about what her thesis film is going to be. But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson about her experience with [[Urban Legend (film)|a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in]], she is inspired to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, fellow student Lisa has a drink with classmate Travis at a bar before her scheduled flight out of town. While leaving the bar, she begins to feel dazed, and is attacked and abducted in the coat room. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney has been removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window, but is decapitated in the process.\n\nThe next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby, who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra, Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor. Her peers witness her [[snuff film|filmed death]] when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene. Amy is disturbed by the footage, and is unable to figure out who shot it; her peers, however, discount it as a piece of a [[showreel]]. Sandra's absence is unnoticed, as she was supposed to leave for an audition in [[Los Angeles]] for a bit part on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' the following day.\n\nTravis commits suicide in the campus tower, apparently spurred by a poor grade received on his thesis film which disqualified him from receiving the university's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock Award]]. At his funeral, the arrogant Graham, the son of a Hollywood director, offers to help Amy with her film; she declines, after which he discloses to her that he is aware of her background{{spaced en dash}}her father was a famous documentarian, a fact she has kept hidden from most of their peers. After the funeral, Amy meets Travis' twin brother, Trevor, who explains to her that he believes his brother was murdered. Later, while Amy is recording [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|audio loops]] of screams for the film, Simon is beaten to death outside, and the audio of his death is inadvertently recorded. While going over the loops, Amy is attacked by the killer, donning a [[fencing]] mask. She is chased through the campus, but manages to evade him.\n\nBefore filming another scene for Amy's film in an empty carnival ride, sophomores Stan and Dirk are attacked and electrocuted while preparing the set. Amy discovers the corpses and is again confronted by the killer. She escapes again and informs the police, who attribute the deaths to accidental electrocution. Amy is comforted by Trevor. They begin having sex when Trevor suddenly stabs Amy. She wakes up and realizes that it was only a dream. Amy later notices a light inside the bell tower. She goes there and finds her friend, Vanessa waiting for her. Vanessa, a [[lesbian]], presents a note she received addressed to her from Amy, in which it states that she has romantic feelings for Vanessa. Amy explains that she did not write the note, and fears that both women have been lured there. They are startled by the killer; Amy presses a [[panic button]] in the tower, but the killer manages to pursue them to the top of the tower. Once at the top, Amy is locked in a closet by the killer, where she finds the corpses of Simon and Sandra. Upon breaking free, she finds Vanessa hanging from the bell. Amy runs out of the tower passing Reese, who was notified of the disturbance via the campus security system.\n\nAmy runs into the arms of Trevor. Later, he tells her he has found that all the murder victims worked on Travis' thesis film. After watching some of Travis' film, ''The Gods of Men'', they suspect Toby, the only person who worked on the film who is still alive. They kidnap Toby and call in Professor Solomon to an empty film set to present their suspicions. However, Toby reveals that Travis faked Toby's sound credit to help him graduate, admitting that he never went anywhere near Travis' film. Graham happens upon the confrontation, watching from a window. In the confusion, Solomon reveals himself as the killer, attempting to frame Amy and usurp the Hitchcock Award{{spaced en dash}}which includes a large [[stipend]]{{spaced en dash}}by presenting Travis' film as his own. A melee ensues in which Amy wrestles his gun from him and holds him at gunpoint. Reese stumbles upon the scene, and a standoff occurs. Solomon leaps at Amy, and she discharges the gun in his abdomen.\n\nAt the Hitchcock Awards ceremony, Trevor attends to accept the award on his brother's behalf. As he goes onstage, a sniper appears in the rafters, only to be shot by Reese. The altercation is revealed to be a scene in Amy's new film, ''Urban Legends'', on which Toby and Graham are working on her behalf.\n\nLater, Solomon, now using a wheelchair, is in a mental institution where, after watching Amy's film, a nurse asks him if he enjoyed the movie. He is wheeled out by the nurse{{spaced en dash}}Brenda Bates, from the original film{{spaced en dash}}who tells him that they have a lot in common.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Amy Mayfield\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Travis Stark / Trevor Stark\n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Professor Solomon\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Reese Wilson\n* [[Joey Lawrence|Joseph Lawrence]] as Graham Manning\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Toby Belcher\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Vanessa Valdeon\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Sandra Petruzzi\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Stan Washington\n* [[Michael Bacall]] as Dirk Reynolds\n* [[Marco Hofschneider]] as Simon Jabuscko\n* Derek Aasland as P.A.
