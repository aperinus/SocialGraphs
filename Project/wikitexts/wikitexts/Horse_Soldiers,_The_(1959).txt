The screenplay by [[John Lee Mahin]] and [[Martin Rackin]] was loosely based on Harold Sinclair's 1956 novel of the same name, a fictionalized version of [[Grierson's Raid]] in Mississippi.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[cavalry]] brigade led by Colonel John Marlowe\u2014a railroad construction engineer in civilian life\u2014is sent on a raid behind [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] lines to destroy a railroad and supply depot at Newton Station. Major Henry Kendall, a regimental surgeon who is torn between duty and the horror of war, is constantly at odds with Marlowe.\n\nWhile the unit rests at Greenbriar Plantation, Miss Hannah Hunter, the plantation's mistress, acts as a gracious hostess to the unit's officers. But she and her slave, Lukey, eavesdrop on a staff meeting as Marlowe discusses his battle strategy. To protect the secrecy of the mission, Marlowe is forced to take the two women with him. Initially hostile to her Yankee captor, Miss Hunter gradually comes to respect him and eventually falls in love with him. In addition to Kendall and Miss Hunter, Marlowe also must contend with Col. Phil Secord, a politically ambitious officer who continually second-guesses Marlowe's orders and command decisions.\n\nSeveral battles ensue, including the capture of Newton Station, later a fire fight during which Lukey is killed, and a skirmish with boy cadets from a local military school (based on the actual [[Battle of New Market]]). After destroying the crucial supply line, and with [[Confederate States Army|Confederate forces]] in pursuit, the brigade reaches a bridge that must be stormed in order to access the Union lines. After taking the bridge, Marlowe's men rig it with explosive charges, and Marlowe bids Hannah farewell. Kendall chooses to remain behind with some badly wounded men, knowing he will be captured with them, rather than leave them unattended until Confederate medical personnel arrive.\n\nMarlowe, though wounded, kisses Miss Hunter goodbye, lights the fuse and is the last of his men to cross the bridge before it is destroyed, halting the Confederate advance. Their mission accomplished, he and his brigade continue on toward [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Wayne]] as Colonel John Marlowe\n* [[William Holden]] as Major Henry 'Hank' Kendall\n* [[Constance Towers]] as Miss Hannah Hunter of Greenbriar\n* [[Althea Gibson]] as Lukey, Miss Hunter's maid\n* [[Judson Pratt]] as [[Sergeant Major]] Kirby\n* [[Ken Curtis]] as Cpl.
