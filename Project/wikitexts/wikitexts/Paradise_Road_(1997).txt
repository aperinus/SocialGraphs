It was directed by [[Bruce Beresford]] and stars [[Glenn Close]] as Adrienne Pargiter, (based on [[Norah Chambers]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Milliken |first1=Sue |title=Selective Memory: A Life in Film |date=1 November 2018 |publisher=Hybrid Publishers |isbn=978-1-74298-242-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpF5DwAAQBAJ&q=Adrienne+Pargiter+Norah+Chambers&pg=PT339 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A map to Paradise Road: A guide for historians {{!}} Australian War Memorial |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/journal/j32/nelson |website=www.awm.gov.au}}</ref>), [[Frances McDormand]] as the brash Dr. Verstak, [[Pauline Collins]] as missionary Margaret Drummond (based on missionary [[Margaret Dryburgh]]), [[Julianna Margulies]] as U.S. socialite Topsy Merritt, [[Jennifer Ehle]] as British doyenne and model Rosemary Leighton Jones, [[Cate Blanchett]] as Australian nurse Susan McCarthy and [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] as dowager Imogene Roberts.\n\n==Plot==\nBasing his film on real events, Bruce Beresford tells the story of a vocal orchestra created by the women in a Japanese Internment camp, a classic survivors' tale about women's ability to survive hardship and atrocity through perseverance, solidarity and creativity. The film opens with a dance at [[Raffles Hotel]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. Wives and husbands, soldiers and socialites are enjoying a night of dancing, libations, and conversation. The scene is happy and carefree, but the film continues to unfold and it soon becomes known that a war is raging right outside the doors. ''Paradise Road'' is set during the time of World War II, and the Japanese forces have just [[Battle of Singapore|attacked Singapore]]. When a bomb explodes right outside the club, it becomes known that the Japanese have advanced beyond defensive lines. The women and children are immediately collected and carried off by a boat to a safer location. A few hours out, the boat is bombed by Japanese fighter planes and the women must jump over board to save their lives.\n\nThree women, Adrienne Pargiter the wife of a tea planter, Rosemary Leighton-Jones a model and the girlfriend of a Royal Malayan Volunteer, and Susan Macarthy, an Australian nurse, swim their way to shore. The place on which they land is the island of Sumatra. The women are found by a Japanese officer, Captain Tanaka, and ushered to a deserted village. They are then taken to a prison camp in the jungle. The three women are reunited with the rest of the women and children from the boat. At the prison camp, there are women of all nationalities including Dutch, English, Irish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Australian; and they all come from many levels of society. Some of the women are nuns, some are nurses, and some are socialites and mothers. The women are forced to bow to the Japanese officers and its flag. The women must endure torture and hard labour while trying to remain positive and level headed. Many believe the war would end soon and their husbands or soldiers will come looking for them. Nonetheless, the living conditions are brutal, and many face sickness and death. Needless to say, their spirits rapidly flag. Some of the women choose to work in a brothel for Japanese officers for better treatment and decent food.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.deseret.com/1997/5/11/20088341/film-review-paradise-road | title=Film review: Paradise Road | date=11 May 1997 }}</ref>\n\nThe women have been at the prison camp for two years now. Adrienne Pargiter, a graduate from the [[Royal Academy of Music]], and Daisy \"Margaret\" Drummond a missionary, decided to create a vocal orchestra in order to encourage the women. Some of the women fear for their lives because the Japanese officers, especially Sergeant Tomiashi \"The Snake\", who is made known for his cruelty and abuse, have prohibited any meetings whether religious or social.  The orchestra finally performs for the entire camp, even the officers stop to listen to the vibrant music. However, the music only works as motivation for so long and the women continue to dwindle in numbers. After some time, the women are moved to a new location where they will remain for the duration of the war. The war ends and the women rejoice for their freedom.  The film closes on a scene of the last performance by the vocal orchestra. The vocal orchestra performed more than 30 works from 1943 to 1944. The original scores survived the war and are the basis for the music performed in the film. In 1997, many of the survivors were still alive during the making of the film and contributed to the inspiration for ''Paradise Road''.<ref name=Holden>{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=It Takes a Saint to Keep a Prison Camp Humming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/11/movies/it-takes-a-saint-to-keep-a-prison-camp-humming.html|access-date=17 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=11 April 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==  \nIn credits order:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119859/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDb|title=Paradise Road|access-date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Adrienne Pargiter\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Dr. Verstak\n* [[Pauline Collins]] as Daisy \"Margaret\" Drummond (based on [[Margaret Dryburgh]])\n* [[Julianna Margulies]] as Topsy Merritt\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Susan Macarthy\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Rosemary Leighton-Jones\n* [[Wendy Hughes]] as Mrs. Dickson\n* [[Johanna ter Steege]] as Sister Wilhelmina\n* [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] as Mrs. Roberts\n* [[Pamela Rabe]] as Mrs. Tippler\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Sergeant Tomiashi, 'The Snake'\n* Stan Egi as Captain Tanaka\n* [[David Chung (actor)|David Chung]] as Mr. Tomio\n* [[Sab Shimono]] as Colonel Hirota\n* [[Penne Hackforth-Jones]] as Mrs. Pike\n* [[Pauline Chan (Australian actress)|Pauline Chan]] as Wing\n* [[Lisa Hensley (actress)|Lisa Hensley]] as Edna\n* [[Susie Porter]] as Oggi\n* Anita Hegh as Bett\n* [[Tessa Humphries]] as Celia Roberts\n* Lia Scallon as Mrs. O'Riordan\n* [[Marta Dusseldorp]] as Helen van Praagh\n* Marijke Mann as Mrs. Cronje\n* [[Aden Young]] as Bill Seary\n* Paul Bishop as Dennis Leighton-Jones\n* Stephen O'Rourke as William Pargiter\n* [[Vincent Ball]] as Mr. Dickson\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Marty Merritt\n* Steven Grives as Westmacott\n* [[Robert Grubb]] as Colonel Downes\n* [[Arthur Dignam]] as Mr. Pike\n* Tanya Bird as Siobhan O'Riordan\n* Alwine Seinen as Millie\n* Kitty Clignett as Sister Anna\n* Shira Van Essen as Antoinette van Praagh\n* Yoshi Adachi as Mr. Moto\n* Mitsu Sato as Rags\n* Taka Nagano as Boris\n* Koji Sasaki as Lefty\n* [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]] as Female Vocalist\n* Geoffrey Ogden-Brown as Band Leader\n* Jason Arden as Edgar\n* Kristine McAlister as Matron Heffernan\n* Jesse Rosenfeld as Danny Tippler\n* Phillip Stork as Michael Tippler\n* John Elcock as Seaman Francis\n* Hamish Urquhart as Aran O'Riordan\n* Jemal Blattner as Older Aran O'Riordan\n* John Proper as Captain Murchison\n* Shigenori Ito as Dr. Mizushima\n* Geoff O'Halloran as  \tSailor\n* Chi Yuen Lee as Chinese Man\n* Ping Pan as Chinese Man\n\n==Production==\nThe story is based on the testimony of [[Betty Jeffrey]], as written in her 1954 book ''White Coolies''.  The 1965 book ''Song of Survival'' by Helen Colijn (granddaughter of [[Hendrikus Colijn]]), another camp survivor, is not listed in the film's credits as being a source for this film, although Colijn is thanked for her help in the credits.\n\nAccording to the media information kit for the film, Martin Meader and David Giles researched the story from 1991 and met with survivors from the camp and choir. Meader and Giles wrote the original screenplay, which was titled \"A Voice Cries Out\". Graeme Rattigan then joined Meader and Giles and together the three travelled the world, raising $8.275 million for the film. They met Beresford in London and he immediately became interested in the project. Together with Village Roadshow, Beresford took over the film, re-wrote the script and renamed the project ''Paradise Road''.\n\nBeresford and producer Sue Milliken then did their own research of the story for over more than two years, by reading books and unpublished diaries on the subject and by interviewing survivors. Meader and Giles got a \"Story by\" credit, and with Rattigan, they all received a Co-Executive Producer Credit. Their company, Planet Pictures, received an \"In Association With\" credit.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite journal  |last=Nelson |first=Hank |author-link=Hank Nelson |title=A map to Paradise Road: A guide for historians |journal=Journal of the Australian War Memorial |issue=32 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |location=Canberra, Australia |date=March 1999 |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/journal/j32/nelson |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film represents an alternative take on female imprisonment by the Japanese during [[World War II]] compared with BBC's dramatic offering from the early 1980s, ''[[Tenko (TV series)|Tenko]]''.  Some criticism of the film's historical accuracy is discussed in an article by Professor [[Hank Nelson]].<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nFox provided $19 million of the budget with $6 million coming from Singapore businessman Andrew Yap.<ref name=\"Milliken p 224\"/>\n\nThe role of Dr Verstak was originally offered to [[Anjelica Huston]], who demanded more profit share than the filmmakers were willing to give, so [[Frances McDormand]] was cast instead. The part of Margaret Drummond was to be played by [[Jean Simmons]] but she had to withdraw due to illness; the studio wanted [[Joan Plowright]] but she accepted another offer and [[Pauline Collins]] wound up being cast. Fox were reluctant to cast Cate Blanchett in the lead as she was relatively unknown at the time but Beresford insisted.<ref>Milliken pp. 228-229.</ref>\n\nProduction took place in Marrickville (Sydney), Singapore, Port Douglas and Penang.\n\n==Historical context==\nDuring World War II, many women became prisoners of war and faced a twenty to fifty percent death rate in Japanese prison camps. However, many women prisoners of war stories have been overlooked, with the exception of the women POWs of Sumatra. Thousands of British and Dutch colonists made the East Indies their home. Singapore was the most popular living option with the [[Raffles Hotel]], shops, and beautiful houses, which attracted many soldiers and their wives. The Japanese armed forces attacked Pearl Harbor, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong on 7 December 1941. Europeans held the Japanese forces to an inferior level and put their trust in the British navy that guarded Singapore. But the Japanese advanced on British military lines, captured the British airfield, and dropped bombs on the city, which led to a retreat by the British forces. On 15 February 1942 the Japanese took Singapore.\n\nDue to the belief that the city was safe, many women and children had remained in Singapore when the city was attacked. The inhabitants of the city, including women and children, ran to board ships to flee the island. Some of these ships housed the women POWs of Sumatra. The \"Vyner Brooke\" contained 65 nurses from the Australian Army Nursing Service.<ref name=\"Women POWS of Sumatra\">{{cite web|title=Women POWs of Sumatra|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2591309983/women-pows-sumatra-19421945.html|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref> It reached the Banka Strait before the Japanese attacked and released bombs over the ship. The women and children were forced to jump overboard to save their lives, but the Japanese continued to fire on the women in the water.\n\nThe survivors swam ashore to [[Banka Island Massacre|Banka Island]]. One of the Australian nurses suggested the women and children to head toward a village on the island while the nurses remained on the beach to care for the men's wounds. When the Japanese discovered them, the men were rounded up and twenty-two of the nurses were forced back into the water where they were shot by the soldiers. Only [[Vivian Bullwinkel]] survived after the soldiers opened fire. Bullwinkel later found the rest of the nurses that survived the sinking of the ship. The women were transferred from Banka Island to Sumatra. Some survived the multiple voyages back and forth between the islands for three and a half years. The women were living in the Sumatra prison camp when the war ended and a rescue came for the survivors.<ref name=\"Australia's War\">{{cite web|title=Australia's War 1939-1945|url=http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/behindwire/found.html|website=Behind the Wire|access-date=17 July 2015|archive-date=8 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908054222/http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/behindwire/found.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 43% approval rating, based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paradise_road/|title=Paradise Road (1997)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film received a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paradise-road|title=Paradise Road|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url= https://cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= CinemaScore |access-date= March 22, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= December 20, 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film opened 11 April 1997 on 9 screens in the United States and Canada and grossed $62,518 for the weekend.
