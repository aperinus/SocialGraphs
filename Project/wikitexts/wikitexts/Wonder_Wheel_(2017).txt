Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works. Soon, Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty and Ginny for Carolina, but they deny having seen her and the mobsters leave.\n\nGinny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and life on the boardwalk, and begins carrying on an affair with Mickey. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the carousel and goes fishing with his friends to bring home dinner. He finds joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to attend night school.\n\nMickey is attracted to Ginny's maturity and experience, and views her as a somebody in need of saving. He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and he becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted about his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.\n\nMobsters Angelo and Nick come around again, asking the owner of the clam shack about Carolina's whereabouts. Carolina takes Mickey on a date to a Brooklyn pizza parlor, and her boss innocently tells this to Angelo and Nick. Ginny telephones the pizza parlor to warn Carolina but begins to stammer, realizing her opportunity to take Carolina away from Mickey, and hangs up. Mickey tells Carolina the truth about his feelings for her and his affair. Instantly feeling compassion for everyone involved, Carolina walks home alone to process the information and decide what to do, not wanting to hurt Ginny or her father or Mickey. We see Angelo and Nick's car following her as she leaves the pizza parlor.\n\nWhen Carolina does not come home, Humpty asks Mickey the next day if he saw her after the date. Mickey investigates and learns Ginny called the pizza parlor but did not speak. Piecing it together, he confronts Ginny, who has started drinking and getting made up in one of her glamorous stage costumes. She pulls a knife out of the drawer and asks Mickey to kill her, but he leaves. Humpty comes back, sinking back into alcoholism after the police find no trace of Carolina, and tells Ginny he needs her help again to function in life. He tries to find a positive outlook and invites her to meet his friends' wives on a fishing trip, but she coldly refuses, keeping their life [[status quo|in its rut]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Ginny Rannell, Humpty's wife and Richie's mother and Carolina's stepmother\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Carolina Rannell, Humpty's grown daughter from his first marriage\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Mickey Rubin, a lifeguard and the film's narrator\n* [[Jim Belushi]] as Humpty Rannell, a recovering alcoholic, Ginny's husband, Carolina's father, and Richie's stepfather\n* [[Jack Gore (actor)|Jack Gore]] as Richie Rannell, Ginny's young son\n* [[Tony Sirico]] as Angelo, a gangster\n* [[Steve Schirripa]] as Nick, a gangster\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as birthday party guest\n* [[Thomas Guiry]] as flirtatious man at Ruby's\n* [[Max Casella]] as Ryan, Humpty's fishing buddy\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Jake, Mickey's friend\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Kate Winslet]] was the first actor who came on board for the film, in July 2016,<ref>{{cite web|first=Nigel M.|last=Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/kate-winslet-cast-woody-allen-new-film|title=Kate Winslet to be cast in Woody Allen's next film|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=June 15, 2016|access-date=September 15, 2016|archive-date=September 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911223311/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/21/kate-winslet-cast-woody-allen-new-film|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Rebecca|last=Ford|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kate-winslet-joining-woody-allens-905062|title=Kate Winslet Joining Woody Allen's Next Film|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=June 21, 2016|access-date=September 15, 2016|archive-date=October 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022031610/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kate-winslet-joining-woody-allens-905062|url-status=live}}</ref> followed by [[Juno Temple]] and [[Jim Belushi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/woody-allen-kate-winslet-movie-jim-belushi-1201809198/|title=Jim Belushi Joins Kate Winslet in Woody Allen's New Movie|access-date=September 15, 2016|date=July 6, 2016|first=Dave|last=McNary|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|archive-date=September 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917135743/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/woody-allen-kate-winslet-movie-jim-belushi-1201809198/|url-status=live}}</ref> Describing the casting process, Allen said, \"The first person I cast was Kate Winslet, then I cast a young girl named Juno Temple who I thought very much of,\" and \"I cast Jim Belushi who I thought was absolutely perfect for it.\"<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite news|first=Ruben V.|last=Nepales|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/197729/woody-allen-on-casting-justin-timberlake-directing-cafe-society-for-nothing|title=Woody Allen on casting Justin Timberlake, directing 'Caf\u00e9 Society' for 'nothing'|date=July 21, 2016|access-date=September 15, 2016|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|archive-date=July 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721122610/http://entertainment.inquirer.net/197729/woody-allen-on-casting-justin-timberlake-directing-cafe-society-for-nothing|url-status=live}}</ref> Talking about the film, Winslet \u2013 who was previously attached to Allen's 2005 drama film ''[[Match Point]]'' but left the project to spend more time with her family \u2013 said, \"I play the lead.
