Thanks to Harry's cousin Clara ([[Vivian Pickles]]), a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry has the captain's first clue. Harry recruits street-smart American foster child Casey Brown (Foster), employing her to pose as Lady St. Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th [[Marchioness]] of Candleshoe, who disappeared ten years ago at age four. Casey is the right age to pass for the long-lost Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the profits.\n\nArriving at Candleshoe, Casey finds that Lady St. Edmund is living in genteel poverty, and that Candleshoe itself is constantly on the verge of being unable to pay its taxes. Priory (Niven), the estate's [[butler]] (who is forced to pose as various members of the household to conceal that all the other servants have been let go) manages to keep one step ahead of foreclosure by pawning the house's antiques, conducting tours of the estate, and selling produce at market. Four local orphans adopted by Lady St. Edmund assist Priory.\n\nCasey eventually becomes part of the family and decides to find the treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Harry. This nearly costs the girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St. Edmund. Casey, now unconscious with a severe concussion, is taken to a hospital, and remains there for several days. Meanwhile, without the money Harry has stolen, Candleshoe is unable to pay its taxes and is within days of [[foreclosure]]. When Casey learns that Lady St. Edmund is preparing to go to a [[retirement home]] and send the children back to the orphanage, she breaks down and tells them about the treasure. After unraveling the final clue together, the household returns to Candleshoe to find Harry and his crew tearing the place apart to find the hidden treasure. Casey, Priory, and the children manage to fight off the thieves until the police arrive, inadvertently discovering the treasure in the process.\n\nWith Candleshoe safe and her scheme discovered, Casey, feeling she has no right to stay, prepares to return to Los Angeles, but is stopped by Lady St. Edmund, who offers her a real home at Candleshoe. Casey expresses doubt, wondering what will happen if Lady St. Edmund's real granddaughter ever returns, but she is eventually persuaded to return to Candleshoe with Lady St. Edmund. The ending is ambiguous as to whether Casey truly is the real Margaret.\n\nThe four clues revealed in the hunt for the treasure:\n*\"For the sunrise student there is treasure among books.\" (This refers to a message in a stained-glass window that can only be seen in the Candleshoe library at sunrise.)\n*\"The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\" (This refers to the poem \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\" by [[Thomas Gray]].)\n*\"He followed the eclipse for riches and fame; and, if ye would prosper, do ye the same.\" (The clue refers to a painting of Captain St. Edmund's ship, the ''Eclipse''.)\n*\"Underfoot, in the great hall. Look high, look low, discover all.\" (This clue refers to a statue of Captain St. Edmund in Candleshoe's great hall. The statue's foot is propped on a chest in which the treasure is hidden.)\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Compton Wynyates.jpg|thumb|right|[[Compton Wynyates]], the main filming location.]]\n[[Compton Wynyates]], in [[Warwickshire]], the home of [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton|Spencer, 7th Marquess of Northampton]], posed as the fictional estate of Candleshoe.\n\nThe [[Severn Valley Railway]] that runs between the midland towns of Bridgnorth and Kidderminister in the United Kingdom was used as a location in the film.<ref>Severn Valley Railway News Issue 43, Spring 1977</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Casey Brown\n* [[David Niven]] as Priory\n* [[Helen Hayes]] as Lady Gwendolyn St. Edmund\n* [[Leo McKern]] as Harry Bundage\n* [[Vivian Pickles]] as Clara Grimsworthy\n* Veronica Quilligan as Cluny\n* Ian Sharrock as Peter\n* Sarah Tamakuni as Anna\n* David Samuels as Bobby\n* [[John Alderson (actor)|John Alderson]] as Jenkins\n* [[Mildred Shay]] as Mrs. McCress, Casey\u2019s Foster Mother\n* [[Michael Balfour (actor)|Michael Balfour]] as Mr. McCress, Casey\u2019s Foster Father\n* [[Sydney Bromley]] as Mr. Thresher\n* Michael Segal as Train Guard\n\n==Music==\nOn September 15, 2015, [[Intrada Records]] released a special edition of the soundtrack containing the entire score from the film plus bonus material, including alternate takes of some tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.9740/.f?sc=13&category=22848|title=Candleshoe|website=[[Intrada Records]]|date=September 14, 2015|accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Metacritic]] gave the film a 68% score.<ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/movie/candleshoe/details Metacritic]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Crooks and Coronets]]'' (1969)\n*''[[Fitzwilly]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' (1974)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/candleshoe}}\n*{{IMDb title|0075807}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|candleshoe}}\n*{{tcmdb title|70171|Candleshoe}}\n*[http://www.ultimatedisney.com/candleshoe.html Candleshoe DVD Review]\n\n{{Norman Tokar}}\n\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:1970s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Norman Tokar]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ron W.
