The film was released on December 16, 2016, by [[Lionsgate Premiere]].

Clancy reluctantly agrees. FBI special agent Katherine Cowles, Merriwether's partner, is skeptical of Clancy's gift, but is soon convinced otherwise.\n\nThe victims all turn out to have been suffering from terminal illnesses and Clancy realizes the killer has abilities exceeding his own. Merriwether is shot by the suspect and admits he was diagnosed with terminal cancer before dying in hospital. After the funeral, Clancy is confronted by the killer, who explains he is sparing his victims from a slow death, killing them out of mercy, and that he engineered Merriwether's death. He arrogantly declares he has seen all the possible outcomes of their confrontation, but Clancy surprises him; nonetheless, the killer escapes.\n\nCowles discovers the killer is a man called Charles Ambrose. Clancy is forced to test his abilities to their limits and is able to intercept Ambrose as he poisons his latest victim. Clancy tells him he has no right to take time away from even the terminally ill, such as his friend Merriwether.\n\nCowles and Clancy finally confront Ambrose in a subway car. Ambrose tells Clancy that he is dying and asks Clancy to shoot him. He wants Clancy to take over the role of mercy killing and warns him that Cowles will be killed if he does not shoot him. Cowles runs up behind Clancy and both Ambrose and Clancy fire their weapons. Ambrose dies and Clancy is injured. In the hospital, Clancy gives Cowles a letter for his wife, with whom Clancy reconciles. He recalls euthanizing his own daughter as she was dying from leukemia.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as John Clancy\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Charles Ambrose\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Agent Joe Merriwether\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Agent Katherine Cowles\n* [[Jordan Woods-Robinson]] as Jeffrey Oldfield\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Laura Merriwether\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Mr. Ellis\n* [[Kenny Johnson]] as David Raymond\n* [[Janine Turner]] as Elizabeth Clancy\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Mrs. Ellis\n* [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Sawyer\n* [[Matt Gerald]] as Sloman\n* Autumn Dial as Emma Clancy\n* [[Joshua Close]] as Linus Harp\n* Luisa Moraes as Victoria Raymond\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=\"The film has an influence of ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', but tried to flee the genre.
