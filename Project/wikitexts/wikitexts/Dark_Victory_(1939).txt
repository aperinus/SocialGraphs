The [[screenplay]] by [[Casey Robinson]] was based on the [[Dark Victory (play)|1934 play]] of the same title by George Brewer and Bertram Bloch, starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Bette Davis in Dark Victory trailer.jpg|left|thumb|upright|From the trailer]]\n<!--- Judith and Judy are used interchangeably throughout the film, and so in this synopsis --->\nJudith \"Judy\" Traherne ([[Bette Davis]]), is a young, carefree, [[hedonism|hedonistic]] [[Long Island]] socialite and heiress with a passion for horses, fast cars, and too much smoking and drinking. She initially ignores severe headaches and brief episodes of dizziness and double vision, but when she uncharacteristically takes a spill while riding and then tumbles down a flight of stairs, her secretary and best friend Ann King insists she see the family doctor, who refers her to a specialist.\n\nDr. Frederick Steele, ([[George Brent]]), is closing his New York City office in preparation for a move to [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], where he plans to devote his time to brain cell research and scientific study on their growth. He reluctantly agrees to see Judy, who acts coldly and is openly antagonistic towards him. She shows signs of short-term memory loss but dismisses her symptoms. Steele convinces her the ailments she is experiencing are severe and potentially life-threatening and puts his career plans on hold to tend to her.\n\nWhen diagnostic tests confirm his suspicions, Judy agrees to surgery to remove a malignant [[glioma]] brain tumor. Steele discovers the tumor cannot be removed entirely and realizes she has less than a year to live. The end will be painless but swift; shortly after experiencing total blindness, Judy will die.\n\nTo allow her a few more months of happiness, Steele opts to lie to Judy and Ann and assures them the surgery was a success. As he is a poor liar, Ann is suspicious and confronts Steele, who admits the truth. Steele tells Ann, \"she must never know\" she will die soon. She agrees to remain silent and continue the lie.\n\n[[File:Dark-Victory-Fitzgerald-Davis.jpg|thumb|right|Geraldine Fitzgerald and Bette Davis, after \"Judy\" has lost her sight, in final minutes of \"Dark Victory\"]]\nJudy and Steele become involved romantically and eventually engaged. While helping his assistant pack the office before their departure for Vermont, Judy discovers her case history file containing letters from several doctors, all of them confirming Steele's prognosis. Assuming Steele was marrying her out of pity, Judy breaks off the engagement and reverts to her former lifestyle. One day, her stable master Michael O'Leary, who for years has loved her from afar, confronts her about her unruly behavior, and she confesses she is dying. Their conversation convinces her she should spend her final months happy, dignified, and with the man she loves. She apologizes to Steele, and they marry and move to Vermont.\n\nThree months later, Ann comes to visit. Judy and she are in the garden planting bulbs when Judy comments on how odd it is she still feels the sun's heat under the rapidly darkening skies. They both immediately realize she is losing her vision and approaching the end. Judy makes Ann stay mum, as Steele leaves that day to present his most recent medical findings\u2014which hold out the long-term prospect of a cure for her type of cancer\u2014in New York. Judy makes an excuse to remain home, helps him pack, and sends him off, telling him, \"What we have now can't be destroyed. That's our victory, our victory over the dark. It's a victory because we're not afraid.\"\n\nThen, after bidding Ann, her housekeeper Martha (who has silently deduced the situation), and her dogs farewell, she goes to her bedroom. She kneels briefly, apparently praying, then lies down on the bed. Martha enters and drapes a blanket over her, then withdraws when Judy asks to be left alone.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dark Victory trailer group shot.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bette Davis]] (center, left to right) in the film's trailer]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Judith Traherne\n* [[George Brent]] as Dr. Frederick Steele\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Michael O'Leary\n* [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] as Ann King\n* [[Ronald Reagan]] as Alec Hamm\n* [[Henry Travers]] as Dr. Parsons\n* [[Cora Witherspoon]] as Carrie Spottswood\n* [[Dorothy Peterson]] as Miss Wainwright\n* [[Virginia Brissac]] as Martha\n* [[Charles Richman (actor)|Charles Richman]] as Colonel Mantle\n* [[Herbert Rawlinson]] as Dr. Carter\n* [[Leonard Mudie]] as Dr. Driscoll\n* [[Fay Helm]] as Miss Dodd\n* [[Lottie Williams]] as Lucy\n}}\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* ''Dark Victory'' was Irish-born actress Geraldine Fitzgerald's first American film, after having appeared in films made in England, and on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]].<ref name=tcmnote />\n* This was the eighth, of eleven, on-screen teaming of Bette Davis and George Brent.<ref>Sikov 2007, p. 138.</ref><ref name=tcmart />\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ronald Reagan in Dark Victory trailer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|From the film's trailer]]\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in Dark Victory trailer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|From the trailer]]\n[[Tallulah Bankhead]] originated the role of Judith Traherne in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Dark Victory (play)|production]], which ran for 51 performances at the [[Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre|Plymouth Theatre]],<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=10417 \"Dark Victory.\"] ''Internet Broadway Database''.

In 1935, [[David O. Selznick]] wanted to cast [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Fredric March]] in the leads, but Garbo chose to play the lead in ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' instead. In 1936, he offered the role to [[Merle Oberon]], but contractual problems prevented her from doing the film. When Bette Davis discovered the play in 1938, she shopped it to every producer on the Warners lot, and Hal Wallis bought the rights from Selznick for her, for $50,000,  when director Edmound Goulding and producer [[David Lewis (producer)|David Lewis]] showed interest in the project.<ref name=tcmnote>{{cite journal| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/586/Dark-Victory/notes.html| title=Dark Victory: Notes| website=Turner Classic Movies| access-date=July 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDavis had recently ended affairs with [[William Wyler]] and [[Howard Hughes]] and her husband Ham Nelson had filed for divorce, and after the first few days of filming she begged to be released from her contract, claiming she was too sick to continue.<ref>Schickel and Perry 2009, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Producer [[Hal Wallis]] responded, \"I've seen the [[dailies|rushes]] \u2013 stay sick!\" She found comfort with Brent, who had just divorced [[Constance Worth]], and the two embarked on an affair that continued throughout filming and for a year \u2013 and three films \u2013 after.<ref name=tcmart>Landazuri, Margarita.

But it is impossible to be that cynical about it. The mood is too poignant, the performances too honest, the craftsmanship too expert. Miss Davis, naturally, has dominated\u2014and quite properly\u2014her film, but Miss Fitzgerald has added a sentient and touching portrayal of the friend, and George Brent, as the surgeon, is\u2014dare we say?\u2014surprisingly self-contained and mature.
