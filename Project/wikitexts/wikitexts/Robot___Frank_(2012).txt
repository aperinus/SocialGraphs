The film stars [[Frank Langella]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[James Marsden]], and [[Liv Tyler]].\n\n''Robot & Frank'' was the first feature film for both Schreier and Ford, and received critical acclaim for its writing, production, and acting. It won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]], tying with the [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] film ''[[Valley of Saints (film)|Valley of Saints]]'' by Musa Syeed.\n\nThe robot was created by [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]]'s [[special effect]]s company [[Alterian, Inc.]]\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the near future, aging ex-convict and thief Frank Weld lives alone and suffers from increasingly severe mental deterioration and [[dementia]]. Frank's son Hunter, an [[attorney at law|attorney]] with a family of his own, grows tired of making weekly visits to his father's home without his kids, but is reluctant to put his father into full-time care, so he purchases a [[robot]] companion, which is programmed to provide Frank with therapeutic care, including a fixed daily routine and cognition-enhancing activities like [[gardening]].\n\nInitially wary of the robot's presence in his life, Frank warms up to his new companion when he realizes the robot is not programmed to distinguish between legal recreational activities and criminal ones, and can assist him in [[lock-picking]]. Together, the two commit a heist in order to win the affection of the local librarian, Jennifer: they steal an antique copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' from the library, which is being renovated and turned into a [[community center]] in the wake of declining interest in [[print media]].\n\nIn the meantime, Frank's daughter Madison, who is away on a [[philanthropic]] trip in [[Turkmenistan]], learns of the robot and returns to convince her father to get rid of the machine, which she finds ethically objectionable. Frank insists on keeping the robot, and they commit one last heist, stealing jewels from Jake, the rich young developer at the head of the library renovation project. The police become involved and begin to question and monitor Frank, who maintains his innocence, feigning deathly illness so that Hunter will return to see him. In order to cover his tracks, Frank is faced with the decision of whether to wipe the memory of his robot, even as his own memory rapidly deteriorates.\n\nFrank goes to the library where he discovers that Jennifer is his ex-wife, which he had forgotten.  He then returns home where the robot convinces him to wipe its [[holographic memory]]; it argues that it is not a real person and its sole reason for existence is to help Frank, which it can best do by helping him avoid jail. Frank then moves into a full-time care facility to help him cope with his [[dementia]]. During a visit from his family, he slips Hunter a note, implying that the jewels are hidden under the tomato plants in the garden that the robot made.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Frank Weld\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Jennifer\n* Rachael Ma as Robot\n** [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as the voice of Robot\n* [[James Marsden]] as Hunter Weld\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Madison Weld\n* Caine Sheppard as Ryan\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Jake\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Sheriff Rowlings<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946885/|title=Robot & Frank|publisher=RBL|work=Variety|date=January 22, 2012|access-date=June 14, 2012|last=Anderson|first=John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=April 4, 2012|last=Handelman|first=Jay|title='Robot & Frank' offers an easygoing, gentle charm|url=http://artssarasota.com/2012-04-14/featured/review-robot-frank-offers-an-easygoing-gentle-charm/|work=Ars Sarasota|access-date=June 14, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Shopgirl\n* [[Ana Gasteyer]] as Shoplady\n* Joshua Ormond as Flattop\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|thumb|The [[Honda ASIMO]], an example of the [[Japanese robotics]] technology that inspired the human-like design of the robot in the film]]\n\n=== Development ===\nThis was the first feature film for both Ford and Schreier, who were friends and classmates at the [[New York University]] [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. After graduation, Schreier directed [[music videos]] and [[commercials]] for companies like [[Absolut Vodka]] and [[Verizon]]. Around 2008, the two began discussing a feature-length project to collaborate on and chose the screenplay that had been Ford's senior thesis at Tisch, which Schreier had helped produce. This evolved into the screenplay for ''Robot & Frank.''<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/movies/article_c8d5aaa6-f2c1-11e1-b913-001a4bcf887a.html | title= Director Jake Schreier talks 'Robot and Frank' and dirty laundry | work=The East Valley Tribune | date=August 30, 2012 | access-date=September 9, 2012 | last=Pizzello |first= Chris}}</ref>\n\nFord had originally begun conceptualizing the story for the film in 2002. He and Schreier were interested in the rapid development of technology and its impact on the daily life of ordinary people. Unlike more [[dystopian]] portrayals of the rise of technology in modern cinema, the filmmakers wanted ''Robot & Frank'' to explore the subject without any particular moral undercurrent. According to Schreier, technology is \"not bad or good but it will change the way we relate to each other. There\u2019s no stopping it.\"<ref name=\"NYTfuture\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/movies/in-robot-frank-technology-of-the-not-so-distant-future-on-display.html | title=From the Future, a Subtle Spark of Recognition In 'Robot & Frank,' Technology of the Not-So-Distant Future on Display | work=The New York Times | date=August 10, 2012 | access-date=September 9, 2012 | last=Wortham | first= Jenna}}</ref>\n\nThe futuristic smartphones and tablets featured in the film were designed by Justin Ouellette of [[Tumblr]], and the robot was created by [[Alterian, Inc.]], a [[Los Angeles]]-based effects company notable for their costume design for [[Daft Punk]].<ref name=\"NYTfuture\" /> The filmmakers wanted to emulate the style of caretaker robots made in Japan, and the design also needed to allow a human actor inside the robot suit, played by Rachael Ma.<ref>{{cite web | date=August 17, 2012 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2012/08/17/movies/robot-images-2.html | title=Behind the Robots in 'Robot & Frank' | work=The New York Times | access-date=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot in 20 days on a budget of 2.5 million dollars.<ref name=\"NYTfuture\" /> Filming took place in the summer in [[upstate New York]]. The library is the Rye Free Reading Room in [[Rye, New York]].\n\nAccording to Schreier, the heat caused the person inside of the robot suit, dancer Rachael Ma, so much discomfort that she had to be replaced with another actress, Dana Morgan, for two days of filming. Though Ma was initially tasked with providing Langella with the robot's lines, it became impossible for her to perform both the physical acting and lines simultaneously, and the task was given to Langella's nephew, who was a [[production assistant]] on the set.<ref name=\"NerdistThompson\">{{cite web | url = http://www.nerdist.com/2012/08/director-jake-schreier-gets-robot-frank-with-us/ | title = Director Jake Schreier Gets (Robot &) Frank With Us | work = The Nerdist | date = August 23, 2012 | access-date = September 9, 2012 | last = Thompson |first = Luke Y.}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 86% based on reviews from 139 critics. The site's consensus is \"Led by a brilliant performance from star Frank Langella, ''Robot & Frank'' works as both a quirky indie drama and as a smart, thoughtful meditation on aging.\"<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|robot_and_frank}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 67% based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Robot and Frank |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/robot-and-frank |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\nThe science fiction film also received positive reviews due to the film's portrayal of care robots and the uncovering of taboo topics related to care.
