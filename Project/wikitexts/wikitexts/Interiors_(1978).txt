It stars [[Kristin Griffith]], [[Mary Beth Hurt]], [[Richard Jordan]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[E. G. Marshall]], [[Geraldine Page]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], and [[Sam Waterston]].\n\nAllen's first fully-fledged film in the [[drama]] genre, it was met with acclaim from critics. It received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (both for Allen), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Page), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Stapleton). Page also won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Film Award for Best Supporting Actress]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/25065/Interiors/awards |title=''Interiors'': Awards |access-date=2008-12-31|archive-date=October 20, 2012|url-status=dead |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020145333/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/25065/Interiors/awards}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centers on the three children of Arthur ([[E. G. Marshall]]), a corporate attorney, and Eve ([[Geraldine Page]]), an interior decorator. Renata ([[Diane Keaton]]) is a poet whose husband Frederick ([[Richard Jordan]]), a struggling writer, feels eclipsed by her success. Flyn ([[Kristin Griffith]]) is an actress who is away most of the time filming; the low quality of her films is an object of ridicule behind her back. Joey ([[Mary Beth Hurt]]), who is in a relationship with Mike ([[Sam Waterston]]), cannot settle on a career, and resents her mother for favoring Renata, while Renata resents their father's concern over Joey's lack of direction.\n\nOne morning, Arthur unexpectedly announces that he wants a separation from his wife and would like to live alone. Eve, who is [[clinically depressed]], attempts suicide. The shock of these two events causes a rift among the sisters. Arthur returns from a trip to [[Greece]] with Pearl ([[Maureen Stapleton]]), a high-spirited and more \"normal\" woman, whom he intends to marry. His daughters are disturbed that Arthur would disregard Eve's suicide attempt and find another woman, to whom Joey refers as a \"vulgarian.\"\n\nArthur and Pearl marry at Arthur and Eve's former summer home, with Renata, Joey and Flyn in attendance. Later in the evening, Joey lashes out at Pearl when Pearl accidentally breaks one of Eve's vases. In the middle of the night, Frederick drunkenly attempts to [[rape]] Flyn. Meanwhile, Joey finds Eve in the house, and sadly explains how much she has given up for her mother, and how disdainfully she is treated. Eve walks out onto the beach and into the surf. Joey attempts unsuccessfully to save Eve, but almost drowns in the attempt. Mike rescues Joey, pulling her to shore, so that Pearl revives the drowned victim by tilting Joey's head back and pinching her nose to administer a cycle of [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|two breaths]].\n\nThe film ends with the family silently attending Eve's funeral, each placing a single white rose, Eve's favorite flower and a symbol of hope to her, on Eve's wooden, perfectly polished coffin, after which all three sisters look out at the sea from their former family beachfront home and comment on how 'peaceful' the sea looks.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Eve\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Renata\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Joey\n* [[Kristin Griffith]] as Flyn\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as Frederick\n* [[E.
