Their dialogue is in Gullah creole.<ref name=\"kviff.com\" />\n\nNarrated by the Unborn Child, the future daughter of Eli and Eula, whose voice is influenced by accounts of her ancestors, the film presents poetic visual images and circular narrative structures to represent the past, present and future for the Gullah, the majority of whom are about to embark for the mainland and a more modern, \"civilized\" way of life. The old ways and African ancestral history are represented by community matriarch Nana Peazant, who practices African spiritual rituals. Nana tells her family as she bids them to remember and honour their ancestors as they embark on their new journey, \"We are two people in one body. The last of the old and the first of the new.\"\n\nContrasting cousins, Viola, a devout Christian, and Yellow Mary, a free spirit who has brought her lover, Trula, from the city, arrive at the island by boat from their homes on the mainland for a last dinner with their family. Yellow Mary plans to leave for Nova Scotia after her visit. Mr. Snead, a mainland photographer, accompanies Viola and takes portraits of the islanders before they leave their way of life forever. Intertwined with these narratives is the marital rift between Eli and his wife Eula, who is about to give birth after being raped by a white man on the mainland. Eli struggles with the fact that the unborn child may not be his and his mother's pressure for him to maintain his connection to his ancestors. The unborn child of Eli and Eula narrates the film tracing the legacy before her birth.\n\nSeveral other family members' stories unfold between these narratives. They include Haagar, a cousin who finds the old spiritual beliefs and provincialism of the island \"backwards,\" and is impatient to leave for a more modern society with its educational and economic opportunities. Her daughter Iona longs to be with her secret lover St. Julien Lastchild, a Cherokee Native American, a resident of the island. Lastchild presents Iona with a letter confessing his devotion the day of Iona's departure asking her to stay with him.\n\nWhile the women prepare a traditional meal for the feast, which includes okra, yams and shellfish prepared at the beach, the men gather nearby in groups to talk and play games. The children and teenagers play games, practice religious rites on the beach, and have a Bible-study session with Viola. Yellow Mary and Eula bond as survivors of rape. Bilal Muhammad, a cousin that is believed to be Ibo but hails from the French West Indies, leads a Muslim prayer. Nana evokes the spirits of the family's ancestors who worked on the island's indigo plantations. Nana combines the power of their ancestors with Viola's Bible as a symbol of the old and the new. Eula and Eli reveal the history and folklore of the slave uprising and mass suicide at Ibo Landing. The Peazant family members make their final decisions to leave the island for a new beginning, or stay behind and maintain their way of life. Yellow Mary chooses to stay on the island along with Eli and Eula. In tears, Iona jumps off the boat prior to departing as Lastchild comes for her on horseback. Haagar is held back by another family member while calling for her daughter. Remaining family members watch as most of the Peazants finally depart.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* Cora Lee Day as Nana Peazant \u2013 Matriarch of the Peazant family, determined to stay on the island.\n* Adisa Anderson as Eli Peazant \u2013 Nana's grandson, torn between traveling north and staying on the island.\n* Alva Rogers as Eula Peazant \u2013 Eli's wife, who was raped by a white man and is now pregnant.\n* Kay-Lynn Warren as Unborn Child \u2013 The spirit of Eula's unborn child, who is Eli's daughter, narrates much of the film and magically appears as a young girl in some scenes before her birth.\n* [[Kaycee Moore]] as Haagar Peazant \u2013 Nana's strong-willed granddaughter-in-law, who is leading the migration north.\n* Cheryl Lynn Bruce as Viola Peazant \u2013 One of Nana's granddaughters, she has already moved to Philadelphia and become a fervent Christian.\n* Tommy Hicks as Mr. Snead \u2013 A photographer from Philadelphia, engaged by Viola to document the family's life on the island before they leave it for the North.\n* Bahni Turpin as Iona Peazant \u2013 Haagar's daughter, in love with St. Julian, a Native American who will not leave the island.\n* M.

She was inspired by her father's Gullah family, who migrated to New York City in the early 20th century during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans from the southern states. Her narrative forms were also inspired by the writing of [[Toni Morrison]], [[Alice Walker]] and [[Melville Herskovits]].<ref name=\"APnews\">Coyle, Jake (November 18, 2016), [https://apnews.com/14cbf0077264447fafa33f2945a3609a/julie-dashs-landmark-daughters-dust-reborn \"Julie Dash\u2019s landmark \u2018Daughters of the Dust\u2019 is reborn\"], ''AP News''. Retrieved October 5, 2017.</ref> As the story developed for more than 10 years, Dash clarified her artistic vision and together with [[Arthur Jafa]], her cinematographer and co-producer, she put together a short film to use for marketing.\n\nShe was initially rejected by Hollywood executives, as this was to be her first full-length film. Dash said they thought it was \"too different\" as she thought their reaction was part of a systematic exclusion of black women from Hollywood. Persisting, Dash finally got $800,000 financing from [[PBS]]' ''[[American Playhouse]]'' in 1988.\n\n=== Casting ===\nWith funding secured, Dash and Casting Director Len Hunt, cast a number of veterans of black independent cinema in various roles, as a tribute to the work they had done and the sacrifices they had made to work in independent films. She would hire a mix of union and non-union members for her crew, with the latter being cast for their familiarity with the Gullah language, which the main actors would have to learn. Rogers had one prior film credit with ''[[School Daze]]'' and was known for her work as a playwright and vocalist, while Jones had worked previously with Dash in the short ''Diary of an African Nun'' (1977) and Grosvenor was a culinary anthropologist with a Gullah background.\n\n=== Dialogue and narrative structure ===\nFor the sake of authenticity and poetry, the characters from the island speak in Gullah dialect. Ronald Daise, author of ''Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage'' (1987), was the dialect coach for her actors, none of whom knew Gullah at the start of production.\n\nThe narrative structure is non-linear, of which Dash explained:\n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to tell a historical drama about African-American women in the same way that I had seen other dramas. I decided to work with a different type of narrative structure...[and] that the typical male-oriented western-narrative structure was not appropriate for this particular film. So I let the story unravel and reveal itself in a way in which an African Gullah would tell the story, because that's part of our tradition. The story unfolds throughout this day-and-a-half in various vignettes. It unfolds and comes back. It's a different way of telling a story. It's totally different, new.<ref name=Kino>Dash, Julie (Director) (2000). ''Touching Our Own Spirit: The Making of Daughters of the Dust'' (short documentary).
