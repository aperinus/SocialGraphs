It was directed by [[Kirk Jones (director)|Kirk Jones]], coproduced by [[StudioCanal]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures]], [[Working Title Films]], Three Strange Angels, and Nanny McPhee Productions with music by [[Patrick Doyle]], and produced by [[Lindsay Doran]], [[Tim Bevan]], and [[Eric Fellner]]. Set in Victorian England, the film stars [[Emma Thompson]] as Nanny McPhee, along with [[Colin Firth]] and [[Angela Lansbury]].\n\nThe film was theatrically released on 28 October 2005 in the UK by [[United International Pictures]] and on 27 January 2006 in the US by [[Universal Pictures]]. Thompson also scripted the film, which is adapted from Christianna Brand's ''[[Nurse Matilda]]'' books. The filming location was Penn House Estate, Buckinghamshire, UK. A sequel, ''[[Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Victorian Britain]], widowed undertaker Cedric Brown is the father of seven unruly children\u2014Simon, Tora, Eric, Lily, Sebastian, Chrissie, and baby Aggie (it is not mentioned how the mother died, but it is vaguely implied to have been from childbirth). He is clumsy and loves his children, but since the death of his wife, has spent little time with them and cannot handle them. The children have had a series of nannies, whom they have systematically driven out with their bad behaviour and pranks. They also take great pleasure in tormenting their cook, Mrs. Blatherwick, a former military cook who declares that there will be \"snow in August\" before the family is put to rights. Besides their father, the only one the children will ever listen to is Evangeline, the family's uneducated but sweet-natured [[scullery maid]].\n\nOne day, Cedric discovers multiple references for a \"Nanny McPhee\" throughout the home. That same night during a storm, while the children cause havoc in the kitchen, Cedric opens the door to reveal a hideous woman, who introduces herself as Nanny McPhee. With discipline and a little [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], she transforms the family's lives. The children, led by Simon, try to play their tricks on her, but gradually start to respect her and ask her for advice. Each time the children learn a lesson, one of Nanny McPhee's facial defects magically disappears. Over time, the children become more responsible, helping their clumsy father in solving the family problems, making Nanny McPhee less and less needed.\n\nThe family is financially supported by Cedric's domineering and short-sighted aunt-in-law Lady Adelaide Stitch, who demands custody over one of the children. She first wants second-youngest daughter Chrissie, but Evangeline volunteers to go and Adelaide agrees, assuming she is one of the daughters. She also threatens to reduce the family to poverty unless Cedric remarries within the month, meaning the family would lose the house, and be forced to separate.\n\nDesperate, Cedric turns to vile and frequent widow, Mrs. Selma Quickly. The children assume from reading [[fairy tale]]s that all [[stepmother]]s are terrible women who treat their stepchildren like slaves; together, they sabotage Mrs. Quickly's visit, and she leaves, angry at Cedric. After the financial rationale for the marriage is explained to the children, they realize their mistake; the children appease Mrs. Quickly by confessing they were to blame for ruining her visit. Mrs. Quickly, intrigued when she hears about Adelaide's wealth and status, reconciles with Cedric and agrees to marry him.\n\nHowever, the children soon discover that Mrs. Quickly is just as cruel and awful as any fairytale stepmother when she deliberately breaks baby Aggie's beloved rattle (which previously belonged to their late mother). When everybody is gathered for the gaudy wedding Quickly insisted on, the children disturb the ceremony by pretending there are bees (inspired by the way Quickly told them to \"behave,\" and baby Aggie repeating the word but pronouncing it as \"beehive\"), chasing the guests, and starting a [[food fight]] using the pastries intended for the banquet. Cedric swiftly understands his children do not like the bride and, recognizing that she is not right for him or his children, joins in the commotion himself. Mrs. Quickly calls off the marriage and storms off in anger.\n\nWhen it seems that Adelaide's marriage deadline is missed, Lily suggests that Cedric marry Evangeline; the other children reveal to Adelaide that she is not, in fact, their sister. Evangeline and Cedric resist at first, but then realize their feelings for each other and agree to marry, satisfying Aunt Adelaide's conditions for maintaining her financial support. Nanny McPhee (who is now fully beautiful), magically makes it snow in August, transforming the wedding scene and changing Evangeline's clothes into a beautiful wedding dress, and restores the children's late mother's rattle for them.\n\nNanny McPhee leaves surreptitiously, in accordance with what she told the children before on her first night: \"When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:EmmaThompson05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Thompson]] at the film's premiere in 2005]]\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Nanny McPhee\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Cedric Brown, an undertaker and the widowed patriarch of the Brown family.\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster|Thomas Sangster]] as Simon Brown, the eldest of the Brown children.\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Evangeline, the Browns' scullery maid, who dreams of being an educated lady.\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Great-Aunt Lady Adelaide Stitch, the aunt of Cedric's late wife and the family's primary financial support.\n* [[Eliza Bennett]] as Tora Brown.\n* [[Rapha\u00ebl Coleman]] as Eric Brown.\n* Jennifer Rae Daykin as Lily Brown.\n* [[Samuel Honywood]] as Sebastian Brown.\n* [[Holly Gibbs]] as Christianna \"Chrissie\" Brown.\n* Hebe and Zinnia Barnes play Agatha \"Aggie\" Brown, the youngest of the Brown children.\n** Freya Fumic as the voice of Agatha Brown.\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Mrs. Selma Quickly, a frequent widow that Cedric intends to marry to appease Aunt Adelaide.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as Mrs. Blatherwick, the Browns' military-minded cook\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Mr. Wheen, one of Cedric's co-workers.\n* [[Patrick Barlow]] as Mr. Jowls, one of Cedric's co-workers.\n* [[Adam Godley]] as the vicar, who is allergic to bees.\n* [[Claire Downs]] as Nanny Whetstone.\n* [[Phyllida Law]] as the voice of Mrs. Partridge.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kirk Jones 2012 Shankbone 2.JPG|thumb|upright|Director [[Kirk Jones (director)|Kirk Jones]]]]\nOn 11 March 2002 [[Kirk Jones (director)|Kirk Jones]] was hired and set to direct ''Nanny McPhee'' based on ''[[Nurse Matilda]]'' by [[Christianna Brand]].

Thompson's work on this film prevented her from reprising her role as [[Frasier Crane]]'s first wife, Nanny G. on his spin-off series, [[Frasier]] in the episode \"Caught in the Act\", so [[Laurie Metcalf]] played Nanny G. in the episode.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released on 28 October 2005 in the UK by [[United International Pictures]] and on 27 January 2006 in the US by [[Universal Pictures]] and was released on DVD on 9 May 2006 by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives ''Nanny McPhee'' a score of 73% based on 135 reviews with an average rating of 6.7/10.
