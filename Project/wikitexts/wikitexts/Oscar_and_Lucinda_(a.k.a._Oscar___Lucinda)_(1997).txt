She buys a glass factory with her money and takes to gambling after her accountant introduces her to it.\n\nMeanwhile, a young Oscar is being reared as a [[Plymouth Brethren|Plymouth Brother]] by his father but after receiving a sign from God he decides to join the [[Anglican]] faith. While studying, he is introduced to gambling and becomes highly successful, using his winnings to fund his studies and giving the rest to the poor. He earns a scholarship to study in [[New South Wales]]. On the boat over, he meets Lucinda and hears her confess to gambling, which he denies is a sin. They play cards together until Oscar becomes panicked at the sight of a storm.\n\nIn [[New South Wales]], Oscar loses his scholarship after he is unable to stop gambling. He goes to live with Lucinda who allows him to work in her glass factory. Inspired by a model of a glass church she shows him, he asks her to make a real life replica to send to their mutual friend the Revered Dennis Hasset, betting that he can deliver it by [[Good Friday]]. Lucinda decides that they will each bet their inheritance.\n\nBecause he fears water, Oscar takes the church over land in an expedition led by Mr. Jeffries. He witnesses Jeffries murdering and raping [[Indigenous Australians]] and eventually kills him in self-defence after Jeffries attacks him.\n\nHe is successful in delivering the church. Weakened upon arrival, he is left in the care of a woman named Miriam Chadwick, who rapes him. Fearing that he will have to marry Miriam, and in love with Lucinda, Oscar enters the glass church to pray. He falls asleep and is drowned inside when the church, which was resting on a barge in the water, sinks.\n\nAs Miriam is pregnant with Oscar's child, Hasset burns the papers confirming the wager, not wanting Lucinda's money to be inherited by her. She dies shortly after her son, Oscar, is born and the child is reared by Lucinda.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Oscar Hopkins\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Lucinda Leplastrier\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as the Reverend Dennis Hasset\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Hugh Stratton\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as Mr. Jeffries\n* [[Clive Russell]] as Theophilius\n* [[Bille Brown]] as Percy Smith\n* [[Josephine Byrnes]] as Miriam Chadwick\n* [[Barnaby Kay]] as Wardley-Fish\n* [[Barry Otto]] as Jimmy D'Abbs\n* [[Linda Bassett]] as Betty Stratton\n* [[Peter Whitford]] as Mr. Ahearn\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Narrator\n* Adam Hayes as Young Oscar\n* James Tingey as 13 year-old Oscar\n* Polly Cheshire as Young Lucinda\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nGillian Armstrong had long wanted to film Peter Carey's novel but the rights were originally bought for [[John Schlesinger]].
