The film stars [[Martin Landau]], [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], [[Rob Schneider]], [[Udo Kier]], [[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] and [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]]. The film was both a critical and commercial failure although a direct to video [[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (film)|sequel]] was made.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSet in the [[18th century]], the film opens with the kindly [[Italians|Italian]] [[woodcarver]], [[Geppetto]], declaring his secret love for a woman named Leona by carving their initials in a heart on an [[pine tree|old pine tree]] in the forest. Later, lightning strikes the tree. Many years later, Geppetto, now an old man living alone with his cat and his puppets, returns to the forest. A piece of wood from that tree, bearing the heart Gepetto carved, finds its way into his cart. Feeling a certain affinity for it, he decides to carve a puppet from it. When he finishes his work, he names his new creation Pinocchio, from the pine wood he made him from and for his magnificent eyes. Suddenly, the wooden boy comes to life and shocks the old puppet-maker. Although Gepetto tells Pinocchio that he is not his father, he seeks to protect the puppet, who damages himself while trying to imitate a pigeon leaping and running along the roofs of the city. Later, Pinocchio wanders off, following a child with a ball. He runs into [[The Fox and the Cat|Volpe and Felinet]], who try to sell him to the puppet-theater owner [[Mangiafuoco|Lorenzini]]. Although Lorenzini agrees to pay a great deal for Pinocchio, Geppetto declines.\n\nLater, Pinocchio follows a group a schoolchildren and becomes fascinated by school and learning. But a rowdy boy named [[Candlewick (character)|Lampwick]] ([[Corey Carrier]]) involves him in a violent prank. The teacher punishes Pinocchio harshly, and the puppet is forced to leave the company of the real boys. He then causes a great deal of mischief in a bakery. Gepetto is held responsible for the puppets actions and arrested. While Geppetto spends the night in a prison cell, Pinocchio returns home and meets 'the voice of truth' in the form of a wise and optimistic cricket named [[Talking Cricket|Pepe]]. Pepe promises to help Pinocchio to become a real boy, if he can promise to be good. The next day, Gepetto and Pinocchio stand before the judge, who rules that unless Gepetto can pay for the damage Pinocchio caused they will both be sent to prison. Lorenzini steps in and offers to pay off the debt, on the condition that Pinocchio be handed over to his custody. Gepetto strongly refuses but eventually gives in, believing that perhaps the puppet will be better off that way. Pinocchio is heartbroken and does not want to leave his \"father\", but Gepetto tells them that he cannot be his father since he is not a real boy. Pinocchio comes to enjoy the theatre and also comes to believe that Lorenzini loves him as much as his Papa did. Pepe tells him that Lorenzini is just using him to gain money and success. Pinocchio comes to realize this as he performs in Lorenzini's play, and manages to save several puppets from being burned by the cruel Lorenzini. As he escapes, he accidentally sets the theatre aflame. He floats away down the river, passing through the woodlands to a quiet church. Volpe and Felinet catch up with him and manage to swindle him out of the few pieces of gold that he still has by telling him that if he buries them in the ground they will grow and cause a miracle that will turn him into a real boy. Pepe scolds the puppet and proclaims: \"Miracles don't grow on trees. Miracles are made in the heart!\" Meanwhile, Geppetto and his friend (and secret love) Leona have begun searching the forest for Pinocchio. However, Pinocchio is enticed by Lampwick to join of wagon-load of other boys who are being taken to [[Land of Toys|Terra Magica]], a hidden [[funfair|fun-fair]] for boys where they are encouraged to perform all sorts of cruel and naughty deeds. While riding on a [[roller-coaster]], Lampwick and some others are turned into donkeys by the enchanted water of a huge fountain. They are then rounded up by Lorenzini, who runs the place and intends to sell the donkeys as work animals. Pinocchio, half-transformed himself, frees the donkeys from their pen. Chased by Lorenzini and his henchmen, Pinocchio attempts to warn the others. No one believes him until Lampwick strikes out with his hooves and knocks Lorenzini into the fountain, where he turns into a monster and dived into the river. The boys run form the valley together and freed the other donkeys, leaving Pinocchio and the donkey Lampwick to journey alone.\n\nGeppetto and Leona arrive and find Pinocchio's hat, believing him to be lost at sea. Before striking out in a rowboat to search for the puppet, Geppetto finally declares his love for Leona. She angrily cries that she (who was married to his deceased brother for many years) is done waiting for him. However, when Pinocchio arrives she is still there, and takes care of Lampwick while reluctantly allowing Pinocchio to follow Gepetto. The puppet is swallowed by a [[The Terrible Dogfish|monstrous whale]]. Based on Pepe's observation of the inside smelling like \"rotten chili peppers\", Pinocchio presumes the whale to be Lorenzini. Inside the creature's stomach, Pinocchio is finally reunited with his Papa. In order to escape, Pinocchio tells Gepetto that he hates him. The lie causes Pinocchio's nose to lengthen and push the whale's throat open wider. Pinocchio's nose snapped as they made their escape, leaving his nose lodged within Lorenzini's throat, presumably killing him eventually. They make it back to shore, where Gepetto apologizes for giving Pinocchio away and tells him he loves him, while Pinocchio apologizes for not being the real boy his father wanted him to be. Gepetto, who has fully accepted his son as he is, tells him that he's \"real to him\". Pinocchio begins to cry tears and turns into a real boy. He proclaims: \"Miracles are made in the heart, Papa,\". Pepe leaves Pinocchio temporarily to go on a much needed vacation. On the way home, Pinocchio runs into Volpe and Felinet. He tricks them into drinking from the fountain where he and the other boys were turned into donkeys. The two swindlers are transformed into a fox and a cat, which results in them being captured by a farmer as new pets. Pinocchio returns to live life as a real boy with his Papa, Leona and his best friend Lampwick, who changed back by becoming good.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Geppetto]], an impoverished Italian puppet maker who accidentally gives Pinocchio life after carving him from an enchanted log. He is initially reluctant to accept the puppet as his son, but warms up to him once he loses him.\n* [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as [[Pinocchio]], the eponymous character and main protagonist of the film. He seeks to learn about right and wrong so that one day he will become a real boy.\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Leona, a friend of Geppetto with whom he is secretly in love \u2013 a love which is actually mutual, despite her having previously married his late brother. She serves as the [[Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]]'s stand-in in the film.\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Lorenzini, an original character created for the film. He is an amalgamation of [[Mangiafuoco]], [[The Coachman]] and [[The Terrible Dogfish]]. His fondness for chili peppers, which give him his somewhat fiery breath, is a homage to Mangiafuoco.\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as [[The Fox and the Cat|Felinet]], a scheming con artist always looking for the next profit. Her name comes from the word \"feline\", meaning \"cat\". She and Volpe are based on the Fox and the Cat from the original novel. In the movie, Felinet is smarter than Volpe, while in the novel and in most adaptations, the Fox is smarter than the Cat.\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as [[The Fox and the Cat|Volpe]], Felinet's dim-witted partner and sidekick. His name is the Italian word for \"fox\". He and Felinet are based on the Fox and the Cat from the original novel.\n* [[Corey Carrier]] as [[Candlewick (Pinocchio character)|Lampwick]]. Unlike in the novel and the 1940 Disney version, Lampwick returns to being human and remains Pinocchio's best friend in the end, and affectionately calls him \"Woody\" even after they have both become real boys.\n* [[Dawn French]] as the Baker's Wife. A [[Shrew (stock character)|shrew]] who works inside the bakery as director; she is like a little tea-pot (being short, stout, and full of steam enough to shout), though she does more damage to her shop than Pinocchio, she sways the court judge to rule in her favour.\n* Richard Claxton as Saleo, Lampwick's companion and friend who kicks Pinocchio in class at school. He is turned into a donkey, along with Lampwick and another boy ([[Joe Swash]]), after drinking cursed water on Terra Magica's roller coaster. In the end, he reforms and returns to normal, along with all the other boys.\n* [[John Sessions]] as the Professor, an irritable teacher who Pinocchio inadvertently annoys while attending one of his classes.\n* [[Jerry Hadley]] as the Judge, a court official who threatens to send Geppetto to a debtors' prison for Pinocchio's irresponsible behavior.\n* [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] as the Foreman\n\n===Voice cast===\n* Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice of Pinocchio, in his puppet form.\n* [[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]] as the Giant's voice\n* Rob Schneider as the voice of Volpe, in his fox form.\n* Bebe Neuwirth as the voice of Felinet, in her cat form. \n* [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] as the voice of Pepe, a [[Talking Cricket|talking cricket]] who serves as Pinocchio's conscience.\n\n===Puppeteers===\n* [[Mak Wilson]] as Pinocchio (lead animatronic puppeteer)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/amphtml/1996/0731/073196.feat.film.1.html|title=Martin Landau's Father Role Is Unlike Any Other|website=Csmonitor.com|access-date=27 November 2021}}</ref>\n* Robert Tygner\n* [[Michelan Sisti]]\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]] as Pinocchio (principal puppeteer)\n* [[William Todd-Jones]]\n* Ian Tregonning\n\n==Development==\nNearly ten years before the film was eventually made, [[Jim Henson]] and director Steve Barron were considering the idea of a live-action version of ''Pinocchio''. They approached [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] with this idea, but Disney turned down the project. Years later, producer Lawrence Mortorff (President of Kushner Locke) sent Barron a script for a film based on the novel by Carlo Collodi. The project then finally got off the ground. For the character of [[Pinocchio]], a complex [[animatronic]] puppet created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] was used with [[stop-motion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/|title=Top South Florida News, Sports, Weather and Entertainment - South Florida Sun-Sentinel|website=Sun-sentinel.com|access-date=27 November 2021}}</ref> [[Framestore]] and [[Cinesite]] also provided the visual effects for the film.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 24, 1995 and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on September 15, 1995. The film was shot in [[Croatia]], [[Prague]], [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]], and [[High Force]]. Pepe, the talking cricket, is computer-animated. One of the biggest changes in the filming was replacing [[Wallace Shawn]] with [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]], as the voice of Pepe. However, Shawn's voice as Pepe can still be heard in the trailer for the film, and he is even credited in the trailer.\n\nThe score by [[Rachel Portman]] features [[saxophone]] solos by [[David Roach (screenwriter)|David Roach]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Adventures of Pinocchio'' was made on a budget of $25 million. The film had a poor performance in the United States, opening at #8 on its first week, then grossing $15,094,530 at the box office.\n\n===Critical reception===\nCritically, the film received a 35% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 26 reviews with the consensus: \"''The Adventures of Pinocchio'' is an admirably faithful adaptation of the source material, but it may be too frightening for younger viewers - and too dull for older ones.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_adventures_of_pinocchio_1996|title=The Adventures of Pinocchio|access-date=27 November 2021|website=Rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn the television review series ''[[Siskel & Ebert]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] expressed disappointment with the film, while [[Gene Siskel]] praised the special effects, and remarked that he believed the film to be a faithful adaptation of the book, as opposed to Disney's interpretation, which strayed significantly from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvUTXJO42TU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/bvUTXJO42TU |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|title=Siskel & Ebert - The Adventures Of Pinocchio (1996)|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2011-05-12|work=At the Movies (U.S. TV series)}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Ebert gave the film a two out of four stars and said, \"The story is told with visual grace, but lacks excitement.
