The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Bodrov and Arif Aliev.

He meets and chooses [[B\u00f6rte]], against his father's wishes. On their way home, Yes\u00fcgei is poisoned by an enemy tribe; on his dying breath, he tells his son that he is now [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. However, Targutai, Yes\u00fcgei's lieutenant, proclaims himself as Khan and is about to kill his young rival. Prevented from doing so by [[Hoelun|the boy's mother]], Targutai lets him go and vows to kill him as soon as he becomes an adult.\n\nAfter falling through a frozen lake, Tem\u00fcjin is rescued by [[Jamukha]]. The two quickly become friends and take an oath as [[blood brother]]s. Targutai later captures him, but he escapes under the cover of night and roams the countryside.\n\nYears later (1186), Tem\u00fcjin is once again apprehended by Targutai. He escapes a second time, finding B\u00f6rte and presenting her to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the [[Merkit]] tribe. While being chased on horseback, Tem\u00fcjin is shot with an arrow but survives. B\u00f6rte, however, is kidnapped and taken to the Merkit camp.<ref name=\"film\">[[Sergei Bodrov]]. (2007). ''Mongol'' [Motion picture]. Russia: [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse Entertainment]].</ref>\n\nTem\u00fcjin goes to Jamukha\u2014who is now his tribe's Khan\u2014and seeks his help in rescuing his wife. Jamukha agrees, and after a year, they launch an attack on the Merkits and are successful. One night, while celebrating their victory, Tem\u00fcjin demonstrates his generosity by allowing his troops to take an equal share of the [[Looting|plunder]]. Two of Jamukha's men see this as a stark contrast to their Khan's behavior and desert him the next morning by following their new master. Jamukha chases him down and demands that he give his men back, to which he refused. This act, aggravated by the inadvertent killing of his biological brother by one of Tem\u00fcjin's men, leaves Jamukha (with Targutai as an ally) no choice but to declare war on him. Outnumbered, Tem\u00fcjin's army is quickly defeated. Sparing his blood brother, Jamukha decides to sell him into slavery.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\nTem\u00fcjin is sold to a Tangut nobleman despite the dire warning given to him by a [[Buddhist]] monk acting as his adviser, who senses the great potential the warrior carries and his future role in subjugating the Tangut State. While he is imprisoned, the monk pleads with him to spare his monastery when he will destroy the kingdom sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to B\u00f6rte indicating that he is still alive, Tem\u00fcjin agrees. The monk succeeds in delivering the bone and the message at the cost of his life. B\u00f6rte infiltrates the Tangut border town disguised as a merchant's [[concubinage|concubine]] and the two escape.\n\nTem\u00fcjin pledges to unify all of the Mongol tribes and imposes three basic laws for them to abide to: never kill women and children, always honor your promises and repay your debts, and ''never'' betray your Khan. Subsequently, (1196), he gathers an army and engages Jamukha, who has an even larger force. During the battle, a thunderstorm arises on the steppe, terrifying Jamhukha's and Temujin's armies, who cower in fear. However Temujin does not cower, and when his army sees him riding unafraid they are inspired to also be fearless and charge Jamukha's helpless and cowering army, which surrenders immediately. Tem\u00fcjin allows Jamukha to live and brings the latter's army under his banner. Targutai is killed by his own soldiers and his body is presented to the Khan as a way of appeasing him, but they are executed for disobeying the law.\n\nA postscript indicates that by 1206, Tem\u00fcjin was designated the Khan of all the [[Mongols]]\u2014''[[Genghis Khan]] of the Great Steppe''. He would later go on to invade and conquer the Tangut kingdom by 1227, fulfilling the monk's prophecy, but spared the monastery, honoring his debt to the monk.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Tadanobu.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Actor Tadanobu Asano, who portrayed the elder Tem\u00fcjin in the film.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan/Tem\u00fcjin]]\n** Odnyam Odsuren as young Tem\u00fcjin\n* [[Sun Honglei]] as [[Jamukha]]\n** Amarbold Tuvshinbayar as young Jamukha\n* [[Chuluuny Khulan]] as [[B\u00f6rte]]\n** Bayertsetseg Erdenebat as young B\u00f6rte\n* Amadu Mamadakov as Targutai\n* [[Batdorj-in Baasanjab|Ba Sen]] as [[Yesugei|Yes\u00fcgei]]\n* Sai Xing Ga as Chiledu\n* Bu Ren as Taichar\n* Aliya as Oelun\n* He Qi as Dai-Sechen\n* Deng Ba Te Er as Daritai\n* Zhang Jiong as Garrison Chief\n* Ben Hon Sun as Monk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2021}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Sergei Vladimirovich Bodrov.jpg|170px|left|thumb|Director Sergei Bodrov at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival|66th Venice Film Festival]]]]\nThe premise of ''Mongol'' is the story of Genghis Khan, the Mongol leader who founded the [[Mongol Empire]], which ruled expansive areas of [[Eurasia]]. The film depicts the early life of Tem\u00fcjin, not as an evil war-mongering brute, but rather an inspiring visionary leader. Director Bodrov noted that \"Russians lived under Mongolian rule for around 200 years\" and that \"Genghis Khan was portrayed as a monster\". During the 1990s, Bodrov read a book by Russian historian [[Lev Gumilev]] entitled ''The Legend of the Black Arrow'', which offered a more disciplined view of the Mongol leader and influenced Bodrov to create a film project about the warrior.\n\nBodrov spent several years researching the aspects of his story, discovering that Tem\u00fcjin was an orphan, a slave and a combatant whom everyone tried to kill. He found difficulty in preparing the screenplay for the film due to the fact that no contemporary Mongol biography existed. The only Mongol history from the era is ''[[The Secret History of Mongols]]'',  written for the Mongol royal family some time after Genghis Khan's death in AD 1227. Author Gumilev had used the work as a historical reference and a work of significant literature. Casting for the film took place worldwide, including Mongolia, China, Russia, and in Los Angeles. Speaking on the choice of Tadanobu Asano to portray Tem\u00fcjin, Bodrov commented that although it might have seemed odd to cast a Japanese actor in the role, he explained that the Mongol ruler was seen by many Japanese as one of their own. Bodrov said, \"The Japanese had a very famous ancient warrior who disappeared {{bracket|[[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]}}, and they think he went to Mongolia and became Genghis Khan. He's a national hero, Genghis Khan. Mongolians can claim he's Mongolian, but the Japanese, they think they know who he is.\" Bodrov felt casting actor Sun Honglei as Jamukha was a perfect mix of \"gravity and humor\" for the role. Describing the character interaction between Asano and Honglei, he noted \"They're completely different people, Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha, but they have a strong relationship, strong feelings between them.\" Aside from the Chinese and Japanese actors for those roles, the rest of the cast were Mongolian. It marked the first time a tale of Genghis Khan would be acted by Asians, this in contrast to such Hollywood and European attempts like the 1956 movie flop ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' and the 1965 film ''[[Genghis Khan]]'' with [[Omar Sharif]].\n\nThe film was initially intended to be shot in [[Mongolia]], but the plans caused much protest in the country, as many Mongolians feared that it would not correctly portray their people and their national hero.<ref name=Protests/> As a consequence, shooting was moved to the Chinese autonomous region [[Inner Mongolia]] and to [[Kazakhstan]].\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:MongolAsano.jpg|thumb|right|The character Tem\u00fcjin, dressed in Mongolian warrior garb]]\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] began in 2005, lasting 25 weeks and taking place in China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. Production designer Dashi Namdakov helped to recreate the pastoral lifestyle of the nomadic tribesmen. Namdakov is originally from a Russian region which borders Mongolia and is home to many ethnic Mongols. Bodrov remarked, \"Dashi has the Mongol culture in his bones and knows how to approach this material.\" To help create some of the horse-mounted stunt sequences, Bodrov called upon seasoned stuntmen from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, whom he was familiar with from the production of ''[[Nomad (2005 film)|Nomad]]''. Describing some of the stunt work, Bodrov claimed: \"Not a single horse was hurt on this film. There's a line in the movie, when young Jamukha tells Tem\u00fcjin, 'For Mongol, horse is more important than woman.' And that's how it is with the Kazakh and Kyrgyz stunt people. They took very good care of the horses and were very conscientious.\" Bodrov collaborated on the film with editors [[Zach Staenberg]] and [[Vald\u00eds \u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir]].\n\n==Release==\n''Mongol'' was first released in Russia and Ukraine on 20 September 2007.<ref name=BoxOfficeRelease>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=mongol.htm |title=International Box Office Results |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> The film then premiered in cinemas in Turkey on 14 March 2008.
