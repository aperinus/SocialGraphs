The film juxtaposes a comedy-drama narrative with the ideas of [[Henri Laborit]], the French surgeon, neurobiologist, philosopher and author. Its principal actors are [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Nicole Garcia]], and [[Roger Pierre]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\nHenri Laborit gives an introduction to the physiology of the brain, and also briefly describes his own background. Summary biographies of three fictional characters are given in parallel to his own: Jean Le Gall is born into a comfortable middle-class family on an island in the gulf of Morbihan in Brittany and pursues a career in radio and politics; Janine Garnier, daughter of left-wing working-class parents in Paris, runs away from home to become an actress, but later switches career to be a fashion adviser; Ren\u00e9 Ragueneau rebels against the old-fashioned outlook of his farming family in Torfou, in Maine-et-Loire, and studies accountancy before becoming an executive in a textile factory in Lille; a company merger forces him to take a new job in Cholet, away from his wife and children.\n\nLaborit expounds his ideas on four main types of animal behaviour, grounded respectively in consumption, escape, struggle, and inhibition. The lives of the three fictional characters intersect at various points (Jean in an affair with Janine, Ren\u00e9 negotiating with Janine about the future of his job) and each of them faces moments of critical life-changing decision. At these moments they are seen as self-identifying with the image of a popular star in French cinema (Jean with [[Danielle Darrieux]], Janine with [[Jean Marais]], and Ren\u00e9 with [[Jean Gabin]]).\n \nLaborit comments on the conflicts arising from pursuit of dominance among individuals and defensive reactions to it, and reflects on the need for better understanding of the human brain.<ref>An abbreviated transcription of Henri Laborit's remarks in the film is given in a note at the end of the following article: Edward Kunz, \"Henri Laborit and the inhibition of action\", in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3984888/ ''Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience''], March 2014, vol. 16(1), pp. 113\u2013117.

That film was not financed, but the two men decided to explore the possibility of a feature film in which documentary would be mingled with fiction. Resnais began an extensive programme of immersing himself in Laborit's published works, to understand how the presentation of scientific reasoning might interact with fictional narrative in a dramatically interesting way while treating each type of material independently.<ref name=\"benayoun242\">Robert Benayoun, Interview with Resnais in ''Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire''. Paris: \u00c9ditions Ramsay, 2008. pp. 242-243.</ref> Resnais commented on his plan in an interview:  \"Films or plays usually arise from a desire to develop an idea or theory through characters or through a story. I said to myself, 'Wouldn't it be fun to do just the opposite? To allow theory and fiction to coexist on the screen.'\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/06/movies/at-the-movies-how-resnais-made-a-success-with-science.html \"How Resnais made a success with science\"], by Tom Buckley.

This led to a screenplay in which three fictional characters would take Laborit's theories as their starting point but their interwoven stories would then develop in their own way.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Thomas, ''L'Atelier d'Alain Resnais''.

Gruault made the choice of Danielle Darrieux, Jean Marais and Jean Gabin as the most likely ones to fit his three characters.<ref>Robert Benayoun, Interview with Resnais in ''Alain Resnais, arpenteur de l'imaginaire''.

Paris: Flammarion, 1989. p. 112.</ref>\n\nThe fictional stories were filmed in advance and independently of Laborit's contributions. At this stage Resnais did not know exactly what Laborit was going to say, although he had discussed with him the general themes which he would cover. Some very long shots were filmed in the stories to allow flexibility for Laborit's words to be added later. The editor Albert Jurgenson commented that the role of the editing process in the film was more important than usual, and the various elements were so complex that everything could not be foreseen in the planning; the film was thoroughly rebuilt at the editing stage.<ref>Albert Jurgenson, quoted in Fran\u00e7ois Thomas, ''L'Atelier d'Alain Resnais''. Paris: Flammarion, 1989. pp. 205-206: \"On ne peut pas dire que la construction de ''Mon oncle d'Am\u00e9rique'' ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli au montage, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 profond\u00e9ment r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0\".</ref>\n\nIn the film's epilogue a montage of travelling shots shows a landscape of abandoned and half-demolished buildings in the Bronx, New York, culminating on a starkly contrasted mural of a green tree painted on the side of one of the buildings, providing a moment of relief and pleasure. The camera then moves progressively closer to the mural in a series of shots, causing the whole image to disintegrate into its constituent parts until we can see only fragments of paint on the side of a single brick. Resnais explained that he wanted to show an image of the impossibility for the brain to understand things completely; the effort to create something and then an effort to destroy it were tendencies which seemed to fit the atmosphere of the film.<ref>Suzanne Liandrat-Guigues & Jean-Louis Leutrat, ''Alain Resnais: liaisons secr\u00e8tes, accords vagabonds''.

(\"There are in this film at least two films, badly mixed together, a grafting which doesn't take, but which adheres to its necessity all the same.\")</ref> while there was also some concern expressed that the scientific arguments about the [[biological determinism]] of human actions and social phenomena were reactionary ideas which would give support to the politics of the 'new right'.<ref>Fran\u00e7oise Lazard-Levaillant, in ''L'Humanit\u00e9'', 4 juin 1980: \"...ce film illustre ces th\u00e8ses r\u00e9actionnaires, et le spectateur doit en \u00eatre d'autant plus conscient que ses qualit\u00e9s lui assureront une grande diffusion\". (\"...this film gives illustration to these reactionary arguments, and the spectator needs to be all the more aware of that inasmuch as its qualities will guarantee it a wide distribution.\")</ref>\n\nIn English-language reviews there was a similar range of reaction, from warm appreciation of a humorous and witty entertainment<ref>Vincent Canby, in [https://www.nytimes.com/1980/12/17/arts/resnais-comedy-mon-oncle-damerique-13.html ''New York Times''], 17 December 1980, page C25: \"... an exhilarating fiction...

Laborit studies the behavior of laboratory white rats and relates it to human behavior, especially that of Jean, Janine, and Ren\u00e9.\"</ref> Elsewhere the view that Resnais and Laborit are expressing the same point of view has been challenged, and the case made that the structure of the film is a more complex arrangement of several component parts, of which Laborit's commentary is one, which need to be examined in relation to each other.<ref>Fabienne Andr\u00e9 Worth, \"Six th\u00e9ories en qu\u00eate d'auteur: qui dit 'mon' dans ''Mon oncle d'Am\u00e9rique''?\", in ''The French Review'', vol. 57 (no. 6) May 1984, pp. 834-842.</ref><ref>Penelope Houston, review in ''Sight & Sound'', vol. 50, no. 1 (Winter 1980/1981), pp. 62-63: \"The structure of the film is at the same time vigorously taut and excitingly free ...It would be disingenuous to deny that the stories are likely to be read by an audience as case histories, checked against the laboratory information. But, having set up one system of cross-references, the film can more easily accommodate others: the use of animals; the linking of the characters to their favourite film stars ... even the incidents of impudently graphic illustration when white rats' heads fleetingly appear on human shoulders.\"</ref>\n\nResnais discussed this question in several interviews after the film's release and consistently made the point that while the film was deeply influenced by Laborit's ideas, it was not a presentation of them, nor a critique. For example: \"... I didn't want the characters simply to illustrate [Laborit's ideas].

Il agit sur notre film comme un catalyseur.\"</ref>\n\nResnais further explained that his intention was to open up an enquiry and a dialogue with the spectator: \"We produced the film upon a contradiction. We wanted it to be impregnated with the theses but to be independent of them as well. I think of it as a collage, with the fiction and the theses alongside each other; sometimes joining, sometimes diverging, sometimes even contradicting.
