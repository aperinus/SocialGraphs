The [[screenplay]] by [[James Warner Bellah]] and [[Willis Goldbeck]] was adapted from a 1953 short story written by [[Dorothy M. Johnson]]. The supporting cast features [[Vera Miles]], [[Lee Marvin]] (as Liberty Valance), [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Andy Devine]], [[John Carradine]], [[Woody Strode]], [[Strother Martin]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]].\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-07-254/librarian-of-congress-announces-2007-film-registry/2007-12-27/|access-date=2020-12-11|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=2020-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014193312/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-07-254/librarian-of-congress-announces-2007-film-registry/2007-12-27/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-12-11|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=2016-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSometime in the early 20th century, U.S. Senator Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard and his wife, Hallie, arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed [[Western United States|western]] state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon. When asked by the local newspaper editor why a senator would attend the funeral of a poor rancher, Stoddard answers with a story that flashes back 25 years.\n\nEntering the then-unincorporated territory as a young lawyer, Ranse is beaten and robbed by infamous outlaw Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon and his handyman, Pompey, find Ranse and take him to Shinbone, where Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, treats his wounds. Ranse learns Valance frequently terrorizes Shinbone and the surrounding country since the local [[town marshal|marshal]], Link Appleyard, is overweight and too cowardly to stop him. Tom says Valance only understands force, but Ranse is determined to bring Valance to justice through the law.\n\nWhile establishing his law practice, Ranse buses tables at Peter Ericson's [[steakhouse]], where Hallie works, and after learning she is illiterate, he opens a school for both children and adults in the back of the ''Shinbone Star'' newspaper office after befriending its editor, Dutton Peabody. He also begins practicing with Peabody's old gun after Valance bullies him in the restaurant. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom takes Ranse to his ranch for a shooting lesson, showing off renovations that are intended for his marriage to Hallie and making those intentions clear to Ranse. During the lesson, he tricks Ranse by shooting a paint can above his head and staining his clothes. Ranse angrily punches Tom and leaves.\n\nShinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the forthcoming statehood convention at the territorial capital. Tom refuses Ranse's nomination: ultimately, Ranse and Peabody are elected. Valance, hired by the [[cattle baron]]s who oppose statehood, tries and fails to intimidate the voters into electing him as a delegate. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines.\n\nThat evening, Valance and his gang vandalize the newspaper office and severely injure Peabody for printing stories that he finds insulting. Ranse arms himself and goes after Valance; even drunk, Valance easily disarms the inexperienced Ranse and prepares to kill him. Ranse retrieves his gun, outdraws Valance, and seemingly kills him. Ranse returns to Ericson's where Hallie treats his arm; Tom enters and sees Hallie's clear affection for Ranse as she attends his wounds. He gets drunk, forces Appleyard to run Valance's men out of town, and attempts suicide by setting fire to his own house, but Pompey is able to rescue him.\n\nAt the territorial convention, Ranse is nominated as their delegate to Congress, but withdraws after a representative of the cattle barons calls him a murderer, feeling that he cannot build a career out of \"killing a man\". Tom arrives and explains to Ranse that it was he, not Ranse, that killed Valance; knowing that Ranse could never hope to beat Valance, Tom shot him with Pompey's rifle at the same time he fired. Tom encourages Ranse to accept the nomination for Hallie's sake before quietly walking out of the convention.\n\nIn the present, Ranse's rising political achievements \u2013 state governor, senator, ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]], and likely vice-presidential nominee in the upcoming election \u2013 fill in the intervening years, but the editor, knowing that publishing the story would ruin Ranse's legacy, chooses to burn his notes and leave him to conduct Tom's funeral in peace. On the return trip to [[Washington, D.C.]], Ranse contemplates retiring to Shinbone, which pleases Hallie. As he thanks the train conductor for the railroad's many courtesies, the conductor answers, \"Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[John Wayne]] as Tom Doniphon\n* [[James Stewart]] as Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard\n* [[Vera Miles]] as Hallie Stoddard\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Liberty Valance\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as Dutton Peabody\n* [[Andy Devine]] as Marshal Link Appleyard\n* [[Ken Murray (entertainer)|Ken Murray]] as Doc Willoughby\n* [[John Carradine]] as Maj.

Many stories and speculations exist to explain this decision. Ford claimed to prefer that medium over [[Color film (motion picture)|color]]: \"In black and white, you've got to be very careful. You've got to know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is,\" he said. \"You might say I'm old fashioned, but black and white is real photography.\"<ref>{{harvp|McBride|2003|p=306}}</ref> Ford also reportedly argued that the climactic shoot-out between Valance and Stoddard would not have worked in color.<ref>{{harvp|Kalinak |2007 |page=96}}</ref>\n\nOthers have interpreted the absence of the magnificent outdoor vistas so prevalent in earlier Ford Westerns as \"a fundamental reimagining [by Ford] of his mythic West\" \u2013  a grittier, less romantic, more realistic portrayal of frontier life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://parallax-view.org/2009/05/21/john-fords-wilderness-the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance/ |title=John Ford's Wilderness: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance |last=Coursen |first=D. |date=May 21, 2009 |website=Parallax View |access-date=September 10, 2014 |archive-date=September 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002345/http://parallax-view.org/2009/05/21/john-fords-wilderness-the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  A more pragmatic interpretation cites the fact that Wayne and Stewart, two of Hollywood's biggest stars working together for the first time, were arguably considerably older (54 and 53, respectively) than the characters they were playing. Filming in black and white helped ease the [[suspension of disbelief]] necessary to accept that disparity.<ref>{{harvp|McBride|2003|p=312}}</ref>  According to cinematographer [[William H. Clothier]], however, \"There was one reason and one reason only ... Paramount was cutting costs. Otherwise we would have been in [[Monument Valley]] or [[Brackettville, Texas|Brackettville]] and we would have had color stock. Ford had to accept those terms or not make the film.\"<ref>{{harvp|Munn|2004|p=232}}</ref>\n\nAnother condition imposed by the studio, according to Van Cleef, was that Wayne be cast as Doniphon.  Ford resented the studio's intrusion and retaliated by taunting Wayne relentlessly throughout the filming. \"He didn't want Duke [Wayne] to think he was doing ''him'' any favors,\" Van Cleef said.<ref name=\"Munn 2004, p. 233\">{{harvp|Munn|2004|p=233}}</ref> Strode recounted that Ford \"kept needling Duke about his failure to make it as a [[American football in the United States|football]] player\", comparing him to Strode (a former [[NFL]] running back), whom he pronounced \"a real football player\". (Wayne's football career at [[USC Trojans football|USC]] had been curtailed by injuries.) He also ridiculed Wayne for failing to enlist during [[World War II]], during which Ford filmed a series of widely praised combat documentaries for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and was wounded at the [[Battle of Midway]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/john-ford.html |title=A Look Back ...

Wayne's avoidance of wartime service was a major source of guilt for him in his later years.<ref>{{Cite book |title=John Wayne |last=Wayne |first=Pilar |pages=43\u201347}}</ref> Another credible explanation is that Ford kept Wayne off balance to intensify the focus and power of his performance.\n\nStewart related that midway through filming, Wayne asked him why he, Stewart, never seemed to be the target of Ford's venomous remarks. Other cast- and crew-members also noticed Stewart's apparent immunity from Ford's abuse. Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strode's costume for the film's beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, \"It looks a bit [[Uncle Remus]]sy to me.\" Ford responded, \"What's wrong with Uncle Remus?\" He called for the crew's attention and announced, \"One of our ''players'' doesn't like Woody's costume. Now, I don't know if Mr. Stewart has a prejudice against Negroes, but I just wanted you all to know about it.\" Stewart said he \"wanted to crawl into a mouse hole\", but Wayne told him, \"Well, welcome to the club. I'm glad you made it.\"<ref name=\"Munn 2004, p. 233\"/><ref>{{harvp|McBride|2003|p=631}}</ref>\n\nFord's behavior \"...really pissed Wayne off,\" Strode said, \"but he would never take it out on Ford,\" the man largely responsible for his rise to stardom. \"He ended up taking it out on me.\" While filming an exterior shot on a horse-drawn cart, Wayne almost lost control of the horses and knocked Strode away when he attempted to help. When the horses did stop, Wayne tried to pick a fight with the younger and fitter Strode. Ford called out, \"Don't hit him, Woody, we need him.\"  Wayne later told Strode, \"We gotta work together. We both gotta be professionals.\" Strode blamed Ford for nearly all the friction on the set. \"What a miserable film to make,\" he added.<ref>{{harvp|Munn|2004|p=234}}</ref>\n\nStewart received [[Billing (performing arts)|top billing]] over Wayne on promotional posters and the trailers, but in the film itself, Wayne's [[Motion picture credits|screen card]] appears first and slightly higher on a sign post. The studio also specified that Wayne's name appear before Stewart's on theatre marquees, reportedly at Ford's request.<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Western Movies |last=Matthews |first=L. |date=1984 |publisher=Crescent |isbn=0517414759 |page=132}}</ref> \"Wayne actually played the lead,\" Ford said, to [[Peter Bogdanovich]]. \"Jimmy Stewart had most of the sides [sequences with dialogue], but Wayne was the central character, the motivation for the whole thing.\"<ref>{{harvp|Bogdanovich|1978|p=99}}</ref>\n\nParts of the film were shot in [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Schneider, Jerry L. |date=2015|title=Western Filming Locations, Book 1|publisher= CP Entertainment Books|page =116 |isbn=9780692561348}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Fleming, E.J. |date=2010|title=The Movieland Directory: Nearly 30,000 Addresses of Celebrity Homes, Film Locations and Historical Sites in the Los Angeles Area, 1900\u2013Present|publisher= McFarland|page =48|isbn=9781476604329}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe film's music score was composed by [[Cyril J. Mockridge]], but in scenes involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, Ford reprised [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s \"Ann Rutledge Theme\", from ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]''.  He told Bogdanovich that he used the theme in both films to evoke repressed desire and lost love.<ref>{{harvp|Bogdanovich|1978|pp=95\u201396}}</ref>  The film scholar Kathryn Kalinak notes that Ann Rutledge's theme \"encodes longing\" and \"fleshes out the failed love affair between Hallie and Tom Doniphon, the growing love between Hallie and Ranse Stoddard, and the traumatic loss experienced by Hallie over her choice of one over the other, none of which is clearly articulated by dialogue.\"<ref>{{harvp|Kalinak |2007|pp=96\u201398}}.</ref> Portions of the song [[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]] are played in scenes by bar musicians and a marching band.\n\nMockridge's main theme that opens the picture can also be heard, in a somewhat different form, in a trailer for ''[[River of No Return]]'' with [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] released in 1953, currently available for viewing as the trailer for ''River of No Return'' on [[Amazon.com]].\n\nThe [[Burt Bacharach]]-[[Hal David]] song \"[[(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance]]\" became a top-10 hit for [[Gene Pitney]].  Though based upon the movie's plotline, it was not used in the film.  Pitney said in an interview that he was in the studio about to record the song when \"... Bacharach informed us that the film just came out.\"  It seems unlikely that the song would be used for the opening credits since its lyrics give the film's surprise ending away.  The picture was released April 18, 1962, and the song entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week ending April 28, 1962, peaking at number four in June.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/arts/06pitney.html | title=Gene Pitney, Who Sang of 60's Teenage Pathos, Dies at 65 | first=Ben | last=Sisario | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 6, 2006 | access-date=February 23, 2017 | archive-date=June 26, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626121729/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/arts/06pitney.html | url-status=live }}</ref>  [[Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] also recorded the song, in the Gene Pitney style.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"entertaining and emotionally involving,\" but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, \"it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,\" instead of concluding with \"condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes.
