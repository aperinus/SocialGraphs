Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their daughter [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]] escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist [[Saw Gerrera]].\n\n<!-- Discuss [[Talk:Rogue One#Timeline]] before changing -->Thirteen years later, cargo pilot [[Bodhi Rook]] defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon [[Jedha]]. [[Rebel Alliance]] intelligence officer [[Cassian Andor]] learns of Rook's defection and the Death Star from an informant. Jyn is freed from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani and is brought to the Rebel leaders [[Bail Organa]] and [[Mon Mothma]], who convince her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.\n\nJyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed Imperial [[Droid (robot)|droid]] [[K-2SO]] travel to Jedha, where the Empire is removing [[kyber crystal]]s from the holy city to power the Death Star; Gerrera and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against them. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior [[Chirrut \u00cemwe]] and his mercenary friend [[Baze Malbus]], Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet [[Scarif]].\n\nOn the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city. [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet [[Eadu]], where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in Jyn's arms, before she escapes with her group on a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by [[Darth Vader]]<!-- Do not link this to Mustafar as it's a misattribution to the primary source. See [[WP:ATT]] --> to answer for the Death Star's attack on Jedha. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but Vader instead Force-chokes him and orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.\n\nJyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank. Arriving on Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs \"Rogue One,\" a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO while the other Rebels attack the [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial garrison]] as a diversion.\n\nThe Alliance learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploys their fleet in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. \u00cemwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus is killed shortly afterward. Rook is killed by a [[grenade]] after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the planetary shield to allow the transmission of the schematics. Rebel [[Admiral Raddus]] uses a Hammerhead corvette to destroy two [[Star Destroyer]]s, and the wreckage crashes atop the shield generator, deactivating the shield. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but are ambushed by Krennic, who is shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship via the base's antenna moments before the Death Star enters orbit above Scarif; Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the antenna, killing Krennic, and the impact creates an approaching blast that engulfs the base, killing Cassian, Jyn, and the remaining ground forces.\n\nThe Rebel fleet prepares to jump to [[hyperspace]], but Admiral Raddus and many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's arriving Star Destroyer. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and kills many rebel troops in an attempt to regain the schematics, but a <!-- Do not wikilink this to Tantive IV as it's an easter egg link and a misattribution to the primary source.

Headphones get hung on a convenient grab rail and not on the hanger designed for them\u2014if there even was a hanger. Apparently, designers of military vehicles in galaxies far, far, away have also never actually operated them in the field. Vehicle movement creates uncomfortable levels of dust.
