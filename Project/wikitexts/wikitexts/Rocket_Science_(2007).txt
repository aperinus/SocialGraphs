It tells the story of Hal Hefner, a fifteen-year-old stutterer who decides to join his school's debate team when he develops a crush on its star member, and addresses the themes of [[coming of age]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and finding one's voice.\n\nBlitz conceived a rough storyline for the film while making ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]'', a documentary about 1999's [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]], but an [[HBO Films]] executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence when he told her about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] and [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n''Rocket Science'' premiered on January 19, 2007 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was theatrically released on August 10. It was not a financial success, earning only [[United States dollar|US$]]756,000 from its $4.5 million budget, though it was well-received by critics. Reviewers praised Thompson, Kendrick and D'Agosto's performances and the film's parallels to real life; others believed that the film was deliberately quirky and forgettable. It was nominated for Sundance's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and three [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. Though it failed to win any of the Grand Jury Prizes at Sundance, Blitz won its Dramatic Directing Award.\n\n==Plot==\nHal Hefner is a fifteen-year-old student of [[Plainsboro, New Jersey|Plainsboro]], [[New Jersey]] with a pronounced stutter. His older brother Earl is an obsessive-compulsive kleptomaniac, his father Doyle has recently walked out on the family after a heated argument, and his mother Juliet has begun to date the father of his school friend, Heston.\n\nHal is riding the school bus home one day when he is approached by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has dropped out of high school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual [[abstinence]] in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.\n\nOn the day of the tournament, Coach Lumbly tells the debate team that Ginny has transferred to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.\n\nLater in the year, Hal's mother breaks up with Heston's father, and Hal decides to seek out Ginny and return her trophy, which he stole. She rejects his apology, and he travels to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]\u2014the \"Big City\"\u2014to find Ben, Ginny's former debate partner. Hal convinces Ben to debate with him, and they register as a home-schooled team in the upcoming Policy Debate Championships. In order to overcome his stutter, Ben helps Hal to write his entire speech to the tune of \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\". During the tournament, Hal is interrupted in the middle of his song-speech by Coach Lumbly and a Debate Official who disqualify Hal and Ben on the grounds that neither of them is home-schooled. Ben is satisfied with their efforts, but Hal finds Ginny before leaving. He insists that one day will be his day, while she tells him that it was not easy for her to betray him as he walks off, having gained a sense of confidence. He spends the evening at a nearby beach, and when his father picks him up, Hal tries to tell him that life and love \"shouldn't be rocket science\", although he is unable to say the phrase \"rocket science\" due to his stutter.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:AnnaKendrick09TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anna Kendrick]] learned debate strategies and studied with a college debate coach to prepare for the role]]\n* [[Reece Thompson]] as Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old student at Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a pronounced [[stutter]].
