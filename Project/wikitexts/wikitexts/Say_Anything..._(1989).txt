The film follows the romance between Lloyd Dobler ([[John Cusack]]), an average student, and Diane Court ([[Ione Skye]]), the class [[valedictorian]], immediately after their graduation from high school.\n\n''Say Anything...'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 14, 1989, by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received positive reviews from critics. In 2002, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Say Anything...'' as the greatest modern movie romance, and it was ranked number 11 on ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'s}} list of the 50 best high school movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/50besthsfilms.html|title=50 Best High School Movies|publisher=Filmsite.org|date=15 September 2006|access-date=17 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the end of their senior year of high school, noble [[underachiever]] Lloyd Dobler falls for [[valedictorian]] Diane Court and plans to ask her out, though they belong to different social groups.\n\nLloyd's parents are stationed in Germany for the Army, so he lives with his sister Constance, a single mother, and has no plans yet for his future. Diane comes from a sheltered academic upbringing, living with her doting divorced father Jim, who owns the retirement home where she works. She will take up a prestigious fellowship in Britain at the end of the summer.\n\nLloyd offers to take Diane to their graduation party. She agrees, to everyone's surprise. Their next \"date\" is a dinner at Diane's, where Lloyd fails to impress Jim, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] informs the latter he is under scrutiny.\n\nDiane introduces Lloyd to the retirement home residents and he teaches her to drive her [[Manual transmission|manual-transmission]] [[Ford Tempo]] graduation gift. They grow closer and become intimate, to her father's concern. Lloyd's musician best friend Corey, who has never gotten over her cheating ex-boyfriend, Joe, warns him to take care of Diane.\n\nJim urges Diane to break up with Lloyd, feeling he is not an appropriate match, and suggests she give Lloyd a pen as a parting gift. Worried about her father, Diane tells Lloyd she wants to stop seeing him and concentrate on her studies, giving him the pen. Devastated, he seeks advice from Corey, who tells him to \"be a man\". Meanwhile, Jim discovers the IRS cut off his credit when his credit cards are declined as the investigation drags on.\n\nAt dawn, Lloyd plays \"[[In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel song)|In Your Eyes]]\" by [[Peter Gabriel]], which was playing when they became intimate, on a [[boombox]], standing under her open bedroom window. The next day, Diane meets with the IRS investigator, who says they have evidence incriminating Jim with [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] funds from his retirement-home residents. He suggests she accept the fellowship as matters with her father will worsen.\n\nDiane finds the cash concealed at home and confronts Jim, who tells her he took it to give her financial independence. Jim feels justified in doing so as he provided better care of his residents than their families. Distraught, she reconciles with Lloyd at his kick-boxing gym.\n\nAt the end of summer, Jim is incarcerated on a 9-month sentence. Lloyd visits him at the prison, saying he is going with Diane to Britain; Jim reacts with anger. Lloyd gives him a letter from Diane, but she arrives to say goodbye and they embrace. She gives him the pen she gave Lloyd, asking him to write to her in Britain. Lloyd comforts Diane, who is [[fear of flying|afraid of flying]], on their flight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Lloyd Dobler\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Diane Court\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Jim Court\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Corey Flood\n* Amy Brooks as D.C.\n* [[Pamela Adlon]] as Rebecca\n* [[Jason Gould]] as Mike Cameron\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Joe\n* [[Polly Platt]] as Mrs. Flood\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Mrs. Evans\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Mark\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Vahlere\n* [[Kim Walker (actress)|Kim Walker]] as Sheila \n* [[Chynna Phillips]] as Mimi\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Constance Dobler (uncredited)\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as IRS Boss\n* [[Joanna Frank]] as Mrs. Kerwin\n* [[John Hillner]] as Court's Attorney\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Diane's teacher (uncredited)\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Diane's mother (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n[[Jennifer Connelly]] and Ione Skye vied for the role of Diane Court, but Connelly lost out to Skye.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it a \"half-baked love story, full of good intentions but uneven in the telling.\" But, the review also said the film's \"[a]ppealing tale of an undirected army brat proving himself worthy of the most exceptional girl in high school elicits a few laughs, plenty of smiles and some genuine feeling.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Variety Staff|title=Say Anything...|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794651|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 31, 1988|access-date=January 13, 2021}}</ref> In a mixed review, Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>[The film] resembles a first-rate production of a children's story. Its sense of parents and the summer after high school is myopic, presented totally from the teenagers' point of view. Yet its melodrama\u2014Will Dad go to prison? Will Diane go to England?\u2014distorts that perspective, so the film doesn't have much to offer an actual adult, not even a sense of what it's truly like to be just out of high school these days. The film is all charming performances and grace notes, but there are plenty of worse things to be.<ref>{{cite web|first=Caryn|last=James|title=Mismatched Teen-Agers Fall in Love, Of Course|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE0DB1231F937A25757C0A96F948260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 14, 1989|access-date=January 13, 2017|archive-date=January 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116182132/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE0DB1231F937A25757C0A96F948260|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10.

Crowe and producer [[James L. Brooks]] believed the scene could become a hallmark of the movie, though Crowe found it difficult to film because Cusack felt it was \"too passive\". The scene was first scored with [[Fishbone]]'s \"Question of Life\", but after viewing the scene, Crowe opted to replace it with Peter Gabriel's \"In Your Eyes\" to better fit the mood that he wished to convey. Gabriel initially turned down Crowe because he confused the film with another film in production at the time, a [[John Belushi]] biography called [[Wired (film)|''Wired'']].<ref>{{AFI film|58268}}</ref>\n\n\"That scene is like Romeo under the trellis,\" said Crowe reminiscing about the iconic scene. \"But I have this feeling when I watch it that it's filled with double emotion \u2013 both with the story and the actors, whose own trepidation bleeds in.\"\n\n==Cancelled TV series==\nA television series based on the movie was planned by [[NBC]] and [[20th Century Fox]], but producers Aaron Kaplan and Justin Adler did not know that Crowe had not approved of the project. When they found out his views, the show was dropped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2014-10-23/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/CELEBRITY_EXTRA.html|title=Celebrity Extra|last=Elavsky|first=Cindy|publisher=[[King Features]]|date=October 23, 2014|access-date=October 23, 2014|archive-date=October 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024230911/http://naples.floridaweekly.com/news/2014-10-23/Arts_%28and%29_Entertainment_News/CELEBRITY_EXTRA.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098258|Say Anything...}}\n* {{Amg movie|43033|Say Anything...}}\n* [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-say-anything25-2009oct25,0,1435053.story {{\"'}}Say Anything...' says so much\"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 25, 2009.\n\n{{Cameron Crowe}}\n{{Gracie Films}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Say Anything ...}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1989 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen romance films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Cameron Crowe]]\n[[Category:Films produced by James L.
