The directorial debut of stuntman [[Hal Needham]], the film follows Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Reed), two [[Rum-running|bootleggers]] attempting to illegally transport 400 cases of [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors beer]] from [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. While the Snowman drives the truck carrying the beer, the Bandit drives a [[Pontiac Trans Am]] to distract law enforcement (called blocking) and keep the attention off the Snowman. During their run, they are pursued by Texas county sheriff [[Buford T. Justice]] (Gleason). ''Smokey and the Bandit'' was the [[1977 in film|second highest-grossing domestic film of 1977]] in the United States. Sally Field and Burt Reynolds began a relationship after meeting on set.\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy Texan Big Enos Burdette and his son Little Enos have sponsored a racer in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]'s Southern Classic and want to celebrate in style when he wins, so they are seeking a trucker willing to [[Rum-running|bootleg]] [[Coors Beer]] to Atlanta for their refreshment. They find local legend Bo \"Bandit\" Darville at a [[roadeo]] at [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] and offer him {{US$|80000|1977|r=-3}} to haul 400 cases of Coors from Texarkana (the closest place it could be legally sold at that time) to Atlanta in 28 hours. The Bandit takes the bet on the risky and unprecedented task, and recruits his partner Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow to drive the truck, while Bandit drives a black [[Pontiac Trans Am]] bought in advance from the Burdettes as a \"blocker\" to divert attention away from the truck and its illegal cargo.\n\nThe pair arrive in Texarkana one hour early and load up the truck, but just as they head back, Carrie, a runaway bride, intercepts Bandit and jumps in his car, unwittingly making him an indirect target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice, a career Texas lawman whose witless son Junior was to have married Carrie. Buford, with Junior along, ignores his jurisdiction and doggedly chases Bandit all the way to Georgia to retrieve Carrie while various mishaps cause his cruiser to disintegrate on the way.\n\nBandit attracts more police attention across [[Dixie]] as Snowman barrels on toward Atlanta with the contraband beer, but they are helped en route by many colorful characters via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]]. Neither Buford nor any other lawmen know of Snowman's illegal manifest, while Bandit is likewise unaware that Buford is chasing him because of Carrie, whose jumpiness inspires Bandit to give her the [[Citizens band radio#1970s popularity|CB handle]] \"Frog\".\n\nJust after re-entering Georgia, Snowman is rescued by Bandit after being stopped by a [[Georgia State Patrol]] motorcycle trooper, and state and local police intensely pursue Bandit with roadblocks and a helicopter to track his movement. With four miles left, Bandit, discouraged by the unexpected mounting attention, is ready to give up, but Snowman, who initially thought they would fail, takes the lead and smashes through the roadblock at the fairgrounds' main entrance. They return ten minutes ahead of their time limit, but instead of taking the payoff, Carrie and Bandit accept a double-or-nothing offer from Little Enos: a challenge to run up to [[Boston]] and bring back [[clam chowder]] in 18 hours. They quickly escape in one of Big Enos's 13 [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillacs]] as police flood the racetrack.\n\nAfter passing Buford's badly damaged cruiser on the roadside, Bandit gets on the CB and initially directs him to the Burdettes, but then respectfully gives his real location\u2014right behind Buford, who continues his chase leaving Junior behind, and with more parts falling off his cruiser as he limps off after Bandit.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Burt Reynolds]] as Bo \"The Bandit\" Darville\n*[[Sally Field]] as Carrie \"Frog\"\n*[[Jerry Reed]] as Cledus \"The Snowman\" Snow\n*[[Jackie Gleason]] as [[Buford T.

Needham had great difficulty getting any studios or producers to take his project seriously, being better known in the film industry as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]]. He obtained the attention of studios and aimed the film at a more mainstream release after his friend Reynolds read the script and agreed to portray the Bandit, with Reed now portraying the Bandit's friend the Snowman. Reed would eventually play the Bandit in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'', in which Reynolds only appeared in a cameo near the end. At the time, Reynolds was the top box office star in the world.\n\nIn the original script, Carrie was called Kate while Big Enos and Little Enos were called Kyle and Dickey. The Bandit's car was a second-generation Trans Am and the prize for completing the run was a new truck rather than $80,000.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\">{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/80484/13-fast-facts-about-smokey-and-bandit |title=13 Fast Facts About ''Smokey and the Bandit'' |first=Roger |last=Cormier |date=May 27, 2017 |website=mentalfloss.com |access-date=December 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119053950/http://mentalfloss.com/article/80484/13-fast-facts-about-smokey-and-bandit |url-status=live}}</ref> Reynolds revealed in his autobiography that Needham had written the first draft script on legal pads. Upon showing it to his friend, Reynolds told Needham that it was the worst script he had ever read, but that he would still make the movie. Most of the dialogue was improvised on set.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\" />\n\n[[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] bankrolled ''Smokey and the Bandit'' for $5.3 million, figuring it was a good risk.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> Just two days before production was to begin, Universal sent a \"hatchet man\" to Atlanta to inform Needham that the budget was being trimmed by $1 million. With Reynolds' salary at $1 million, Needham was left with only $3.3 million to make the film. Needham and assistant director David Hamburger spent 30 hours revising the shooting schedule.<ref name=\"CNN\" />\n\n\"Buford T. Justice\" was the name of a real [[Florida Highway Patrol]]man known to Reynolds' father, who was once Police Chief of [[Riviera Beach, Florida]]. His father was also the inspiration for the word \"sumbitch\" used in the film, a variation of the phrase \"son-of-a-bitch\" that, according to Reynolds, he uttered quite often. Gleason was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. It was his idea to have Junior alongside him throughout the film. In particular, the scene where Sheriff Justice unknowingly encounters the Bandit in the \"choke and puke\" (a roadside diner) was not in the original story but was rather Gleason's idea.\n\nThe film's theme song, \"[[East Bound and Down]]\", was written virtually overnight by Reed. He gave Needham a preview of the song and, getting no reaction, offered to rewrite it. In response, Needham told Reed that he liked the song so much that if Reed changed even a word or a note, Needham would \"choke him\".<ref name=\"SatB-Movieline\">{{cite web |last1=Abrams |first1=Simon |title=Smokey and the Bandit at 35: A Case for the Genius of Hal Needham |url=http://movieline.com/2012/06/07/smokey-and-the-bandit-at-35-a-case-for-the-genius-of-hal-needham/ |website=Movieline |date=June 7, 2012 |publisher=pmc.com |access-date=April 27, 2021}}</ref> It would become one of Reed's biggest hits and his signature song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Bobby |title=Top 10 Jerry Reed Songs |url=https://theboot.com/jerry-reed-songs/ |website=The Boot |publisher=Townsquare Media, Inc |access-date=April 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film features the custom clothing and costuming of Niver Western Wear of [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref>Niver Western Wear Corporate Records</ref> Niver provided much of the western attire worn in the film, as well as the custom-made sheriff's uniforms (waist size 64\") that Gleason wore throughout the film.\n\nWhile made to take advantage of the ongoing 1970s [[Citizens band radio#1970s popularity|CB radio fad]], the film added to the craze.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUR-BAAAQBAJ&q=cb+radio+craze+smokey+and+the+bandit.&pg=PT405 |title=Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology |page=377 |first1=Joseph |last1=Straubhaar |first2=Robert |last2=LaRose |first3=Lucinda |last3=Davenport |year=2016 |edition=9th |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-305-08035-5 |access-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-date=February 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206085525/https://books.google.com/books?id=jUR-BAAAQBAJ&q=cb+radio+craze+smokey+and+the+bandit.&pg=PT405 |url-status=live}}</ref> Though the film ''[[Moonrunners]]'' (1975) is the precursor to the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (1979\u20131985), from the same creator and with many identical settings and concepts, the popularity of ''Smokey and the Bandit'' and similar films helped get the ''Dukes'' series on the air. Three actors from the main cast of ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' appear in small uncredited roles in ''Smokey and the Bandit'': [[Ben Jones (American actor and politician)|Ben Jones]], [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], and [[Sonny Shroyer]] (who played a police officer in both). In return, Reynolds portrayed [[Boss Hogg]] (originally portrayed by [[Sorrell Booke]]) in the film adaptation ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (2005). Reynolds is referenced by name in several early episodes of the series.\n\n===Casting===\nBefore Gleason was cast in the film, [[Richard Boone]] was originally considered for the role of Buford T. Justice.<ref name=\"mentalfloss.com\" /> Sally Field only accepted the part after her agent advised her that she needed a big movie role on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Reynolds actively pushed for her casting after Universal initially resisted, claiming Field was not attractive enough. Field enjoyed making the film, but remembers that virtually the entire project was improvised.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/blog/8-sally-field's-most-memorable-characters |title=Southbank Centre}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] of the film began on August 30, 1976.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/smokey/poster.htm |title=Smokey & the Bandit poster |access-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726233500/http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/smokey/poster.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The movie was primarily filmed in Georgia, in the cities of [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough]], [[Jonesboro, Georgia|Jonesboro]], and [[Lithonia, Georgia|Lithonia]]. The scenes set in Texarkana were filmed in Jonesboro and the surrounding area and many of the chase scenes were filmed in the surrounding areas on Highway 54 between [[Fayetteville, Georgia|Fayetteville]] and Jonesboro for a majority of the driving scenes, Mundy's Mill Road, Main Street in Jonesboro, [[Georgia State Route 400]], I-85 (Pleasant Hill exit) and in McDonough. However, the scene where they drive through the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] gas station was filmed in [[Ojai, California]], on the corner of Ojai Avenue and El Paseo Road. Much of the surrounding scene comes from that immediate vicinity. The scene featuring the racetrack was filmed at [[Lakewood Speedway]] at the old [[Lakewood Fairgrounds]] on Atlanta's south side. The [[roller coaster]] in the movie was the Greyhound. It had not been used for some time and was repainted for the film. It was destroyed in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' and in a flashback scene in ''Part 3''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greyhound \u2013 Lakewood Park (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) |url=http://rcdb.com/1965.htm |publisher=Roller Coaster DataBase |access-date=March 21, 2013 |archive-date=March 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317110927/http://rcdb.com/1965.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The area around [[Helen, Georgia]], was used for some locations. The scene where Sheriff Justice's car has the door knocked off by a passing semi-truck was shot on Georgia State Route 75, {{convert|3|miles|km}} north of Helen.

The new Hot Pants scene had to quickly be refilmed as a part of a [[second unit]] in the San Fernando Valley and was shot at a drive-in restaurant near [[Hansen Dam]] named Baby Beef Burgers, which has since been demolished. This same restaurant was used for a scene in the 1983 Stephen King Movie [[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]], which was ultimately cut in the final film (it can be viewed as a deleted scene on the DVD release of the film).\n\n===Vehicles===\n{{multiple image\n|total_width = 450\n|image1 = Pontiac transam 78 modelcar 04.jpg \n|image2 = Pontiac transam 78 modelcar 01.jpg \n|footer = [[Scale model]] cars of the Pontiac Trans Am used in the film, by [[Johnny Lightning.]]\n}}\nNeedham saw an advertisement for the soon-to-be-released 1977 [[Pontiac Firebird|Pontiac Trans Am]] and knew right away that would be the Bandit's car, or, as Needham referred to it, a character in the movie. He contacted Pontiac and an agreement was made that four 1977 Trans Ams and two [[Pontiac LeMans]] four-door sedans would be provided for the movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pontiacsonline.com/JIM%20WANGERS.htm |title=An Interview With Jim Wangers: Pontiac and the 1970's |first=John |last=Chung |website=PontiacsOnline.com |access-date=December 27, 2018 |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809150816/http://www.pontiacsonline.com/JIM%20WANGERS.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The Trans Ams were actually 1976-model cars with 1977 front ends (from 1970 to 1976, both the Firebird/Trans Am and [[Chevrolet Camaro]] have two round headlights and in 1977, the Firebird/Trans Am was changed to four rectangular headlights, and the Camaro remained unchanged). The decals were changed to 1977-style units, as evidenced by the engine size callouts on the hood scoop being in liters rather than cubic inches, as had been the case in 1976. The hood scoop on these cars says \"6.6 LITRE\", which, in 1977, would have denoted an [[Oldsmobile]] 403-equipped car or a non-W-72, 180 hp version of the 400 Pontiac engine.\n\nThe cars were 1976 models, the engines fitted to them were 455ci powerplants, the last year these engines were offered for sale before withdrawal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iconicpremier.world/smokey-and-the-bandit-trans-am-collectors/ |title=Trans Am \u2013 ICONIC PREMIER |access-date=October 19, 2020 |archive-date=February 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206091340/http://www.iconicpremier.world/smokey-and-the-bandit-trans-am-collectors/ |url-status=live}}</ref> All four of the cars were badly damaged during production,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2011/02/09/how-smokey-and-the-bandit-was-born/ |title=How ''Smokey and the Bandit'' was born |first1=Scott |last1=Olster |first2=Hal |last2=Needham |work=Fortune |date=February 9, 2011 |access-date=December 27, 2018 |archive-date=October 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027121433/http://fortune.com/2011/02/09/how-smokey-and-the-bandit-was-born/ |url-status=live}}</ref> one of which was all but destroyed during the jump over the dismantled Mulberry bridge. The Trans Am used for said jump was equipped with a booster rocket, the same type that was used by [[Evel Knievel]] during his failed [[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]] jump. Needham served as the driver for the stunt (in place of Reynolds), while Lada St. Edmund was in the same car (in place of Field). By the film's ending, the final surviving Trans Am and LeMans were both barely running and the other cars had become parts donors to keep them running. This gives rise to various continuity errors with Justice's patrol car, which during some chase sequences is shown with a black rear fender, which then reverts to the car's bronze color again in later scenes. When it is finally torn off along with the car's roof in the impact with the girder, the missing fender still reappears later on in the film. The Burdettes' car is a 1974 [[Cadillac Eldorado]] convertible painted in a \"Candy Red\" color scheme and is seen briefly at the beginning of the movie and in the final scene as the Bandit, the Snowman, Fred the dog, and Frog use it to make their escape. Three [[Kenworth W900]]A short-frame semi trucks, driven by Reed, were each equipped with 38-inch sleepers. Two units were 1974 models, as evidenced by standard silver Kenworth emblems on the truck grille, and one unit was a 1973 model, as evidenced by the gold-painted Kenworth emblem on the truck's grille, signifying Kenworth's 50 years in business. The paint code for each truck was coffee brown with gold trims and the {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} mural trailer used was manufactured by Hobbs Trailers in Texas with a non-operational Thermo King Refrigeration unit. This is obvious, because there is no fuel tank on the underside of the trailer to power the refrigeration unit, and the unit is never heard running.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic%3D1459.0 |title=BIZARRE QUESTION |access-date=September 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016064743/http://hankstruckpictures.com/forum01/index.php?topic=1459.0 |archive-date=October 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Legal status of Coors beer===\nIn 1977, Coors was unavailable for sale east of [[Oklahoma]].

Because of the popularity of the film and the sales success of the Trans Am, the president of Pontiac Alex Mair promised to supply Reynolds with a Trans Am each year. Due to his financial difficulties in 2014, Reynolds put his vast collection of artwork and memorabilia up for auction, including the Trans Am. High estimates for the car were up to $80,000, but the actual sale price was $450,000.

Though no authoritative source identifies the composition of the sandwich, there are several possibilities.

Other sources in East Texas (from whence Sheriff Justice hails) are familiar with the popular regional delicacy known as the Diablo Sandwich. It consists of any of the various [[Louisiana]]-style hot sauces on [[Texas toast]]-style bread alongside the fourth most famous product of [[Pittsburg, Texas]] (behind [[Pilgrim's Pride]], Cavender's, and [[Carroll Shelby]]){{mdash}}Pittsburg Hot Links.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadfood.com/Forums/Diablo-Sandwich-quotDiablo-amp-Docquot-From-Smokey-amp-the-Bandit-Identified-m778897.aspx |title=Diablo Sandwich / \"Diablo & Doc\" From Smokey & the Bandit, Identified! |publisher=[[Roadfood.com]] |access-date=March 1, 2016 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194001/http://www.roadfood.com/Forums/Diablo-Sandwich-quotDiablo-amp-Docquot-From-Smokey-amp-the-Bandit-Identified-m778897.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===The Bandit Run===\nThe first run in 2007 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the movie, [[The Bandit Run]] was the brainchild of Dave Hall, owner of Restore A Muscle Car. A group of Trans Am owners and fans of the movie take part in an annual road trip from Texarkana to Jonesboro, recreating the route taken by the characters in the film. The Bandit Run quickly became a fixture, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the movie with a special 2017 screening of the film attended by Reynolds and a recreation of the jump undertaken by the Bandit and Frog across a river.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thebanditrun.com/ |title=The Bandit Run \u2013 Brought to you by Restore A Muscle Car |website=The Bandit Run |access-date=June 25, 2017 |archive-date=June 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624024611/http://thebanditrun.com/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Mobil 1 commercial===\nIn 2014, petroleum company [[Mobil 1]] produced television commercials, featuring then-[[NASCAR]] driver [[Tony Stewart]], closely based on the film. Called ''Smoke is the Bandit'' and playing on Stewart's nickname, the commercials featured him as the Bandit opposite commentators [[Darrell Waltrip]] as the Snowman and [[Jeff Hammond (NASCAR)|Jeff Hammond]] as Buford T. Justice. The story replaced the Coors beer with Mobil 1 products. The advertisements lampoon the film and feature a Pontiac Trans Am and a cover version of the song ''East Bound and Down''. The commercials were produced after Stewart mentioned that the movie was one of his favorites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/6/tony-stewart-bandit-commercial-mobil-1-ad.html |title=Stewart plays off 'Smokey and the Bandit in Mobil 1 ad |access-date=April 6, 2017 |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054208/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/6/tony-stewart-bandit-commercial-mobil-1-ad.html |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Television censorship and alternative versions==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nWhen ''Smokey and the Bandit'' first aired on American network television in the early 1980s, [[Censorship|censors]] were faced with the challenge of toning down the raw language of the original film. For this purpose, they overdubbed dialogue deemed offensive, which was common practice. The most noted change made for network broadcast was the replacing of Buford's often-spoken phrase \"sumbitch\" (a contraction of \"son of a bitch\"; usually in reference to the Bandit) with the phrase \"scum bum\". This phrase achieved a level of popularity with children and the 2007 ''[[Hot Wheels]]'' release of the 1970s Firebird Trans Am has \"scum bum\" emblazoned on its tail.\n\nExcept for Gleason, the original actors mostly redubbed their lines for the television version. Actor [[Henry Corden]], who voiced [[Fred Flintstone]] after original performer [[Alan Reed]] died the same year the film was released, was used to replace a considerable amount of Sheriff Justice's dialogue. In the U.K., the heavily dubbed version was shown for several years, particularly by the [[BBC]]. However, in more recent years, the original version has been shown (on [[ITV Network|ITV]], a commercial channel), usually with the stronger language edited out, often quite awkwardly. The theatrical release has a few lines deleted, including an edit in which Sheriff Justice tells a state trooper to \"[[fuck]] off\" after the sheriff called his vehicle \"a piece of crap\". His expletive is obscured when a passing [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]] sounds its horn. At the time, using \"fuck\" would immediately require an [[Motion picture rating system|R rating]] and this self-censorship allowed the film to avoid this rating and reach a much larger audience. However, the scene and the obscured expletive were played for comedy value and written as such, with the passing truck being the gag of the scene more than a way to avoid the censors.\n\nIn 2006, a DVD re-release was issued of ''Smokey and the Bandit'' featuring a digitally remastered audio track with 5.1 Dolby-compatible surround sound. Many of the film's original sounds were replaced. For instance, the diesel engine start and run-up sequence in the opening sequence of the film were completely dubbed over with a new sound. A few other examples of sound effect replacement occur when the Bandit takes off after getting the reluctant Cledus involved in the bet, the Bandit comes to a screeching halt on a roadway moments before picking up Carrie, and when Buford's car top comes off. Some of the original sound effects (such as Cledus's dog Fred barking) and music (such as the final chase to the Southern Classic) were removed and not replaced. Earlier DVD releases and the 40th Anniversary Blu-ray of the film have the original soundtrack intact.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/smokey-and-the-bandit-40th-brd |title=Smokey and the Bandit: 40th Anniversary Edition |last=Salmons |first=Tim |date=May 29, 2017 |work=The Digital Bits |access-date=November 12, 2017 |language=en-GB |archive-date=November 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111132707/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/smokey-and-the-bandit-40th-brd |url-status=live}}</ref> Major portions of the audio background have been modified with different engine sounds or tire squeals from the original film. The updated version of the film features sound inaccurate for what would be produced by the Trans Am or the numerous other Pontiac vehicles in the film. The original film had correct sounds that were usually recorded live as the action took place.\n\n==Sequels==\nThe film was followed by two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' (1983). The second film was a modest box office success, earning $66.1 million against a $17 million budget.\n\nThe third film \u2013 which had no involvement from either Hal Needham or Sally Field and contained only a short cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds \u2013 revolved entirely around Jackie Gleason's character, was panned by critics, and was a [[box office bomb]], earning only $7 million against a $9 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=smokeyandthebandit2.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |title=Smokey and the Bandit II, Box Office Information |access-date=August 25, 2012 |archive-date=July 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721175259/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=smokeyandthebandit2.htm |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Unstoppables |publisher=New York, New York: Sussex Publishers, LLC |author=Spy |author-link=Spy (magazine) |journal=Spy: The New York Monthly |date=Nov 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJly6nVC7qkC&q=An+Officer+and+a+Gentleman+1982+budget&pg=PA92 |issn=0890-1759 |page=92 |access-date=October 20, 2020 |archive-date=February 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210206085526/https://books.google.com/books?id=KJly6nVC7qkC&q=An+Officer+and+a+Gentleman+1982+budget&pg=PA92 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1983/0SNB3.php Box Office Information for ''Smokey and the Bandit Part 3''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921130005/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1983/0SNB3.php |date=September 21, 2013 }} The Numbers.
