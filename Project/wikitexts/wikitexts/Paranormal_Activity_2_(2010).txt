The only thing stolen is a necklace that Kristi's sister, Katie, gave to her. Martine, the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] family housekeeper and nanny, senses \"[[unclean spirit|evil spirits]]\" in the house and burns [[Salvia officinalis|sage]] to rid the house of them, and Daniel fires her for doing so. Kristi also believes that their home is haunted, and she and Katie talk about being tormented by a [[demon]] [[Paranormal Activity 3|when they were children]]. Daniel, however, initially dismisses her claim despite footage of strange occurrences around the house. Daniel's daughter from a prior marriage, Ali ([[Molly Ephraim]]), begins investigating the mysterious happenings; she discovers that humans can make deals with demons for wealth or power by forfeiting the soul of their first-born son, but if the deal is not fulfilled, the demon will stick to the family until another son is born\u2014Hunter was the first male to be born on Kristi's side since the 1930s.\n \nThe violence escalates, as the family's [[German shepherd]], Abby, is attacked by the demon and apparently suffers from a [[seizure]]. As Daniel and Ali take Abby to the [[veterinarian]], Kristi is attacked and dragged into the basement by the demon, possessing her. The following day, Ali is left home with Kristi, unaware she is possessed. Soon, Ali hears a scratch sound in the basement door and opens it to find scratches and sees a word, ''meus'' ([[Latin]] for \"Mine\"), etched into it. A strange bite mark on her leg and the footage of Kristi\u2019s attack motivates Daniel to re-hire Martine, who prepares a cross to [[Exorcism|exorcise]] the demon; Kristi will have no memory of having been possessed. Daniel goes to pass the demon onto Katie so that Kristi and Hunter will be saved, despite Ali's pleas not to.\n\nThat night, when Daniel tries to use the cross on Kristi, she attacks him and the houselights all go out. Using the handheld camera's [[night vision]], he walks around the shaking house into the basement where he is attacked by Kristi; he retaliates against her with the cross, causing her to collapse. Daniel puts Kristi to bed and burns a photo of a young Katie, passing the demon onto her. Three weeks later, Katie visits and explains that strange things have begun happening at her house. On October 9, the night after [[Paranormal Activity|Micah is killed]], a possessed and bloodstained Katie breaks into the Rey house, kills Daniel and Kristi and then takes Hunter with her. Ali comes home from a school trip to find the corpses, and Katie and Hunter's whereabouts remain unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Sprague Grayden]] as Kristi Rey\n* Brian Boland as Daniel Rey, Kristi's husband\n* [[Molly Ephraim]] as Ali Rey, Dan's daughter\n* [[Katie Featherston]] as Katie, Kristi's older sister \n* [[Micah Sloat]] as Micah \n* Seth Ginsberg as Brad, boyfriend of Ali\n* Vivis Cortez as Martine, the nanny / housekeeper\n* Jackson Xenia Prieto and William Juan Prieto as Hunter Rey, Dan and Kristi's infant son\n\n==Production==\n[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] hired screenwriter [[Michael R.
