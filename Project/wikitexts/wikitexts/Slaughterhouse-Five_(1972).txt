I drool and cackle every time I watch that film, because it is so harmonious with what I felt when I wrote the book.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43796292|title=Meditations on the Philosophy of Tralfamadore: Kurt Vonnegut and George Roy Hill|journal= Literature/Film Quarterly|first=Peter F.|last=Parshall|year=1987|volume=15|issue=1|pages=49\u201359|jstor=43796292|access-date=November 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{hatnote|The film is presented in a [[nonlinear narrative]]. The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\nIn [[Ilium (Kurt Vonnegut)|Ilium, New York]], the middle-aged Billy Pilgrim writes a letter to the editor claiming to have become \"unstuck in time\"; he finds himself as a young man behind enemy lines in Belgium during [[World War II]], where he and a number of other American troops are captured by the Germans. A fellow [[prisoner of war]], Paul Lazzaro, develops a grudge against Billy and vows to kill him; at a camp, Lazzaro attacks Billy but is intercepted by an older POW, Edgar Derby. Billy and Edgar develop a friendship. The Americans are set to be transferred to [[Dresden]] for the duration of the war and are asked to elect a leader. When Lazzaro nominates himself, Billy nominates Edgar for the role, and Edgar is acclaimed after Lazzaro steps down. In Dresden, the POWs are placed in a [[slaughterhouse]], Slaughterhouse-Five. During dinner, sirens sound off and the POWs head to shelter; the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]] commences, during which Billy believes 100,000 perish. The POWs emerge and the Germans have them sort through the ruins for survivors, warning looting will be punished. When Edgar discovers a dancing figurine, he pockets it, and is executed by a Nazi firing squad.\n\nAfter the war, Billy marries the wealthy Valencia, whose father owns an optometry school, and Billy goes into the field. They have two children, Robert and Barbara. Robert becomes a troubled adolescent, at one point caught by the police vandalizing a Catholic cemetery. Billy bribes the police. The family also treats Valencia to a [[Cadillac]]. Billy and his father-in-law Lionel Merble board a private jet for an optometry convention. When Billy looks out the window and sees men in ski masks, he has a premonition the plane will crash en route, which it does. Lionel is killed but Billy is found alive and taken to hospital. On her way to the hospital, a distressed Valencia has multiple accidents and the Cadillac's exhaust is destroyed, causing her to die of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\n\nBilly is released from the hospital and opts to live alone, over the objections of Barbara. Robert has reformed and enlisted for the [[Vietnam War]]. While alone, Billy is [[alien abduction|abducted]] to the alien planet of [[Tralfamadore]], along with film actress Montana Wildhack. The Tralfamadorians live in the \"[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]\" and teach Billy the universe is made up of random moments strung together; when one dies, they go back to another point in their life, and it is up to them to focus on good moments and ignore the bad. The Tralfamadorians hope Billy and Montana will mate. Billy and Montana fall in love and have a child, whom Montana names Billy Jr. On Earth, Billy argues with Barbara about the existence of Tralfamadore; Billy, being able to travel into the future as well as the past, shares a vision of his death, in which he is shot by an elderly Lazzaro while giving a speech about Tralfamadore.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Michael Sacks]] as Billy Pilgrim\n*[[Ron Leibman]] as Paul Lazzaro\n*[[Eugene Roche]] as Edgar Derby\n*[[Sharon Gans]] as Valencia Merble Pilgrim\n*[[Valerie Perrine]] as Montana Wildhack\n*[[Holly Near]] as Barbara Pilgrim\n*[[Perry King]] as Robert Pilgrim\n*[[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Roland Weary\n*[[Friedrich von Ledebur]] as German Leader\n*[[Ekkehardt Belle]] as Young German Guard\n*[[Sorrell Booke]] as Lionel Merble\n*[[Roberts Blossom]] as Wild Bob Cody\n*[[John Dehner]] as Professor Rumfoord\n*Gary Waynesmith as Stanley\n*[[Richard Schaal]] as Howard W.

The film used such a small amount of music that the soundtrack album added atmospheric excerpts from [[Douglas Leedy|Douglas Leedy's]] synthesized triple album ''Entropical Paradise''.\n\nThe prolonged rendition of the final movement of Bach's fourth [[Brandenburg concerto]] accompanies a cinematic montage as the main character first encounters the city of Dresden.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film won the ''[[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Prix du Jury]]'' at the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2342/year/1972.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Slaughterhouse-Five |access-date=2009-04-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> as well as a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Award]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Saturn Award]].
