Russell]]<ref name=\"Joy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2065086/Joy/|title=Joy|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref> and starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Joy Mangano]], a self-made millionaire who created her own business empire.\n\n''Joy'' received a theatrical release on December 25, 2015, distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Lawrence's performance but criticized the writing and pace of the film. Lawrence received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. ''Joy'' was also nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1990, [[Joy Mangano]], an airline booking agent residing in [[Peconic, New York|Peconic]], [[New York (state)|New York]], struggles financially while juggling a complicated family life. Living with Joy and her two children are her single mother, Terri, who spends all day in bed watching [[soap operas]], her maternal grandmother, Mimi, and her under-employed ex-husband, Tony, a wannabe singer who sleeps in the basement. Her [[overachievement|overachieving]] paternal half-sister, Peggy, constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children for her failed marriage. Joy's father, Rudy, further complicates matters when he also moves into the basement after his third divorce.\n\nMimi and Joy's best friend, Jackie, encourage Joy to pursue her inventing ambitions. Frustrated when using a conventional mop, Joy designs and builds an innovative [[Joy Mangano#Miracle Mop|self-wringing]] type. Trudy, a wealthy Italian widow Rudy is dating, agrees to invest in Joy's product. They contract with a [[California]] company to manufacture the mop's parts at a low price. To avoid a potential patent lawsuit, the company advises Joy to pay $50,000 in royalties to a man in [[Hong Kong]] who has a similar product. When the manufacturer repeatedly bills Joy to remake their faulty parts, Joy refuses to pay.\n\nJoy meets [[QVC]] executive Neil Walker who agrees to sell her mops on TV. To manufacture 50,000 additional units, Joy takes out a second home mortgage. When the first TV attempt fails after the celebrity pitchman improperly demonstrates the product, Joy demands she be allowed to do a second infomercial. The mop sells out, earning thousands of dollars; Joy's success is soon tempered by Mimi's sudden death.\n\nJoy's fledgling business is financially jeopardized after Peggy pays the manufacturer's excessive overcharges without Joy's approval. The manufacturer refuses to refund the money, and a contract loophole allows them to fraudulently patent Joy's mop design as their own. Shortly after filing for [[bankruptcy]], Joy discovers there never was a similar product in Hong Kong, and the manufacturer has defrauded her. She confronts owner Derek Markham, forcing him to refund the overcharges, pay damages, and relinquish any claim to her patent or else face criminal charges.\n\nJoy becomes a successful independent businesswoman who sponsors other inventors. Jackie and Tony are her most valued advisers. Joy supports her aging father, despite his and Peggy's unsuccessful lawsuit for ownership of her company. Only Terri is independent, having found stability with Toussaint, a [[Haiti]]an plumber Joy once hired. As Neil predicted, he and Joy became \"adversaries in commerce\" with her move to HSN, but they remain personal friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Joy Mangano]],<ref name=\"RussellLawrence\" /> the inventor of the Miracle Mop\n**[[Isabella Crovetti|Isabella Crovetti-Cramp]] as young Joy Mangano<ref name=\"CrampCast\" />\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Rudy Mangano, Joy's father<ref name=\"DeNiroCast\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Neil Walker, an executive at [[QVC]]<ref name=\"CooperCast\" />\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Tony Miranne, Joy's ex-husband<ref name=\"RamirezCast\" />\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Mimi, Joy's grandmother<ref name=\"ThreeMoreCast\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/joy-trailer-breakdown|title=Joy character breakdown|access-date=July 28, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Terri Mangano, Joy's mother<ref name=\"ThreeMoreCast\" />\n* [[Dascha Polanco]] as Jackie, Joy's best friend<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/dascha-polanco-joy-movie-orange-is-the-new-black-1201386520/ |title='Orange Is The New Black's Dascha Polanco Joins Jennifer Lawrence In 'Joy' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=March 5, 2015 |access-date=March 5, 2015 }}</ref>\n** Emily Nunez as young Jackie\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Peggy Mangano, Joy's paternal half-sister<ref name=\"RohmCast\" />\n** [[Madison Wolfe]] as young Peggy Mangano\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Trudy, Rudy's girlfriend<ref name=\"ThreeMoreCast\" />\n* [[Melissa Rivers]] as [[Joan Rivers]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/melissa-rivers-joan-rivers-joy-exclusive |title='First Look!
