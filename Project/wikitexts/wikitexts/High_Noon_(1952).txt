The happy couple will soon depart for a new life to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive on the [[noon]] train.  Miller's gang\u2014his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce\u2014await his arrival at the train station.\n\n[[File:High Noon1.JPG|thumb|left|Will Kane and Amy Fowler argue in the Marshal's office]]\n\nFor Amy, a devout [[Quaker]] and [[Pacifism|pacifist]], the solution is simple\u2014leave town before Miller arrives\u2014but Kane's sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him.\n\nKane visits a series of old friends and allies, but none can or will help: Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees on horseback, and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane's young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and \"puts the word in\" for him. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at Ram\u00edrez's Saloon, and then the church, are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation entirely. Some are Miller's friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others are of the opinion that their tax money goes to support local law enforcement and the fight is not a posse's responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, sending his wife Mildred to the door to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. Kane tells him he will call him and gives him money for a drink. The mayor encourages Kane to just leave town. Martin Howe, Kane's predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. A final offer of aid comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires the boy's courage, but refuses his help.\n\nWhile waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy meets Helen Ram\u00edrez, who was once Miller's lover, then Kane's, then Pell's. Helen, who is leaving as well, tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need.\n\nAt the stables, Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking his former deputy senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. The clock ticks toward noon.\n\nKane then goes into the street to face Miller and his gang alone. Amy and Ramirez ride by on a wagon with their luggage, bound for the train station. The perspective elevates and expands, showing Kane standing alone on a deserted street. The gunfight begins. As the train is about to depart, Amy hears the gunfire, leaps off, and runs back to town. Kane guns down Ben Miller and Colby, but is wounded as Miller attempts to burn Kane out of a barn. Choosing her husband's life over her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell's pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller's face, he pushes her to the ground, and Kane shoots him dead.\n\nKane helps his bride to her feet and they embrace. As the townspeople cluster around him, Kane throws his marshal's star in the dirt and departs with Amy on their wagon.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gary Cooper in High Noon 1952.JPG|thumb|Gary Cooper as Marshal Will Kane]]\n[[File:GraceKellyHighNoonTrailerScreenshot1952.jpg|thumb|Grace Kelly as Amy Fowler Kane]]\n[[File:Katy Jurado in High Noon.png|thumb|upright|Katy Jurado as Helen Ram\u00edrez]]\n\n===Main cast===\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Marshal [[Will Kane]]\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Mayor Jonas Henderson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Deputy Marshal Harvey Pell\n* [[Katy Jurado]] as Helen Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Amy Fowler Kane\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Judge Percy Mettrick\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as Martin Howe, the former marshal\n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Sam Fuller\n* [[Ian MacDonald (actor)|Ian MacDonald]] as Frank Miller\n* [[Eve McVeagh]] as Mildred Fuller\n* [[Morgan Farley]] as Dr. Mahin, minister\n* [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Cooper\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Jack Colby\n* [[Robert J.

In 1951, during production of the film, [[Carl Foreman]] was summoned before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) during its investigation of \"Communist propaganda and influence\" in the motion picture industry. Foreman had once been a member of the [[Communist party]], but he declined to identify fellow members or anyone he suspected of current membership. As a result, he was labeled an \"uncooperative witness\" by the committee, making him vulnerable to [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=\"Byman\">{{cite book |title=Showdown at High Noon: Witch-hunts, Critics, and the End of the Western |author=Byman, Jeremy |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8108-4998-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIp2PfC1Mm4C}}</ref> After his refusal to name names was made public, Foreman's production partner [[Stanley Kramer]] demanded an immediate dissolution of their partnership. As a signatory to the production loan, Foreman remained with the ''High Noon'' project; but before the film's release, he sold his partnership share to Kramer and moved to Britain, knowing that he would not find further work in the United States.<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nKramer later asserted that he ended their partnership because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman said that Kramer feared damage to his own career due to \"guilt by association\". Foreman was indeed blacklisted by the Hollywood studios due to the \"uncooperative witness\" label and additional pressure from [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]], [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|MPA]] president [[John Wayne]], and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]].<ref name=\"Byman\" />\n\nAccording to ''Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman Documents''\u2014a 2002 documentary based in part on a lengthy 1952 letter from Foreman to film critic [[Bosley Crowther]]\u2014Foreman's role in the creation and production of ''High Noon'' has been unfairly downplayed over the years in favor of Kramer's. Foreman told Crowther that the film originated from a four-page plot outline he wrote that turned out to be very similar to a short story by [[John W. Cunningham]] called \"The Tin Star.\" Foreman purchased the film rights to Cunningham's story and wrote the screenplay. By the time the documentary aired, most of the principals were dead, including Kramer, Foreman, Zinnemann, and Cooper. [[Victor Navasky]], author of ''Naming Names'', a definitive account of the Hollywood blacklist, told a reporter that, based on his interviews with Kramer's widow and others, the documentary seemed \"one-sided, and the problem is it makes a villain out of Stanley Kramer, when it was more complicated than that\".<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|title='High Noon,' High Dudgeon|author=Weinraub, Bernard|work=The New York Times|date=April 18, 2002|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/18/movies/high-noon-high-dudgeon.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Fleischer]] later claimed he helped Carl Foreman develop the story of ''High Noon'' over the course of eight weeks while driving to and from the set of ''[[The Clay Pigeon]]'' (1949) which they were making together.

St. Joseph's Church in [[Tuolumne City, California|Tuolumne City]] was used for exterior shots of the Hadleyville church.  The railroad was the old [[Sierra Railroad]] in [[Jamestown, California|Jamestown]], a few miles south of Columbia, now known as [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]], and often nicknamed \"the movie railroad\" due to its frequent use in films and television shows. The railroad station was built for the film alongside a water tower at Warnerville, about 15 miles to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com//movies/h/High-Noon.php |website=Movie-Locations.com|title=High Noon}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Jensen | first =Larry | authorlink = | title =Hollywood's Railroads: Sierra Railroad | publisher =Cochetopa Press | series = | volume = Two| edition = | date =2018 | location =Sequim, Washington | pages =30 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RNswEACAAJ&q=Hollywood%27s+Railroads | doi = | id = | isbn =9780692064726 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref>\n\nCooper was reluctant to film the fight scene with Bridges due to ongoing problems with his back, but eventually did so without the use of a stunt double.

Polish political poster featuring [[Gary Cooper]] to encourage votes for the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] party in the [[Contract Sejm|1989 elections]].]]\n\n''High Noon'' is considered an early example of the [[revisionist Western]]. [[Kim Newman]] calls it the \"most influential Western of the 1950s (because) its attitudes subtly changed the societal vision of the whole (Western) genre\".{{sfn|Newman|1990|p=148}} The traditional format of the Western is of a strong male character leading the civilised against the uncivilised but, in this film, the civilised people fail (in a way described by John Wayne as \"un-American\") to support their town marshal. Newman draws the contrast between the \"eerily neat and civilised\" town of Hadleyville and the \"gutlessness, self-interest and lack of backbone exhibited by its inhabitants\" who will allow the town to \"slip back into the savage past\" from which Kane and his deputies once saved it.{{sfn|Newman|1990|pp=146\u2013147}} In his article, ''The Women of \"High Noon\": A Revisionist View'', Don Graham argues that in addition to the man-alone theme, ''High Noon'' \"represents a notable advance in the portrayal of women in Westerns\".{{sfn|Graham|1980|p=244}} Compared with the \"hackneyed presentation\" of stereotypical women characters in earlier Westerns, ''High Noon'' grants the characters of Amy and Helen an expanded presence, the two being counterpoints.{{sfn|Graham|1980|p=245}} While Helen is socially inferior, she holds considerable economic power in the community.{{sfn|Graham|1980|p=246}} Helen's encounter with Amy is key because she tells Amy that she would never leave Kane if he were her man \u2013 she would get a gun and fight, thus predicating Amy's actions.{{sfn|Graham|1980|p=247}} For most of the film, Amy is the \"Eastern-virgin archetype\" but her reaction to the first gunshot \"transcends the limitations of her genre role\" as she returns to town and kills Pierce.{{sfn|Graham|1980|pp=247\u2013248}} The gang's actions indicate the implicit but very real threat they pose to women; as is suggested by the Mexican woman crossing herself when the first three ride into town. Graham summarises the many references to women as a community demoralised by the failure of its male members, other than Kane.{{sfn|Graham|1980|pp=249\u2013250}} The women, he asserts, equal Kane in strength of character to the extent that they are \"protofeminists\".{{sfn|Graham|1980|p=250}}\n\nIn 1989, 22-year-old Polish graphic designer Tomasz Sarnecki transformed Marian Stachurski's 1959 Polish variant of the ''High Noon'' poster into a [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] election poster for the [[Contract Sejm|first partially free elections]] in [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]]. The poster, which was displayed all over Poland, shows Cooper armed with a folded ballot saying \"Wybory\" (i.e., elections) in his right hand while the [[Solidarity logo]] is pinned to his vest above the sheriff's badge. The message at the bottom of the poster reads: \"W samo po\u0142udnie: 4 czerwca 1989\", which translates to \"High Noon: 4 June 1989.\"\n\nAs former Solidarity leader [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] wrote, in 2004,\n\n{{blockquote|Under the headline \"At High Noon\" runs the red Solidarity banner and the date\u2014June 4, 1989\u2014of the poll. It was a simple but effective gimmick that, at the time, was misunderstood by the Communists. They, in fact, tried to ridicule the freedom movement in Poland as an invention of the \"Wild\" West, especially the U.S. But the poster had the opposite impact: Cowboys in Western clothes had become a powerful symbol for Poles. Cowboys fight for justice, fight against evil, and fight for freedom, both physical and spiritual. Solidarity trounced the Communists in that election, paving the way for a democratic government in Poland. It is always so touching when people bring this poster up to me to autograph it. They have cherished it for so many years and it has become the emblem of the battle that we all fought together.<ref>Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040714082335/http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110005204 \"Remembering Reagan: In Solidarity\"], Editorial, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 11 June 2004, accessed 6 April 2022.</ref>}}\n\nThe 1981 science fiction film ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] as a federal agent on an interplanetary mining outpost, has been compared to ''High Noon'' due to similarities in themes and plot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=G.|title=Unlikely 'Outland'|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 23, 1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Blowen|first=M.|title=Outland is Western out of this world|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=May 22, 1981}}</ref>\n\n''High Noon'' is referenced several times on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. [[Tony Soprano]] cites Gary Cooper's character as the archetype of what a man should be, mentally tough and stoic. He frequently laments, \"Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?\" and refers to Will Kane as the \"strong, silent type\". The iconic ending to the film is shown on a television during an extended dream sequence in the fifth-season episode \"[[The Test Dream]]\".<ref>''The Sopranos'', Season 5.  HBO Studios DVD (2008). ASIN B0007YMVWO.</ref>\n\n''High Noon'' inspired the 2008 hip-hop song of the same name by rap artist [[Kinetics (rapper)|Kinetics]], in which ''High Noon'' is mentioned along with several other classic Western films, drawing comparisons between rap battles and Western-film street showdowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Kinetics-high-noon-official-lyrics|title=Rap Genius: Lyrics and Explanations for the Kinetics song \"High Noon\"}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels and remakes==\n* A television sequel, ''[[High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane]]'', was produced in 1980, and aired on [[CBS]] in November of that year.  [[Lee Majors]] and [[Katherine Cannon]] played the Cooper and Kelly roles. [[Elmore Leonard]] wrote the original screenplay.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/High-Noon-Part-II-Return/dp/B01EIRLSJ2 ''High Noon Part II''], MGM Studios, Inc, retrieved September 11, 2016.</ref>\n*''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' is a 1981 British science fiction thriller film written and directed by Peter Hyams and starring Sean Connery, Peter Boyle, and Frances Sternhagen that was inspired by ''High Noon''.\n* In 2000, Stanley Kramer's widow [[Karen Sharpe|Karen Sharpe Kramer]] produced [[High Noon (2000 film)|a remake of ''High Noon'']] as a TV movie for the cable channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].
