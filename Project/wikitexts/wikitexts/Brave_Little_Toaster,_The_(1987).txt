Day, [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Timothy Stack|Tim Stack]], and [[Thurl Ravenscroft]], with [[Wayne Kaatz]], Colette Savage, [[Phil Hartman]], [[Joe Ranft]], and Jim Jackman in supporting roles. It is set in a world where [[Home appliance|domestic appliances]] and other consumer electronics come to life, pretending to be lifeless in the presence of humans. The story focuses on five anthropomorphic household appliances, which include a [[toaster]], a [[Light fixture|lamp stand]], a [[electric blanket|blanket]], a [[Radio receiver|radio]] and a [[vacuum cleaner]], who go on a quest to search for their owner.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Hyperion Pictures]] and [[The Kushner-Locke Company]]. Many [[CalArts]] graduates, including the original members of [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]], were involved with this film.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTI1yeZd-tkC&q=the+brave+little+toaster&pg=PA41 |title=The Animated Movie Guide - Jerry Beck - Google Books |date=October 28, 2005 |isbn=9781569762226 |access-date=May 27, 2014|last1=Beck |first1=Jerry }}</ref> The rights to the book were acquired by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] in 1982. [[John Lasseter]], then employed at Disney, wanted to do a [[computer-animated film]] based on it, but it was turned down. While the film received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]], ''The Brave Little Toaster'' received positive reviews and was popular on [[home video]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]'' in 1997 and ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]'' in 1998.<ref name=\"AMScribeDies\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn a small wooden cottage known as Peaceful Woodland Cottage, five members of a clan of small electric appliances -- a toaster, a radio, a lamp stand named \"Lampy\", an electric blanket named \"Blanky\" and a vacuum cleaner named \"Kirby\" -- await the return of a young boy named Rob (whom they refer to as the Master) who used to vacation at the cottage with his family, but the family has not come by in many years. Then one day in July, upon seeing that the cottage is about to be sold, the appliances decide to venture out and find Rob themselves. They turn Kirby into a lawn tractor by attaching a rolling office chair, a power strip and a Junko car battery for a power source to him and travel via Kirby, and Radio serves as navigator by directing the group toward urban radio signals he picks up.\n\nAlong their journey, the appliances have numerous harrowing adventures. At one point, when their battery is nearly dead, the group stops for the night in a forest, with Blanky serving as a makeshift tent. During the night, a storm blows Blanky up into the trees, and Lampy uses himself as a [[lightning rod]] to recharge the battery. After recovering Blanky, the appliances try to cross a waterfall, but everyone except Kirby falls into the water below. Kirby dives in and rescues the others; but with the chair, strip and battery lost, the group resorts to pulling the disabled Kirby through a swamp. They are almost swallowed up by quicksand but are saved by Elmo St. Peters and taken to his appliance parts store, where they witness him dismantling a blender to sell its motor to a customer. When Radio is about to be taken apart for [[radio tube]]s, the others frighten St. Peters by pretending to be a ghost. With St. Peters unconscious, the group escapes and makes their way to the city.\n\nRob, now a young adult, goes out to the cottage with his girlfriend Chris to retrieve the appliances to take with him to college. When the group arrives at Rob's family's apartment, their newer appliances -- resentful about Rob wanting to take the older appliances instead of themselves -- demonstrate how much more technologically advanced they are and throw the group out of the apartment and into a dumpster. Rob and Chris return home empty-handed; but an old [[black and white television]] in the apartment, a friend of the five appliances who formerly resided in the cottage with them, plays fictional advertisements for the [[Wrecking yard|junkyard]] the appliances have been taken to, in the hopes that Rob and Chris will go there to find them.\n\nAt the junkyard, the appliances are despondent that Rob apparently no longer needs them. They are picked up by a large [[electromagnet]] and are about to be destroyed by a [[car crusher|crusher]]; but when they see Rob in the junkyard, they believe he might still need them after all. They make numerous attempts to escape the magnet and place themselves so Rob will find them, until the magnet picks up a huge pile of junk and spreads it along the conveyor belt leading to the crusher, separating the group. Rob spots all the appliances except Toaster on the conveyor belt, but the magnet picks up Rob as well as the appliances and drops them back on the belt. Toaster jumps into the crusher's gears and jams them, stopping the crusher just before it flattens Rob and the others. Back at the apartment, Rob repairs the mangled Toaster, and he and Chris soon depart for college with all five appliances in tow.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Deanna Oliver]] as Toaster, a pop-up two-slice [[toaster]] who is the leader of the clan of minor electrical appliances. The main protagonist in the film, Toaster is courageous, intelligent, kind, thoughtful and warmhearted, and is the one who devises the idea of going on a journey to locate the appliances' master Rob. Though Toaster's gender is ambiguous in the film, most official sources describe Toaster as a male. Oliver originally auditioned for the voice of the Air Conditioner but was given the role of Toaster.\n* Timothy E. Day as Blanky, an [[electric blanket]] with an innocent demeanor. Childlike and insecure, Blanky is the only appliance who is deeply distressed over Rob's absence and wants nothing more than to be reunited with him. Toaster and Blanky share a warm, older sibling-younger sibling relationship.\n** Day also voices Young Rob in several flashbacks.\n* [[Tim Stack]] as Lampy, an easily impressed yet slightly irascible [[Tensor lamp|tensor]] [[Gooseneck lamp|gooseneck]] desktop [[Light fixture|lamp stand]]. He is bright, but tends to be ironically dimwitted, though he has a couple of good points. During the storm scene, he nearly sacrifices his life, using himself as a lightning rod to power the clan's car battery. Lampy and Radio share a like-hate relationship and frequently get into arguments with each other, though their animosity lessens throughout the movie.\n** Stack also voiced a salesman named \"Zeke\".\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Radio, a wisecracking vacuum-tube-based dial A.M. [[Alarm clock|radiotelegraphic alarm clock]] with a personality that parodies loud and pretentious [[announcer]]s. In a running gag, Radio and Lampy get into petty arguments.\n** [[Jerry Rees]] as Radio's singing voice.\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Kirby, a very deep-voiced, individualistic upright [[vacuum cleaner]] who dons a cynical, cantankerous attitude towards the other appliances, though deep inside he cares about them greatly.\n* [[Wayne Kaatz]] as Master Rob McGroarty, the original human owner of the five appliances. After appearing as a child in flashbacks, Rob as an adult is leaving for [[college]]. While in the book, Rob plans to sell the cabin along with the appliances, in the film, Rob still has sentimentality towards appliances and takes them to college in the end.\n* Colette Savage as Chris, Rob's tomboyish, supportive girlfriend.\n* [[Phil Hartman]], doing an impression of [[Jack Nicholson]], as Air Conditioner, a sardonic [[Air conditioning|air conditioner]] who resides in the cabin with the rest of the clan. He loses his temper while arguing with them, which causes him to overheat and explode, but is repaired by Rob near the end of the film.\n** Hartman, doing an impression of [[Peter Lorre]], also voiced the Hanging Lamp, a tensor desktop lamp stands with extension cords for arms in the spare parts shop.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Elmo St. Peters, the owner of a [[spare part|spare appliance part]]s shop where he disassembles even his own appliances and sells the parts.\n** Ranft also voices the evil clown in Toaster's nightmare.<ref name=\"twitter1\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/C_A_P_/status/1287219832879042562|title=First tweet confirming Ranft's role as the clown}}</ref><ref name=\"twitter2\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/C_A_P_/status/1287221625516064768|title=Second tweet confirming Ranft's role as the clown}}</ref>\n* [[Beth Anderson (singer)|Beth Anderson]] as the [[Mae West]]-inspired magneto phone open-reel tape recorder in \"It's a B-Movie\" and the wooded wagon in \"Worthless\".\n* Janice Liebhart as the fan in \"It's a B-Movie\", the phone in \"Cutting Edge\" and the pink [[convertible]] in \"Worthless\".\n* [[Judy Toll]], doing an impression of [[Joan Rivers]], as Mishmash, a mish-mash hybrid device consisting of a [[can opener]], a gooseneck desktop lamp stands and an [[electric shaver]].\n* Darryl Phinnessee as various characters in \"It's a B-Movie\" and \"Cutting Edge\" and the hearse in \"Worthless\".\n* [[Jonathan Benair]] as T.V., a [[monochrome|black and white]] [[television set]] who has moved to Rob's apartment and is an old member of the clan.\n* Jim Jackman as Plugsy, a pear-shaped [[nightstand|night table]] lamp stand who is one of the modern appliances that reside in Rob's apartment. While they were benevolent in the novel, in the film, they are initially jealous and antagonistic towards the clan.\n* [[Mindy Sterling|Mindy Stern]] as Rob's mother, who is an unseen character.\n** Toll and Stern also voiced the Two-Faced [[Sewing Machine]], who is one of the modern appliances that reside in Rob's apartment.\n* Randy Bennett as Computer, who is the leader of the family of modern appliances that reside in Rob's apartment.\n* Danny Mann as Stereo, who is one of the modern appliances that reside in Rob's apartment.\n* [[Randall William Cook]] as Entertainment Complex, a [[Entertainment center|stereophonic entertainment complex system]] who is one of the modern appliances that reside in Rob's apartment.\n* [[Susie Allanson]] as the toaster oven in Rob's apartment.\n\n==Production==\n===Conception and financing===\nThe film rights to ''The Brave Little Toaster'', the original novella by Thomas M. Disch, were purchased by the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] in 1982, two years after its appearance in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction|The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''.<ref name=\"beck\">Beck (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref> After animators [[John Lasseter]] and [[Glen Keane]] had finished a short 2D/3D test film based on the book ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'', Lasseter and producer Thomas L. Wilhite decided they wanted to produce a whole feature with the same technique.\n\nThe story they chose was ''The Brave Little Toaster'', and this became the first CGI film Lasseter ever pitched.<ref name=\"wrap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/waterman-gives-brave-little-toaster-new-lease-life-exclusive-56236/ |title=Waterman Gives 'Brave Little Toaster' a New Lease of Life (Exclusive) |date=September 12, 2012 |publisher=TheWrap |access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref> But in their enthusiasm, they ran into issues pitching the idea to two high-level Disney executives, animation administrator Ed Hansen, and Disney president [[Ron W. Miller]]. Ron Miller asked about the cost after the pitch and when Lasseter replied that it would cost no more than a traditionally animated film, Miller rejected the pitch, saying that the only reason to use computers would be if it was \"faster or cheaper\".<ref name=\"toinfinity\">{{cite book |last=Paik |first=Karen |date=2015 |title=To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios |page=40}}</ref><ref name=\"disneyhistory\">{{cite book |last=Robbk |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Robb |date=2014 |title=A Brief History of Walt Disney}}</ref>\n\nA few minutes after the meeting, Lasseter received a phone call from Hansen and was instructed to come down to his office, where Lasseter was informed that he was dismissed. Originally set to commence at the Disney studios with a budget of $18 million, development was then transferred to the new [[Hyperion Pictures]], which had been created by former Disney employees Tom Wilhite and [[Willard Carroll]], who took the production along with them after Wilhite successfully requested the project from then-president Ron Miller. As a result, the film was financed as an independent production by Disney, with the aid of electronics company [[TDK]] Corporation and video distributor [[CBS/Fox Video]].<ref name=\"beck\" />\n\nThe budget was reduced by $12.06 million to $5.94 million as production began, approximately a third of the budget offered when in-house.<ref name=\"beck\" /> Despite providing funds to get it off the ground, Disney was not involved with production of the film.<ref name=\"beck\" /> Rees later commented that there were external forces at work that had the right to say this was a cheap film that could be shipped overseas, which the staff objected to and therefore were willing to make sacrifices to improve the quality of the film despite its limited budget.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Geohir5F76U |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/Geohir5F76U| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=The Brave Little Toaster Interview|date=September 19, 2010|access-date=September 1, 2021|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn 1986, Hyperion began to work on the story and character development. [[Jerry Rees]], a crew member on two previous Disney films, ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' and ''[[Tron]]'', and co-writer of the screenplay along with [[Joe Ranft]], was chosen to direct the project.<ref name=\"beck\" /> He had been working on an animated adaptation of [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[The Spirit]]'' with [[Brad Bird]], and received a call from Wilhite asking him to develop, write, and direct, explaining that ''The Brave Little Toaster'' was being adapted into a short, but that a feature film was possible if handled correctly.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Joe Ranft and Rees worked on developing the story. The storyboards were designed by Jerry, Joe, along with Alex Mann and Darrell Rooney. When animators ran out of pages to storyboard, Rees sat down and wrote more of the script.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\nThe work was significantly adapted from the original story. Only about four lines of dialogue from the book ended up in the finished film.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Rees decided to move the junkyard sequence from the middle of the story to its end because of the junkyard's symbolism as a graveyard for appliances.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> He also wanted a definitive moment that earned Toaster the title of \"brave\", so he had Toaster jump into the gears to save the Master, a plot point that wasn't in the book.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Having the character's voices in his head when writing the script helped Rees to personalize the dialogue. He even reworked some of the already-completed script in order to customize sections based on the actors' personalities.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> After cutting together the storyboards and scene-planning in Taipai, production manager Chuck Richardson explained the logistics issues\u2014the film would be 110 minutes long. As a result, Rees decided to cut around 20 minutes' worth of the story\u2014the deleted scenes have not been released to the public.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nRees was still in the process of writing when he decided to find actors. Many auditioners presented cartoony, exaggerated voices, which displeased him, because they did not believe their characters or bring a reality to the role.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> As a result, he sought out voice talent from [[The Groundlings]] improvisational group upon recommendation by Ranft,<ref name=\"beck\"/> and he appreciated the honesty and naturalism they gave to their performances.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Many of their members, including [[Jon Lovitz]] (Radio), [[Phil Hartman]] (Air Conditioner/Hanging Lamp), [[Timothy Stack|Tim Stack]] (Lampy), [[Judy Toll]] (Mishmash), and [[Mindy Sterling]] (Rob's mother) voiced characters in the film. Already established as an actor through [[Tony the Tiger]] and ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] was cast as Kirby the vacuum cleaner. Heading the ensemble cast were Groundlings performer [[Deanna Oliver]] as Toaster, and newcomer Timothy E. Day as Blanky.<ref name=\"beck\"/>\n\nOliver originally auditioned for Air Conditioner using a [[Bette Davis]] impression, but accepted the lead when offered.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Rees, who had conceived Toaster as a female character, later recalled an anecdote where a crew member \"slammed the door and walked out\" because he had hired a woman to play the lead role.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Day had never done acting work before, and had asked his mother to take him to auditions after becoming fascinated with a child actor voice-over.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n===Recording===\nRecording sessions did take place at Disney; the crew found and renovated a small derelict property in Hollywood.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Rees's direction primarily consisted of ensuring the performances were as natural and realistic as possible.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> When recording, Rees first had each scene delivered as written, and then allowed the voice actors to play around with the dialogue and ended up using many of the improvised lines in the final film.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Unusual for the time, some of the recordings were done in group sessions.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\nAfter being cast, Jon Lovitz got an opportunity to appear on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Because Rees had written the part of Radio specifically for Lovitz, he tried to find a way to keep Lovitz in the film. They ended up doing a marathon recording session, recording all of Lovitz's lines of dialogue in one night. Rees then stood in for Lovitz when the others were recording.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\nRees described Timothy Day as an \"amazing performer\", who would ask about his character's motivation and the context of each scenario before recording his lines. Day was nicknamed \"one-take Timmy\" due to nailing the emotional truth of the text so quickly, such as crying loudly or delivering a line with a quiver in his voice.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Comparing this film to the sequels, where a high note was dubbed by another singer due to being off-key, Oliver noted that in this film it would have been kept in due to being part of the character.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n===Animation===\nThe crew initially worked on pre-production for six months in Los Angeles in 1985, and then a staff of ten people moved to Taiwan with Rees for another six months to work with [[Wang Film Productions]] Company Limited in Taipei (headed by James Wang) for the principal animation,{{cn|date=December 2021}} then returned for a third six-month work period for post-production in the U.S.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"jerryrees27\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jerryrees.com/page27/page27.html |title=Newman_BLT_Score |publisher=Jerryrees.com |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref> Rees's wife Rebecca was the film's directing animator, and she taught classes to the Taiwanese animators in order to improve the quality of their output.\n\nThe animators also had a mixture of ex-Disney employees and college graduates from CalArts.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Every day, they had to do what would normally be done across a two-week period at Disney.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> The colour stylist was veteran Disney animator A. Kendall O'Connor, a member of Disney's [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|feature animation department]] from its first feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'',<ref name=\"beck\" /> and Oliver likened the light-hearted frog sequence to ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> A massive TDK sign was included by Rees as the company was a big sponsor.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> The animators used many visual cues to help inform the audience about plot and character. For example, during the nightmare sequence at the beginning of the film, Toaster burns toast and emits smoke, which symbolizes guilt and fear of being responsible.\n\nThey deduced toasters would be afraid of things like forks and falling into the bathtub while plugged in, so they included them in this sequence. Oliver described the transition from bathtub sparks to lightning outside the house as proper filmmaking.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Similarly, Blanky being a certain shade of yellow bears significance to the plot. In the beginning of their journey, the other characters dismiss him, even Toaster. Then Toaster encounters a flower that is the same color, who also wants to snuggle. After explaining it is just a reflection, he walks away, thereby making the flower wilt. The next moment shows Toaster proactively rescuing Blanky. The idea is that the flower informs Toaster that his actions will make Blanky wilt too.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n===Music and sound===\nThe film score of ''The Brave Little Toaster'' was composed and conducted by [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]] and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]]. Newman's score for this movie was one of his earlier works and apparently one that he felt very close to. He did not view it as a cheerful one and decided to give the film a dramatic score to reinforce the serious nature of many of the film's themes. Rees admired his \"rich, classical style\", and chose him so that the film wouldn't have \"cartoon music\".<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> Rees stated that Newman would attempt to get into the headspace of the characters and thought in the terms of the inanimate objects being real characters.\n\nRees said that Newman's score was as \"grand as anything he would ever do\", rather than composing the music differently due to the medium being animation.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> He wove death, joy, love, loss, and struggle into the work. Newman's composing style was influenced by his philosophy that behind every \"chord of joy\" lies an element of sadness, whether it being the knowledge it won't last forever, that it is a facade for a deeper emotion, or that joy itself comes from sadness.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> He used lush strings in the opening scenes to convey a sense of longing.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> As the characters are introduced, the score becomes more lively, and each character has their own theme, influenced by their personality. For example, Kirby is a grumpy and old vacuum cleaner, and so Newman provides a theme consisting of low chords, whereas Radio was given a brassy fanfare to reflect his self-important personality. These musical motifs wove their way into the entire movie score.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/>\n\nAt some points, the style of music was used to provoke an emotional response, for example when the Air Conditioner breaks down, the orchestra first trembles and then bursts with energy. After this the music returns to a somber tone, as the appliances start to realize that there is truth to what he said.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> When they explore the outside world for the first time, the music fills with a \"pastoral grandeur\", and when they enter the woods, strings, flutes, bells and brass are used to convey the simultaneous magic and danger of the outdoors. The film also contains a Busby Berkeley Italian opera-esque sequence containing a fish.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> The score was finally given a limited release in 2004.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> The film contains four original songs (\"City of Light\", \"It's a B-Movie\", \"Cutting Edge\", and \"Worthless\") that were written by [[Van Dyke Parks]]. Rees \"felt uncomfortable with the full [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] book musical approach\", and his philosophy was that the songs should be part of the action and plot without stopping for a big production number.\n\nRees specifically wanted characters to be able to break out into song whenever they wanted to, similar to the films of the Hollywood Golden Age.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> Once they were written, Newman used the songs in his own score. For example, the first song in the film, \"City of Light\", displays the character's naivety and apprehension, and contains a motif that gets more complex as the film goes on.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> This approach made the score more cohesive. \"It's a B-Movie\" is filled with black humor and an ominous pipe organ as the mutant appliances scare the main characters. The synthesizer driven \"Cutting Edge\" sees the master's state-of-the-art appliances boast about how great they are. The poignant number \"Worthless\" is a track filled with piano, strings, guitar, and vocals which are abruptly cut off when the singing cars are crushed. The junkyard sequence's climax evokes feelings of desperation, danger, suspense and real-world peril. Newman \"reprises the score's subtle and varied themes over the end credits\".<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> Newman wrote and orchestrated the score over a 50-hour period, which included embarking on a 12-hour flight to Japan to record with the orchestra in Maeda Hall.\n\nThe New Japan Philharmonic gave the score a \"luxurious sound\" that was impressive given the limited resources available.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> The sound effects were not from a library, and were instead, exclusively made [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds, with various real-world objects around Los Angeles being used in the score, such as objects in antique stores. This technique was used because Rees wanted to create new characters with new sounds.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> The sound mixers, including former Disney studio mixer Shawn Murphy who recorded the score, asked how they would do their job due to the film being animated, and Rees explained that they should mix it like any other film, instead of thinking of it like it were a cartoon.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/>\n\n==Music==\n\n[[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]] composed the score for the film. The music and lyrics for the songs were written by [[Van Dyke Parks]]. In most of the songs, [[Beth Anderson (singer)|Beth Anderson]], Janice Liebhart, and Darryl Phinnessee perform the singing voices of various background characters, while also doubling as the chorus. In addition, the songs [[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]] and [[My Mammy]] are played by the character Radio during the film.\n\n===Songs===\nOriginal songs performed in the film include:\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n\n| title1   = City of Light\n| extra1   = [[Deanna Oliver]], [[Timothy E.

He also explained that the film's themes included a \"fear of being abandoned and wanting to be reunited with somebody that you love...\"\u2014the opposing forces of feeling like you're worthless and the joy of redemption.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Another important notion was that of \"valuing things from the past and taking them...into the future\", both in terms of objects and relationships.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> All of the main characters have personalities that are unique twists on the appliance functionality.\n\nBlanky is an electric security blanket but is insecure without its owner, the bright Lampy is mentally dim, Kirby is supposed to hold everything inside but has a nervous breakdown, Toaster is warm and reflective so can easily empathize, and Radio is constantly switched on and entertaining.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> He has the philosophy that despite being inanimate, they each symbolized thing we actually feel.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> As the foundation for writing the story, Rees reasoned that the characters would only be happy if they were being used by the Master.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> As a result of this, a major aspect of the film is about inanimate objects becoming alive when you are not observing them.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\nAs opposed to other films of the time, ''The Brave Little Toaster'' was able to include dark, scary, edgy, or risqu\u00e9 content due to being an independent feature. They were able to explore the \"wouldn't it be fun if\" places that Disney wouldn't allow. They rejected the false dichotomy of being joke-driven or overly sincere, and instead incorporated both elements as that is how real conversations work.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n==Release and home media==\nThe film's premiere was at [[Wadsworth Theatre]] in Los Angeles on July 13, 1987.<ref name=\"jerryrees27\"/> With the producer help, the film premiered in various festivals, including the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration in 1987, and the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1988. It made history as the first animated film ever exhibited at Sundance and remained the only one until 2001's ''[[Waking Life]]''.<ref name=\"dvdizzy1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/bravelittletoaster.html |title=The Brave Little Toaster DVD Review |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThough the prize went to [[Rob Nilsson]]'s ''[[Heat and Sunlight]]'', before the awards ceremony, Rees claims he was told by the judges that they considered ''Toaster'' the best film, but they decided not to give the award to a cartoon as they considered people would not take the festival seriously afterwards.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Though it is sometimes thought that the film was not released in cinemas because it failed to find a distributor,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jD9_0jxVmqUC&q=the+brave+little+toaster&pg=PA51 |title=Disney, Pixar, and the Hidden Messages of Children's Films - M.

To compensate, Hyperion continued its plan to enter the film into various festivals and managed to secure limited theatrical airings at arthouse facilities across the United States, such as spending two weeks at New York's Film Forum in May 1989, and shortly in Washington, D.C. in March 1990.<ref name=\"dvdizzy1\"/> This helped to give the film a cult following.\n\nRees thinks most people discovered the film through syndication on the Disney Channel, or through home video releases.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> In July 1991, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] released the film to home video format via VHS and Laserdisc. In the UK, the [[VHS]] tapes were released under [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram Video]] (1990s) and [[Carlton Television|Carlton Video]] (2000s), while in Australia, [[Roadshow Entertainment|Roadshow Home Video]] held the rights. ITC Entertainment syndicated the film international as of the NATPE 1991 TV trade show.<ref>{{cite journal|title=AISLES OF PROGRAMING AT NATPE: ITC Entertainment|journal=Broadcasting|date=January 14, 1991|page=94|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1991/BC-1991-01-14.pdf|access-date=June 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Spain, Divisa Home Video and Aurum Produccines were in charge of distribution, the former during the 2000s. Disney's VHS was re-printed throughout the '90s onward, and it enjoyed popularity as a rental amongst children. The [[DVD-Video|DVD]] was released in September 2003, to tie in with the film's 15th anniversary. In the UK, [[Prism Leisure Corporation]] was in charge of distribution. Their license has since expired, but the disc can still be found on UK shopping sites. Disney's releases commonly use a LaserDisc transfer from the early 1990s, while Prism Leisure's DVD uses a fresh transfer from an international print.\n\nWhile the sequels, ''The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue'' and ''The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars'', are available, the original film has yet to appear on [[Disney+]], or any video on demand services for that matter.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film has garnered a 77% rating on the reviews website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 7.31/10.<ref name=\"RT Toaster\">{{rotten-tomatoes|id=brave_little_toaster|title=The Brave Little Toaster}}.

Many of the cast and crew members went on to have successful careers in the animation industry. Co-writer Joe Ranft became a script supervisor at Pixar, while animators [[Glen Keane]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Kevin Lima]] went on to animate and co-direct films of the [[Disney Renaissance]], such as ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''. Keane would also go on to serve as executive producer for the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'' and director for the 2020 animated film [[Over the Moon (2020 film)|Over the Moon]]. Effects animator [[Mark Dindal]] directed Disney's ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' and ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', as well as [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''. Character designer [[Rob Minkoff]] directed ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'', ''[[Stuart Little 2]]'', ''[[Mr. Peabody & Sherman]]'' and [[Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank]]. After directing a financially unsuccessful film ''[[The Marrying Man]]'' in 1991, Jerry Rees went on to direct Disney theme park films.<ref name=\"google1\"/> Voice actors Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman wound their way onto animated series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Many have noted that this film shares similarities to the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], also worked on by John Lasseter. Rees saw it as \"the next inanimate object feature\".<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n''The Brave Little Toaster'' was followed by two sequels a decade later: ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]'' and ''[[The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue]]''.<ref name=\"AMScribeDies\">{{cite news|last1=Ball|first1=Ryan|title=Brave Little Toaster Scribe Dies|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/brave-little-toaster-scribe-dies/|access-date=May 22, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=July 9, 2008}}</ref> The latter (''Mars'') is based on the sequel to Disch's novella while the former (''Rescue'') is a brand new story. While reuniting most of the cast, they had a new director and crew. Rees noted that the original film was made out of pure love and not thought of as a kids' film or a product, and that he had heard the new approach was a more commercial venture.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Deanna Oliver felt that despite Ramirez being a talented director who handled the franchise with care, instead of \"film\" and \"character-driven\", the project seemed more about getting it done because it could be made. Neither Rees nor Oliver have watched the finished sequels.\n\nIn 2006,  the official website of Hyperion Pictures posted an image of a possible fourth film in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]; however, that film was never produced. The website has been inactive since then but was recently updated in 2019. [[Steve Waterman (producer)|Waterman Entertainment]] planned a remake, but it was never produced.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\nDespite its limited release, the cult following of the film has seen the cast and crew get substantial recognition throughout the world. Rees recalled a situation where a person he was doing an online project with messaged him on [[IMDb]], discovering his work on ''TBLT'', and explained how deeply the film affected him due to teaching life lessons. He appreciated this genuine reaction from a real person.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Oliver went to the [[Afghanistan]] deployment ceremony for her son in June 2010, and he had told Brave Company his mother played Toaster, so they brought toasters with them for her to sign, which the soldiers took to the country with them. She also received fan art from one of the soldiers.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> The consensus among people who worked on the film such as Tom Wilhite and Donald Kushner is that the original is the one that has the cult following as opposed to the sequels.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Rees said that when his future Pixar friends saw the film, they appreciated it despite the animation due to the heavy financial and time constraints.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Toy Story]]''\n* ''[[Tin Toy]]''\n* [[Arthouse animation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* Beck, Jerry (2005).
