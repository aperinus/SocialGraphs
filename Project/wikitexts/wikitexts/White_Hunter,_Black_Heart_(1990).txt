Viertel also co-wrote the script with [[James Bridges]] and [[Burt Kennedy]]. The film is a [[film \u00e0 clef|thinly disguised account]] of Viertel's experiences while working on the 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', which was shot on location in Africa at a time when location shoots outside of the United States for American films were very rare. The main character, brash director John Wilson (played by Eastwood) is based on real-life director [[John Huston]]. Jeff Fahey plays Pete Verrill, a character based on Viertel. [[George Dzundza]]'s character is based on ''African Queen'' producer [[Sam Spiegel]]. [[Marisa Berenson]]'s character Kay Gibson and Richard Vanstone's character Phil Duncan are based on [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], respectively.  This was the last film that James Bridges wrote the screenplay for before dying in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1950s, Pete Verrill is invited by his friend, director John Wilson, to rewrite the script for Wilson's latest project: a film with the working title of ''The African Trader''. The hard living, irreverent Wilson convinces his producer, Paul Landers, to have the film completely shot on location in Africa, even though doing so would be extremely expensive. Wilson explains to Verrill that his motivation for this has nothing to do with the film - Wilson, a lifelong hunter, wants to fulfill his dream of going on an African safari; he even purchases a set of finely crafted hunting rifles and charges them to the studio.\n\nUpon landing in [[Entebbe]], Wilson and Verrill spend several days at a luxury hotel while Verrill finishes the script and Wilson makes arrangements for the safari. Verrill finds himself growing fond of Wilson after the latter defends him against a fellow guest who makes [[antisemitic]] remarks in front of Verrill (who happens to be Jewish) and challenges the hotel manager to a fistfight after witnessing him insult and belittle a black waiter for spilling a drink. The two men constantly argue over Verrill's changes to the script, particularly his insistence that Wilson not use his original planned ending, where all of the main characters are killed on-screen.\n\nWilson hires a pilot to fly him and Verrill out to the hunting camp of safari guide Zibelinsky and his African tracker Kivu, whom Wilson is quick to bond with. The film's unit director, Ralph Lockhart, is also present and insists that Wilson start pre-production before the cast arrives, to which Wilson replies he'll do so after he shoots a [[elephant|\"tusker\"]]. The first day of hunting ends in disappointment when Zibelinsky spots a herd of elephants and warns Wilson not to spook them by firing. Verrill gradually becomes disenchanted with Wilson, who keeps going out to hunt despite being in poor physical condition and seems completely indifferent to the success of his movie. He even questions why Wilson would want to kill such a magnificent beast.\n\nConfronted, Wilson tells Verrill off and accuses him of \"playing it safe\" and not wanting to risk anything. He calls hunting a \"sin that you can get a license for\" and doesn't try to convince Verrill otherwise when he threatens to resign and go back to [[London]]. Landers arrives in Entebbe and insists that Verrill stay on lest the entire studio go under if the movie isn't finished. When Verrill does return, he is informed by Lockhart that Wilson, without consulting anyone, has decided to move the entire production to Kivu's home village despite Landers spending most of the budget on a prefabricated set.\n\nThe cast, now unable to stay at the hotel, go to Zibelinsky's camp and find Wilson waiting for them with a lavish banquet. He humiliates Landers and takes advantage of several days of rain to resume his safari, now accompanied by professional elephant hunter Ogilvy. Verrill follows after Wilson again taunts him for cowardice. Wilson finally gets his chance to kill the \"tusker\", but when the time comes to shoot, he suddenly finds he can't pull the trigger. The elephant suddenly charges after seeing its child move too close to Wilson, and Kivu tries to scare it off only to be fatally gored by the elephant's tusks.\n\nWilson, horrified by Kivu's death, returns to the set. He sees the villagers beating drums and asks Ogilvy what they mean. Ogilvy replies that they are communicating to everyone how Kivu died: \"white hunter, black heart\". Recognizing that he is ultimately to blame for what happened, Wilson tells Verrill that he was right: the film does need a happy ending after all. Sitting in his director's chair as the actors and crew take their places to film the opening scene of ''The African Trader'', a now humbled and broken Wilson silently mutters \"Action\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as John Wilson\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Pete Verrill\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Ralph Lockhart, unit director\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Paul Landers\n* [[Charlotte Cornwell]] as Miss Wilding, Wilson's secretary\n* [[Norman Lumsden]] as George, Wilson's butler\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Kay Gibson\n* Richard Vanstone as Phil Duncan\n* [[Catherine Neilson]] as Irene Saunders, an aspiring writer who pitches her film to Wilson\n* [[Edward Tudor-Pole]] as Reissar, British partner\n* [[Roddy Maude-Roxby]] as Thompson, British partner\n* [[Richard Warwick]] as Basil Fields, British partner\n* Boy Mathias Chuma as Kivu\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Hodkins, bush pilot\n\n==Production==\nDuring the 1950s, [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote an unproduced version of the film for MGM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellesnet.com/ray-bradbury-lost-tv-show-with-orson-welles-and-his-unused-ending-for-king-of-kings/|title = Ray Bradbury's lost TV show with ORSON WELLES and his unused ending for KING OF KINGS|date = 3 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nAt times, Eastwood, as the John Huston-like character of John Wilson, can be heard drawing out his vowels, speaking in Huston's distinctive style.\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Kariba, Zimbabwe]], and surrounds including at [[Lake Kariba]], [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], and [[Hwange]],<ref name=\"graysmarkcue\">Production designer [[John Graysmark]] interview, ''Cue International'' May 1990.</ref> over two months in the summer of 1989.<ref name=Hughes144>Hughes, Howard, ''Aim for the Heart: The Films of Clint Eastwood'', p.144, I.B.

The boat used in the film was constructed in England of glass fibre and shipped to Africa for filming.<ref name=\"graysmarkcue\" /> It was electrically powered, and was fitted with motors and engines by special-effects expert John Evans to make the boat appear to be steam-powered.<ref name=\"graysmarkcue\" /> The elephant gun used in the film was a \u00a365,000 double-barrelled rifle of the type preferred by most professional hunters and their clients in this era. It was made by [[Holland & Holland]], the gunmakers who also made the gun used by Huston when he was in Africa for ''The African Queen'' in 1951.  The ''White Hunter Black Heart'' filmmakers took great care with the gun and sold it back to Holland & Holland after filming \"unharmed, unscratched, unused.\"<ref name=\"graysmarkcue\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film was entered into the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/157/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: White Hunter Black Heart |access-date=2009-08-07|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> The film received positive reviews with review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reporting that 30 out of the 35 reviews they tallied were positive giving a 86% rating. The consensus reads: \"''White Hunter Black Heart'' is powerful, intelligent, and subtly moving, a fascinating meditation on masculinity and the insecurities of artists.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_hunter_black_heart/ | title=White Hunter Black Heart (1990) | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=February 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film has grown significantly in critical stature, especially in light of the films Eastwood made immediately afterwards. Many of these, like ''White Hunter, Black Heart'', turned out to be self-reflexive and self-conscious works criticizing and deconstructing Eastwood's own iconography. [[Jim Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' hailed it as \"Eastwood\u2019s best work before ''Unforgiven''...[an] underrated hall-of-mirrors movie about movie-inspired megalomania.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Voice Choices: White Hunter, Black Heart |work= [[The Village Voice]] |date=July 13, 2010  |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-07-13/voice-choices/white-hunter-black-heart/full/|access-date=2015-01-04|first=Jim|last=Hoberman}}</ref> [[Dave Kehr]] and [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] consider it a masterpiece, with the latter pointing out the [[Brechtian]] nature of Eastwood's performance, as he never disappears into the role he is playing; instead, Eastwood is always recognizably his unique star persona while showing us what he imagines Huston (i.e. Wilson) to have been. The result is \"a running commentary on his two subjects, Huston and himself\u2014the ruminations and questions of a free man.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= A Free Man |url= http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2009/12/a-free-man-clint-eastwoods-white-hunter-black-heart/ |date=December 1, 2009 |access-date=2015-01-04 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''White Hunter Black Heart'''s gross theatrical earnings reached just over $2 million, well below the film's $24 million budget.<ref name=\"Hughes147\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0100928}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|white_hunter_black_heart}}\n* {{Mojo title|whitehunterblackheart}}\n* [http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=24888 Movie stills]\n\n{{Clint Eastwood}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action films]]\n[[Category:1990 drama films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about films]]\n[[Category:Films about film directors and producers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Clint Eastwood]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Clint Eastwood]]\n[[Category:Malpaso Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films about hunters]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Zambia]]\n[[Category:Films \u00e0 clef]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Lennie Niehaus]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Humphrey Bogart]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
