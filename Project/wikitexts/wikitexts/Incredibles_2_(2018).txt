Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the [[sequel]] to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Incredibles as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] formats. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, humor, writing, and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->second<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] of all time during its theatrical run, along with being the highest-grossing Pixar film and the third to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], but lost both awards to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nThree months after defeating Syndrome,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004)}} the Parrs and [[Frozone]] battle [[the Underminer]] and prevent him from destroying the [[city hall]], but are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage gives the government the excuse to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, denying the Parrs and other superheroes financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s crush [[Tony Rydinger]] discovers her superhero identity. Agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] accidentally erases his entire memory of her instead of just the incident.\n\nWealthy businessman [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]] and his sister [[Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]], who run the media and telecommunications giant DevTech, propose secret missions to Elastigirl, Mr. Incredible, and Frozone that will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes. Winston chooses [[Elastigirl]] over [[Mr. Incredible]] for the initial missions because of her being less accident prone. Bob struggles in his new role as a stay-at-home parent: trying to help [[Dash Parr|Dash]] with math homework, Violet's heartache over Tony standing her up for their first date (due to his memory wipe), and [[Jack-Jack]] wreaking havoc with his burgeoning superpowers.\n\n[[Edna Mode]] develops a suit to help control Jack-Jack's abilities. In New Urbem, Elastigirl encounters a [[supervillain]] known as \"Screenslaver\", who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images by hacking into monitors. After preventing him from having a crowded [[commuter rail|commuter train]] derailed, and thwarting his attempt to kill an ambassador by having a helicopter crash into hers, she tracks him to an apartment building and unmasks him as a pizzeria worker who claims to have no recollection of his actions. At a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury yacht, the ''Everjust''. Elastigirl discovers the pizzeria worker is not Screenslaver but was being [[Mind control|controlled]] with hypnotic goggles.\n\nEvelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the true Screenslaver. Restraining her in a freezing room inside the boat to limit her stretching abilities, Evelyn explains her resentment of supers, blaming them for the deaths of her and Winston's parents; their father was shot and killed waiting for supers to help during a burglary, and their mother subsequently died of mourning. Evelyn plans to sabotage her brother's summit by causing a catastrophe to irreparably tarnish the reputation of all superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed for good and leaving the public to solve their own issues. Evelyn lures Bob into a trap and sends a group of hypnotized superheroes to subdue the Parr children. Frozone attempts to protect them but is overwhelmed.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape in a refurbished Incredibile, the supercar once owned by their father, and reach Winston's yacht. Onboard, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone broadcast a vengeful speech painting superheroes as a threat, subdue the ship's crew, aim the yacht at New Urbem, and destroy the controls on Evelyn's orders. Jack-Jack removes the goggles on Elastigirl; she in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. They release the other mind-controlled superheroes, and all work together to turn the yacht from crashing into the city. Elastigirl apprehends Evelyn attempting to escape in a jet. Evelyn is arrested, and the legal status of superheroes is reinstated.\n\nSome time later, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a carload of bank robbers, Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and they give chase in their Incredibile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters{{!}}List of ''The Incredibles'' characters}}\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as [[Helen Parr (The Incredibles)|Helen Parr / Elastigirl]], the mother of the family who has the ability to stretch her body into many shapes and forms.<ref name=THRHunterAlanBall>{{cite news |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title=Holly Hunter to Star in HBO's Alan Ball Family Drama |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/holly-hunter-star-hbos-alan-ball-family-drama-948295 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 17, 2016 |access-date=November 17, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Craig T.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''Toy Story 4'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\" Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] would not \"rule [a third film] out\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/ |title=Could there be an Incredibles 3?
