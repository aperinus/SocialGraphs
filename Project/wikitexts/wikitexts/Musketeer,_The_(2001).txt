Released days before the [[September 11 attacks]], the film was a box office success in North America but didn't perform well in other countries, and received largely negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe young boy, [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]] witnesses the murder of his parents at the hands of Febre, chief henchman of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], d'Artagnan is nearly killed after using his dead father's sword to fight Febre, who is then left with a permanent scar and blind in one eye. D'Artagnan is taken in by Planchet, a family friend and former [[musketeer]], one of the loyal protectors of [[king]] [[Louis XIII]].\n\nFourteen years later, the adult d'Artagnan finds on his arrival in Paris that the musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu, who is usurping the king's authority with the help of Febre. Richelieu is also trying to foment hostility between France, England and Spain to gain more political power for himself. D'Artagnan convinces two of the musketeers, [[Porthos]] and [[Aramis]], to free the imprisoned head of the musketeers, Treville, thus earning their trust. He takes a room at a Paris [[boarding house]], where he takes a fancy to the chambermaid, Francesca, who is the daughter of the late seamstress to the queen. Febre, on orders from Richelieu, incites a mob to attack the French Royal Palace during a State dinner for Lord Buckingham, a visiting English dignitary. D'Artagnan, with the help of Porthos, Aramis and another musketeer, [[Athos (character)|Athos]], saves King Louis, the queen, and Lord Buckingham from being hurt or killed. Afterwards, Francesca recruits d'Artagnan to make a clandestine trip to the north coast of France with the queen to meet with Buckingham in whose honor the state dinner was being held, to keep peace between the two countries. However, d'Artagnan's landlord overhears them and tells Febre.\n\nDuring the trip, d'Artagnan fights off repeated attacks by Febre's henchmen. He and Francesca become intimate, only to have Febre discover them and kidnap her and the queen. Febre forces the queen to write a letter to Buckingham asking him to meet her at a heavily fortified castle of his choosing, using the queen's ring to convince him of the authenticity of the message. Richelieu finally realizes just how far Febre is willing to go: he means to start a war between France, England and Spain, a war that will cripple France. Knowing that he has lost control of his chief henchman, Richelieu secretly visits d'Artagnan and tells him of Febre's plans and pleads for his help to stop Febre. D'Artagnan agrees, but only because Febre is holding Francesca. D'Artagnan returns to Paris and convinces the surviving musketeers that their responsibility to the crown remains their highest priority, and they join him at the castle where Francesca, the queen, and Lord Buckingham are being held. They charge the castle on horseback, losing several of their number in the process, but the diversion they create allows Planchet to drive his carriage in front of the castle gates below the field of cannon fire from the castle. This enables him to fire a mortar directly into the castle gates.\n\nThe remaining musketeers battle the Cardinal's guards, while d'Artagnan engages Febre in an intense duel, finally killing him and avenging the death of his parents. D'Artagnan and the [[The Three Musketeers|Three Musketeers]] are given medals for their service, and d'Artagnan covertly threatens Richelieu. At the end, d'Artagnan and Francesca are seen to be married.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Justin Chambers]] as [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]]\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Febre, the Man in Black\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as [[Cardinal Richelieu]]\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Francesca Bonacieux\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as The [[Anne of Austria|Queen]]\n* [[Daniel Mesguich]] as [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]]\n* [[Jean-Pierre Castaldi]] as Planchet\n* [[Nick Moran]] as [[Aramis]]\n* [[Steve Speirs]] as [[Porthos]]\n* Jan-Gregor Kremp as [[Athos (character)|Athos]]\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Treville, Head of the Musketeers\n* [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] as [[Comte de Rochefort|Rochefort]], Richelieu Henchman\n* [[Jeremy Clyde]] as Lord Buckingham\n* [[Bill Treacher]] as Mr Bonacieux\n* [[Tsilla Chelton]] as Madame Lacross\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was initially announced under the title ''D\u2019Artagnan''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/d-artagnan-parries-deals-worldwide-for-mdp-1117794188/ |title = 'D'Artagnan' parries deals worldwide for MDP - Variety|date = 24 February 2001}}</ref> In May 2000, [[Gary Oldman]] and Mena Suvari were in discussions to star in the film.<ref name=\"DArtagnanOldman\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/markets-festivals/d-artagnan-to-ink-oldman-suvari-1117781656/|title=  'D'Artagnan' to ink Oldman, Suvari |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\n[[Universal Pictures]] teamed up with [[Miramax]] Films to buy the film's North American and U.K. rights for $7.5 million, with Universal releasing the film in North America and Miramax in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lchr.org/a/11/ps/marknews40.html|title=Mark Wahlberg In The News|first=Lianne|last=Wong|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/box-office-analysis-sept-9-57232657/|title=Box Office Analysis: Sept. 9|first=Martin|last=Grove|date=9 January 2002|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref> The film debuted with a $10.7 million opening ahead of ''[[Two Can Play That Game (film)|Two Can Play That Game]]'';
