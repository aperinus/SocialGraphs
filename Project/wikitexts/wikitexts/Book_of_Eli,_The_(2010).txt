He demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, such as hunting wildlife and defeating a group of [[highwaymen]]. Searching for water, he arrives in a ramshackle town ruled by a warlord named Carnegie, who seeks to control the people through the power of a certain book, which his [[henchmen]] have been unable to find.\n\nEli barters with a store owner, the Engineer, to recharge the battery of his portable music player. At the town bar, he is attacked by a gang of bikers but swiftly kills them all. Impressed, Carnegie invites Eli to join his employ, but Eli declines. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie forces him to stay the night under guard. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia brings Eli food and water, Carnegie orders her daughter Solara to seduce Eli, but he rebuffs her. Solara sees Eli has a book, and he offers to share his food, saying [[grace (prayer)|grace]] before they eat. In the morning, Carnegie overhears Solara repeating the prayer to her mother and realizes Eli has the book he has been seeking: a [[Bible]].\n\nEli sneaks away, but Carnegie and his henchmen confront him in the street. When Eli refuses to give up the book, Carnegie orders him killed; the ensuing battle leaves Eli untouched, but many henchmen dead and Carnegie shot in the leg. Solara catches up to Eli and leads him to the town's water supply, hoping to accompany him on his travels, but he traps her inside and continues alone. Solara escapes and is ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli reappears and kills them. Continuing toward the West Coast, Eli explains his mission: His book is the last remaining copy of the Bible since all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war. He says that he was led to the book by a voice in his head, directing him to travel westward to a place it would be safe, and assuring that he would be protected and guided on his journey.\n\nAt an isolated house, Eli and Solara fall into a trap but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, George and Martha, who invite them in for tea. Realizing that George and Martha are [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], Eli and Solara attempt to leave just as Carnegie and his men arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha, and many of Carnegie's men are killed, and Eli and Solara are captured. Threatening to kill Solara, Carnegie forces Eli to surrender the Bible before shooting him and leaving him for dead, departing with his caravan. Solara escapes, destroying one truck with a hand grenade and driving back in another to find Eli. With his remaining vehicle low on fuel, Carnegie returns to town.\n\nSolara finds Eli, and they drive until they reach the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and row to [[Alcatraz Island]], where they find a group intent on preserving what remains of literature and music. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the Bible. Taken inside, Eli dictates the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible from memory to Lombardi, the sanctuary's leader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/idolchatter/2010/01/the-book-of-eli-interview-with.html |title='The Book of Eli': Interview with Denzel Washington, Mila Kunis, and Gary Oldman\n|last1=Bakhshian |first1=Sara |date= January 2010 |access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"girouxj1\" />\n\nIn the town, the Engineer opens Eli's locked Bible, which Carnegie discovers is in [[Braille]], revealing Eli to be blind. Claudia, feigning ignorance of Braille, tells Carnegie that his leg wound has become [[Sepsis|infected]] and the loss of his enforcers has led the people to [[run amok]]. At the sanctuary, Eli has died, but not before reciting the entire book. A printing press begins producing copies of the Bible, and Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the [[Tanakh]] and the [[Quran]]. Offered sanctuary on Alcatraz, Solara chooses instead to return home, taking up Eli's machete and other possessions.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as Eli\n*[[Gary Oldman]] as Bill Carnegie\n*[[Mila Kunis]] as Solara\n*[[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] as Redridge\n*[[Jennifer Beals]] as Claudia\n*[[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]] as Martz\n*[[Joe Pingue]] as Hoyt\n*[[Frances de la Tour]] as Martha\n*[[Michael Gambon]] as George\n*[[Tom Waits]] as Engineer\n*[[Chris Browning]] as Hijack Leader\n*[[Malcolm McDowell]] as Lombardi (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2007, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] signed the Hughes brothers to direct ''The Book of Eli'', based on a script by [[Gary Whitta]].
