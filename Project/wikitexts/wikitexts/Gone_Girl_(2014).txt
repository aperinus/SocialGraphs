Her disappearance receives press coverage, as Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular ''Amazing Amy'' children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle in the house. The media suspect Nick due to his apathy towards Amy's disappearance.\n\nIn the past, Amy revealed to Nick that ''Amazing Amy'' was a perfected version made up of the real Amy's failures. Their marriage disintegrated over time; both lost their jobs in the [[Great Recession|recession]] and moved from New York City to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, [[Missouri]], to support his dying mother. Nick became distant with Amy, and began cheating on Amy with Andie, one of his students, while Amy became resentful towards Nick for making her move to Missouri.\n\nForensic analysis of the house uncovers cleaned bloodstains, indicating a murder. Boney discovers evidence of financial issues, spousal disputes, and Amy's recent propensity to acquire a gun. Medical reports indicate that Amy was pregnant, which Nick denies knowing of.\n\nAmy and Nick had played treasure hunt games on every wedding anniversary. Amy, this year, had hidden items purchased with Nick's credit card in the shed, as well as a diary that shows Amy's growing dread and ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.\n\nAmy drives to a campground in the [[Ozarks]]. Upon discovering Nick's affair, she had conceived a plan to frame him for her murder. She misrepresented the relationship between herself and Nick by falsifying accounts in a diary. Unbeknownst to Nick, she had befriended her neighbor to tell her stories about Nick's temper, and steal her urine to manipulate pregnancy results. She placed supporting evidence of Nick's guilt in the clue spots for the \"treasure hunt\" to let the police find them. She also splattered her own blood across the kitchen, and cleaned it haphazardly. She assumed that Nick would be executed for her murder, and planned to drown herself.\n\nNick deduces Amy's plan and convinces his twin sister, Margo, of his innocence. He flies to New York City and hires Tanner Bolt, a lawyer known for representing men accused of killing their wives. Nick also meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Tommy O'Hara, whom Amy had falsely accused of rape, by ostensible \"rape wounds\" on her vagina and evidence of O'Hara's semen. Nick approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy had filed a restraining order for stalking, but Desi turns him away.\n\nWhen Amy's campground neighbors rob her, she calls Desi for help, convincing him that she fled Nick's abuse. Desi agrees to hide her in his lake house. After Andie reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show affirming his innocence and apologizes for his shortcomings as a spouse to lure Amy out of hiding. Boney believes she has enough evidence to arrest Nick for murder, but Bolt gets him out on bail. Amy realizes that Desi intends to keep her in the house to forcibly rekindle their relationship. Amy then uses Desi's surveillance cameras to help make it appear that he kidnapped and raped her, slits his throat while they have sex, and returns home to Nick covered in Desi's blood, clearing Nick of suspicion and framing Desi as the kidnapper after recounting a false account of their altercation to Boney.\n\nWhen Boney brings up the inconsistencies with Amy's account, she retorts by calling her incompetent. Amy tells Nick the truth and admits to Desi's murder, saying that him pleading for her to come back is the man she wants. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but there is no evidence of her guilt.\n\nNick intends to leave Amy, but she reveals that she is pregnant, having [[Artificial insemination|inseminated]] herself [[Sperm theft|with Nick's sperm]] stored at a fertility clinic. Nick reacts violently to Amy's insistence that they should remain married but feels responsible for the child and decides to stay married, despite Margo's qualms. The couple then announces on television that they are expecting a child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Nicholas \u201cNick\u201d Dunne, a teacher<ref name=\"theny\" />\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as Amy Elliott Dunne, Nick's missing wife\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Desi Collings, Amy's wealthy ex-boyfriend\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as Tanner Bolt, Nick's attorney\n* [[Carrie Coon]] as Margo \"Go\" Dunne, Nick's twin sister<ref name=\"theny\" />\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Detective Rhonda Boney, the lead investigator on Amy's disappearance\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as Officer James Gilpin, Boney's partner\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Ellen Abbott, a cable TV host based on [[Nancy Grace]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nancy-grace-reveals-what-she-754653|title=Nancy Grace Reveals What She Really Thinks About 'Gone Girl' \u2014 to the Actress Who Played Her|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 12, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Emily Ratajkowski]] as Andrea \u201cAndie\u201d Fitzgerald, Nick's mistress and student\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as No\u00eblle Hawthorne, Nick and Amy's neighbor\n* [[Lola Kirke]] as Greta, a young woman Amy meets at the Ozarks campground\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Jeffrey \u201cJeff\u201d, a flirtatious man Amy meets at the Ozarks campground\n* [[Lisa Banes]] as Mary Elizabeth \u201cMarybeth\u201d Elliott, Amy's mother\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Sharon Schieber, a network TV host\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Thomas \u201cTommy\u201d O'Hara, a former boyfriend of Amy's\n* [[Scott Takeda]] as TV Producer\n* [[David Clennon]] as Randall \u201cRandy\u201d Elliott, Amy's father\n* [[Kathleen Rose Perkins]] as Shawna Kelly\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gone Girl Premiere at the 52nd New York Film Festival P1070636 (15347765806).jpg|thumb|[[David Fincher]] and [[Gillian Flynn]] at the film's premiere at the [[2014 New York Film Festival|52nd New York Film Festival]]]]\n''Gone Girl'' is a [[film adaptation]] of Flynn's 2012 [[Gone Girl (novel)|novel of the same name]].

One of the aspects that she was certain of was the presence of the media, which she described as the \"third player\", alongside Nick and Amy.

Amy's pieces can be seen as more timeless over high fashion and trendy as Summerville explains that Amy is just \"kind of not that girl.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> This is also exemplified through Amy's jewelry; she wears a Rose Gold Cartier Love bracelet as well as a necklace containing a floating 'A' to show how Amy holds onto keepsakes from the past.\n\nNick Dunne's character is also more simple in the way he presents himself. Summerville wanted to dress him in simple yet well-fitting suits and found that designer suits fit best due to actor Ben Affleck's larger build. Nick Dunne can be seen wearing suits from Dolce & Gabbana, as well as Prada shirts.<ref name=\":0\" /> The shirt that Nick puts on when he comes home to find his wife missing is an important piece in the film because he does not take this shirt off for the days following. The infamous blue shirt Nick wears is a blue button-up designed by Steven Alan, paired with J brand jeans.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen Amy and Nick move to Missouri, Summerville made minor changes to Amy's wardrobe in order to signify change.

The narrative that Nick is guilty for the disappearance of Amy is a direct result of his mishandled media appearances as well as the actual misinformation being told as \"evidence\" on the news. Whether or not Nick is actually guilty, the audience is led to believe he is through the media's manipulation. The role of the media in this film is to provide the conclusion that making snap judgements can be harmful and reveals the importance of carefully assessing situations before making decisions.\n\n=== Manipulation ===\nWhile almost all of the characters have ulterior motives to serve their own selfish needs, it is Amy who shows the most prevalent examples of manipulation throughout the story. Not only does Amy lie throughout the entirety of the film, she carefully calculates her plans and predicts behaviors of those around her, especially Nick, to attain her desired outcome and behaviors of those close to her. Amy's intelligence and knowledge of psychology also comes to her aid as she executes her plan; Amy is attractive and can be charismatic which leads people to assume she is innocent. As Nick begins to figure out Amy's plan, he uses manipulation tactics through the media to get Amy to return home. We know that he is disingenuous when he states that he was only \"telling her [Amy] what she wants to hear\".\n\n==Potential sequel==\nIn an interview in October 2014, Rosamund Pike stated she would return for a sequel if Gillian Flynn wrote the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rosamund-Pike-Return-Gone-Girl-2-Person-Does-67648.html|title=Rosamund Pike Will Return For
