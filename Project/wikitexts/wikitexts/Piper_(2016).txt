Written and directed by [[Alan Barillaro]], it was theatrically released alongside Pixar's ''[[Finding Dory]]'' on June 17, 2016.<ref name=\"Audubon\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.audubon.org/news/a-behind-scenes-look-pixars-new-short-film-piper|title=A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Pixar's New Short Film 'Piper'|last=Imbler|first=Sabrina|date=June 17, 2016|website=[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]|publisher=[[National Audubon Society]]|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]], becoming the first Pixar animated short to win the award since ''[[For the Birds (film)|For the Birds]]'' in 2001.\n\nThe short film involves a hungry baby [[sandpiper]] learning to overcome her [[aquaphobia|fear of water]]. The inspiration came from less than a mile away from Pixar Studios in [[Emeryville, California]], where Barillaro, a veteran Pixar animator, would run alongside the shore and notice birds by the thousands fleeing from the water but returning between waves to eat.<ref name=A/><ref name=\"Audubon\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nA flock of [[sandpiper]]s is hunting for food at a seashore by searching for [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] exposed by receding waves and running away when the wave returns. A baby (named Piper) is taken to shoreline by her mother so she can learn how to find her own food. However, she fails to pull away in time and is soaked wet by the incoming surf. The incident leaves Piper [[Aquaphobia|terrified of the water]] and she refuses to leave the nest. Soon, she is compelled to return to the shoreline by her hunger and notices a [[hermit crab]] digging in the sand. While she is watching the crab, a large wave comes in and submerges her. However, this time the crab tells Piper to open her eyes, allowing her to see large bivalves exposed by the wave. Excited, Piper overcomes her fear of water and learns how to catch the large bivalves when they are exposed underwater, catching enough to feed her entire flock.\n\n== Production ==\nAlan Barillaro used new, cutting edge technology to create ''Piper'' over three years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/piper-pixar-short-bird-who-directed-alan-barillaro|title=Behind the Scenes of ''Piper'', Pixar's Best Short Film in Years|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|date=June 16, 2016|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|access-date=September 22, 2016}}</ref>  In order to give the sandpipers and other birds visible in the background a realistic look, Barillaro and the short animation team visited beaches in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] to study their appearance and behavior.
