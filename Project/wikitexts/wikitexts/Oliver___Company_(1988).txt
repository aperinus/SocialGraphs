The 27th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it is loosely based on the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. In the film, [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] is a [[Homelessness|homeless]] [[kitten]] who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century [[London]] to 1980s [[New York City]], [[Fagin]]'s gang is made up of dogs (one of which is [[The Artful Dodger|Dodger]]), and [[Bill Sikes|Sykes]] is a [[loan shark]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985), [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] held a pitch meeting with the animation staff, in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt ''Oliver Twist'' with [[dog]]s. The pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title ''Oliver and the Dodger''. Released on the same day as ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' (1988), ''Oliver & Company'' was a box office success, but it received mixed reviews from film critics. The film was re-released in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was then released on home video later that same year, and again in 2002 and 2009 on [[DVD]]. The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2013, commemorating its 25th anniversary. The film has garnered a [[cult following]] and has become a Disney fan-favourite over the years.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 596. -->\nOn [[Fifth Avenue]], several kittens are left in a box outside a shop. All but one, an orange tabby, are adopted. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, the kitten meets a laid-back [[mongrel]] named Dodger, who agrees to help him steal food from a [[hot dog]] vendor. Dodger then reneges on the deal and flees with the hot dogs.\n\nThe kitten pursues Dodger all over [[New York City]]. Dodger eventually arrives at a [[barge]], where the kitten watches him share the hot dogs with a gang of poverty-stricken dogs (Tito the [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], Einstein the [[Great Dane]], Rita the [[Saluki]], and Francis the [[bulldog]]). The kitten accidentally falls into the barge, startling the dogs; however, while they are annoyed, none of them harm him. Fagin, the bargeman and [[petty thief]] who owns the dogs, is indebted to Sykes, a nefarious [[loan shark]] and criminal. Sykes arrives and gives Fagin an [[ultimatum]]; repay the money in three days, or suffer violence, possibly even death. Sykes's two [[Doberman]]s, Roscoe and DeSoto, harass Fagin's dogs and threaten to eat the kitten, until he scratches DeSoto's nose, earning Fagin and the dogs' respect. Roscoe warns that they will try to exact revenge.\n\nThe next morning, Fagin goes to pawn some of his stolen goods, while the dogs and the kitten try to steal more money for him. Through a theatrical ruse, the animals stop a [[limousine]] belonging to the wealthy Foxworth family, but the attempt to rob the limo fails, and the kitten is taken by the child Jenny Foxworth, who is missing her vacationing parents and desires a companion. She names him Oliver, and becomes very attached to him.\n\nOliver makes himself at home in Jenny's house, much to the disgust of Georgette, the Foxworth family's spoiled, prize-winning [[poodle]]. With her help, Dodger and the dogs manage to steal Oliver back from the Foxworth household, returning him to the barge. Fagin recognizes from Oliver's new [[cat collar|collar]] and gold [[pet tag|name tag]] that he had been adopted by a wealthy family, and desperately decides to hold Oliver for ransom. His anonymously written ransom note reaches Jenny, who sets out to get Oliver back at the [[pier]].\n\nJenny and Georgette meet with Fagin, who is shocked to be dealing with a little girl whose \"ransom money\" is a [[piggy bank]]. Bothered by his conscience and Jenny's tears, Fagin gives Oliver back freely. Sykes, whom Fagin had informed of the deal beforehand, is watching from the shadows and kidnaps Jenny, intending to ransom her while declaring Fagin's debt paid. Dodger rallies Oliver and the other dogs to free Jenny from Sykes, but Sykes and his Dobermans confront them as they attempt to leave. Fagin saves the group with his [[motor scooter]], and a chase ensues throughout the streets and into the [[New York City Subway|subway tunnels]]. Jenny falls from the scooter onto Sykes's car; Oliver and Dodger go after her and battle Roscoe and DeSoto, who fall off the car and are electrocuted on the [[third rail]] of the subway. Fagin leaves Tito to drive and saves Jenny, while Dodger and Oliver are thrown from Sykes's car onto the pavement of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] just before an oncoming train strikes and kills Sykes. Tito drives the scooter to safety, and Jenny and Oliver are reunited.\n\nLater, Jenny celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin, and the family butler Winston, who receives a phone call from Jenny's parents saying that they will be returning from [[Rome]] the next day. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny, but he promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- Before you edit, please note that Sykes was not referred to as Bill Sykes in the film, only as Sykes. -->\n* [[Joey Lawrence]] as [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]]: an [[Orange (colour)|orange]] [[orphan]]ed [[kitten]] who is looking for a home. He joins [[Fagin|Fagin's]] [[gang]] of [[dog]]s before being taken in by Jenny.\n* [[Billy Joel]] as [[Artful Dodger|Dodger]], a carefree, charismatic [[mongrel]] with a mix of [[terrier]] in him. He claims to have considerable \"street savoir-faire.\" He is the [[Leadership|leader]] of Fagin's gang of dogs, and is Oliver's first acquaintance, as well as his eventual best friend and [[bodyguard]].\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Tito, a tiny yet passionate [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] in Fagin's gang. He has a fiery temper for his size, and rapidly develops a crush on Georgette (although she is initially repulsed by him). His full name is Ignacio Alonso Julio Federico de Tito.\n* [[Richard Mulligan]] as Einstein, a gray [[Great Dane]] and a member of Fagin's gang. He is named ironically as he is not particularly bright, representing the stereotype that Great Danes are friendly but dim-witted.\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Francis, a [[bulldog]] with a [[British English|British]] accent in Fagin's gang. He appreciates [[art]] and [[theatre]], particularly [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. He also detests anyone abbreviating his name as \"Frank\" or \"Frankie\" (which Tito frequently does).\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] ([[Ruth Pointer]], singing) as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Rita]], a [[Saluki]]<ref name=\"WashingtonPost\" /> and the only female dog in Fagin's gang. She is street-wise and takes Oliver under her wing.\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as [[Fagin]], a lowly thief who lives on a barge with his dogs. He desperately needs [[money]] to repay his [[debt]] with Sykes. Because of his [[Economy|economic]] situation, he is forced to perform [[Crime|criminal]] acts such as [[Pickpocketing|pick-pocketing]] and [[petty theft]], but in truth he is well-meaning and genial most of the time.\n* [[Taurean Blacque]] and [[Carl Weintraub]] as Roscoe and DeSoto, respectively: Sykes's vicious [[Doberman Pinscher]]s who have a hostile history with Dodger and his friends. Roscoe is the apparent leader, while DeSoto seems to be the more savage of the two.\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as [[Bill Sikes|Bill Sykes]], a cold-hearted, immoral loan shark and [[shipyard]] agent who lent a considerable sum of money to Fagin and expects it paid back.\n* [[Natalie Gregory]] (Myhanh Tran, singing) as [[Mr. Brownlow|Jennifer \"Jenny\" Foxworth]], a kind-hearted, rich girl who adopts Oliver.\n* William Glover as Winston, the Foxworth family's bumbling but loyal butler.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Georgette, the Foxworth family's prize-winning poodle. Vain and [[wikt:spoiled|spoiled]], she becomes jealous of Oliver but eventually accepts him and Fagin's gang.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Old Louie, an aggressive, bad-tempered hot dog vendor who appears early in the film when Oliver and Dodger steal his hot dogs. He is described by Dodger as \"a well-known enemy of the four-legged world,\" meaning that he hates both cats and dogs.\n\n==Production==\n''Oliver & Company'' was the twenty-seventh [[animation|animated]] film developed by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], and the first one to begin production under the supervision of then-CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]]; the duo, who had previously worked at [[Paramount Pictures]] as chairman and head of production, respectively, joined the company in 1984.<ref name=\"disneytwist\">{{cite news|title='Oliver & Company' Gives Dickens A Disney Twist urban scene from an appropriate rooftop.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/movies/film-oliver-company-gives-dickens-disney-twist-urban-scene-appropriate-rooftop.html|first=John|last=Culhane|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 13, 1988|access-date=July 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525085252/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/movies/film-oliver-company-gives-dickens-disney-twist-urban-scene-appropriate-rooftop.html|archive-date=May 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After the release of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985), Eisner and Katzenberg invited the animators to pitch potential ideas for upcoming animated features, infamously called the \"Gong Show.\" After [[Ron Clements]] had pitched ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Treasure Planet|Treasure Island in Space]]'', story artist Pete Young suggested, \"''Oliver Twist'' with dogs.\" Katzenberg, who had previously planned on producing a live-action adaptation of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' at Paramount,<ref name=\"disneytwist\"/> approved the pitch.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pp=93\u201394}} Under the working title of ''Oliver and the Dodger'',{{sfn|Beck|2005|pp=182-83}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Willistein|title=Disney Gearing Up For More Animation|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-11-22/entertainment/2601792_1_animation-disney-characters-disney-theme-parks|work=[[The Morning Call]]|date=November 22, 1987|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> the film was originally much darker and grittier with the film opening with Sykes's two [[Doberman]]s murdering Oliver's parents, setting the story to focus on Oliver exacting his revenge as detailed in a draft dated on March 30, 1987.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=192}}\n\n[[George Scribner]] and [[Richard Rich (filmmaker)|Richard Rich]] were announced as the directors of the project, while Pete Young was appointed as story supervisor.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=90}} However, Rich was fired from Disney about six months into production, leaving Scribner as the sole director.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Noyer|first=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie|title=Once Upon A Time In New York City: Oliver & Company's Director George Scribner!|url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/once-upon-a-time-in-new-york-city-oliver-companys-director-george-scribner/|website=Animated Views|date=February 3, 2009|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref> In this adaptation, Scribner turned Oliver into a na\u00efve kitten, Dodger and the gang into dogs, and Fagin into a human, and encouraged the film to be more street smart.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=192}} Furthermore, Scribner borrowed a technique from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955) by [[blocking (stage)|blocking out]] the scenes on real streets, and then photographing them with cameras mounted eighteen inches off the ground.
