V. DeVincentis, [[Steve Pink]] and [[John Cusack]]. It stars Cusack, [[Minnie Driver]], [[Alan Arkin]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] and follows the story of assassin Martin Q. Blank (Cusack), who returns to his [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan|titular hometown]] to attend a [[class reunion|high school reunion]]. The film's score was composed by [[Joe Strummer]], former member of the [[punk rock]] band [[the Clash]]; the film's soundtrack contains a number of popular and alternative punk rock, [[ska]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] songs.\n\n''Grosse Pointe Blank'' was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], receiving generally positive reviews from critics and grossing $31 million.\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[Contract killing|professional assassin]] Martin Blank prepares for a job, his assistant, Marcella, informs him that he has received an invitation to his ten-year high school reunion. A rival assassin, Grocer, approaches him about joining his fledgling union, which Martin refuses, preferring to work alone. Martin\u2019s job goes badly when he is forced to shoot the target, even though the assignment was to make it appear the target died of natural causes. His client demands that he make amends by killing [[Whistleblower|a Federal witness]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], close to his hometown of [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan|Grosse Pointe]], where the reunion is taking place.\n\nIn Grosse Pointe Martin reconnects with his childhood friend Paul and high-school sweetheart, Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the [[United States Army|Army]].\n\nMartin is stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, another hitman, who attempts to kill Martin. He is also followed by two [[National Security Agency]] agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Martin remains distracted by his desire to reconcile with Debi and procrastinates in opening the dossier on his target. Grocer reveals that LaPoubelle was hired by a wealthy dog owner whose prize retriever was killed on one of Martin's previous assignments. Martin reveals that he knows Grocer put the agents on his trail and again refuses to join the union.\n\nDebi is conflicted about her feelings for Martin, but he manages to persuade her to attend the reunion with him. At the reunion Martin and Debi rekindle their relationship as they dance together intimately, and sneak off to have sex. Martin runs into LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and flees the reunion in shock.\n\nDebi confronts Martin in his hotel room. He reveals that when he joined the Army his psychological profile indicated a \"moral flexibility\" that prompted the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to recruit him as an assassin, after which he decided to freelance. Martin assures Debi that he accepts only contracts on corrupt individuals. His efforts to rationalize his work anger Debi and she rejects his attempts at reconciliation.\n\nMartin decides to retire from being a contract killer. He fires his psychiatrist, Oatman, over the phone, provides Marcella with a generous [[severance package|severance]] and finally opens the dossier detailing the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe. He discovers the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.\n\nGrocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client and eliminate Martin as a competitor. Martin abandons the contract, saves Bart and takes him home. Grocer, his cohorts, and the NSA agents descend upon the house. During the siege Martin tells Debi that he left her on prom night to protect her from his homicidal urges; however, having fallen in love with Debi again, he has developed a newfound respect for life. Martin kills Grocer's henchmen and they both shoot the NSA agents when they burst onto the scene. Out of ammunition, Martin takes out Grocer with a TV set.  Martin proposes marriage to Debi, who is too stunned by the killing spree to respond, though Debi's father quips, \"You have my blessing.\"\n\nDebi and Martin leave Grosse Pointe together, with Martin visibly cheerful, and Debi confessing on her prerecorded radio show that she's decided to give love another chance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Martin Q.

I said: \"Look, I'm not doing anything over 100 pages.\" They said, \"Okay,\" and they did a rewrite, and it came back 150 pages. So I said \"Okay, you guys are fired,\" and I spent most of preproduction rewriting the screenplay, getting it down to 102 pages. Then we would improvise, and I noticed that some of the stuff I'd cut out was in the improvs, they were bringing back stuff that I'd cut out, but we had a good time with it.<ref name=\"film\">{{Cite web |date=April 28, 2015 |author=Nick Pinkerton |website=Film Comment |title=Interview: George Armitage |url=https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/ }}</ref></blockquote>\n{{Anchor|Locations}}\nOnly the aerial footage of Lakeshore Drive was actually shot in Grosse Pointe.<ref name=\"dfp\" /> The city of Grosse Pointe Farms did not allow the filmmakers to use any shots of [[Grosse Pointe South High School]] for the movie due to the presence of alcohol in the reunion scenes. The majority of the film was shot in [[Monrovia, California]].<ref name=\"dfp\" /> In a 1997 interview, actor John Cusack, who shares the film's screenwriting credit along with Jankiewicz, [[Steve Pink]], and [[D.

DeVincentis]], said he would have liked to film on location in Grosse Pointe, but they were unable to move production to Michigan due to budget constraints.<ref name=\"dfp\" />\n\nThe scene where Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle while exploring the halls of his old high school was filmed at [[Reseda High School]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\nArmitage later recalled:\n<blockquote>With ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' I shot three movies simultaneously. We shot the script as written, we shot a mildly understated version, and we shot a completely over-the-top version, which usually was what was used. We cast that movie\u2014and I've cast most movies\u2014by having the actors come in and read, then throwing the script out and saying: \"Okay, let's improvise.\" That's what I was comfortable with. I say to the actors: \"You are creating the character. This is written, these are the parameters, this is the outline. Now you take this, make it your own, and bring me, bring me, bring me.\"... I'm very fond of ''Grosse Pointe Blank'' because of that, the insanity of it was trying to keep things working with three different registers to choose from.<ref name=\"film\" /></blockquote>\nArmitage says he shot several endings:\n<blockquote>I'm usually rather rough on studio heads in terms of creative help, but after seeing the audience so angry at [[Alec Baldwin]] dying in ''[[Miami Blues]]'', I decided that on ''Grosse Pointe Blank'', this time, dealing with another [[psychopath]], another [[sociopath]], John's character\u2014I just wanted him to survive, and we shot so many different endings. They were so generous at Disney, we had [[Michael Ovitz]] and [[Joe Roth]] running the place, they were really great with us. We shot two or three different endings, the two of them getting together, talking about things, and everything didn't work. And Joe Roth said at one of the screenings: \"When the father says 'You've got my blessing' in the bathtub at the end, after the shoot-out, just cut to the two of them leaving.\" I thought, \"Let's give it a shot,\" and it worked beautifully.<ref name=\"film\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned an estimated $6,870,397 in its opening weekend, ranking number four at the box office.
