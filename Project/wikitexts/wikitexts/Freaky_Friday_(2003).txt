It stars [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]] as a mother and daughter, respectively, whose bodies are switched by a mysterious and magical Chinese [[fortune cookie]].\n\nThe film was released in theaters on August 6, 2003, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]]. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly that of Curtis and Lohan), but criticized the transformation scene.

It was Disney's third film adaptation of the novel, after the [[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|1976 film]], starring [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] and [[Jodie Foster]], and the 1995 [[Freaky Friday (1995 film)|made-for-TV film]], starring [[Shelley Long]] and [[Gaby Hoffmann]].\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring teenage [[musician]] Anna Coleman lives with her widowed [[therapist]] mother, Tess, and younger brother, Harry. Tess is about to marry her fianc\u00e9, Ryan, whom Anna has not entirely accepted as she has not properly moved on from the death of her biological father three years earlier.\n\nAt school, Anna's English teacher, Mr. Elton Bates, treats her unfairly, giving her an F on every assignment regardless of how well she does. She is also feuding with Stacey Hinkhouse, her former best friend-turned-nemesis and a bully. Anna has a crush on a school staff member, Jake, of whom her mother disapproves. Anna also serves as the lead guitarist in the band, Pink Slip, which is scheduled to audition for a spot in [[Wango Tango]] at the [[House of Blues]], the same night as the wedding rehearsal, so Tess forbids Anna from going. At a dinner at Pei-Pei's [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] restaurant, the two get into a heated argument. Pei-Pei's mother interrupts their quarrel by giving them [[fortune cookie]]s. They both go into separate rooms, read their fortunes aloud, and immediately feel an intense [[earthquake]] to which the rest of the restaurant is oblivious.\n\nThe next morning, Anna and Tess wake up in each other's bodies. \"Anna\" (Tess in her daughter's body) goes to school and begins to fully understand her daughter's woes. She experiences bullying from Stacey and recognizes Mr. Bates as an old high school classmate, realizing that he is treating Anna unfairly as revenge for Tess turning down a prom invitation from him years ago. \"Anna\" threatens Mr. Bates with reporting him to the school board unless his treatment of Anna stops. Meanwhile, \"Tess\" (Anna in her mother\u2019s body), after giving her new body a makeover, has difficulty handling the patients. At lunchtime, \"Anna\" and \"Tess\" return to the restaurant, but Pei-Pei explains that only showing selfless love for each other will cause the switch to be reversed.\n\n\"Tess\" attends Harry's parent-teacher conference, where she reads a composition about how much he actually admires Anna, and decides to be nicer to him. \"Anna\" attempts to make amends with Stacey, but Stacey frames her for cheating on a test and \"Anna\" gets sent to detention. When Jake notices \"Anna\" sneaking out of detention, he offers to help her finish the test. Jake takes \"Anna\" to the file room in the teachers' lounge and she realizes that she misjudged him, but he loses his enamoration towards \"Anna\" after she sabotages Stacey's test by erasing most of the answers and writing \"I'M STUPID!\" on it. Ryan surprises \"Tess\" with a [[talk show]] interview to discuss her latest [[psychology]] book. To disguise the fact that she hasn't read the book, \"Tess\" goes into an amusing tirade about getting older. \"Anna\" and Jake watch the interview on television and while she is embarrassed, he is impressed. \"Tess\" bumps into Jake at his second job, a coffee shop, and they bond over their favorite music.\n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Anna's friends Maddie and Peg, two of her bandmates, try to convince \"Anna\" to sneak off to the audition, but they are caught by security. Ryan surprisingly gives \"Anna\" permission to go, explaining that he just wants the kids to accept him, and urges \"Tess\" to support the band, finally winning her over. Since \"Anna\" cannot play, \"Tess\" plays the guitar backstage while \"Anna\"  mimes along. Realizing her daughter is indeed musically talented, \"Anna\" promises to treat her daughter's band with more respect, and during the show, Jake becomes enamored with \"Anna\" again upon seeing her perform.\n\nBack at the rehearsal dinner, \"Anna\" tells \"Tess\" to ask Ryan to postpone the wedding, so that her daughter will not have to marry him in her mother's body. Instead, \"Tess\" proposes a toast, finally accepting Ryan because of how happy he makes her mom. This act of selfless love switches back Anna's and Tess' bodies. Tess and Ryan later marry, she and Anna finally reconcile, realizing how tough their lives are, and Tess allows Anna to start dating Jake.\n\nAt the wedding, Pei-Pei notices her mother offering Anna's grandfather, Alan, and Harry two fortune cookies after seeing them argue. She immediately rushes over, tackles them both, and grabs the cookies. During the credits, Anna is playing with her band at Ryan's and Tess's wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Tess Coleman/Anna Coleman\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Anna Coleman/Tess Coleman\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Alan Coleman\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Jake \n* [[Mark Harmon]] as Ryan\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Mr. Elton Bates\n* [[Ryan Malgarini]] as Harry Coleman\n* [[Christina Vidal]] as Maddie\n* [[Haley Hudson]] as Peg\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Pei-Pei\n* [[Lucille Soong]] as Pei-Pei's mother\n* [[Julie Gonzalo]] as Stacey Hinkhouse\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Evan\n* [[Dina Waters]] as Dottie Robertson \n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Joe\n* [[Alex Handzus]] as Zachary\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nLohan's character was originally written as [[Goth subculture|goth]], but she did not think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a [[preppy]] style for her audition.
