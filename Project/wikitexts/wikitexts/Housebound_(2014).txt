Due to her history of recidivism, she is sentenced to [[house arrest]] for eight months under the care of her mother, Miriam. Kylie does not get along with either her mother or her step-father, Graeme. A security contractor, Amos, explains that Kylie's [[ankle monitor]] will alert the police if she ever leaves the premises of her mother's house.\n\nKylie is further frustrated when Miriam claims the [[Haunted house|house is haunted]]. After a disembodied hand grabs her in the basement, Kylie becomes convinced that an intruder is in the house. Amos takes Miriam's suggestion of a haunting seriously, and promises to return with [[ghost hunting]] equipment. After a series of unexplained experiences, Kylie comes to believe there may truly be a [[ghost]] in the house. Dennis, Kylie's clinical psychologist, becomes concerned with what he believes to be delusions in Miriam and Kylie. Graeme reveals that their home was once a [[halfway house]] and the site of a horrific murder. They discover evidence of the crime, including an [[Retainer (orthodontics)|orthodontic retainer]].\n\nWhen Kylie and Amos discover that her neighbour uses a retainer, Kylie breaks into the man's house as she attempts to take his retainer. After she flees back home and hides in the basement, she panics and accidentally stabs Graeme. Amos attempts to break into her neighbour's house next but the neighbour says that he is not the killer. He tells the story of a young savant, Eugene, whom he adopted. Eugene is an expert at mechanics and electronics, and disappeared a year before the killing, though the neighbour believes him to be responsible.\n\nKylie discovers Eugene's secret hallways in their house. She and Amos converge at the police station, and Amos corroborates her wild stories of a serial killer living in the hidden passageways. However, the police find no evidence, and Dennis convinces all involved that it would be best if Kylie were institutionalized. Once Dennis reveals that he wears a retainer, Kylie becomes suspicious of him. When she confronts him with evidence that he was an intern at the halfway house, he attempts to kill Miriam and Kylie, while incapacitating Amos. Kylie and Miriam flee into the secret tunnels, where they encounter Eugene.\n\nRealizing that their paranormal activity has been Eugene all this time, they are at first frightened but realize that he is friendly. Dennis stabs Eugene, knocks out Kylie, and begins to strangle Miriam. Eugene wakes Kylie and hands her a weapon, which she uses to stab Dennis. Eugene throws a switch, and high voltage explodes Dennis' head. Months later, all have recovered, Amos removes Kylie's ankle monitor, and Eugene has seemingly become an accepted (albeit mostly unseen) member of the household.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Morgana O'Reilly]] as Kylie Bucknell\n*[[Rima Te Wiata]] as Miriam Bucknell\n*Glen-Paul Waru as Amos\n*[[Cameron Rhodes]] as Dennis\n*Ross Harper as Graeme\n*Ryan Lampp as Eugene\n*Mick Innes as Mads Kraglund\n*[[Bruce Hopkins (actor)|Bruce Hopkins]] as Officer Carson \n*Millen Baird as Officer Grayson\n*Wallace Chapman as Mr. Hollis\n*Nikki Si\u2019ulepa as Leslie\n*[[Ian Mune]] as Judge\n\n==Production==\nJohnstone was first inspired to create a horror film after watching ''[[Ghosthunters (TV series)|Ghosthunters]]'' on television and received additional inspiration from classic films such as ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]''.<ref name=AC>{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=SXSW Gets 'Housebound|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/sxsw/2014-03-11/sxsw-gets-housebound/|publisher=Austin Chronicle|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> While writing the script Johnstone wanted the character of Kylie to be \"someone that wouldn't scare easily.
