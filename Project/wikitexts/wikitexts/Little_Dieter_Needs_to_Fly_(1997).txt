The film follows the life of [[Dieter Dengler]], in particular being shot down during the [[Vietnam War]] and his capture, imprisonment, escape, and rescue.\n\n''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'' was released on DVD in 1998 by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]], and on Blu-Ray in 2014 by Shout! Factory as a part of a larger collection of Herzog's films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shoutfactory.com/product/herzog-the-collection-limited-edition?product_id=3277 |title = Herzog: The Collection [Limited Edition] - Blu-ray :: Shout! Factory}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Werner Herzog]] found a kindred spirit in the [[German-American]] [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilot and [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Dieter Dengler]]. Like Herzog, Dengler grew up in a Germany reduced to rubble by [[World War II]], and Dengler's stories of hunger and deprivation in the years after the war echo similar stories from Herzog's past. Dengler recounts an early memory of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[fighter-bomber]]s destroying his village and says he decided he wanted to be a pilot after seeing one of these pilots fly past his house.\n\nAt the age of 18, Dengler emigrated to  the United States, where he served a two-year enlistment in the [[United States Air Force]]. Frustratingly, he was unable to gain a pilot's slot in that service, so he left the Air Force, attended college, and then joined the Navy. After completing flight training, he was assigned as a [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]] pilot in [[Attack Squadron 65 (U.S. Navy)|Attack Squadron 65]] aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}.\n\nIn 1966, Dengler served aboard {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}} with [[VA-145 (U.S. Navy)|Attack Squadron 145]]. At the time, the squadron was equipped with the Douglas AD-6/A-1H Skyraider, a single-engine, propeller-driven attack plane. On the morning of 1 February, Lieutenant Dengler launched from ''Ranger'' with three other aircraft on an [[interdiction]] mission near the Laotian border. Visibility was poor due to weather, and upon rolling in on the target, Dengler and the remainder of his flight lost sight of one another. Dengler was the last man in and was hit by anti-aircraft fire. He was forced to crash-land his Skyraider in Laos.\n\nDengler was taken [[prisoner of war]] by the [[Pathet Lao]] and then turned over to soldiers of the Army of [[North Vietnam]]. After a period of [[torture]] and starvation spent handcuffed to six other prisoners in a bamboo [[prisoner-of-war camp]], Dengler escaped. He was subsequently rescued after being spotted by United States Air Force pilot [[Eugene Peyton Deatrick|Eugene Deatrick]].\n\nThe bulk of the middle of the film consists of footage from a trip Herzog took with Dengler back to Laos and Thailand to recreate his ordeal three decades after the fact. Herzog hired locals to play the part of the captors and had Dengler retrace his steps while describing his experiences. A postscript consisting of footage from Dengler's funeral in 2001 was later added to the film.\n\nHerzog subsequently directed ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', a feature film based on the events of Dengler's capture, imprisonment, escape, and rescue. That film, starring [[Christian Bale]] as Dengler, was released on 24 July 2007.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dieter Dengler]] as himself\n* [[Werner Herzog]] (voice) as himself/narrator\n* [[Eugene Peyton Deatrick|Eugene Deatrick]] as himself\n\n==Reception==\n''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'' received critical acclaim.
