It was released by [[MGM]] in 1941 and was directed by [[W. S. Van Dyke]]. It stars [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Nick and Nora Charles]]. Also, in this film their son Nick Jr. (Dickie Hall) is old enough to figure in the comic subplot. Other cast members include [[Donna Reed]] and [[Barry Nelson (actor)|Barry Nelson]]. This was one of three films in which [[Stella Adler]] appeared.\n\n==Plot==\nNick and Nora Charles are looking forward to a relaxing day at a racetrack, but when a jockey accused of throwing a race is found shot to death, Police Lieutenant Abrams requests Nick's help. The trail leads to a gambling syndicate that operates out of a wrestling arena, a murdered reporter, and a pretty secretary whose boyfriend has been framed. Along the way, Nick and Nora must contend with a wild wrestling match, a dizzying day at a merry-go-round (accompanied by Nick, Jr.), and a table-clearing restaurant brawl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Powell]] as Nick Charles\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Nora Charles\n* [[Barry Nelson (actor)|Barry Nelson]] as Paul Clarke\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Stella\n* [[Donna Reed]] as Molly\n* [[Sam Levene]] as Lieutenant Abrams\n* [[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]] as \"Whitey\" Barrow\n* [[Henry O'Neill]] as Major Jason I.
