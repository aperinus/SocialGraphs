Loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage, the film follows a group of women in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] who are stalked by a killer wearing a [[Cupid]] mask.\n\nReleased theatrically on February 2, 2001, the film was critically panned, with critics deeming it too similar to 1980s slasher films. The film earned $36.7 million on a $29 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a [[junior high]] school [[St. Valentine's Day]] [[dance]] in 1988 [[San Francisco]], Jeremy Melton, an outcast student, asks four popular girls to dance. The first three girls, Shelley, Lily, and Paige, reject him spitefully and cruelly, while the fourth girl, Kate, politely responds, \"maybe later.\" Their rich friend Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation, and they proceed to make out underneath the bleachers. When the school bully Joe Tulga and his friends discover them, Dorothy falsely claims that Jeremy sexually assaulted her. Joe and his friends publicly strip and severely beat Jeremy, and his nose starts bleeding under the distress. It is later revealed Jeremy was expelled and eventually transferred to reform school and juvenile hall, due to Lily, Paige, Shelley and Joe testifying against him for unwanted sexual advances towards Dorothy, and then ended up in a state-run mental institution.\n\nThirteen years later, in 2001, Shelley, now a medical student at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], is at the morgue one evening studying for her medical exam. After receiving a vulgar Valentine's card in her locker, Shelley discovers someone has taken the place of the cadaver they had been dissecting. After being attacked by someone in a trench coat and [[Cupid]] mask, Shelley is cornered in a cooler where she attempts to hide in a [[body bag]], but the killer finds her before slitting her throat. The killer's nose bleeds as she dies.\n\nAt Shelley's funeral, Kate, Lily, Paige, and Dorothy are questioned. They admit to not having seen her in some time after she moved from San Francisco to [[Los Angeles]]. Paige, Lily and Dorothy subsequently receive obscene cards, each signed \"JM\".  Lily's card comes with a box of chocolates which she finds are filled with [[maggot]]s. Meanwhile, Dorothy's boyfriend, Campbell, loses his apartment and temporarily moves in with her at her father's large mansion.\n\nAs the girls attend the exhibit of Lily's artist boyfriend Max, they meet Campbell's bitter ex-girlfriend Ruthie, who accuses him of being a [[con artist]]. Lily becomes lost at the exhibit and the killer appears, who proceeds to shoot her repeatedly with arrows until she falls several floors into a dumpster. When they have not heard from Lily, the others assume she is in Los Angeles on a work trip. Upon contacting the police, they agree that the culprit can be Jeremy Melton. Dorothy admits to Kate and Paige that she lied to avoid being humiliated and that Jeremy never attacked her; ruining his life by causing him to be beaten and sent to reform school. Meanwhile, Kate's neighbor Gary breaks into her apartment to steal her underwear. The killer catches Gary in the act and hits him with a hot iron, then proceeds to brutally beat him to death with the object.\n\nAs Valentine's Day approaches, Dorothy is planning a [[party]] at her family's estate. On the morning of the party, the killer murders Campbell with an ax in the basement. The others assume he has simply left Dorothy, angering her, to which Dorothy believes that they are jealous and still look at her as the \"fat girl\" of the group. She confesses Jeremy never assulted her. After coming to the party to confront Dorothy with the truth about Campbell, Ruthie is thrown through a shower window by the killer, who then impales her neck on the glass. At the party, Paige is attacked and trapped in a hot tub by the killer. The killer impales her in the shoulder with an electric [[drill]] before throwing it into the water, electrocuting her.\n\nThe party disintegrates when the power cuts out, cause Paige was killed, and Dorothy and Kate argue over who the killer is. Kate claims that Campbell could be a suspect because they do not know anything about him or where he is, while Dorothy counters by accusing Adam, Kate's recovering alcoholic on-off boyfriend, who is now a journalist. After being told by Lily's boyfriend that she did not arrive in Los Angeles as planned, Kate realizes she is also probably dead and calls Detective Vaughn who was assigned to the case. After dialing the number, she follows the sound of a ringtone outside the house and discovers Vaughn's severed head in the pond. Kate becomes convinced that Adam is actually Jeremy, disguised by reconstructive surgery, and goes back into the house, only to find Adam waiting for her. To her surprise, he asks her to dance. Kate becomes frightened and flees. She runs through the house, discovering Dorothy's room trashed and Paige and Ruthie's corpses. She locates a gun, but the Cupid masked killer jumps out from the darkness and sends them both tumbling down a staircase. The killer arises and is shot to death by Adam.\n\nAs a shocked and confused Kate apologizes profusely, Adam pulls off the killer's mask to reveal Dorothy. Adam forgives Kate, explaining that childhood trauma can lead to lifelong anger and some people are eventually forced to act on that anger, referring to Dorothy. As Kate and Adam wait for the police to arrive, they hug and Adam says he has always loved her. Moments later, when Kate closes her eyes, Adam's nose begins to bleed, revealing that he is in fact Jeremy Melton (and also the actual killer having knocked out Dorothy and put her in the costume), who set everything up to ruin Dorothy's reputation and exact revenge.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Paige Prescott\n** Chelcie Burgart as young Paige\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Kate Davies\n** Brittany Mayers as young Kate\n* [[Jessica Capshaw]] as Dorothy Wheeler\n** Kate Logie as young Dorothy\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Lily Voight\n** Chelsea Florko as young Lily\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Shelley Fisher\n** Sarah Mjanes as young Shelley\n* [[David Boreanaz]] as Adam Carr/Jeremy Melton\n** Joel Palmer as young Jeremy Melton\n* [[Fulvio Cecere]] as Detective Leon Vaughn\n* [[Hedy Burress]] as Ruthie Walker\n* [[Daniel Cosgrove]] as Campbell Morris\n* [[Johnny Whitworth]] as Max Raimi\n* Claude Duhamel as Gary Taylor\n* [[Adam J.
