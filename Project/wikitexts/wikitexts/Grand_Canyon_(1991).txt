Featuring an [[ensemble cast]], the film is about random events affecting a diverse group of people, exploring the race- and class-imposed chasms which separate members of the same community.\n\nThe film was produced and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] and was released on Christmas Day, 1991. ''Grand Canyon'' was advertised as \"''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' for the '90s\", in reference to an earlier Kasdan film.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter attending a [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] basketball game, an immigration lawyer named Mack finds himself at the mercy of potential [[Robbery|muggers]] when his car breaks down in a bad part of [[Los Angeles]] late at night. The muggers are talked out of their plans by Simon, a tow truck driver who arrives just in time. Mack sets out to befriend Simon, despite their having nothing in common.\n\nIn the meantime, Mack's wife Claire and his best friend Davis, a [[film producer|producer]] of violent [[action film]]s, are experiencing life-changing events. Claire encounters an abandoned baby while jogging and becomes determined to [[adoption|adopt]] her. Davis suddenly becomes interested in philosophy rather than [[box-office]] [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s after being shot in the leg by a man trying to [[theft|steal]] his watch, vowing to devote the remainder of his career to eliminating violence from the [[Film|cinema]].\n\nThe film chronicles how these characters\u2014as well as various acquaintances, co-workers and relatives\u2014are affected by their interactions in the light of life-changing events. In the end, they visit the [[Grand Canyon]] on a shared vacation trip, united in a place that is philosophically and actually \"bigger\" than all their little separate lives.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Danny Glover]] as Simon\n*[[Kevin Kline]] as Mack\n*[[Steve Martin]] as Davis\n*[[Mary McDonnell]] as Claire\n*[[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Dee\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Jane\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Roberto\n*[[Tina Lifford]] as Deborah\n*Patrick Malone as Otis\n*[[Randle Mell]] as The Alley Baron\n*Sarah Trigger as Vanessa\n*Destinee DeWalt as Kelley\n}}\n\n==Production==\nWriter-director Lawrence Kasdan explained, \"Part of what ''Grand Canyon'' is about is that we have accepted the fact that our city is not our own. That for people from South Central, for them to go into Beverly Hills and West L.A., the police are on the lookout. They feel unwelcome, are under threat. And vice-versa.
