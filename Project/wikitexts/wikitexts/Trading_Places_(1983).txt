Starring [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Ralph Bellamy]], [[Don Ameche]], [[Denholm Elliott]], and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the film tells the story of an upper-class [[commodity broker|commodities broker]] (Aykroyd) and a poor street hustler (Murphy) whose lives cross when they are unwittingly made the subject of an elaborate bet to test how each man will perform when their life circumstances are swapped.\n\nHarris conceived the outline for ''Trading Places'' in the early 1980s after encountering two wealthy brothers who were engaged in an ongoing rivalry with each other. He and his writing partner Weingrod developed the idea as a project to star [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Gene Wilder]]. When they were unable to participate, Landis cast Aykroyd\u2014with whom he had worked previously\u2014and a young but increasingly popular Murphy in his second feature-film role. Landis also cast Curtis, against the intent of the studio, [[Paramount Pictures]]; she was famous mainly for her roles in horror films, which were looked down upon at the time. [[Principal photography]] took place from December{{nbsp}}1982 to March{{nbsp}}1983, entirely on location in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York City]]. [[Elmer Bernstein]] scored the film, using [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera buffa]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' as an underlying theme.\n\n''Trading Places'' was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $90.4 million to become the [[1983 in film|fourth-highest-grossing film of 1983]] in the United States and Canada, and $120.6{{nbsp}}million worldwide. It also received generally positive reviews, with critics praising both the central cast and the film's revival of the [[screwball comedy]] genre prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s while criticizing ''Trading Places'' for lacking the same moral message of the genre while promoting the accumulation of wealth. It received multiple award nominations including an [[Academy Award]] for Bernstein's score and won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards for Elliott and Curtis. The film also launched or revitalized the careers of its main cast, who each appeared in several other films throughout the 1980s. In particular, Murphy became one of the highest-paid and most sought after comedians in Hollywood.\n\nIn the years since its release, the film has been reassessed both positively and negatively. It has been praised as one of the greatest comedy films and Christmas films ever made, but retrospective assessments have criticized its use of racial jokes and language. In 2010, the film was referenced in Congressional testimony concerning the reform of the commodities trading market designed to prevent the [[insider trading]] demonstrated in ''Trading Places''. In 1988, Bellamy and Ameche reprised their characters for Murphy's comedy film ''[[Coming to America]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nBrothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke own a [[Commodity market|commodities]] brokerage firm, Duke & Duke Commodity Brokers, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Holding opposing views on the issue of [[nature versus nurture]], they make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment\u2014switching the lives of two people on opposite sides of the [[social stratification|social hierarchy]] and observing the results. Witnessing an encounter between their managing director\u2014the well-mannered and educated Louis Winthorpe&nbsp;III, engaged to the Dukes' grandniece Penelope\u2014and poor black street hustler Billy Ray Valentine; Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence after the latter assumes he is being robbed. The Dukes decide to use them for their experiment. \n\nWinthorpe is framed as a thief, drug dealer and philanderer by Clarence Beeks, a man on the Dukes' payroll. He is fired from Duke & Duke, his bank accounts are frozen, he is denied entry to his Duke-owned home, and is vilified by Penelope and his friends. He befriends Ophelia, a prostitute who helps him in exchange for a financial reward once he is exonerated to secure her own retirement. The Dukes post bail for Valentine, install him in Winthorpe's former job, and grant him use of Winthorpe's home. Valentine becomes well versed in the business, using his street smarts to achieve success, and begins to act in a well-mannered way.\n\nDuring the firm's Christmas party, Winthorpe plants drugs in Valentine's desk, attempting to frame him, and brandishes a gun to escape. Later, the Dukes discuss their experiment and settle their wager for $1. They plot to return Valentine to the streets, but have no intention of taking back Winthorpe. Valentine overhears the conversation and seeks out Winthorpe, who has attempted suicide by overdosing. Valentine, Ophelia, and Winthorpe's butler, Coleman, nurse him back to health and inform him of the experiment. Watching a television news broadcast, they learn that Beeks is transporting a secret [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) report on orange crop forecasts. Winthorpe and Valentine remember large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes. They realize they will obtain the report early to [[cornering the market|corner the market]] on frozen concentrated orange juice.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, the four board Beeks' train in disguise, intending to switch the original report with a forgery that predicts low orange crop yields. Beeks uncovers their scheme, and attempts to kill them, but is knocked unconscious by a gorilla being transported on the train. The four disguise Beeks with a gorilla costume and cage him with the real gorilla. The group deliver the forged report to the Dukes in Beeks' place. After sharing a kiss with Ophelia, Winthorpe travels to [[New York City]] with Valentine, carrying with them Coleman's and Ophelia's life savings to carry out their plan.\n\nOn the commodities [[Open outcry|trading floor]], the Dukes commit their holdings to buying frozen concentrated orange juice [[futures contract]]s, legally committing themselves to buying the commodity at a later date. Other traders follow their lead, driving the price up; Valentine and Winthorpe [[Short (finance)|short-sell]] juice futures contracts at the inflated price. Following the broadcast of the actual crop report and its prediction of a normal harvest, the price of juice futures plummets. Valentine and Winthorpe buy at the lower price from everyone except the Dukes, fulfilling the contracts they had short-sold earlier, turning an immense profit. \n\nAfter the closing bell, Valentine and Winthorpe explain to the Dukes that they made a wager on whether they could get rich and make the Dukes poor at the same time, and Valentine collects $1 from Winthorpe. When the Dukes prove unable to supply the $394 million required to satisfy their [[margin call]], the exchange manager orders their seats sold and their corporate and personal assets confiscated, effectively [[bankruptcy|bankrupting]] them. Randolph collapses holding his chest and Mortimer shouts at the others, demanding the floor be reopened in a futile plea to recoup their losses. The now-wealthy Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia, and Coleman vacation on a luxurious tropical beach, while Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship bound for Africa.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | alt footer= Head shots of Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche | | footer = [[Ralph Bellamy]] in 1971 (left) and [[Don Ameche]] in 1964.

Following one session, Harris returned home exasperated with the pair's conflict and concluded that they were \"awful\" people. The situation gave him the idea of two brothers betting over nature versus nurture in terms of human ability. Harris shared the idea with his writing partner [[Herschel Weingrod]], who liked the concept. Harris also drew inspiration for the story from his own living situation; he lived in a rundown area near [[Fairfax Avenue]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He described the area in grim terms as crime-ridden, where everyone either had a gun pointed at them or had been raped.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/>\n\nHarris and Weingrod researched the commodities market for the script.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> They learned of financial market incidents, including Russian attempts to corner the wheat market and the Hunt brothers' efforts to corner the silver market on what became known as [[Silver Thursday]]. They thought trading orange juice and pork bellies would be funnier because the public would be unaware such mundane items were traded.<ref name=\"NPRHistory\"/> Harris consulted with people in the commodities business to understand how the film's finale on the [[Trading room|trading floor]] would work. The pair determined that the commodities market would make for an interesting setting for a film, as long as it was not about the financial market itself. They needed something to draw the audience in. It was decided to set the story in Philadelphia because of its connections to the founding of the United States of America, the American dream and idealism and the pursuit of happiness. This was tempered by introducing Billy Valentine as a black man begging on the street.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> The pair knew that the method of Winthorpe's and Valentine's financial victory could be confusing, but hoped that audiences would be too invested in the characters' success to care about the details.<ref name=\"NPRHistory\"/>\n\nThe script was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]] under the title ''Black and White''. Then-Paramount executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] offered the project to director [[John Landis]]. Landis disliked the working title,<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> but favorably compared the script to older [[screwball comedy|screwball comedies]] of the 1930s by directors like [[Frank Capra]], [[Leo McCarey]], and [[Preston Sturges]], which often satirized social constructs and social classes, reflecting the cultural issues of their time. Landis wanted his film to reflect these concepts in the 1980s;<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/><ref name=\"WAPOLandisInterview\"/> he said the main updates were the addition of swearing and nudity.<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> Landis admitted that it took him a while to understand how ''Trading Places''{{'}} finale worked.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Dan Aykroyd cropped.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A headshot of Dan Aykroyd|upright|[[Dan Aykroyd]] pictured in 2009. [[Paramount Pictures]] saw Aykroyd's success as tied to his partnership with the late [[John Belushi]], and the studio did not want to cast him, but his previous work with director [[John Landis]] helped him to secure the role]]\n''Trading Places'' was developed with the intent to cast comedy duo [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Gene Wilder]] as Billy Ray Valentine and Louis Winthorpe&nbsp;III respectively.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> The pair were in high demand following the success of their comedy film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> When Pryor was severely injured after setting fire to himself while [[freebasing]] cocaine, the decision was made to cast someone else.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"WAPOFreebasing\"/> Paramount Pictures suggested Eddie Murphy.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> The studio was initially unhappy with Murphy's performance in his first film, the as-then-unreleased action-comedy ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982)\u2014a film also conceived as a Pryor project.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribuneApril71985\"/> However, that film was well received by preview test audiences, leading the studio to reverse its opinion.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> Landis was unaware of Murphy, who had been gaining fame as a performer on ''Saturday Night Live''. After watching Murphy's audition tapes, Landis was impressed enough to travel to New York City to meet with him.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Murphy said that he was paid $350,000 for the role; it was reported that the figure was as high as $1{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"WashingtonPost350K\"/><ref name=\"WashingtonPost1Million\"/>\n\nLandis wanted Dan Aykroyd to serve as Murphy's co-star. He had worked previously with Aykroyd on the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980); the experience had been positive. Landis said, \"he could easily play [Winthorpe]&nbsp;... you tell him what you want, and he delivers. And I thought he'd be wonderful.\" Paramount Pictures was less enamored with Aykroyd; executives believed that he performed better as part of a duo, as he had working with [[John Belushi]]. They felt that Aykroyd working alone would be akin to [[Bud Abbott]], half of [[Abbott and Costello]], working without [[Lou Costello]] and Aykroyd's recent films had fared poorly at the box office. Aykroyd agreed to take a pay cut for the role.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/>\n\nThe studio also objected to the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis. At the time she was seen as a \"[[scream queen]]\", primarily associated with low-quality [[B movie]]s. Landis had worked previously with Curtis on the horror documentary ''[[Coming Soon (1982 film)|Coming Soon]]'', for which she had served as the host. She wanted to move away from horror films as she was conscious that the association would limit her future career prospects. She had turned down a role in the horror film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho&nbsp;II]]'' (1983) because of this. Her mother, [[Janet Leigh]], had famously starred in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Curtis had performed recently in the slasher film ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween&nbsp;II]]'' (1981) as a favor to director [[John Carpenter]] and producer [[Debra Hill]]; she was paid $1{{nbsp}}million for that role, but received only $70,000 for ''Trading Places''.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> When asked if she had researched her role as a prostitute, Curtis jokingly remarked: \"I'd love to say I went out and [[Turning tricks|turned a couple of tricks]] on 42nd Street, but I didn't.\"<ref name=\"PeopleCurtis\"/> Curtis had long hair when she was cast; costume designer [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis]] suggested cutting her hair shorter for the film.<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/>\n\nFor the greedy Duke brothers, [[Ralph Bellamy]] was the first choice for Randolph.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> For Mortimer, Landis wanted to cast an actor famous in the 1930s or 1940s who was not associated with playing a villain. His first choice was [[Ray Milland]], but the actor was unable to pass a physical test to qualify for insurance while filming. As the start date for filming loomed, Landis thought of Don Ameche. The casting director claimed that Ameche was dead.<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> Landis was skeptical of this and contacted the [[Screen Actors Guild]] in an attempt to locate him. They confirmed that Ameche had no agent, and his [[Residual (entertainment industry)|royalty payments]] were being forwarded to his son in [[Arizona]]. Landis accepted this as evidence that Ameche was deceased. However, after hearing of Landis' search, one of the Paramount Studios' secretaries mentioned that they saw Ameche regularly on [[San Vicente Boulevard (Santa Monica)|San Vicente Boulevard]] in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Landis called [[directory assistance]] to locate a \"D. Ameche\" in the area and made contact.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Ameche had not featured in a film for over a decade; when asked why, he said that no one had offered him film work.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"NYTImesJune171983\"/> The studio did not want to pay Ameche what Milland had been offered; as Ameche was financially independent and in no need of work, he refused to take the part until he received equal pay.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribuneAmechePay\"/><ref name=\"PeopleAmeche\"/> Landis claimed that the studio reduced the film's budget, frustrated at Ameche's casting after a long absence from film work.<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/>\n\n[[John Gielgud]] and [[Ronnie Barker]] were considered for the role of Winthorpe's butler, Coleman. Barker refused to act if it involved filming more than {{convert|7|mi}} from his home in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/><ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> [[G. Gordon Liddy]], a central figure in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate political scandal]] of the early 1970s, was offered the role of corrupt official Clarence Beeks. Liddy was interested in the offer until he learned that Beeks becomes the romantic partner of a gorilla. Paul Gleason took the role; his character reads a copy of Liddy's autobiography ''Will'' while riding the train.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> Don McLeod portrayed the gorilla; he had already become popular for his performances as a gorilla in [[American Tourister]] commercials, which led to film appearances.<ref name=\"DonMcLeod1\"/><ref name=\"DonMcLeod2\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Curtis Institute of Music - IMG 6559.JPG|alt=An angled photo of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, showing the front and right hand side|thumb|The [[Curtis Institute of Music]] pictured in 2010.

Changes were normally discussed in advance, but on other occasions, ad-libbed dialogue was considered funny enough to keep. Examples of ad-libs retained in the film include Valentine comparing Randolph to [[Randy Jackson (Jacksons singer)|Randy Jackson]] of [[The Jackson 5]] and demonstrating his \"quart of blood\" technique in jail.<ref name=\"WAPOLandisInterview\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneMurphy\"/> Murphy liked ''Trading Places''{{'}} script; he felt it was unlike ''48 Hrs.'', which he said had been saved by director [[Walter Hill]]. Even so, he changed many of his own lines because he said that a white writer writing for a black person would use stereotypical dialogue like \"jive turkey\" and \"sucker\", and he could write his lines to sound authentic.<ref name=\"RollingStoneMurphy\"/> Weingrod said the studio objected to Murphy's line, \"Who put their [[Kool (cigarette)|Kools]] out on my Persian rug?\" They believed it was racist because the Kool cigarette brand was targeted mainly at African Americans; Murphy restored the line.<ref name=\"WeinGrodInterview\"/> Ophelia pretending to be a European exchange student to fool Beeks was also improvised; Curtis used a mix of German attire with a Swedish accent because she could not perform a German accent.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/>\n\nThe first fifteen days of filming were spent in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Landis described the weather as freezing. While filming the scene where Randolph and Mortimer collect Valentine from jail, Landis was positioned in a towing truck that pulled the [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]] carrying Ameche, Bellamy and Murphy. Landis wore a thick [[parka]] to stay warm, and the actors had a [[space heater]] in their vehicle; Landis listened to their dialogue via radio. Describing the filming of the scene, Landis recalled a jovial discussion between Ameche, Bellamy, and Murphy: Bellamy said that ''Trading Places'' was his 99th film; Ameche said it was his 100th. Murphy informed Landis that \"between the three of us we've made 201 films!\"<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/> Filming locations in Philadelphia included townhouses in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] that served as the Winthorpe home exterior, and the [[Philadelphia Mint]] (now the [[Community College of Philadelphia]]) which served as the police station's exterior.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"MintturnedCollege\"/> The exterior and lobby of the [[Wells Fargo Building (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Building]] serve as the respective exterior and lobby of Duke & Duke.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"MetroPhilly\"/>\n\n[[File:Northwest, St Croix 00840, USVI - panoramio (17).jpg|alt=An aerial view of a beach in St Croix, showing a light blue ocean, sandy beach, and green trees|thumb|left|Winthorpe, Valentine, Ophelia, and Coleman retire with their gains to a tropical beach.

Empty lockups in police administration buildings would normally be in use but because of the financial investment the production had made filming in the city, the mayor's office agreed to accommodate Landis' request; the studio paid for any expenses incurred. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that for years the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision|Corrections Department]] had failed to deliver prisoners on time for trials and arraignments; despite this, they moved nearly 300 prisoners through the 12th-floor before 9{{nbsp}}a.m. on the day of filming.<ref name=\"NYTImesJaiLCell\"/>\n\nThe scene where Valentine and Winthorpe enact their plan against the Dukes was filmed at the [[COMEX (NYMEX)|COMEX]] commodity exchange located inside [[4 World Trade Center]]. The lack of windows gave the appearance the floor was situated below ground, but it was actually on a high floor. The scene was scripted to take place at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], but the filmmakers were unable to secure permission to film there.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> The scene was shot over approximately 3\u20134 hours a day over two days.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> It was scheduled to take place during a weekday, but Aykroyd's and Murphy's presence on the floor distracted the active traders and over $6{{nbsp}}billion of trading had to be halted; filming was rescheduled for a weekend.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> A majority of the people on screen are actual traders, along with some extras. Landis said the traders in the film were less physically rough with each other than they were during normal trading.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/><ref name=\"AFI\"/> Landis also performed some [[guerrilla filmmaking]] there for additional footage.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Ameche was opposed to using foul language and often apologized in advance to his crewmates for what he was scripted to say; he only performed one take of his final scene where he shouts \"fuck him\" towards Randolph.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> The final scene shot was of the main characters celebrating on a beach; this was filmed on [[Saint Croix]] island in the [[United States Virgin Islands]].<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"FilmStCroix\"/> Principal photography concluded on March{{nbsp}}1, 1983, after 78 days.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Mozart, The Marriage of Figaro (overture).ogg|title=''The Marriage of Figaro'' - Overture|description=Performed by [[Musopen|Musopen Symphony]] (4:00)}}\n[[Elmer Bernstein]] composed the score for ''Trading Places''.<ref name=\"MusicClassicFm\"/> He and Landis had collaborated previously on several films including ''The Blues Brothers'' and the horror-comedy ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"MusicRoyalAbertHall\"/> Landis conceived of the idea to use the [[opera buffa]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] as the underlying theme for the score.

Over 40 films were scheduled for release over the 16-week period.

Instead, the characters do not dismantle or expose the corruption of the financial system, they just take revenge on the Dukes, obtaining extreme wealth in the process. Even so, he concluded the film was one of the best American comedies released in a long time.<ref name=\"ReviewCanby\"/> Maslin agreed that the film was too enamored with the wealthy institutions it satirized to provide a true criticism of the system and its failings.

His successes with ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''Trading Places'' elevated him to film superstardom.]]\nAs predicted, the 1983 summer film season broke the previous year's record with over $1.5{{nbsp}}billion worth of tickets sold. It was seen as a substantial increase in spite of increased ticket prices.<ref name=\"NYTimesRecordSummer\"/> Even so, the year was a mixture of unexpected successes and disappointments. Films like ''Superman&nbsp;III'' and the action comedies ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part&nbsp;3]]'' and ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' had failed at the box office. The science fiction comedy ''[[The Man With Two Brains]]'' featuring an established star in [[Steve Martin]] had also underperformed.<ref name=\"NYTimesSep181983\"/> Conversely, ''Flashdance'' was an unexpected hit and the third highest-grossing film of the year, despite a negative critical reception.<ref name=\"NYTimesRecordSummer\"/> In September, ''The New York Times'' wrote that ''Trading Places'' was the only film of the fifteen top-grossing films that could be recommended without reservation.<ref name=\"NYTimesSep181983\"/> The film was well-received critically and considered a significant commercial success, along with ''Flashdance'' and ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref name=\"TheSpectator\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesSep181983\"/> Then-production vice president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA]] studio [[Peter Bart]] described it as a \"gimmick\" film that focused on a \"[[high-concept]]\" over story and characterization. Bart believed its success triggered a negative trend that resulted in him receiving numerous film pitches\u2014often a mix of the high-concept nature of ''Trading Places'' with a ''Flashdance''-inspired breakdancing or gym setting.<ref name=\"NYTimesOct101983\"/> Harris recalled people asking if the producer Aaron Russo or Katzenberg had created the idea and just paid him to write it. He said he knew it was a success because people were trying to take credit for it.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/>\n\n''Trading Places'' is considered responsible for launching, changing, or re-launching the careers of many of its stars.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Murphy's success was significant. He rose from a TV comedian to a superstar with two of the most successful films of the year.<ref name=\"NYTimesMurphyAfter\"/> Industry experts voted him as the biggest box-office star after [[Clint Eastwood]]. No other African-American actor had achieved a comparable level of success before him.<ref name=\"NYTimesMurphyAfter\"/> It was reported that Murphy earned up to $1{{nbsp}}million for ''Trading Places'', but by his third film, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), he commanded a $3{{nbsp}}million salary. This was considered a top-tier salary reserved for the most popular movie stars.<ref name=\"WashingtonPost1Million\"/>\n\nShortly after ''Trading Places''{{'}} release, Paramount Pictures signed Murphy to a $25{{nbsp}}million five-film exclusive contract\u2014one of the biggest deals ever with an actor at the time. The studio also agreed to finance his Eddie Murphy Productions studio.<ref name=\"WashingtonPost1Million\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesApril301984\"/> Murphy was among several young stars who emerged that year, including [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Tom Cruise]], and [[Michael Keaton]], who were all in their 20s. This reflected the fact that average audiences were aging and now in their late teens to late 20s, and led to a shift in focus away from making films targeted mainly at children.<ref name=\"NYTimesOct101983\"/> His rapid rise to fame led to Murphy leaving ''Saturday Night Live'' the following year; he said he had grown to dislike the job and felt he was resented for his success.<ref name=\"RollingStoneMurphy\"/>\n\nAfter a series of failures, ''Trading Places'' revitalized Aykroyd's career.<ref name=\"NYTimesJune251983\"/> Throughout the 1980s, he went on to star in the blockbuster phenomenon ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984),<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985) and ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'' (1987).

The pair had a falling out on the set of that film; even so, they collaborated again on ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' (1994).<ref name=\"EmpireRetrospective\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneMurphyLandis\"/><ref name=\"WAPOCollabs\"/> Harris and Weingrod were elevated to prominence as writers.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> They later sued ''Trading Places''{{'}} producer, [[Aaron Russo]], for an agreed upon 0.5% of the producer profits share, estimated to be worth $150,000; the outcome of this lawsuit is unknown.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn the early 1980s, the [[VCR]] home video market was gaining popularity rapidly. In previous years, VHS sales were not a revenue source for studios, but by 1983 they could generate up to 13% of a film's total revenue; the North American cassette rights could generate $500,000 alone.<ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia\"/> ''Trading Places'' was released on [[VHS]] in May 1984, priced at $39.95.<ref name=\"NYTimesMay1984\"/> Paramount distributed its own cassettes and priced them significantly lower than the standard $80 price to promote home user VCR adoption. A successful film was expected to earn between $5{{nbsp}}million and $10{{nbsp}}million on the home video market.<ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia\"/> In the rental market, ''Trading Places'' was one of the more popular releases in May, alongside the action thriller ''[[Sudden Impact]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia\"/> Paramount signed an exclusive deal to show its movies, including ''Trading Places'', on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] TV network for approximately $500{{nbsp}}million; this was seen as an attempt by Paramount to damage the network monopoly held by [[HBO]] that the studio saw as financially unfavorable.<ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesHBOSHowTime\"/>\n\n''Trading Places'' was first released on [[DVD]] in October 2002.<ref name=\"HomeMediaDVD\"/> A Special Collector's Edition (also known as the \"Looking Good, Feeling Good\" edition) was released in 2007 on DVD, [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]].

The other brokers realize what the Dukes are doing and join in buying futures.<ref name=\"BIWhatHappens\"/><ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/> This demand significantly inflates the price to $1.42 per pound\u2014each future represents several pounds of FCOJ. Winthorpe and Valentine begin selling futures at this inflated price, believing it to be the peak price; the contracts will require them to supply FCOJ in April.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/><ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/> Anticipating that the crop report will cause the value of FCOJ to rise far above $1.42, the other brokers purchase heavily from the pair.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/><ref name=\"BIWhatHappens\"/><ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/>\n\nOnce the real crop report is published indicating that the orange crop will be normal and there will be no shortage of FCOJ, the value of the futures plummets as the brokers desperately attempt to sell their futures and limit their financial losses.<ref name=\"BIWhatHappens\"/><ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/> Winthorpe and Valentine then buy back the futures from the brokers\u2014except for the Dukes' broker Wilson\u2014at the lower price of 29 cents a pound.<ref name=\"BIWhatHappens\"/><ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/> The difference is their profit. Effectively, they have sold FCOJ which they do not have at a high price and bought it back at a lower price, earning them a profit and eliminating the need to fulfill any contracts.<ref name=\"NPRWhatHappens\"/> Meanwhile, the Dukes have bought a significant number of FCOJ futures, around 100,000 contracts or 1.5{{nbsp}}million pounds of FCOJ and have been unable to sell any of them. When trading closes, they must meet the margin call\u2014essentially a deposit\u2014for holding the futures contracts. In addition to their basic financial loss from buying futures at up to $1.42 that are now worth only 29 cents, the margin call for holding the futures gives them a total loss of $394{{nbsp}}million,{{efn|The $394{{nbsp}}million the Dukes lose is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|394000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} which they do not have, requiring the sale of all of their assets.<ref name=\"HuffPoWhatHappened\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\n[[File:The Prince and The Pauper - 32-377.jpg|left|alt=A drawing of two young males. One is dressed in black, the other in royal garments.|thumb|A drawing from the 1882 novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' by [[Mark Twain]]. ''Trading Places'' is seen as a modern retelling of that story and Twain's 1893 short story ''[[The Million Pound Bank Note]]''.]]\nThe central storyline of ''Trading Places''\u2014a member of society trading places with another whose socio-economic status stands in direct contrast to his own\u2014has often been compared to the 1881 novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' by [[Mark Twain]].<ref name=\"ReviewEBERT\"/>{{sfn|Budd|2002|p=210}}{{sfn|Childs|2006|p=44}} The novel follows the lives of a prince and a beggar who use their uncanny resemblance to each other to switch places temporarily; the prince takes on a life of poverty and misery while the pauper enjoys the lavish luxuries of royal life.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> ''The Prince and the Pauper'' is seen as a classic tale of American literature; ''Trading Places'' adds a twist by casting an African-American as the pauper raised up in status, playing on fears of black usurpation and appropriation.{{sfn|Childs|2006|p=44}} The film has also been compared to Twain's 1893 short story ''[[The Million Pound Bank Note]]'', in which two brothers bet on the outcome of giving an impoverished person an unusable million-pound bank-note.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/><ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> The choice to use Mozart's opera buffa ''The Marriage of Figaro'' also adds meaning. The opera tells the tale of a servant, Figaro, who foils the plans of his wealthy employer to steal his fianc\u00e9e. When Winthorpe is driven to work during the film's opening, he hums \"[[Se vuol ballare]]\", an [[aria]] from ''The Marriage of Figaro'', in which Figaro declares he will overturn the systems in place. This foreshadows Winthorpe's eventual efforts to do the same to the Dukes.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/><ref name=\"MONAHAN\"/>\n\nThe main theme of ''Trading Places'' is the consequences of wealth or the lack thereof. Both extremes are depicted by those living in opulent luxury and those trapped in a [[culture of poverty]]\u2014a concept arguing that poor people adopt certain behaviors that keep them poor.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/> Harris has described the story as a satire of greed and social conventions, but in the end, the good guys win by becoming extremely rich.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> Economic inequality is demonstrated by the wealthy who live in luxury. They are completely removed from those whose lives are affected by poverty. This is demonstrated by the Dukes' bet, showing their own sense of superiority over, and disregard for, the lives of those beneath them, even Winthorpe. Their only reward for the bet is personal pride.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/> Author Carolyn Anderson noted that films often feature an \"introduction\" scene for characters elevated above their station, like Valentine, to help them understand the rules of their new world. Conversely, there is rarely a complementary scene for those subjected to [[Social mobility|downward mobility]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|p=161}}\n\nVincent Canby said that although the film is an homage to social satire screwball comedies of the early 20th century, ''Trading Places'' is a symbol of its time. Where the earlier films espoused the benefits of things other than money, ''Trading Places'' is built around the value of money and those who aspire to have it. The heroes win by making lots of money; the villains are punished by becoming part of the impoverished. The heroes' reward is escaping to a tropical island, completely divorced from the poverty-stricken neighborhoods that had previously been their home.<ref name=\"ReviewCanby\"/><ref name=\"WAPOSupplySide\"/><ref name=\"EmpireEssay\"/> Money is demonstrably a solution to all of the problems raised in the film, and when it is taken away, it is shown that people quickly resort to a basic criminal nature.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/> It can be seen as an example of [[supply-side economics]], alongside films like the comedies ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981) and ''[[Risky Business]]'' (1983). While seemingly supporting left-leaning political concepts by arguing that given an equal platform a street-hustler like Valentine can perform Winthorpe's job equally well, the film promotes right-leaning concepts like [[Political positions of Ronald Reagan|Reagan-era policies]] where the accumulation of wealth is highly valued.<ref name=\"WAPOSupplySide\"/>\n\nDavid Budd said ''Trading Places'' defies expectations of racial stereotypes. Randolph's attempts to prove nurture wins over nature demonstrates that Valentine, given the same advantages as Winthorpe, is just as capable, and leaves behind the negative aspects of his former, unfair life.{{sfn|Budd|2002|p=210}} Even so, once the Dukes' bet is complete, Mortimer reveals his intent to return Valentine to poverty, saying, \"Do you really believe I would have a [[nigger]] run our family business?\"; Randolph concurs, \"Neither would I.\"<ref name=\"EmpireEssay\"/> Budd concluded the film is a \"message loudly asking for a reassessment of prejudice, and for level playing fields\".{{sfn|Budd|2002|p=210}} Hernan Vera and Andrew Gordon argue racial stereotypes are enabled with the permission of the only black main character. As part of their revenge against the Dukes, Winthorpe disguises his identity by donning [[blackface]] makeup, an act enabled by Valentine who has helped loosen up this strait-laced character. Because Valentine allowed it, it makes the act acceptable. This requires Valentine to accept and support Winthorpe despite having numerous reasons to dislike him, including originally getting Valentine wrongly arrested and then later trying to frame Valentine to reclaim his old job. Even so, Valentine befriends Winthorpe and helps him get revenge on the Dukes, the old establishment characters who demonstrate explicit racism. The film requires Valentine to act \"white\", performing as is expected of him to survive in the Dukes' world.{{sfn|Vera|Gordon|2003|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n[[Stephen Schiff]] argues that because the film identifies money as the most valuable entity, this in turn means that Ophelia is only valuable as a prostitute because she is financially intelligent.<ref name=\"WAPOSupplySide\"/> Hadley Freeman said Ophelia is an example of the [[Smurfette principle]], a female character in an otherwise male ensemble cast who exists to be pretty and rescued by men.<ref name=\"GuardianApril2014\"/> However, it is Ophelia who rescues Winthorpe, helping him to survive his new lowered-state.<ref name=\"EmpireEssay\"/> Neal Karlen said Ophelia becomes a real person after telling Louis: \"All I've got going for me in this whole, big, wide world is this body, this face, and what I've got up here [referring to her brain].\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneOphelia\"/>\n\n''Trading Places'' also employs several conventions of its Christmas setting to highlight the individual loneliness of the main characters, in particular, Winthorpe. On Christmas Eve he humiliates himself in front of his former bosses, unwittingly losing his opportunity for his swap with Valentine to be undone by having become a criminal. While waiting outside a store, a dog urinates on him.{{sfn|Metcalf|1991|pp=101\u2013102}}<ref name=\"DOGXmas\"/> He attempts suicide and only fails because the gun does not fire; then it begins to rain on him.

Murphy portrays the affluent Prince Akeem who hands the now-homeless brothers a large sum of cash. Mortimer tells Randolph that it is enough to give them a new start.<ref name=\"IndieWireTidbits\"/> Of the two films, Murphy has said that while he \"loves\" ''Trading Places'', he prefers ''Coming to America'' because it allowed him to portray multiple characters.<ref name=\"YahooMurphy\"/> The 2021 sequel ''[[Coming 2 America]]'' also references the Dukes, revealing they used Akeem's donation to rebuild their business.<ref name=\"Coming2America\"/><ref name=\"Coming2America2\"/>\n\nHarris described one incident where a person told him they had obtained a career in finance because of ''Trading Places''; Harris said that this was counter to the film's message.<ref name=\"BIOralHistory\"/> An anonymous seller sold off their portion of the royalties earned from the film for $140,000 in 2019. At the time, the share was generating an average of $10,000 per annum.<ref name=\"RoyaltyAuction\"/><ref name=\"MoneyWatch\"/> A musical adaptation of ''Trading Places'' debuted at the [[Alliance Theater]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, on June 4, 2022.<ref>ArtsATL.org (June 1, 2022) https://www.artsatl.org/alliances-trading-places-musical-trades-some-dated-plotlines-for-inclusiveness/</ref>\n\nIn 2010, nearly 30 years after its release, the film was cited in the testimony of [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] chief [[Gary Gensler]] regarding new regulations on the financial markets. He said:<blockquote>We have recommended banning using misappropriated government information to trade in the commodity markets. In the movie ''Trading Places'', starring Eddie Murphy, the Duke brothers intended to profit from trades in frozen concentrated orange juice futures contracts using an illicitly obtained and not yet public Department of Agriculture orange crop report. Characters played by Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd intercept the misappropriated report and trade on it to profit and ruin the Duke brothers.<ref name=\"WSJMurphyRule\"/></blockquote> The testimony was part of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] designed to prevent [[insider trading]] on commodities markets, which had previously not been illegal. Section 746 of the reform act is referred to as the \"Eddie Murphy rule\".<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/>\n\n===Critical reassessment===\n''Trading Places'' is considered one of the best comedies of the 1980s and one of the best Christmas films.<ref name=\"Bestof80sUSAToday\"/><ref name=\"Bestof80sRT\"/><ref name=\"LastingRTXmas\"/> In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the joint thirty-third funniest on the WGA's 101 Funniest Screenplays list, tied with ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986).<ref name=\"WGAFunniest2\"/><ref name=\"WGAFunniest1\"/> In 2017, the [[BBC]] polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from 52 countries on the funniest film made. ''Trading Places'' came seventy-fourth, behind ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' (1988).<ref name=\"BBC253\"/> Several publications have named it one of the best films of the 1980s, including: number eight by ''[[IFC (American TV channel)|IFC]]'';<ref name=\"Bestof80sIFC\"/> number 17 by [[MTV]];<ref name=\"LastingMTV\"/> number 37 by ''[[USA Today]]'';<ref name=\"Bestof80sUSAToday\"/> and number 41 by [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\"Bestof80sRT\"/> It has also been listed as one of the best comedy films ever by publications including: number 16 by ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'';<ref name=\"LastingTimeOut\"/> number 26 by Rotten Tomatoes;<ref name=\"LastingRTList\"/> and number 48 by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.<ref name=\"LastingEmpire\"/>\n\nAlthough the film's story takes place over several weeks leading up to and after Christmas, ''Trading Places'' is regarded as a Christmas film.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/><ref name=\"DOGXmas\"/> In 2008, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it one of the most underrated Christmas films.<ref name=\"WAPOUnderrated\"/> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described it as a less traditional Christmas film, but one whose themes remain relevant, particularly regarding the divide between the wealthy and poor.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/> It has appeared on several lists of the best Christmas films, including: number 5 by ''Empire'';<ref name=\"XmasEmpire\"/> number 12 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'';<ref name=\"XmasEW\"/> number 13 by ''[[Thrillist]]'';<ref name=\"XmasThrillist\"/> number 23 by ''Time Out'';<ref name=\"XmasTimeOut\"/> number 24 by Rotten Tomatoes (based on overall critical scores);<ref name=\"LastingRTXmas\"/> number 45 by ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'';<ref name=\"XmasToday\"/> and unranked by ''[[Country Living]]''<ref name=\"XmasCountry\"/> and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\"XmasTelegraph\"/> It has been a popular Christmas film on TV in Italy since its release there in 1984.<ref name=\"XmasItaly\"/>\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of {{RT data|score}}, based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The site's consensus states: \"Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, ''Trading Places'' is an immensely appealing social satire.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 10 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nIn the years followings its release, some critics have praised the film while highlighting elements that they believe have aged poorly and are now seen by some as problematic, including racial language, the use of blackface, and the implied rape of Beeks by a gorilla.<ref name=\"TheAtlanticXmas\"/><ref name=\"GuardianApril2014\"/><ref name=\"NYTIMESRacial\"/><ref name=\"RacialGQ\"/> The film's use of the word \"nigger\", said during Mortimer's statement that he will never allow Valentine to run his family business, is sometimes censored in TV broadcasts. Todd Larkins Williams, director of the 2004 documentary ''[[The N-Word]]'', said that it is a critical scene that should not be censored. He considered it dangerous to pretend a word never existed as in turn other negative events could also be ignored.<ref name=\"NYTIMESRacial\"/> ''[[GQ]]'' argued that its social commentary remained relevant in spite of these elements.<ref name=\"RacialGQ\"/> In response to the 2020 [[George Floyd protests]] about racial inequality, ''Trading Places'' was one of 16 films that had a disclaimer added by British broadcaster [[Sky UK]]. The disclaimer read, \"This film has outdated attitudes, language, and cultural depictions which may cause offence today.\"<ref name=\"VarietySKY\"/>\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Academy\">{{cite web|title=Nominees & Winners for the 56th Academy Awards
