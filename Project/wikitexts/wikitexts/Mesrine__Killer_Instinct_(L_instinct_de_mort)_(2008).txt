The first part, '''''Mesrine: Killer Instinct''''', was based on Mesrine's autobiographical book ''L'instinct de mort'', while the second part, '''''Mesrine: Public Enemy Number One''''', detailed Mesrine's criminal career. The film has earned comparisons to the American film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', and [[Vincent Cassel]] earned rave reviews for his portrayal of Mesrine.<ref>{{cite news |title=French 'Scarface' Mesrine finally hits US cinemas |publisher= France 24 |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100827-france-cinema-usa-film-vincent-cassel-mesrine-crime |access-date=23 July 2018 |work=France 24 |date=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes2010\">{{cite news |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Vincent Cassel in Biography of French Gangster |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/movies/27mesrine.html |access-date=23 July 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 August 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news |last1=Hussey |first1=Andrew |title=Killer, robber, master of disguise... and now the biggest movie star in France |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/12/jacques-mesrine-french-movie |access-date=23 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2009 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Parts==\n\nThe film is divided into two parts, with various titles:\n#'''''Mesrine: L'instinct de mort''''' ([[French language|French]] for \"Mesrine: Instinct for Death\"); known in English as '''''Public Enemy Number One (Part One)''''', '''''Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct''''' and '''''Mesrine: Killer Instinct'''''\n#'''''Mesrine: L'ennemi public No 1''''' ([[French language|French]] for \"Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1\"); known in English as '''''Public Enemy Number One (Part Two)''''', '''''Mesrine: Part 2 - Public Enemy #1''''' and '''''Mesrine: Public Enemy Number One'''''\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part 1===\n\nPart 1 depicts Mesrine's life from 1959 to 1972, beginning with his time as a member of the French Army during the [[Algerian War]], where he was forced to shoot and kill prisoners and bomb-makers. On his return to France, he moves into his parents' home, where he reunites with his mother and his father. After an argument about getting an honest job, he meets with his old childhood friend, Paul, who is wealthy now and drives a sports car. They soon get into robbery business with Paul's boss, Guido, and from him, he obtains a [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] as a loan. Later, Guido and Mesrine kill Ahmed, an Arab pimp who beat up Sarah (one of his girls and Mesrine's girlfriend), and bury him in the countryside and drive off.\n\nUsing Guido's status as a local crime boss as protection from their enemies, after committing some robberies, Paul and Mesrine briefly leave [[France]] for the [[Canary Islands]], where Mesrine meets and falls in love with Sofia, who moves to France with him, and they marry. However, although they have a daughter, and later two sons, Mesrine continues to be in the robbery business, causing him to get arrested and sent to prison in late 1960. He is released in 1962, and although tries to keep a steady job and be honest, he is fired during an economic downturn, and dreams of easy money get him back into 'the business'. One night, Guido and Paul arrive and Mesrine prepares to leave with them, but Sofia yells at him and tells him that she will call the police, on which Mesrine snaps, slaps her, drags her across the stairs, and shoves a gun into her mouth and threatens her in front of Guido and Paul before departing. Later they divorce, leaving him custody of the children.\n\nIn 1966, Mesrine, now a gangster, goes into a bar. A woman named Jeanne Schneider comes on to him and the pair quickly fall in love. Jeanne is cut from the same cloth as Mesrine and the pair begin to commit robberies together. After stealing from a mob operated casino, the pair attract the attention of local mob bosses. In 1968, while walking with his young daughter, several men pull a 'drive-by' on Mesrine, wounding him. Guido treats him for his injuries, and suggests that he should leave the country until the things cool down, to which Mesrine agrees. He packs, leaves his kids in custody of his parents, and departs from France, traveling to [[Canada]] with Jeanne.\n\nLater, in [[Montreal]], he works as a construction worker on the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], where he meets a Quebec resident, Jean-Paul Mercier, and they become friends. Mesrine is denied residency in Canada due to his criminal past but he remains there illegally. He and Jeanne hatch a plan to kidnap and hold a French-Canadian billionaire, a decrepit man paralyzed from the waist down. They gain access to his home by taking the jobs of a maid and a chauffeur. After several months, they put their plan into practice, kidnapping the man and spiriting him away to a flat in the city. While Jeanne and Mesrine are away to try and collect the ransom money, the man manages to crawl to the balcony, break the glass, and call for help. The billionaire is taken away by paramedics just as Mesrine and Jeanne arrive back at their apartment. They flee, escaping across the border to the United States. They are subsequently captured in the [[Arizona]] desert, while at about the same time, Guido and Paul are murdered back in France by an unknown assailant.\n\nMesrine and Jeanne are sent back to Canada, where Jeanne is sentenced to five years, and Mesrine is sentenced to 10 years. He is sent to the [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] prison, where he is exposed to extreme torture and pain. Nevertheless, he still plans to break out of prison. After reuniting with Jean-Paul, also held in the same prison, he meets Roger Andr\u00e9, another prisoner, who helps him and Jean-Paul escape through the fence on a Monday, when the guards in the watch towers are hung over from the weekend. Soon after, they arrive near the border, where Jean-Paul meets Sylvie Jeanjacqout, and he falls in love with her. They hatch a plan to break Roger and friends out of prison, which does not go as intended. While Mesrine and Mercier are mounting the assault on the prison, they are both wounded. Roger is shot and killed.\n\nLater Mesrine manages to call Jeanne, to tell her he plans to break her out of prison, but, fearful for them both and wanting to abandon her old life of crime, with the prison weakening her, she severs her ties to him. Mesrine and Jean-Paul continue on with the robberies, and while having target practice in the woods one day, they are caught by two forest rangers, and forced to kill them and leave them. Mesrine says to Jean-Paul, \"If they catch us now, we'll hang.\"\n\nThe end credits roll. Notation concludes that Jeanne was released after serving her sentence, and went back to France to live freely, while Jean-Paul split with Mesrine and was shot dead a year later while robbing a bank. Mesrine's story is 'to be continued' (in part two).\n\n===Part 2===\n\nThe second film is about Mesrine's life from 1972 until 2 November 1979, the day of his death. The story starts back in 1972, with Mesrine returning to France after departing from Canada. He is now with Sylvie, who becomes his new girlfriend. He returns to [[Paris]] and commits more robberies. However, in March 1973, he is arrested after a successful heist, but as he is transferred to the courtroom, he requests to use the bathroom, and retrieves a pistol hidden in the toilet tank. He brandishes the gun in the court, forces the guards to uncuff him, and takes a judge hostage temporarily, while his apprentice, Michel, awaits, and the duo escapes. He returns to robberies with Michel, but his reckless behaviour (including robbing two banks at the same time) causes Michel to abandon Mesrine. After two months, French intelligence locates Mesrine's apartment, and Commissioner Broussard negotiates with Mesrine, who surrenders. He is brought to court and sentenced to 20 years in [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison]].\n\nDuring his time in prison, he reunites with his daughter, after 12 years of absence, and she is also present when he pleads his case in court. He then writes a book about his life, which angers his lawyer, who states that his biography places him in a difficult position, since he confesses to everything in public, but he rebuffs it. He also meets Fran\u00e7ois Besse, another convict and his solitary confinement neighbour, and hatches an escape plan; Besse smuggles pepper spray through a cookie box in prison (which can pass through the detectors since it's covered in aluminum foil), while Mesrine meets with his lawyer, who smuggles dual handguns in her briefcase. Mesrine informs the guard to bring his case file from Besse's cell and Besse attacks and subdues the guards with the spray, Mesrine then attacking them as well. They take their uniforms, take another prisoner as a cover and head over the wall, where the prisoner is shot while trying to escape with them. They manage to get away.\n\nAfter several other robberies, Mesrine fools the media, calling himself \"a revolutionary\", and professing to bring Palestinian armed forces to slay the French government. This angers Besse, and he leaves him. A year later, in 1979, Mesrine is living a wealthy life and buys himself a [[BMW New Class|1974 BMW]], and contacts his old friend from prison, Charlie Bauer, and they also start a series of robberies. Mesrine becomes more and more dillusioned with the media, secretly meeting with reporters and giving controversial interviews. He also kidnaps a local billionaire, Henri Leli\u00e8vre, and holds him for ransom, and then sets him free after being paid. Sylvie is more and more worried about Mesrine, and convinces him to leave the country. Meanwhile, Mesrine kidnaps Jacques Tillier (whose name is changed to Dallier in the movie), who wrote an article about him that he doesn't like, and makes him strip naked, then beats him and shoots him, presuming him dead. Mesrine finds out the next day that Tillier survived the ordeal.\n\nOn 2 November 1979, Mesrine and Sylvie leave their apartment disguised, with Sylvie taking her poodle, but Broussard's men are after them. After checking the area, Mesrine and Sylvie arrive at their car and drive off. Broussard is stuck in traffic and runs after them. At an intersection, a truck blocks Mesrine's way, and the back tarp is thrown open, revealing armed police gunmen, who immediately open fire and shoot him dead. Broussard arrives, and orders a hysterical and injured Sylvie and her dog to be taken away, and grimly looks at Mesrine's dead body.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Jacques Mesrine]]\n*[[Ludivine Sagnier]] as Sylvie Jeanjacquot\n*[[Michel Duchaussoy]] as Pierre Andr\u00e9 Mesrine (Mesrine's father)\n*[[Myriam Boyer]] as Mesrine's mother\n*[[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Guido\n\n===Part 1===\n*[[C\u00e9cile De France]] as Jeanne Schneider\n*[[Gilles Lellouche]] as Paul\n*[[Roy Dupuis]] as Jean-Paul Mercier\n*[[Elena Anaya]] as Sofia (Maria De La Soledad)\n*[[Florence Thomassin]] as Sarah\n*[[Abdelhafid Metalsi]]\t as Ahmed\n*[[Pascal Elso]] as Commissioner SRPJ\n*[[Deano Clavet]] as Roger Andr\u00e9\n*[[Gilbert Sicotte]] as the billionaire\n\n===Part 2===\n*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as Fran\u00e7ois Besse\n*[[G\u00e9rard Lanvin]] as Charlie Bauer\n*[[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Michel Ardouin\n*[[Olivier Gourmet]] as Commissioner Broussard\n*[[Anne Consigny]] as Mesrine's advocate\n*[[Georges Wilson]] as Henri Leli\u00e8vre\n*[[Fanny Sidney]] as Sabrina\n*[[Joseph Malerba]] as Robert\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor &ndash; Leading Role (Vincent Cassel)\n**'''Won''': Best Director (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n**'''Won''': Best Sound (Herv\u00e9 Buirette, Fran\u00e7ois Groult, G\u00e9rard Hardy, Jean Minondo, Lo\u00efc Prian and Alexandre Widmer) \n**Nominated: Best Cinematography (Robert Gantz)\n**Nominated: Best Costume Design (Virginie Montel)\n**Nominated: Best Editing (Bill Pankow and Herv\u00e9 Schneid)\n**Nominated: Best Film\n**Nominated: Best Music Written for a Film (Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp)\n**Nominated: Best Production Design (Emile Ghigo)\n**Nominated: Best Writing  &ndash; Adaptation (Abdel Raouf Dafri and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n*'''[[Tokyo International Film Festival]]''' (Japan)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor (Vincent Cassel)\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe critic aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] certified the movie \"fresh\" with both parts having 84% of critics favourable.
