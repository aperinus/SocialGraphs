'''''Imposter''''' and '''''Personal History''''') is a 1940 American black-and-white [[spy thriller]] film directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. It tells the story of an American reporter based in Britain who tries to expose enemy spies involved in a fictional continent-wide conspiracy in the prelude to World War II. It stars [[Joel McCrea]] and features 19-year-old [[Laraine Day]], [[Herbert Marshall]], [[George Sanders]], [[Albert Basserman]], and [[Robert Benchley]], along with [[Edmund Gwenn]].\n\n''Foreign Correspondent'' was Hitchcock's second Hollywood production after leaving the United Kingdom in 1939 (the first was ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'') and had an unusually large number of writers: [[Robert Benchley]], [[Charles Bennett (screenwriter)|Charles Bennett]], [[Harold Clurman]], [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[John Lee Mahin]], [[Richard Maibaum]], and [[Budd Schulberg]], with Bennett, Harrison, Hilton and Benchley the only writers credited in the finished film. It was based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s political memoir ''Personal History'' (1935), the rights to which were purchased by producer [[Walter Wanger]] for $10,000.\n\nThe film was one of two Hitchcock films nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1940, the other being ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', which went on to win the award. ''Foreign Correspondent'' was nominated for six Academy Awards, including one for [[Albert Basserman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], but did not win any.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Foreign Correspondent (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|right|upright=1.2|thumbtime=2:18|[[:C:File:Foreign Correspondent (1940) - Trailer.webm|Trailer]] for ''Foreign Correspondent'']]\n\nIn mid-August 1939, just before the outbreak of World War{{nbsp}}II, the editor of the ''New York Morning Globe'', Mr. Powers ([[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]]), sends crime reporter John Jones, using the [[pen name]] \"Huntley Haverstock\" ([[Joel McCrea]]), to Europe to report on conditions there. [[File:Foreign Correspondent trailer 16 McCrea crop.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Joel McCrea]] as \"John Jones\", foreign correspondent]] Jones's first assignment is to interview a Dutch diplomat named Van Meer ([[Albert Basserman]]), at an event held by Stephen Fisher ([[Herbert Marshall]]), the leader of the Universal Peace Party, who's holding the event to honor diplomat Van Meer. Unbeknownst to Powers and Jones, Fisher is actually a German agent.\n\nJones shares a cab with Van Meer on the way to the luncheon, but the diplomat evades any questions about the impending war. Once at the luncheon, Van Meer mysteriously disappears \u2013 his sudden absence announced by Fisher \u2013 but Jones doesn't mind as he becomes smitten with Fisher's daughter, Carol ([[Laraine Day]]). Powers sends Jones to Amsterdam to cover Van Meer's next appearance, at a conference of the UPP. When Jones stops to greet Van Meer outside the conference hall, Van Meer does not seem to recognize him. Suddenly, an assassin disguised as an eager photographer hoping to take a photo of the Dutch diplomat \u2013 actually concealing a gun near the camera \u2013 shoots and kills Van Meer. Jones, Carol and her reporter friend Scott ffolliott ([[George Sanders]]), give chase. They seem to lose the assassin's car in the countryside, until Jones recognizes that they are hiding in a windmill.\n\nWhile Carol and ffolliott go for help, Jones searches the windmill and finds a live Van Meer; the man shot in front of witnesses was an imposter. The old man has been drugged and is unable to tell Jones anything. Jones narrowly escapes to tell the police himself, but when he, Carol and ffolliott return with authorities, Van Meer and his kidnappers are gone. Later, back at Jones's hotel room in Amsterdam, two spies dressed as police officers arrive to kidnap him. When he suspects who they really are, he escapes with Carol's help.\n\nJones and Carol board a British ship to England, and while a furious storm thunders overhead, he proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. In England, they go to Carol's father's house, where Jones sees Krug ([[Eduardo Ciannelli]]), whom he recognizes from the windmill as the operative running the assassination and kidnapping. He informs Fisher, who promises to provide a bodyguard who will protect him. The bodyguard, Rowley ([[Edmund Gwenn]]), whose true task is to kill Jones, is working with Fisher and Krug in the plot against Van Meer. Rowley tries to push Jones off the top of [[Westminster Cathedral]] tower but falls to his death himself.\n\n[[File:Foreign Correspondent trailer 12 Sanders crop.jpg|thumb|250px|[[George Sanders]] as \"ffolliott\"]]\nJones and ffolliott are convinced that Fisher is a traitor, so they come up with a plan: Jones will take Carol to [[Cambridge]], and ffolliott will pretend she has been kidnapped, in order to force Fisher to divulge Van Meer's location. But when Carol, who mistakenly thinks that Jones tricked her to go to Cambridge \u2013 not for a romantic getaway,  but to sideline her while he pursues her father \u2014 returns home from Cambridge to her father earlier than expected; this forces ffolliott to leave in haste. Ffolliott trails Fisher to a closed hotel where Van Meer is being held prisoner, but ffoliott is captured at gunpoint. He prevents Fisher from carrying out a ruse intended to persuade Van Meer to reveal a secret clause in a treaty that would benefit the Germans in the event of war. Fisher orders Van Meer to be tortured for the information; ffolliot escapes from Fisher's thugs, while Fisher flees. Van Meer is taken to a nearby hospital, where he slowly regains consciousness.\n\nBritain and France declare war on Germany. Jones and ffolliott follow the Fishers on a [[Short S.30 Empire]] flying boat to America. When he intercepts a telegram intended for ffolliott, telling him that Van Meer has recovered and identified Fisher as his kidnaper, Fisher realizes he will soon be captured and returned to England as a spy. He confesses his treasonous behavior to Carol, who already suspects the truth but promises to stand by him. Jones pleads with Carol to rekindle their affair. Seconds later, the aircraft is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean. The survivors perch on the floating wing of the downed aircraft. Realizing that it cannot support everyone, Fisher slips into the ocean to drown, sacrificing himself so the rest may live.\n\nAn American ship rescues the survivors. The captain refuses to allow the reporters to file their stories using the ship's communications, citing American neutrality in the war. Still, Jones, ffolliott, and Carol surreptitiously communicate the story by radio-telephone to Mr. Powers. Jones returns to England and, with Carol at his side, becomes a successful war correspondent. During a live radio broadcast, he describes London being bombed, urging Americans to \"keep the lights burning\" as they go dark in the studio.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Joel McCrea]] as John Jones\n* [[Laraine Day]] as Carol Fisher\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Stephen Fisher\n* [[George Sanders]] as ffolliott\n* [[Albert Basserman]] as Van Meer\n* [[Robert Benchley]] as Stebbins\n* [[Edmund Gwenn]] as Rowley\n* [[Eduardo Ciannelli]] as Mr. Krug\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Mr. Powers\n* [[Martin Kosleck]] as Tramp\n{{col-break|gap=3em}}\n* [[Frances Carson]] as Mrs. Sprague\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as Stiles\n* [[Charles Wagenheim]] as Assassin\n* Edward Conrad as Latvian\n* [[Charles Halton]] as Bradley\n* [[Barbara Pepper]] as Dorine\n* [[Emory Parnell]] as \"Mohican\" Captain\n* Roy Gordon as Mr. Brood\n* [[Gertrude Hoffman (actress)|Gertrude Hoffman]] as Mrs. Benson\n* Martin Lamont as Captain\n* Barry Bernard as Steward\n* [[Holmes Herbert]] as Asst.

Selznick]] and available to direct this film on a loan-out. Hitchcock, who did not enjoy working under the usual close scrutiny of Selznick, originally wanted [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] for the lead roles, but Cooper was not interested in doing a thriller at the time, and Selznick would not loan out Fontaine. Later, Cooper admitted to Hitchcock that he had made a mistake in turning down the film.<ref name=\"tcmart\">Stafford, Jeff and John M. Miller.

To accommodate this, [[Ben Hecht]] was called in to write the epilogue of the film, the scene in the radio station, which replaced the original end sequence in which two of the characters discussed the events of the film on a transatlantic seaplane trip. The new ending was filmed on July 5, presciently foreshadowing the celebrated radio broadcasts of [[Edward R. Murrow]].<ref name=\"tcmtriv\">[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/75400/foreign-correspondent#trivia \"Trivia: 'Foreign Correspondent'.\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''.

A fictional nation is mentioned numerous times however, possibly indicating that it was briefly considered as a potential proxy aggressor European country rather than an actual Axis nation.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb title|0032484|Foreign Correspondent}}</ref>\n[[File:Foreign Correspondent trailer 26 crash crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The aircraft crash]]\nOne of the sequences in the film that continues to have a strong effect on viewers is the [[William Cameron Menzies]]-designed mid-ocean crash of the flying boat after it is shot down by a German destroyer. In 1972, in an interview with [[Dick Cavett]], Hitchcock discussed some details of how the scene was created. Footage taken from a stunt aircraft diving over the ocean was rear-projected on rice paper in front of the cockpit set, while behind the rice paper were two chutes connected to large water tanks. The chutes were aimed at the windshield of the cockpit so that water would break through the rice paper at the right moment, simulating the crash of the aircraft into the ocean.<ref name=\"imdb\" /> However, during the crash sequence, studio lights can briefly be seen.\n\nHitchcock's eccentric marriage proposal to his wife Alma was written for this film, for the scene when Jones proposes to Carol.<ref name=\"imdb\" />\n<!---Hitchcock frequently used visual imagery to underscore the dramatic action. When McCrea flees his hotel room and touches the letter \"E\" of the neon \"HOTEL\" sign, he burns himself and the letters \"E\" and \"L\" die, leaving the word \"HOT\" and leaving the sign reading \"HOT EUROPE\", underscoring the film's theme of war in Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}--highly unlikely----->\n\n==Reception==\n''Foreign Correspondent'' opened on August 16, 1940, in the United States and on October 11 of that year in the United Kingdom.
