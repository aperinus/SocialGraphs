Twenty-five years later, he drives a rusted [[MG Midget]] and all his ambitions revolve around a series of ill fated [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s. A handshake loan of $5,000 from the loan sharks grows to $50,000 through interest and penalties, resulting in him trying to skip town at [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].\n\nHe overhears a conversation between lawyer Gary Young and his children, who are waiting to pick up his childhood friend, Derek Bond, who is now a successful, strait-laced and [[vegetarian]] [[dentist]]. Upon hearing him say that he has not seen Bond in twenty five years and does not know what he looks like, Franklin gives his baseball cap to the real Bond to throw off the two dimwitted mobsters chasing him and poses as Bond to the Youngs, who take him to their posh home in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]].\n\nAlthough he knows nothing about dentistry, Franklin still manages to convince those around him that he is in fact Derek Bond, and his affable personality makes him popular with Young's otherwise stuffy and rich associates. Young has little time for his children and his wife who runs a chain of successful new [[frozen yogurt]] businesses, which gradually builds a gap between them, largely due to the demands of his bigoted, arrogant boss at the law firm where he works and their clients are a rival yogurt company that is Gary\u2019s wife competition, this leads to Franklin developing a bond with Young's [[Goth subculture|Goth]] daughter, helping her stand up to her cheating boyfriend; and his young son, who has aspirations of playing pro [[basketball]]. Young eventually stands up to his boss with Franklin's support and quits the firm to be with his family.\n\nMeanwhile, the mob thugs threaten Franklin's best friend, Larry into revealing his whereabouts, and Franklin asks him to pick him up. After he does so reluctantly, he sparks an argument with him over his lack of appreciation of friendship, causing him to realize that Young has been his friend all along. He returns to the Youngs' house only to find that the mobsters have taken them hostage, and his true identity is revealed when the real Derek Bond finally shows up.\n\nAfter the mobsters take Franklin away, he manages to escape, losing them in a charity [[marathon]], where he meets up with Young, who graciously decides to help him despite his charade, in return for helping bring his family closer together. Franklin reveals that he has an instant [[lottery]] ticket he purchased the previous day for a chance at a $1 million cash prize spin on a Saturday night television show, which he reluctantly gives up to the mobsters in exchange for the forgiveness of his debt.\n\nThe film fast forwards to wintertime, Franklin [[parallel parking|parallel park]]s a shiny new red Porsche with Larry in tow, in front of the Youngs' house, appearing for a promotional party for his new [[best-seller]] book, ''Handbook for Houseguests'', based on his experiences with them. The partygoers gather in front of the television to watch the mobsters spin the wheel for the jackpot.\n\nIt initially lands on the million dollar jackpot, but then falls and lands on $5,000, much to the mafia don's dismay and Franklin's delight. During the closing credits, Young and Franklin sing a medley of food based parodies of Christmas songs, as they cook a barbecue in Youngs' backyard outside of a Christmas party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Sinbad (actor)|Sinbad]] as Kevin Franklin\n*[[Phil Hartman]] as Gary Young\n*[[Kim Greist]] as Emily Young\n*Kim Murphy as Brooke Young\n*[[Chauncey Leopardi]] as Jason Young\n*Talia Seider as Sarah Young\n*[[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Pauly Gasperini\n*[[Tony Longo]] as Joey Gasperini\n*[[Jeffrey Jones]] as Ron Timmerman\n*[[Stan Shaw]] as Larry, the Tattoo Artist\n*[[Ron Glass]] as Dr. Derek Bond\n*Kevin Jordan as Steve 'ST-3', Brooke's boyfriend\n*[[Mason Adams]] as Mr. Pike\n*Patricia Fraser as Nancy Pike\n*[[Don Brockett]] as Happy Marcelli\n*[[Kirk Baily]] as Stuart the Manager\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn February 1993, Sinbad signed a deal with disney for [[The Sinbad Show|13 episode TV show]] and a pay or play deal for Houseguest.<ref name=\"SinbadSailsDisney\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/sinbad-sailing-to-disney-103608/|title=      Sinbad sailing to Disney  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref> Phil Hartman joined the film in March 1994.<ref name=\"HouseguestHartman\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/houseguest-makes-room-for-hartman-119439/|title=   \u2018Houseguest\u2019 makes room for Hartman   |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\nSome scenes for the movie were shot on location at the Pittsburgh International Airport, Pittsburgh's historic [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District]] and [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]], [[Downtown Pittsburgh]], and the [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]] suburb.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at No. 3.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Dumb and Dumber' Has Last Laugh|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-01-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-10/entertainment/ca-18192_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Holiday Spurs Record-Setting Movie Weekend|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1995-01-17|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-17/entertainment/ca-20974_1_opening-weekend|access-date=2012-06-07|first=Richard|last=Natale}}</ref> It eventually grossed $26 million in North America.
