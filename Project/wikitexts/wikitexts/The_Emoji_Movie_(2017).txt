Directed by [[Tony Leondis]], who wrote the script with Eric Siegel and [[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]], it stars the voices of [[T.J. Miller]], [[James Corden]], [[Anna Faris]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Steven Wright]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Jake T. Austin]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]], [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]], and [[Sir Patrick Stewart]]. Based on [[emoji]]s, the film centers on a multi-expressional emoji who exists in a teenager's [[smartphone]] embarking on a journey to become a normal emoji capable of only a single expression.\n\n''The Emoji Movie'' premiered on July 23, 2017 at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Regency Village Theatre]] and was theatrically released in the United States five days later. The movie was a commercial success after grossing $217 million worldwide against its $50 million production budget, but was universally lambasted by critics, who criticized its script, humor, use of [[product placement]],<ref name=\"negativeten\">[https://screenrant.com/worst-movies-rated-negative-10-reddit/ 10 Movies That Are A Negative 10 Out Of 10, According To Reddit - Screen Rant]</ref> tone, voice performances, lack of originality, and plot, with negative comparisons and similarities to other animated films, especially ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' (2012), ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' (2014) and ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' (2015). ''The Emoji Movie'' was nominated for five awards at the [[38th Golden Raspberry Awards]], winning four. It is the first animated film to win in any of those categories. It is frequently cited as the worst film of 2017, as well as [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst animated movies ever made]].<ref>[https://www.newsweek.com/worst-animated-movies-according-critics-1588466 The 25 Worst Animated Movies, According to Critics - Newsweek]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guidelines, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nGene is an [[emoji]] that lives in Textopolis, a digital city inside the phone of his user, a teenager named Alex. He is the son of two [[meh]] emojis named Mel and Mary and is able to make multiple expressions despite his parents' upbringing. His parents are hesitant about him going to work, but Gene insists so that he can feel useful. Upon receiving a [[Text messaging|text]] from his love interest Addie McCallister, Alex decides to send her an emoji. When Gene is selected, he panics, makes a panicked expression, and wrecks the text center. Gene is called in by Smiler, a [[smiley]] emoji and leader of the text center, who concludes that Gene is a \"malfunction\" and therefore must be deleted. Gene is chased by [[Software agent|bots]] but is rescued by Hi-5, a once-popular emoji who has since lost his fame due to lack of use. He tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a [[hacker]], and Hi-5 accompanies him so that he can reclaim his fame.\n\nSmiler sends more bots to look for Gene when she finds out that he has left Textopolis, as his actions have caused Alex to think that his phone needs to be fixed. Gene and Hi-5 come to a [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] [[Mobile app|app]] where they meet a hacker emoji named Jailbreak, who wants to reach [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] so that she can live in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. The trio is attacked by Smiler's bots, but manage to escape into the game ''[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]''. Jailbreak reveals that Gene can be fixed in the cloud, and the group goes off into the ''[[Just Dance (video game series)|Just Dance]]'' app. While there, Jailbreak is revealed to be a princess emoji who fled home after tiring of being [[stereotype]]d. They are once again attacked by bots, and their actions cause Alex to delete the ''Just Dance'' app. Gene and Jailbreak escape, but Hi-5 is taken along with the app and ends up in the [[Trash (computing)|trash]].\n\nMel and Mary go searching for Gene and have a very lethargic argument. They make up in the [[Instagram]] app when Mel reveals that he, too, is a malfunction, explaining Gene's behavior. While traveling through [[Spotify]], Jailbreak admits that she likes Gene just the way he is and that he should not be ashamed of his malfunction. The two start to fall in love and Gene silently debates his choice to change himself. They make it to the trash and rescue Hi-5, but are soon attacked by a bot upgraded with illegal malware. They evade it by entangling its arms and enter Dropbox, where they encounter a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. After many tries, the gang gets past it with a [[password]] being Addie's name and make it to the cloud, where Jailbreak prepares to reprogram Gene. Gene admits his feelings for Jailbreak, but she wishes to stick to her plan of venturing into the cloud, unintentionally causing Gene to revert to his apathetic programming out of heartbreak. Suddenly, the upgraded bot sneaks into the cloud and captures Gene, prompting Hi-5 and Jailbreak to go after him with a [[Twitter]] bird summoned by Jailbreak in her princess form.\n\nAs Smiler prepares to delete Gene, Mel and Mary arrive. Mel reveals to everyone that he is also a malfunction, prompting Smiler to threaten to delete him as well. Jailbreak and Hi-5 arrive and disable the bot, which falls on top of Smiler. Alex has since taken his phone to a store in hopes that a [[factory reset]] performed by [[technical support]] would restore his phone's functionality, which would entail total destruction of Gene's world should such operation complete. Out of desperation, Gene prepares to have himself texted to Addie, making numerous faces to express himself. Realizing that Addie received a text from him, Alex cancels the factory reset just as it nearly finishes, saving the emoji and finally getting to speak with Addie, who likes the emoji Alex sent. Gene accepts himself for who he is and is celebrated by all of the emojis.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Smiler has been relegated to the \"loser lounge\" with the other unused and forgotten emojis for her crimes, wearing numerous braces due to her teeth being chipped by the bot, and playing and losing a game of [[Go Fish]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:The Emoji Movie premiere at the Fox Theatre, Westwood Village 3.jpg|thumb|T.
