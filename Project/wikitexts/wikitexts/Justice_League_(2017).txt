Produced by [[Warner Bros.

K. Simmons]]. In the film, following the events of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Batman]] and [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Wonder Woman]] recruit [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|The Flash]], [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Aquaman]], and [[Victor Stone (DC Extended Universe)|Cyborg]] after the death of [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Superman]] to save the world from the catastrophic threat of [[Steppenwolf (DC Extended Universe)|Steppenwolf]] and his army of [[Parademon]]s.\n\nWarner Bros. began to develop a live-action Justice League film in 2007 with [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] set to direct, but the project was canceled due to production delays and budgetary concerns. A Justice League film would re-enter development as part of Warner Bros' upcoming DC film slate in October 2014, with Snyder on board to direct and Terrio attached to write the script. [[Principal photography]] took place from April to October 2016. After Snyder stepped down from the film following the death of his daughter, Whedon was hired to oversee the remainder of post-production, including writing and directing additional scenes, as well as reshooting a large portion of the film, which changed many aspects of it; Snyder ultimately retained sole credit as director. With an estimated production budget of $300&nbsp;million, ''Justice League'' is one of the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Justice League'' premiered in Los Angeles on November 13, 2017, and was released in the United States four days later. The film grossed over $657&nbsp;million worldwide against an assumed [[break-even]] point of $750&nbsp;million, becoming a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]] and losing Warner Bros. Pictures an estimated $60&nbsp;million. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, with criticism aimed towards the plot, pacing, generic villain and [[computer-generated imagery]], while its humor and light tone were met with polarized responses, although the action sequences and the cast's performances were praised. Whedon's major involvement during post-production also received harsh criticism especially from the cast, particularly Gadot and Fisher. A director's cut, titled ''[[Zack Snyder's Justice League]]'', was released on [[HBO Max]] in March 2021 after fans had begun to advocate for Snyder's original version of the film since the film's theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be kept between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThousands of years ago, [[Steppenwolf (DC Extended Universe)|Steppenwolf]] and his legions of [[Parademon]]s attempted to take over the Earth using the combined energies of the three [[Mother Box]]es. The attempt was foiled by a unified alliance including the [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Olympian Gods]], [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlanteans]], humanity, and extraterrestrial beings.{{refn|name=YalanGur|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Yalan Gur]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anderson |first=Jenna |date=November 26, 2017 |title=Green Lantern In 'Justice League' Identified |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/amp/2017/11/26/justice-league-movie-green-lantern-yalan-gur/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414172725/https://comicbook.com/dc/amp/2017/11/26/justice-league-movie-green-lantern-yalan-gur/ |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |access-date=November 30, 2019 |website=[[ComicBook.com]]}}</ref>}} After Steppenwolf's army was repelled, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in different locations. In the present, humanity is still in [[mourning]] two years after the death of [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Superman]], which triggered the Mother Boxes' reactivation and Steppenwolf's return to Earth. Steppenwolf aims to gather the boxes to form \"The Unity\", which will destroy Earth's ecology and [[Terraforming|terraform]] it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.\n\nSteppenwolf retrieves one Mother Box from [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], prompting Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] to warn her daughter [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana]]. Diana joins [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne]] in an attempt to unite other [[metahumans]] to their cause: Wayne goes after [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Arthur Curry]] and [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]], while Diana locates [[Victor Stone (DC Extended Universe)|Victor Stone]]. Wayne fails to persuade Curry but finds Allen enthusiastic. Although Diana fails to persuade Stone, he agrees to help them locate the threat. Stone joins after his father [[Silas Stone|Silas]] and several other [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] employees are kidnapped by Steppenwolf, who is seeking the Mother Box protected by humanity.\n\nSteppenwolf attacks an [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] outpost to retrieve the next Mother Box, forcing Curry into action. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box for the group, revealing that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after an accident almost cost him his life. Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman, not only to help them fight off Steppenwolf's invasion but also to restore hope to humanity.\n\n[[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Clark Kent]]'s body is exhumed and placed in the amniotic fluid of the genesis chamber in the Kryptonian scout ship, along with the Mother Box, successfully resurrecting Superman. However, Superman's memories have not returned, and he attacks the group. Batman enacts his contingency plan: [[Lois Lane (DC Extended Universe)|Lois Lane]]. Superman calms down and leaves with her to his family home in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], where his memories come back. In the turmoil, the last Mother Box is left unguarded, allowing Steppenwolf to retrieve it. Without Superman to aid them, the five heroes travel to a village in [[Russia]] where Steppenwolf aims to unite the Mother Boxes once again to remake Earth. They fight their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf but are unable to distract him enough for Stone to separate the Mother Boxes. Superman arrives and assists Allen in evacuating the city, as well as assisting Stone in separating the Mother Boxes. The team defeats Steppenwolf, who, overcome with fear, is attacked by his own Parademons.\n\nAfter the battle, Bruce and Diana agree to set up a base of operations for the team, with room for more members. As the team establishes, Diana steps back into the public spotlight as a heroine; Barry acquires a job in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]'s [[Central City Police Department|police department]], impressing [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Henry Allen|his father]]; Victor continues to enhance his abilities with his father in S.T.A.R.

He described that in the film, audiences will see Batman as more heroic, and more of a leader. \"Batman is by nature, [while] not necessarily anti-social, pretty private, pretty a loner,\" Affleck says. \"And then in this movie he's thrust into the role of having to not only work with people, but bring them together and convince them to come in and try to ... somehow with Wonder Woman hold all that community effort together. That was a really interesting thing to play for me, and it also does take us to a more traditional role for Batman in the Justice League comics, and his role with the Justice League versus the sort of less typical version we saw in Batman v Superman, where he was blinded by rage and wanted to take on Superman.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Crow, David |date=November 6, 2017 |title=Justice League: Ben Affleck Talks \"More Traditional\" Batman in New Film |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/justice-league/268773/justice-league-ben-affleck-talks-more-traditional-batman-in-new-film |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620101838/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/justice-league/268773/justice-league-ben-affleck-talks-more-traditional-batman-in-new-film |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |publisher=Den Of Geek!}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Bonomolo, Cameron |date=October 13, 2017 |title=Ben Affleck Describes Batman's Leadership Role in 'Justice League' |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2017/10/13/ben-affleck-describes-batmans-leadership-role-in-justice-league/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619160523/http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/10/13/ben-affleck-describes-batmans-leadership-role-in-justice-league/ |archive-date=June 19, 2018 |access-date=June 20, 2018 |website=[[ComicBook.com]]}}</ref>\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Clark Kent / Superman]]: <br />A member of, and inspiration for, the [[Justice League]].

Snyder's Justice League}}\nThe divisive reaction towards the theatrical cut of the film, with Zack Snyder leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Joss Whedon, has led to an argument comparing the situation to the one experienced by the film ''[[Superman II]]''. Both ''Justice League'' and ''Superman II'' feature a director who was replaced, for different reasons, before completion of a film, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes to the tone of each film. Although the reasoning behind each director's departure differs, [[Richard Donner]] was able to complete his [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|''Superman II'' cut]] in 2006. In the belief that Snyder had shot enough material for a finished film, a campaign for a \"Snyder Cut\" was started to allow Snyder to receive a similar treatment to Donner. Arguments were made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see. Warner Bros. initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a \"[[Snyder Cut]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 8, 2018 |title=Justice League: The Snyder Cut Movement Explained |url=https://screenrant.com/justice-league-release-zack-snyder-cut-movement-explained/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107104039/https://screenrant.com/justice-league-release-zack-snyder-cut-movement-explained/ |archive-date=November 7, 2018 |access-date=November 6, 2018 |website=[[Screen Rant]] |at=page 1}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut existed, and stated that it was up to Warner Bros. to release it.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Colbert |first=Stephen M. |date=March 28, 2019 |title=Zack Snyder Confirms A Snyder Cut Of Justice League Exists |url=https://screenrant.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-cut-exists-confirmed/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615042216/https://screenrant.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-cut-exists-confirmed/ |archive-date=June 15, 2020 |access-date=April 14, 2019 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref> In November, an insider claimed that Warner Bros. was unlikely to release Snyder's version of ''Justice League'' in theaters, calling it a \"pipe dream\".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |last2=Kroll |first2=Justin |date=November 26, 2019 |title=DC Films Plots Future With Superman, Green Lantern and R-Rated Movies (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dc-comics-superman-michael-b-jordan-green-lantern-aquaman-birds-of-prey-1203415757/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191126172333/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dc-comics-superman-michael-b-jordan-green-lantern-aquaman-birds-of-prey-1203415757/ |archive-date=November 26, 2019 |access-date=November 29, 2019 |website=Variety}}</ref> In December, Snyder posted a photo in his [[Vero (app)|Vero]] account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled \"Z.S.
