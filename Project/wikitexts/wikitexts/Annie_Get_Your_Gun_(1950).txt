The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] release, with music and lyrics by [[Irving Berlin]] and a screenplay by [[Sidney Sheldon]] based on the 1946 [[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|stage musical of the same name]], was directed by [[George Sidney]]. Despite several production and casting problems ([[Judy Garland]] was fired from the lead role after a month of filming in which she clashed with the director and repeatedly showed up late or not at all), the film won the [[Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] and received three other nominations. Star [[Betty Hutton]] was recognized with a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Betty Hutton]] as [[Annie Oakley]] \n* [[Howard Keel]] as [[Frank E.

The 2000 [[compact disc]] release of the soundtrack includes all of the film's numbers and \"Let's Go West Again\" (a Hutton number deleted before the film's release), an alternative take of Wynn's \"[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)#Musical numbers|Colonel Buffalo Bill]]\", and Garland's renditions of Annie's pieces.\n\n==Production history==\nThe film was originally budgeted at $1.5 million, with $600,000 payable to [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Dorothy Fields|Dorothy]] and [[Herbert Fields]] for the score and the book, comparatively cheap compared to the $2.3 million budget for Berlin's ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety174-1949-04#page/n1/mode/2up|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 6, 1949|page=3|title='Annie' At $1,500,000, MG's Cheapest Musical|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Betty Hutton]] played Annie Oakley, with [[Howard Keel]] (making his American film debut) as Frank Butler and [[Benay Venuta]] as Dolly Tate. [[Louis Calhern]] played Buffalo Bill, replacing [[Frank Morgan]], who died of a sudden heart attack  shortly after filming had begun.\n\n[[Judy Garland]], MGM's biggest musical comedy star, was originally cast as Annie Oakley. She recorded all her songs for the soundtrack and worked for two months under the direction of [[Busby Berkeley]] and dance director [[Robert Alton]]. Berkeley and Garland had worked together previously in the late 1930s and early 1940s in a successful series of backstage musicals teaming her with fellow juvenile star [[Mickey Rooney]]. However, Berkeley had been fired from the Garland/Rooney musical ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' in 1943 due to personality clashes with musical director [[Roger Edens]] and for driving Garland to collapse and subsequent doctor-ordered bed rest during the filming of the ''[[I Got Rhythm]]'' musical number. Six years later, producer [[Arthur Freed]] felt Berkeley was the right man to capture the spectacle needed for ''Annie Get Your Gun''. But once again Berkeley was severe with Garland, and they immediately clashed. Unfortunately, Garland was suffering from overwork and exhaustion, the dissolution of her marriage to director [[Vincente Minnelli]], and an addiction to prescription medication. Having recently completed the hit musical ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'', she was in no condition to undertake a taxing role in another major musical production, and \u2013 based in part on her past experiences with him \u2013 she resented working with the demanding Berkeley.  Struggling to make her characterization of Annie Oakley a real person and not just a broad caricature of Ethel Merman, Garland felt Berkeley had no understanding of how to translate the material to the big screen. She was put off by his bombastic directorial style, often leaving the set when he began shouting at the actors and crew. Garland complained about Berkeley to studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]], attempting to have him removed from the film. After viewing Berkeley's footage to that point, producer Freed was disappointed and fired the veteran director, replacing him with [[Charles Walters]].  Despite this change, the underweight and physically exhausted Garland arrived late or not at all for each day's filming schedule. After a couple of warnings, MGM finally suspended Garland's contract and she was fired from the picture. Garland, telling the press she was forced to leave the production against her will, traveled to Boston where she was hospitalized for several weeks to regain her health.<ref name=\"Green, Stanley 1999 p. 159\">Green, Stanley; revised and updated by Elaine Schmidt. ''Hollywood Musicals Year By Year, Second Edition'' (1999) Hal Leonard Corporation, p. 159 {{ISBN|0-634-00765-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Betty Garrett]] was considered as Garland's replacement, but her contract with the studio had expired and her agent asked for too much money for her to return. [[Ginger Rogers]] lobbied hard for the role, but the producers felt she was too mature and glamorous for the part.  According to Rogers, studio head L.B. Mayer told her, \"You stay in your silk stockings and high heels, Ginger. This part isn't for you.\" [[Betty Hutton]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s top musical comedy star, pleaded for the role with both MGM and her home studio.  A loan-out deal was brokered and Hutton won the part of Annie Oakley. Shooting resumed after five months, with [[George Sidney]] replacing [[Charles Walters]] as director.<ref name=\"Green, Stanley 1999 p. 159\"/>\n\nAccording to Betty Hutton, she was treated coldly by most of the cast and crew because she had replaced Garland. During an interview with [[Robert Osborne]] (first telecast on [[Turner Classic Movies]] \"Private Screenings\" on July 18, 2000), she recalled the other cast members being hostile and the MGM management as so unappreciative they neglected to invite her to the New York premiere. By all accounts, Hutton clashed with co-star [[Howard Keel]].  Years later, Keel recalled Hutton as \"a scene stealer\" and \"insecure\".  In his autobiography ''Only Make Believe: My Life in Show Business'', Keel wrote that on one occasion Hutton was upset because she felt Keel was upstaging her and they reshot the scene 35 times until she was satisfied with it. Hutton wrote in her memoir ''Backstage You Can Have'' that Keel was a \"green horn\" who tried to pull focus from her performance. Reportedly, she felt the only major cast member who treated her with any kindness and respect was [[Louis Calhern]]. Hutton also stated that one day Judy Garland visited the set and when Hutton greeted her with a bouncy \"Hiya', Judy!\", she was brought up short by a seething string of profanities from Garland. Years later, the two women became friendly while each was performing in Las Vegas. According to Hutton, Garland admitted to her that she never felt she was right for the part of Annie and had been relieved when Hutton took over.\n\nOnly two production numbers were completed with Garland, \"Doin' What Comes Naturally\" and the elaborate \"I'm an Indian, Too\" and these were officially released by MGM for the first time in the 1994 documentary ''[[That's Entertainment III]]''. All of Garland's studio prerecordings for the film exist and were officially released by [[Rhino Records]] in 2000 for the film's first complete and remastered soundtrack CD, alongside Betty Hutton's renditions of the same numbers from the film.\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film premiered at [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in New York City on May 17, 1950.<ref>{{cite book |last=Arceri |first=Gene |date=2009 |title=Rocking Horse - A Personal Biography of Betty Hutton |publisher=BearManor Media |isbn=9781593933210 }}</ref> Despite the production problems, the film garnered mostly favorable reviews from critics.
