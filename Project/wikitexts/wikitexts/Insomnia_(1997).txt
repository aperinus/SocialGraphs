The investigation goes horribly wrong when he mistakenly shoots his partner and subsequently attempts to cover up his bungle. The title of the film refers to his inability to sleep, the result of his guilt (represented by the relentless glare of the [[midnight sun]]). ''Insomnia'' was the film debut of director [[Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg]]. The screenplay was written by [[Nikolaj Frobenius]] and Skjoldbj\u00e6rg, and the soundtrack by [[Geir Jenssen]].\n\nThe film inspired the 2002 American remake ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nWhen 17-year-old Tanja is found murdered in the city of [[Troms\u00f8]], far up in the Norwegian Arctic, [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|Kripos]] police officers Jonas Engstr\u00f6m ([[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]]) and Erik Vik ([[Sverre Anker Ousdal]]) are called in to investigate. Engstr\u00f6m is a police inspector formerly with the [[Swedish police]] who moved to Norway after being caught having sex with the main witness in one of his cases. Vik is nearing retirement age, and his memory is failing.\n\nEngstr\u00f6m devises a plan to lure the murderer back to the scene of the crime, but the stakeout is blown and the murder suspect flees into the fog. Events take a turn for the worse when the fugitive shoots one of the pursuing unarmed Norwegian police officers. Without telling his colleagues, however, Engstr\u00f6m carries a gun from his days in the Swedish police, who routinely carry firearms. While shooting at what he believes to be the suspect, Engstrom accidentally kills Vik, who had mistakenly run right instead of left as ordered.\n\nEngstr\u00f6m initially tells the truth about the shooting, but realises that everyone assumes that the fugitive shot Vik. He decides to conceal his culpability. When one of his colleagues, Hilde Hagen ([[Gisken Armand]]), is assigned to investigate Vik's death, Engstr\u00f6m becomes worried about [[ballistic fingerprinting]] and tampers with evidence to support his story. Haunted by guilt and unable to sleep with the [[midnight sun]] of the Arctic, Engstr\u00f6m becomes increasingly unhinged and starts hallucinating about Vik. Things become even worse when he learns that Tanja's murderer saw him shoot Vik.\n\nEngstr\u00f6m learns from one of Tanja's friends that she had been seeing Jon Holt ([[Bj\u00f8rn Floberg]]), a crime novelist. He correctly deduces that Holt killed Tanja, but Holt [[blackmail]]s Engstr\u00f6m with his knowledge of the Vik shooting. The two meet and decide to frame Tanja's boyfriend Eilert for her murder, with Engstr\u00f6m later planting Holt's gun under Eilert's bed. However, Hagen is not convinced of Eilert's involvement, and when new evidence emerges, Engstr\u00f6m knows that it's only a matter of time until Holt is arrested.\n\nEngstr\u00f6m tracks down Holt in some rotting wooden buildings at the waterfront and tries to talk with him. Holt suspects that Engstr\u00f6m has come to kill him and holds him at gunpoint. He explains how he killed Tanja in a fit of rage when she rejected his advances. Holt tries to flee across a pier, but the rotten floorboards give way and he falls into the water below, striking his head on the way. He drowns as Engstr\u00f6m watches. When he rummages through Holt's nearby house, Engstr\u00f6m finds Tanja's dress, which Holt had removed before dumping the body. With Holt dead, and this definitive proof that he was the murderer, the case is closed.\n\nJust before he leaves town, Engstr\u00f6m is visited by Hagen, who shows him a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge case]] found at the site where Vik was shot. She notes that it is a [[Norma Precision|Norma]] case, which Engstr\u00f6m confirms is a brand used by the Swedish police. Engstr\u00f6m expects Hagen to arrest him, but instead she simply places the cartridge case on a table and leaves. Engstr\u00f6m drives out of town, his face and eyes showing great weariness; he seems not to have recovered from his insomnia.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Jonas Engstr\u00f6m\n*[[Sverre Anker Ousdal]] as Erik Vik\n*[[Bj\u00f8rn Floberg]] as Jon Holt\n*[[Gisken Armand]] as Hilde Hagen\n*[[Maria Bonnevie]] as Ane\n*Bj\u00f8rn Moan as Eilert\n*Maria Mathiesen as Tanja Lorentzen\n*Marianne O.
