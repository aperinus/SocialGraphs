The film stars [[Danny Aiello]], [[Greg Cruttwell]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Teri Hatcher]], [[Glenne Headly]], [[Peter Horton]], [[Marsha Mason]], [[Paul Mazursky]], [[James Spader]], [[Eric Stoltz]], and [[Charlize Theron]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo hitmen, Lee Woods and [[made man|mafioso]] Dosmo Pizzo, walk into a bedroom where a sleeping couple, Olympic athlete Becky Foxx and her ex-husband Roy Foxx, are in bed. Lee injects Becky with a tranquilizer, then shoots Roy in the head. Lee and Dosmo then drive to an abandoned area off [[Mulholland Drive]], where Lee shoots Dosmo and blows up the car in order to set Dosmo up as the [[fall guy]] for the murder. Lee flees the scene with his girlfriend, Helga Svelgen.\n\nDosmo was wearing a bulletproof vest and survived the shooting and car explosion. He takes shelter at the mansion of wealthy art dealer Allan Hopper, where he takes Hopper and his assistant Susan Parish hostage. Dosmo is unaware that Hopper has called his sister Audrey Hopper, a nurse, to come to the house. On her way, Audrey picks up Teddy Peppers, a down-and-out TV producer contemplating suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Becky awakens and discovers Roy's body in bed beside her. She runs from her house and flags down two policemen, young, ambitious Wes Taylor and cynical veteran Alvin Strayer, who are driving by. Although sympathetic, Wes begins to suspect that Becky knows more than she is saying. Becky had hired Lee and Dosmo to kill Roy for $30,000, but was unaware that they would do it in her own house. Alvin arrives at his house which is across the road from a golf course. One of the golf balls breaks Alvin\u2019s window. Furious, he draws his revolver and confronts the golfers. Later that night he\u2019s wrapping a birthday present for his son and sees a letter in his coat from the police department saying that due to his erratic behaviour, he has to turn in his badge and gun and he yells in frustration. Lee goes back to the house to get the money, encounters homicide detectives Creighton and Valenzuela working the crime scene, and kills them both. Wes returns to the crime scene to see if he can offer any insight on the case. Masquerading as one of the detectives, Lee lures Wes outside, intending to kill him.\n\nAt Lee\u2019s hotel, Becky and Helga argue and get into a fight. Becky smashes a vase over Helga\u2019s head. Helga reaches for a gun in her purse and there is a struggle in which Helga is shot and wounded.  Becky escapes with Helga firing after her. Helga finds her way to Becky's house, where Lee has knocked Wes unconscious. Lee decides to kill Helga instead of taking her to the hospital, concluding that her wound is too severe to be treated, but his gun jams. He turns to retrieve Wes's gun but finds that Helga has escaped and has flagged down a passing car, which happens to carry Dosmo and his hostages. Audrey jumps out of the car and tries to help the dying Helga, but Helga dies on the roadside.\n\nWes is caught in the middle of a shootout between Dosmo and Lee, and is shot in the legs. Just before Lee can kill Dosmo, Teddy shoots Lee, killing him.\n\nA grateful Wes allows Dosmo to take the $30,000 and escape with Susan. The following day, Teddy shows up at an anniversary party that Audrey is attending. As Susan and Dosmo drive down a highway, Dosmo contemplates using the money to start a pizzeria in Brooklyn.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Dosmo Pizzo\n* [[Greg Cruttwell]] as Allan Hopper\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Alvin Strayer\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Becky Foxx\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Susan Parish\n* [[Peter Horton]] as Roy Foxx\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Audrey Hopper\n* [[Paul Mazursky]] as Teddy Peppers\n* [[James Spader]] as Lee Woods\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Wes Taylor\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Helga Svelgen\n* [[Keith Carradine]] as Detective Creighton\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Evelyn\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Ralph Crupi\n* [[Kathleen Luong]] as Midori\n* [[Michael Jai White]] as Buck\n* [[Cress Williams]] as Golfer\n* [[Lawrence Tierney]] as Older Man\n* [[Micole Mercurio]] as Older Woman\n* [[Ada Maris]] as Detective Carla Valenzuela\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was given mixed reviews from critics, with a 62% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 58 reviews.
