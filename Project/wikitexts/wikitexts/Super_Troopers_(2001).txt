Accessed November 13, 2008.</ref>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Super Troopers 2]]'', was released on April 20, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the fictional town of Spurbury, [[Vermont]], four [[Vermont State Police|Vermont state troopers]] patrol a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} section of highway and compete for prominence with the local police department. Although they are warned that their station risks being shuttered due to low productivity, the troopers{{snd}}Lieutenant Arcot Ramathorn, \"Rabbit\" Roto, \"Mac\" Womack, and Carl Foster{{snd}}delight in playing practical jokes on unsuspecting motorists and each other, rather than enforcing the law. They particularly enjoy tormenting fellow trooper Rodney Farva, a cocky and overzealous officer who has been suspended from the road for an unspecified incident.\n\nThe troopers, led by Captain John O'Hagen, are called to investigate an abandoned Winnebago off the highway, only to find the Spurbury police have already arrived: by claiming the investigation, the Spurbury police chief, Bruce Grady, hopes to force the closure of the troopers' station, thereby securing increased funding for his agency. The animosity leads to a brawl between the assembled officers, during which the body of a murdered woman is discovered inside the Winnebago. The troopers observe a tattoo on the dead woman depicting a monkey. During a routine traffic stop of a semi truck shortly after, Foster and Womack discover a large shipment of marijuana marked with stickers depicting the same monkey. The troopers suspect the dead woman and the marijuana are related, but Chief Grady laughs off the claim and refuses Captain O'Hagen's suggestion that the troopers and local police cooperate on the investigation.\n\nFoster begins a relationship with Spurbury police officer Ursula Hanson and, while attempting to have sex with her in the now-impounded Winnebago, discovers hidden bundles of marijuana, all bearing the same monkey sticker. Foster conspires with Ursula, who hates her coworkers and is stuck manning the front desk, to reveal the bust at an upcoming visit by the governor, thereby proving the troopers' suspicions and embarrassing the local police. Meanwhile, Farva is reinstated to patrol and partnered with an exasperated Ramathorn. However, Farva attacks a restaurant cashier and is arrested by the Spurbury police. Chief Grady offers Farva a job with his department in exchange for information about the drug investigation, but Farva refuses. Farva is subsequently reprimanded by an infuriated O'Hagen, who re-suspends Farva.\n\nThe governor arrives in Spurbury; Ramathorn and Foster break into the police impound and steal the Winnebago, planning to reveal the marijuana discovered by Foster at a press conference. They barely make it in time, only to discover the marijuana has already been seized by the Spurbury police, with Chief Grady claiming credit. Foster accuses Ursula of revealing the location of the marijuana in exchange for a favorable assignment. Having nothing to show for their efforts, the state troopers expect their station to be shut down.\n\nBack at the station, the troopers find Farva dressed in a Spurbury police uniform; Foster realizes that it was Farva, not Ursula, who betrayed the location of the marijuana. The troopers, including Captain O'Hagen, handcuff Farva to a toilet and drunkenly vandalize Chief Grady's house.  Ursula offers to help the troopers get back at Grady, and tips them off to intercept a drug-running truck. As they attempt to pursue it, the troopers encounter an escaped Farva, who holds them at gunpoint and berates them for not taking him seriously as a cop. O'Hagen intervenes and the troopers convince Farva to help them stop the drug smugglers. Following the truck to a nearby airfield, the troopers observe it being loaded with marijuana from a Canadian-marked plane. Chief Grady and several Spurbury officers then arrive, and the troopers realize that the local police are running protection for the smugglers. After creating a diversion, the troopers brawl with the Spurbury officers and smugglers, ultimately arresting them.\n\nSome days later, the governor sends Captain O'Hagen a letter thanking him for his efforts, but telling him the station will still be shut down. Three months later, Ramathorn and Rabbit, as deliverymen, find themselves bringing a keg of beer to a party hosted by underage college students they previously arrested. As the teenagers torment the seemingly powerless ex-troopers, they remove their deliverymen's uniforms to reveal that they are Spurbury police officers, having replaced their corrupt predecessors.\n\n== Cast ==\n;Vermont State Troopers\n* [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] as Lieutenant Arcot \"Thorny\" Ramathorn, a veteran of the Vermont State Police who is the second-in-command of his barracks.\n* [[Paul Soter]] as Trooper Carl Foster, arguably the most calm and reserved Trooper of the force.\n* [[Steve Lemme]] as Trooper MacIntyre \"Mac\" Womack, the Trooper who enjoys pranks the most.\n* [[Erik Stolhanske]] as Trooper Robbie \"Rabbit\" Roto, a rookie State Trooper.\n* [[Kevin Heffernan (actor)|Kevin Heffernan]] as Trooper Rodney \"Rod\" Farva, a fat, loud, ill-tempered, obnoxious and arrogant radio operator.\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Captain John O'Hagen, the cantankerous commander of his Vermont State Trooper barracks.\n\n;Spurbury Police Department\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Police Chief Bruce Grady, the sassy chief of the Spurbury Police\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Officer Ursula Hanson, an underappreciated dispatcher\n* James Grace as Officer Jim Rando, a rude, ill-tempered, wisecracking [[police officer]]\n* Michael Weaver as Officer Samuel Smy, an obnoxious, intellectually stupid [[police officer]]\n* Dan Fey as Officer Jack Burton, an obnoxious, intellectually stupid [[police officer]]\n\n;Other Characters\n* Andre Vippolis as College boy 1\n* [[Joey Kern]] as College boy 2\n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as College boy 3\n* Amy de Lucia as Bobbi Ramathorn, Thorny's wife\n* [[Philippe Brenninkmeyer]] as German man\n* Maria Tornberg as German woman\n* Jimmy Noonan as Frank Galikanokus, one of the ringleaders in the drug smuggling ring\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as Larry Johnson, a [[Speed limit|speeding]] motorist \n* [[Blanchard Ryan]] as Casino La Fantastique Sally\n* [[Lynda Carter]] as [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont Governor]] Jessman\n* [[John Bedford Lloyd]] as \"Mad Bill\" Timber, the Mayor of Spurbury\n* [[Charlie Finn]] as Ted, a wisecracking yet dim-witted employee at the fictitious Dimpus Burger.\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Foreman 1 (deleted scene)\n* Jerry Walsh as Foreman 2 (deleted scene)\n\n== Production ==\nBroken Lizard member Steve Lemme stated that the idea for the film came from road tripping to various weddings in his friend and fellow BL member Jay Chandraskhar's car and frequently getting pulled over by cops.<ref name=\"Esquire\"/>  As they were frequently under the influence of drugs, the gang began to wonder what would happen if the cops were aware of the situation and \"had a sense of humor\".
