It is based on the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' comic strip ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and its eponymous character created by [[John Wagner]] and [[Carlos Ezquerra]]. [[Karl Urban]] stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, [[dystopia|dystopic]] metropolis called [[Mega-City One]] that lies in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, [[Judge Anderson]] ([[Olivia Thirlby]]), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey <!--British spelling of \"story\"-->high-rise block of apartments and deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma ([[Lena Headey]]).\n\nGarland began writing the script in 2006, although the development of a new ''Judge Dredd'' film adaptation, unrelated to the 1995 film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', was not announced until December 2008. Produced by British studio [[DNA Films]], ''Dredd'' began [[principal photography]], using [[3D film|3D]] cameras throughout, in November 2010. Filming took place on [[practical effect|practical]] sets and locations in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]].\n\n''Dredd'' was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's [[visual effects]], [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] and action, while criticism focused on excessive violence as well as a perceived lack of the [[satire|satirical]] elements that are found in the source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30\u201345 million. ''Dredd'' saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a [[cult film]]. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by ''2000 AD''{{'}}s publisher [[Rebellion Developments]] have maintained the possibility of a second film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2080, most of the United States is a dystopic post nuclear war wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies [[Mega-City One]], a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judges]], who act as judge, jury, and executioner. [[Judge Dredd]] is tasked by the Chief Judge with evaluating new recruit [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]], a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge.\n\nIn a 200-storey<!--British spelling of \"story\"--> slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal executes three rogue drug dealers by having them [[flaying|skinned alive]]. They are infused with Slo-Mo (an addictive new drug that reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down to the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one that carried out the executions, and Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building (closing its blast shield doors under the pretext of a security test) to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help.\n\nMa-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, forcing the Judges to fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with [[rotary cannon]]s that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. The Judges breach an outer wall and call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb to search for the Judges. When they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.\n\nDredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns Peach Trees is the center of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists they move up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and [[Judge Guthrie|Guthrie]] respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as a hostage and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.\n\nWhile Dredd works his way toward Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan, and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd encounters Chan and is suspicious that he does not ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the [[Judge Dredd (character)#Weapon|pistol]]'s [[biometric device|DNA scanner]] does not recognize him and explodes, taking his hand off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading her mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition. He is subsequently shot and injured by Lex, but Dredd stalls him long enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.\n\nAnderson and Dredd obtain the code to Ma-Ma's apartment from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that [[Dead man's switch|if she dies, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives]] on the top floors, destroying the building. Because the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, Dredd forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anderson accepts that she has failed her evaluation by getting disarmed and leaves. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karl Urban]] as [[Judge Dredd|Dredd]]: <br />A famed and feared [[Judge (2000 AD)|Judge]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=2}} Producer Allon Reich described Dredd as \"an extreme character, and he administers justice with an extreme lack of prejudice\". Urban approached the producers about joining the film. He found the role challenging because the character never removes his helmet, requiring Urban to convey emotion without using his eyes. He viewed the character as an average man with an insanely tough job in a fragmenting society and likened Dredd's heroism to that of a fireman.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=7\u20139}} The role also demanded physical preparation; Urban undertook intensive physical training to become a \"beast of a man\".<ref name=\"ShaveMagazine\" /> He also underwent weapons and technical training to learn how to operate under fire, arrest criminals and breach doors. He insisted on performing his own motorcycle stunts for the film. He played Dredd with a raspy and harsh vocal tone akin to \"a saw cutting through bone\", which he found difficult to sustain.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=7\u20139}}\n[[File:Olivia Thirlby 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Olivia Thirlby]] promoting the film at the 2012 [[Fantastic Fest]]]]\n* [[Olivia Thirlby]] as [[Judge Anderson|Cassandra Anderson]]:<br>A rookie Judge and genetic mutant with powerful psychic abilities.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3\u20134}} Anderson can sense the thoughts and emotions of others.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=11}} Thirlby contrasted her character with Dredd's \"black and white\" perspective, describing Anderson as existing \"in a grey area where everything is enhanced or clouded by the fact [that] she knows what is going on in the very interior of a person\". She undertook weapons and combat training, learning to perform a [[roundhouse kick]] to make her believably physically commanding. The character was partially inspired by singer [[Debbie Harry]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=10\u201311}}\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal: <br />A former prostitute turned drug lord and criminal kingpin who is the sole supplier of Slo-Mo, a new and addictive drug.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3,11}} Headey's performance was inspired by punk-rock singer [[Patti Smith]]. Reich described the character as someone who does \"not care at all about what anybody thinks or feels and she will do, and behave, as she wants\".{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=11\u201312}} Headey said: \"I think of [Ma-Ma] like an old great white shark who is just waiting for someone bigger and stronger to show up and kill her&nbsp;...&nbsp;she's ready for it. In fact, she can't wait for it to happen&nbsp;...&nbsp;She's an addict, so she's dead in that way, but that last knock just hasn't come.\"<ref name=\"CastHeadey\" /> Before Headey's casting, the character was described as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman.<ref name=\"2011JanPlaylist\" /><ref name=\"Marketing1\" />\n* [[Wood Harris]] as Kay: <br />Ma-Ma's clansman.{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=3,16}} Harris described the character as a villain, but one that sees himself as no worse than the Judges. Harris said: \"&nbsp;...&nbsp;Dredd goes around literally judging and killing people if they do wrong&nbsp;...&nbsp;Anyone who goes against the system might end up the bad guy. So I think Kay has justified fighting that in his mind.\"{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=12}}\n\nThe cast also includes: [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as the gang's unnamed computer expert;<ref name=\"CastGleeson\" /> Warrick Grier as Ma-Ma's right-hand man Caleb; [[DeObia Oparei]] as TJ, Peach Trees' medic; [[Francis Chouler]] as [[Judge Guthrie]],<ref name=\"CastChouler\" /> Daniel Hadebe as Judge Volt, and [[Rakie Ayola]] as the Chief Judge.<ref name=\"Rakie\" /> [[Langley Kirkwood]], Edwin Perry, Karl Thaning, and Michele Levin portray, respectively, the corrupt Judges Lex, Alvarez, Chan, and Kaplan. ''Dredd'' also features Junior Singo as Amos and Luke Tyler as Freel, young boys who confront Dredd; [[Jason Cope]] as Zwirner, the thug executed by Dredd during the opening scene; Joe Vaz as Big Joe, the thug that leads the confrontation outside of the med station; Scott Sparrow as Japhet, Anderson's first execution; and Nicole Bailey as Cathy, Japhet's wife, in whose apartment the Judges take refuge.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=2, 20}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of the film was announced on 20 December 2008, although writer [[Alex Garland]] had begun working on the script in 2006.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> British studio [[DNA Films]] produced the film, and partnered with sales agency [[IM Global]] to sell the worldwide distribution rights.<ref name=\"DevelopmentDec08\" /><ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner [[Reliance Entertainment|Reliance Big Pictures]] agree to co-finance the [[3D film|3-D]] project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa in late 2010.<ref name=\"Development1\" /><ref name=\"Development2\" /> [[Pete Travis]] was named as the film's director and Garland, [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] and Allon Reich would produce it.<ref name=\"Development2\" /><ref name=\"DevelopmentJul1\" /> [[Duncan Jones]] had previously been offered the role of director.<ref name=\"Reelz4\" /> In a 2010 interview, Jones said that his vision for the film was unconventional\u2014describing it as weird, dark, and funny\u2014and it did not mesh well with Garland's script.<ref name=\"DevJones\" /> In September 2010, it was reported that the film would be titled ''Dredd''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep10\" />\n\n[[Pre-production]] commenced on 23 August 2010 at Cape Town Film Studios in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.<ref name=\"ReelzChannel\" /> During the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July, Urban confirmed that he had been offered the role of Judge Dredd, and on 18 August 2010, it was reported that Urban officially had the role.<ref name=\"VarietyAug2010\" /> In September 2010, it was announced that Thirlby would play Dredd's telepathic rookie Cassandra Anderson.<ref name=\"VarietySep2010\" /> In the same month during the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the film attracted $30 million in worldwide pre-sales to distributors in 90% of theatrical markets.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep10B\" /><ref name=\"GuardianSep2010\" /> The sales included a $7 million deal with British distributor [[Entertainment Film Distributors]].\n\nOn 2 November 2010, [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] secured the North American distribution rights to ''Dredd''.<ref name=\"VarietyNov2010\" /> Headey joined the cast as drug-dealer Ma-Ma in January 2011.<ref name=\"2011JanPlaylist\" /> ''Judge Dredd'' creator [[John Wagner]] acted as a consultant on the film.<ref name=\"TheGuardian\" /> In 2012, he confirmed that it was a new adaptation of the comic material and was not a remake of the 1995 adaptation ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'', which starred [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />\n{{quote box|quote=\"...what John [Wagner] does [in the comic] is have Dredd evolve, in the way that a glacier moves: you look a year later and something actually has shifted! I tried to be true to that.\"|source=Alex Garland concerning writing Dredd's character.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />|width=35%|}}\n\n===Writing===\nGarland began writing ''Dredd'' during post-production of his other writing credit ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'', and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of ''[[28 Weeks Later]]''. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead [[Judge Death]]. He described the story as a \"riff on the whole Judge system\", but that it did not work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the ''Judge Dredd'' comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including \"[[Democracy (Judge Dredd storyline)|Democracy]]\" (1986) and \"[[Origins (Judge Dredd story)|Origins]]\" (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: \"I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but there is definitely a change in him over the course of the movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes.\"<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" />\n\nDiscussing the film's setting within the Peach Trees Block tower, Garland said the buildings were \"like micro city states&nbsp;...&nbsp;you could live and die in those buildings\". He also considered that the setting met Wagner's suggestion that the future portrayed in ''Dredd'' should relate to modern ways of living. Garland named the tower after a restaurant called \"The Peach Tree\" in [[Shrewsbury]], England, where he first met with Wagner. The budget limited his ability to represent some of the comic aspects of Mega-City One, such as robots and aliens.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Throughout the production, Garland would send his script to Wagner, who would revise some of the dialogue. Urban would then further revise the script during his performance.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" />\n[[File:Dredd (film) - Visual Effects.ogv|thumb|left|The Slo-Mo sequences were designed over several years with the intention of replicating the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, combining high-speed photography and colour saturation. Alex Garland questioned if the effect could make the film's violence beautiful.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /><ref name=\"FX\" />|alt=A man fires a gun at another man raising his gun. The bullet enters one side of the man's face and erupts out of the other, sending blood towards the camera. The scene plays entirely in slow motion.]]\n\n===Design===\nThe filmmakers decided that Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like \"someone who spends hours sort of [[anabolic steroid|steroiding]] himself up.\" His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an extruded eagle statuette was removed from his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality and give it a sense of realism.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /> Garland said: \"If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he'd be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection.\"<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Remaining faithful to the comic,<ref name=\"TheGuardian\" /> Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film.<ref name=\"IgnSep2010\" /> Urban said: \"He is supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma&nbsp;...&nbsp;You wouldn't get to the end of a [[Sergio Leone]] Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Urbanquote\" />\n\nDredd's signature weapon, the \"[[Lawgiver (Judge Dredd)|Lawgiver]]\" was developed as a fully operational weapon based on a [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm firing system]], capable of firing ammunition and being changed from automatic to semi-auto fire.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}} His motorcycle \"Lawmaster\" was a modified 500cc motorcycle. A large [[motorcycle fairing|fairing]] was added over the motorcycle with machine guns, an extended wheel base and the largest functional tyres possible. The vehicle was also operational and Urban insisted on riding it himself rather than relying on [[Chroma key]] visual effects. Wagner described the necessity of adaptation from the source material and said that the 1995 film's attempt to directly replicate the comic's motorcycle was unable to steer because the tyres were too large.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}}\n\nGarland and VFX supervisor [[Jon Thum]] began developing the Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for ''[[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|Never Let Me Go]]''. They experimented with an effect to replicate the visual effects of [[hallucinogen]]ic drugs to see how long it could be used before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /> Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, \"You see a whale or a shark breach the water&nbsp;...&nbsp;then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by&nbsp;...&nbsp;how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [drug] trip, sort of stepping outside it but staying attached at the same time.\" He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: \"Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete.\"<ref name=\"DesignSloMo\" /> Comic artist [[Jock (artist)|Jock]] provided concept art for the film design.<ref name=\"DevelopmentSep09\" /><ref name=\"Reelz3\" />\n[[File:Dredd-Film-City-View.jpg|thumb|Final art of the city by VFX art director Neil Miller, with Peach Trees on the left. To highlight the scale of [[Mega-City One]], the \"micro-city state\"\u2013like towers were gradually positioned farther apart to emphasise their size and allow a more detailed city to emerge between them.]]\n\n===Filming===\nWith a $30\u201345 million production budget, filming began on 12 November 2010 in Cape Town and took approximately 13 weeks, with [[second unit]] photography occurring over seven weeks.<ref name=\"VarietySep2010\" /><ref name=\"VarietyNov2010\" /><ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Filming locations included Johannesburg and Cape Town Film Studios (''Dredd'' was the first project filmed at the studio).{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=31}}<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The project involved a majority of Cape Town crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs.<ref name=\"DevTime\" /> The film was shot [[digital cinematography|digitally]] and primarily in 3D using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED MX]], SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras for the Slo-Mo sequences, producing 4,000 frames per second. Multiple camera rigs were used.<ref name=\"BSCine\" /><ref name=\"EmpireSep2010\" /> Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.<ref name=\"Pf3df\" /><ref name=\"ColliderFrames\" />\n\nDNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer [[Anthony Dod Mantle]] to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D.<ref name=\"BSCine\" />{{Sfn|Production|2012|pp=12\u201313}} The filmmakers wanted ''Dredd'' to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}}\n\nMega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a suitable set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers did not want to build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing [[rotary cannon]]s across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=13}} Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story.<ref name=\"FX\" /> Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: \"I hope it will be more painterly. If we get it right, it will be a cross between ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]''.\"<ref name=\"BSCine\" /> Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.<ref name=\"FilmingGarland\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nThe filmmakers experimented with the visuals of Mega-City One, including the design and positioning of the city's tower blocks, to create the impression that the city had risen out of the remains of another. They found that replicating the comic visuals of blocks close together made the blocks appear small. Instead they allowed more space between the buildings to emphasise the larger buildings and allow for the presence of roads and cars to allow for extrapolation outside of the picture. Outcrops and appendages were added to break up the buildings' straight lines.<ref name=\"SequelSep12\" /><ref name=\"FX\" /> On 7 October 2011, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Travis was prohibited from participating in the editing process following creative disagreements between producers and executives. Garland took over the editing process; his contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit\u2014a situation considered unusual as Garland had never directed a film before and had not been in charge of any filming. The disagreement concerned a disapproval over the footage that Travis was providing. Although Travis was removed from the editing process, he was monitoring the progress of the film. On 10 October, Travis and Garland released a joint statement saying that they had agreed on an \"unorthodox collaboration\" before production began, that Travis was still involved in the film and that Garland was not seeking a co-director credit.<ref name=\"PPContro\" /> In March 2018, Urban said that he believed ''Dredd'' should be considered Garland's directorial debut.<ref name=\"GarlandDirector\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Listen|filename=Dredd - Ma Ma's Requiem Sample.ogg|title=\"Ma-Ma's Requiem\"|description=Tracks matching the slow motion visuals of the film were composed with real instruments before being slowed down (0:21).|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[Paul Leonard-Morgan]] wrote the film's [[industrial music]] score.<ref name=\"Music1\" /><ref name=\"Music2\" /> Leonard-Morgan created music to suit the film's futuristic setting. He experimented with band-based music, but decided it sounded over-produced and too safe. He turned to electronic music and used 1980s-style synthesisers and modern sound modules to create various combinations and applied distortion and other effects to the result. Leonard-Morgan said, \"I was looking to create a timeless score which couldn't be placed in any particular era. So it's ended up being a cross between a modern dance track and evocative soundscapes.\" For scenes conveying the effect of the Slo-Mo narcotic, he composed new music with real instruments and then slowed the songs down to match the visuals, such that one second of his composed score could last ten minutes (slowed to 0.17% of original). He then added additional real-time score to the slowed track.<ref name=\"Music3\" />\n\nAn unofficially altered [[Justin Bieber]] song served as inspiration for the Slo-Mo theme. Garland said that [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] instrumentalist [[Geoff Barrow]] \"sent me a link to a Justin Bieber song slowed down 800 times and it became this stunning trippy choral music.\" Morgan recreated the effect based on the modified track, which was used in the finished film. The film used Bieber's music as a [[temp track|temporary placeholder]] during editing before the score was finalised.<ref name=\"MusicBieber\" />\n\nThe film also features songs by artists including: \"Poison Lips\" by [[Vitalic]]; \"Dubstride\" by Yann McCullough and Gemma Kicks; \"Snuffbox\" by [[Matt Berry]]; \"Pontiac Moon\" by Robert J. Walsh; and \"Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)\" by [[Bobby Womack]].{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=31}}\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n|width  = 210px\n|align  = left\n|video1 = {{YouTube|Ba0gC1vCoSA|The \"Big Addicted\" trailer}}\n}}\nIn August 2012, the viral advertising site \"Dredd Report\" was launched, satirising the [[Drudge Report]]. The site featured a video condemning the use of Slo-Mo, and links to news about the film.<ref name=\"Marketing2\" /> A tie-in comic book was published; its plot serves as a prequel to the film's narrative and follows Ma-Ma's life as a prostitute, controlled by her pimp Lester Grimes.

Critics praised his performance.]]\n\nSince its premiere screening at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International,<ref name=\"RevSDCC\" /> ''Dredd'' received positive reviews from critics.<ref name=\"SequelJune13\" /><ref name=\"Reception1\" /><ref name=\"Reception2\" /> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 79%, based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Fueled by bombastic violence and impressive special effects, rooted in self-satire and deadpan humor, ''Dredd 3D'' does a remarkable job of capturing its source material's gritty spirit.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F.<ref name=\"BONA2\" /> Some reviewers enjoyed its take on the titular character,<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> [[IGN]] praising it as a \"character study\".<ref name=\"RevIGN\" />\n\nUrban's acting was frequently praised, particularly his ability to perform a characterless figure.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /><ref name=\"RevGuardian\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Darren Franich enjoyed his \"credibly wry performance using little more than his gravelly, imitation-[[Clint Eastwood|[Clint] Eastwood]] voice\u2014and his chin\".<ref name=\"RevEW\" /> [[Indiewire]] argued that with the film, he \"continues to distinguish himself as a versatile performer who turns mimicry into emotional meaning\".<ref name=\"RevIndie\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Geoff Berkshire wrote the actor \"does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront\".<ref name=\"RevVariety\" />\n\nThirlby's Anderson was also highlighted,<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> such as by Berkshire for carrying the film's emotional story and said, \"one of the film's true thrills comes in watching Thirlby effortlessly balance the conflict between a Judge's merciless duties and a psychic's compassionate understanding.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> The ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s Laura Sneddon noted that ''Dredd'' passed the [[Bechdel test]], lacking in sexism or misogyny and positively portraying female characters who are no weaker, more sexualised or shown less than their male counterparts. Sneddon described Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender.<ref name=\"RevStatesman\" />\n\nMany US newspaper critics were less taken with the film. Mark Olsen of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it \"a clunk-headed action picture\" that \"simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations\".<ref name=\"RevLATimes\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Newsday]]'' described it as a \"soullessly gritty\" film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is \"all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism\".<ref name=\"RevNewsDay\" /> Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called it a \"gray and ugly film\", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.<ref name=\"RevStarLedger\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Stephen Dalton wrote that the \"dark, ironic, very British humour of the original strip\" was largely absent from the film and that \"[t]he limited location, computer game-style plot and muted humour\" of the film might disappoint some fans of the comic. Dalton also said that Urban's performance, while close to the comic, lacked something. Overall Dalton said, \"[p]itched at the right level to please original fans, but still slick and accessible enough to attract new ones, [Dredd] feels like a smart and muscular addition to the sci-fi action genre.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\" />\n\nThe visual effects and slow-motion sequences induced by Slo-Mo received broad praise. Berkshire said that they are notable and eye-catching with \"impressively utilised 3D.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> Hewitt said the visuals were \"genuinely surreal splashes of heightened colour that&nbsp;...&nbsp;don't outstay their welcome. The film's use of 3D is often excellent (including the credits) and it really comes to life in the Slo-mo scenes\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> Dalton said the film \"constantly impresses on a visual level, with a gritty style more akin to cult hits like ''[[District 9]]'' or ''[[28 Days Later]]'' than to standard Hollywood comic-book blockbusters.\" Dalton said, \"[Mantle's] first venture into 3D is a blaze of saturated colours, gorgeous high-resolution close-ups and dazzling slow-motion sequences.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\" /> ''Dredd'' won ''The Art of 3D'' award at the 2013 [[Empire Awards]], and was nominated for ''Best British Film'' and ''Best Science-fiction/Fantasy''.<ref name=\"AccoEmpire\" />\n\n''Judge Dredd'' creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of ''Dredd''. He said: \"I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd&nbsp;...&nbsp;Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson&nbsp;...&nbsp;The character and storyline are pure Dredd.\"<ref name=\"2012Empire \" /><ref name=\"RevWagner\" /> ''Dredd'' has been recognised as a [[cult film]] since its release.<ref name=\"TheGuardianOrigins\" /><ref name=\"Cult\" /><ref name=\"Cult2\" /><ref name=\"SequelMay15\" /> Some reviewers drew comparisons between ''Dredd'' and ''[[The Raid: Redemption]]'', another action film released a few months earlier, noting that similar elements in setting, story, and characters made ''Dredd'' appear derivative.<ref name=\"2012Empire\" /><ref name=\"RevIGN\" /><ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> However, Garland and Urban explained that the timing of when the films were shot would have made plagiarism impossible.<ref name=\"IntGarlandCrave\" /><ref name=\"IntUrbanSlash\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n!

It was also the best-selling digital download for that period.<ref name=\"HomeMediaNASale\" /> Sales spiked in the United Kingdom in June 2013, following a reported rumour that it could influence DNA Films' decision to pursue a sequel.<ref name=\"SequelJune13\" /> By September 2013, ''Dredd'' was estimated to have earned approximately $10 million in home media sales in North America, while in the UK it marked over 270 days in online-retailer [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s top 100 selling home media.<ref name=\"HomeMediaSep2013\" /> By July 2017, this sales figure was estimated to have increased to $20 million.<ref name=\"HomeMediaJul17\" />\n\n==Future==\nAt the [[London Film and Comic Con]] in July 2012, Garland said that a North American gross of over $50 million for ''Dredd'' would make sequels possible and that he had plans for a trilogy of films.

In July 2013, ''2000 AD'' endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures.<ref

involved in the original film.<ref name=\"SequelMar15\" />\n\nIn 2016, Urban said that \"conversations are happening\" regarding a ''Dredd'' continuation on streaming services [[Netflix]] or [[Amazon Prime]].<ref name=\"TVSequel\" /> In an interview in May 2016, Urban said that while the film's \"mishandled\" marketing strategy and \"unfortunate\" box office performance meant that it was \"problematic\" to try to make a sequel, \"the success it has achieved in all post-theatrical mediums has definitely strengthened the argument in favour of a sequel.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekMay2016\" /> In May 2017, a television series named ''Judge Dredd: Mega-City One'' was announced to be in development by IM Global Television and Rebellion.<ref name=\"SequelTVMay17\" /> In August 2017, Urban
