It was [[film score|score]]d by [[Stewart Copeland]], a member of [[The Police]]. The story revolves around a preteen boy named Michael, nicknamed Fresh (portrayed by [[Sean Nelson (actor)|Sean Nelson]]), who runs drugs for gangsters.

Jackson]]), Fresh devises and executes a brilliant plan to extricate himself and his drug-addicted sister ([[N'Bushe Wright]]) from their hopeless lives.<ref name=\"Ebert\"/><ref name=\"Berry\">Berry & Berry (2007), p. 128.</ref>\n\nMarketed as a [[hip hop culture|hip hop]] '[[hood film]], ''Fresh'' went relatively unnoticed by the public, but won critical acclaim. Critics praised the film for offering a realistic glimpse of life in New York City's projects during the [[crack epidemic]]. \"There's shocking resonance to the notion of a grade-school boy who's become a criminal out of sheer pragmatism,\" wrote [[Entertainment Weekly|''Entertainment'' ''Weekly'']]'s [[Owen Gleiberman]].<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |date=September 16, 1994 |title=Movie Review: Fresh |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303713,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421103711/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303713,00.html |archive-date=April 21, 2009 |access-date=27 May 2012 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|reason=Over a thousand words|date=October 2020}}\nTwelve-year-old Michael a.k.a. \"Fresh\" stops at a Latina woman's apartment to pick up dime bags of heroin before he goes to school. Fresh notices that she has given him the wrong amount, trying to swindle him out of his delivery. Fresh warns her that his boss Esteban will be angry with the incorrect amount. The woman, a drug addict, \"finds\" the missing bag. He leaves, disgusted. \n\nNext, he visits another apartment where several women and one man, Herbie, are measuring and cutting bricks of heroin. Herbie insults Fresh and makes crude comments about Fresh's sister, which angers Fresh. He rushes out because he is late for school. He meets up with another of Esteban's employees to count the drugs. The employee tells Fresh that Esteban wants to see him after handing Fresh his share of the money.\n\nFresh arrives late at school where he is his scolded by his teacher, Mrs. Coleman. At recess, Fresh and his best friend, Chuckie, watch the girls' cheerleading team and Fresh talks to one of them, Rosie. After school, Fresh goes to a wooded, abandoned area. In a secret hiding place where he stashes his earnings, his savings now come to a substantial amount. From there, he goes to his grandmother's house where his aunt and eleven cousins live.\n\nThe next morning, Fresh is selling drugs when a desperate drug addict offers sex to Fresh in exchange for drugs, but he sends her away. At the end of the day, Jake, one of the lookouts, becomes angry and threatens to kill Kermit who didn't show up to pay $50 Kermit owes him. Fresh seeks out Corky \u2014 his boss as well as Jake's \u2014 in order to get paid but Corky tries to short him. Fresh demands more money since the lookouts like Jake make $50, while his pay is $100 for selling the drugs. Corky agrees.\n\nFresh takes the subway to Washington Square to play chess for cash with a man who is undefeated while his father Sam, a skilled chess player, sits at another table watching him. After winning, Fresh plays his father but loses. Fresh visits Chuckie, who proposes to enter their dog, Roscoe, in a dogfight to earn cash and urges Fresh to get him a job with Esteban. Fresh leaves him to visit Esteban, who is annoyed that Fresh is selling crack for other drug dealers. Fresh leaves Esteban to go where his sister Nichole works. He bumps into James, Nichole's drug-dealing boyfriend. Fresh warns Nichole that Esteban is interested in her. She tells him that she doesn't like the way Esteban looks at her \"like a queen\" and that she doesn't love James either, only the drugs he gives her.\n\nFresh goes to watch a neighborhood basketball game, where Jake begins to show jealously towards a smaller kid, Curtis. During the game Curtis humiliates Jake by scoring the winning basket. As Rosie sees Fresh and walks over to talk to him, Jake fatally shoots Curtis. Everyone leaves except Fresh. He walks past Curtis' corpse and finds Rosie on the ground, choking on blood, having been struck in the neck by a stray bullet and dies. The police arrive shortly, demanding information which Fresh refuses to provide.\n\nNext day, Fresh plays chess with his father Sam again who scolds him for being distracted. Fresh loses but is able to put his Father's king in \"check\" for the 1st time. Later, Chuckie and Fresh arrive at the dogfight. Their dog wins. Chuckie wants to enter him into another fight but Fresh stops him, agreeing to get him a job with Esteban. They go to Esteban's apartment where Esteban and Nichole are finishing having sex. Esteban dismisses Chuckie after Chuckie boasts of \"busting those dope moves\". Esteban tells Fresh that he plans to groom Fresh to be his protege and wants Fresh to stop selling for other dealers.\n\nMeanwhile, Corky has the police's attention since Jake's shooting. Fresh takes his own savings to a cocaine source, Hector (Anthony Ruiz), under the pretense of being the runner for Corky. Hector refuses to hand over the drugs to Fresh. Fresh threatens him and offers him a big sum of cash - the entirety of Fresh's personal savings. Hector takes the cash and tells Fresh where to pick up the drugs. Fresh says that the police have wire-tapped Corky's phone numbers and tells Hector not to call Corky.\n\nAt school, Chuckie can't resist bragging about his supposed new job for Esteban. After school, he and Fresh buy science textbooks to hide the drugs. During the trip back, Chuckie almost gets arrested on the train for talking back to an officer, but Fresh deescalates the situation. They go to an abandoned house where Fresh is replacing their Heroin stash with Hector's Cocaine, while Chuckie keeps lookout thinking he's just there to hide it. When leaving, three armed men step out from behind the corner. Chuckie shoots at the men and runs, but trips. The gun falls under a car's tire. Chuckie tries to grab it but the tire is shot and it flattens over Chuckie's left hand, crushing it. Fresh runs back over to help him, to no avail, and Fresh runs away. The assailants kill Chuckie. Fresh is questioned by the police at the police station, but is let go.\n\nBack at home, Fresh's aunt tells him that she cannot risk the lives of her eleven other children for him and informs him that he will be sent to a group home. At school, Fresh's friends blame him for Chuckie's death and now truly alone, Fresh kills Chuckie's dog. When Fresh goes outside, Jake forces him in the car with the three assailants, revealing that Jake was behind the ambush on the kids. They bring Fresh to Corky who is upset with Chuckie's bragging about moving base for Esteban - the same drugs that Corky is selling - and that Esteban is encroaching on his product. The drugs that Jake and the assailants took from Chuckie's bag reveal that both Fresh and Chuckie were carrying crack cocaine. Corky threatens to kill Fresh to send a message to rival dealers.\n\nFresh lies, stating he was being forced to sell for Jake. An astonished Jake pulls out his gun to shoot Fresh, but Corky's henchmen turn on Jake and Jake's friend, Red, who try to convince everyone that Fresh is lying. Fresh insists that Jake and Red were planning to oust Corky and he was only saying that he was selling for Esteban as protection. Fresh tells them to call Hector, who will reveal the truth. Corky calls Hector. The conversation is short, with Hector expressing concern over Corky's phone being wire-tapped, as Hector was told by Fresh. Corky then kills Red and Jake. Corky turns to Fresh and asks who else is involved. Fresh names James.\n\nFresh then goes to Esteban's warehouse and tells him that Corky's crew had jumped him and that Corky is planning to sell heroin as well. He tells Esteban that Corky's distributor is James and the two are planning to meet that night. He adds that Nichole is seeing James secretly because James is plotting with Corky to take Esteban out. Corky and his men arrive at James' place and storm in while Esteban, Fresh, and two other men wait in Esteban's car. Inside, Esteban's crew kills James, Corky, and Corky's men. \n\nAfterwards, they drive to Esteban's place and Esteban sees Nichole is there. He tells his henchmen to take Fresh home. Fresh makes them stop the car and he leaves. He runs into a convenience store and makes a phone call. He then shows up at Esteban's apartment. Esteban lets him stay because he wants to confront Fresh for telling Nichole that he found her father in Staten Island and for urging her to leave for a rehabilitation center.\n\nAngry, Esteban demands to know what else Fresh is hiding from him. The police arrive and as Esteban goes to answer the door, Fresh hides something under the bed. The police officer turns out to be Sgt. Perez, responding to a call about a domestic dispute, presumably the call Fresh made before he visited Esteban. Esteban denies any argument. Fresh comes forward and tells Perez that Esteban is a drug dealer who killed James, Corky, and several others earlier that night, and his sister is scared to speak up since he is now threatening her. Sgt. Perez checks under the bed and finds Esteban's gun, which he removed from the car after the shooting earlier, and the drugs Fresh planted. The police take Esteban away. Sgt. Perez promises [[witness protection]] for Fresh and his sister.\n\nThe movie concludes with Fresh meeting his father again to play chess. His father berates him for being late and antagonizes Fresh before their game. Fresh's father looks up and sees Fresh sobbing, with tears quietly streaming down his face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Nelson (actor)|Sean Nelson]] as Fresh\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Esteban\n* [[Samuel L.
