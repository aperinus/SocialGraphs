It is based on the novel by [[Shane Connaughton]], and stars [[Albert Finney]] and [[Matt Keeslar]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-run-of-the-country-v135062|title=The Run of the Country (1995) - Peter Yates, Toby Yates &#124; Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related|website=AllMovie}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story tells of a political and generational conflict in a teen romance and coming-of-age story in Ireland. Albert Finney stars as a policeman with the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] in a small [[County Cavan]] village just south of the border between [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Republic of Ireland|the Republic]]. The sergeant, with nothing to do, hopes for just one murder to solve and make himself famous. His real concern, however, is that his relationship with his 18-year-old son Danny (Matt Keeslar) has been strained since the recent death of his wife from a heart attack during a domestic quarrel. Danny blames his father for his mother's death and resents his father's bullying ways, so he moves in with his best friend Prunty (Anthony Brophy). Danny then falls in love with Annagh (Victoria Smurfit), a beautiful, red-haired northerner, and their relationship, which becomes sexual, brings Danny's conflict with his headstrong father to a boil.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Danny's father\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Danny\n* [[Victoria Smurfit]] as Annagh\n* [[Anthony Brophy]] as Prunty\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Father Gaynor\n* Shaney McPhillips, a native of [[Ballyhaise]], as boy at the [[cockfight]] and boy wading across the river. McPhillips was awarded the 'Golden Farney Award' at The [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] Film Festival in [[County Monaghan]] for this performance.\n\n==Production==\nNovelist Shane Connaughton, who also wrote the script for ''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Playboys (film)|The Playboys]]'' (1992), adapted the script from his novel.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The film shares some of the same thematic and stylistic qualities of Yates's second movie of 1995 \u2014 ''[[Roommates (1995 film)|Roommates]]''.\n\nThe movie was mainly filmed on location in [[Redhills, County Cavan|Redhills]] and near [[Ballyhaise]], neighbouring villages in [[County Cavan]]. Some scenes were filmed in [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]], [[County Monaghan]], a town near Redhills. Other locations in the [[Republic of Ireland]] were also used.\n\n==Reception==\nMichael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said, \"Peter Yates' best or best-remembered movies...all excel at showing male interaction. And that's one of the strong points of ''Run of the Country.'' Just as Finney's outstanding trait as an actor is the solidity he gives his parts\u2014his growly voice and bulldog chin pulling the audience one way, his yearning eyes pulling them another\u2014Yates's direction, at its best, has an earthy reliability.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-09-22-9509220382-story.html|title=FINNEY SHINES IN POETIC 'RUN OF THE COUNTRY'|first=Michael Wilmington, Tribune movie|last=critic|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0114307}}\n* {{Mojo title|runofthecountry}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|run_of_the_country}}\n\n{{Peter Yates}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Run of the Country, The}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Yates]]\n[[Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Cockfighting in film]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ireland]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
