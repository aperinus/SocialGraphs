Eight years earlier, she was found washed ashore on a New Jersey beach, pregnant with Caitlin and totally amnesiac. Having never remembered her real name, \"Samantha\" has hired a number of ineffective private investigators to discover her past, the latest being the down-on-his-luck Mitch Henessey. During the Christmas holidays, Samantha is involved in a car accident and suffers a brief concussion; when she recovers, she finds she possesses skills with a knife that she cannot explain. Shortly thereafter, the family home is broken into by \"One-Eyed Jack\", a convict who escaped from jail after seeing Samantha's face on television.  Samantha demonstrates her fighting prowess by killing Jack bare-handed.  Worried that she poses a danger to Hal and Caitlin, Samantha leaves with Mitch, who has found a suitcase belonging to her, to seek out answers.\n\nThe suitcase contains a note directing them to Dr. Nathan Waldman. They arrange to meet at a train station unaware that government agents are tapping the doctor's calls.  En route, Samantha discovers the bottom of the suitcase contains a disassembled [[Remington 700|sniper rifle]] which she can expertly reassemble, along with other weapons.  When Samantha and Mitch go to meet Waldman at the station, they are attacked by a team of agents who shoot numerous bystanders, but the two escape with Waldman's help. The doctor informs Samantha that she is really an expert [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin, Charlene Elizabeth \"Charly\" Baltimore, who had disappeared eight years earlier.\n\nUnsure if they can trust Waldman, Samantha and Mitch leave him behind and seek another contact named on a note in the suitcase, Luke, believing he may be Charly's fianc\u00e9.\n\nWaldman catches up with them and tries to warn them that Luke is actually Charly's last assassination target, \"Daedalus\".  However, Luke kills Dr. Waldman, then straps Samantha to a waterwheel and tortures her by repeatedly submerging her in cold water.  After being tortured, she is finally jolted into remembering her past life.  Samantha frees herself, kills Luke, and escapes with Mitch.  Samantha completes her physical transformation back to Charly, cutting her hair and dying it platinum blonde.  Charly realizes that her \"Samantha Caine\" personality was a cover to get near to Daedalus eight years earlier.\n\nA [[Psychological Operations|psychological-operations]] specialist named Timothy, with whom Charly once had a romantic relationship, kidnaps Caitlin.\n\nCharly and Mitch learn about Daedalus' involvement in \"Project Honeymoon\", which she disrupted on her mission, resulting in One-Eyed Jack's incarceration; \"Project Honeymoon\" was intended to be a [[false flag]] chemical bomb detonation in Niagara Falls, planned by the CIA in an attempt to blame [[Islamic Terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] and secure more funding.  Charly realizes that Timothy and a new group is plotting to restage the attack, led by CIA Director Leland Perkins.  In Niagara Falls, where Timothy has taken Caitlin, he captures Mitch and Charly.  She tells Timothy that he is Caitlin's biological father and implores him not to hurt their daughter, but Timothy is ultimately unmoved, locking Charly and Caitlin in a freezer to kill them.\n\nCharly and Caitlin break out of the freezer by detonating barrels of kerosene and then freeing Mitch, who helps Charly attack the staging area.  This forces Timothy to launch the attack early; meanwhile, Caitlin locks herself in a cage on the truck carrying the bomb.  Charly chases the truck, overpowers its driver, diverts it from a Christmas parade, and overturns it on the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Niagara Falls International Bridge]] leading to [[Canada]].\n\nCharly frees Caitlin but they cannot get away from the bomb, which is about to explode, as Timothy and his agents attack them from a helicopter. Mitch suddenly arrives in a car, picking up Charly and Caitlin and entering Canada just before the bomb explodes, which kills Timothy and his forces and destroys the bridge.\n\nIn an epilogue, Charly has returned to her assumed identity of Samantha Caine, moving with Caitlin and Hal to a remote farmhouse and declining an offer from the president to join the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] (which could imply rejoining the CIA).  Mitch enjoys the publicity attracted by his role in the crisis and is interviewed by [[Larry King]] on television about Perkins, who was indicted for treason.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Charlene \"Charly\" Elizabeth Baltimore / Samantha Caine\n* [[Samuel L.

The lead had to be female.' It has also been suggested that the film's poor advertising campaign and lukewarm critical reception may have been a carry-over effect from [[Renny Harlin]] and [[Geena Davis]]'s previous collaboration, ''[[Cutthroat Island]]'', which was released 10 months earlier and was one of the biggest [[Box-office bomb|box office bombs]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/06/02/the-spy-and-the-private-eye-and-the-long-kiss-goodnight | title=The Spy and the Private Eye And THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT | first=Priscilla | last=Page | date=June 2, 2016 | publisher=Birth.
