Rebuilding after a gruelling armed conflict in which it lost a sizable part of its young male population, the nation is struggling to recover demographically. The situation is especially visible in certain rural parts where this shortage of men threatens to extinguish life completely.\n\nTwo sisters, Ognjenka and Mala Boginja from a fictional village that has no males of marrying age, set off for the city in search of good men to bring home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/entertainment/movies/text.php?vest=81275|title=Kona\u010dno sti\u017ee \"\u010carlston za Ognjenku\"! |website=Mtsmondo.com|access-date=6 November 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception and reaction==\n===Serbia===\nDespite a lot of hype, ''Charleston & Vendetta''{{'}}s reviews in the Serbian media were a mixed bag.\n\nWeb magazine ''Popboks'' called it a cross between an A movie and a [[B movie]].

Its main selling point at that stage was the political upheaval in Serbia at the time with parliamentary elections being held following a government's fall after the independence of Kosovo, all of which led to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publishing a large piece about the movie written by its staff writer Tracy Wilkinson.\n\nIn June 2008, another American publication took notice. The review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' by Alissa Simon also touches on politics as she sees the movie as \"a postmodern allegorical tale\" which \"succeeds in poking fun at various Serbian national myths and symbols with its strong, lusty, independent women, eager-to-fight men and sacrilegious shenanigans in a hearse and among tombstones\". Among praises for the visuals and special effects, she admits that the movie \"will require careful handling and critical support to reach international audiences\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=review&reviewid=VE1117937343|title=Tears for Sale, ''Variety'', June 4, 2008|website=Variety.com|access-date=6 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nAmerican audiences had a chance to see the movie on January 27, 2009 at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]].
