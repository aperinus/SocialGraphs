It stars [[David Duchovny]], [[Orlando Jones]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Julianne Moore]], and [[Ted Levine]]. It was released by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] in the United States and by [[Columbia Pictures]] internationally. The plot of the film follows college professor Ira Kane (Duchovny) and [[geologist]] Harry Block (Jones), who investigate a large [[meteor]] crash in Arizona. They discover that the meteor harbors extra-terrestrial lifeforms, which are evolving very quickly into large, diverse and outlandish creatures.\n\n''Evolution'' was based on a story by Don Jakoby, who originally wrote it as a serious science fiction horror thriller film, until director Reitman hired [[David Diamond (screenwriter)|David Diamond]] and [[David Weissman]] to re-write much of the script into a comedy which Don liked. Shooting took place from October 19, 2000 to February 7, 2001 in California and Page, Arizona, with an $80&nbsp;million budget, and the film was released in the United States on June 8, 2001. The film grossed $98.4 million internationally. A short-lived [[animated series]], ''[[Alienators: Evolution Continues]]'', loosely based on the film, was broadcast months after the film was released.\n\n==Plot==\nA large [[meteor]] crashes in the barren [[Arizona]] desert late at night, which aspiring firefighter Wayne Grey witnesses. The next day, science professors Ira Kane and Harry Block from nearby Glen Canyon [[Community College]] investigate the crash site, discovering the meteor has landed in a large cave and 'bleeds' a strange blue liquid when scraped. They quickly learn that the meteor harbors [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extra-terrestrial]] [[nitrogen]]-based microorganisms that condense millions of years of evolution within a matter of hours: the next day, the microscopic organisms have evolved into asexual [[fungi]] and [[flatworms]] that cannot yet breathe oxygen, and aquatic life the day after that.\n\nAfter the [[U.S. Army]] soon seals off the site, Ira and Harry ask Brigadier General Russell Woodman, Ira's former boss, and the clumsy Dr. Allison Reed, senior researcher in\nepidemiology at the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]], to aid in their research, but their efforts fail when two weeks later, Ira goes to court to be allowed to be part of the federal investigation, and when Allison questions him as a witness, he reveals that he was discharged from the army in the summer of 1997 after an experiment in May of that year, in which he developed an anthrax vaccine and administered it to nearly 140,000 soldiers, resulted in terrible consequences, which led to his dismissal from his position as a top-level researcher at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]]. Upon returning to the lab, Ira and Harry discover that Woodman has stolen their research, forcing them to infiltrate the base in disguise to get another meteor sample. They shockingly and amazingly discover that the caverns now harbor an alien rainforest teeming with tropical plant and animal life, including flying insects and carnivorous plant-life. That night, a large reptilian creature fatally mauls the owner of a local country club where Wayne works, and the next day a dog-sized frog-like animal attacks two elderly ladies in their home. Ira, Harry and Wayne find a valley behind the home filled with suffocating dragon-like creatures, which they theorize cannot yet breathe oxygen and are escaping from the meteor site through the local caverns. However, a newly-born dragon quickly adapts to the earth's oxygen and terrorizes a shopping mall before the trio gun it down.\n\nWith the media becoming increasingly aware of the alien attacks, [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] Lewis visits the site demanding answers, furious at not being informed earlier about the situation. Allison believes that the aliens will engulf the United States in two months, and Woodman suggests a [[napalm]] strike to destroy the meteor's contents and the surrounding town. Though Lewis opposes bombing the community, [[primate]]-like creatures suddenly attack the base and wound several members, persuading him to approve Woodman's napalm strike. Disgusted, Allison quits the CDC and joins Ira's crew. Ira later realizes that intense heat triggers the aliens' DNA and that the initial impact to Earth activated its evolution. Woodman ignores Allison's pleas and the town begins evacuating for the impending bombing strike. Looking at the positions of nitrogen and carbon on the [[periodic table]] on the back of Allison's T-shirt, Ira theorizes that [[selenium]] might be as toxic to the aliens as [[arsenic]] is to Earth's carbon life. Rather surprisingly, two of his dumbest students, Deke and Danny Donald, recall that [[selenium disulfide|selenium sulfide]] is the active ingredient in [[Head & Shoulders]] hair shampoo, which they decide to use against the alien organisms.\n\nWayne procures a firetruck and fills it with the shampoo with help from Ira's college students. However, Woodman's napalm strike goes off ahead of schedule before the team can try their plan, triggering the entire alien ecosystem to fuse together into a single immense amoeba-like blob that stands hundreds of feet tall. The giant mass begins multiplying through mitosis, which it would do infinitely until the country was overtaken by thousands of these gigantic creatures. The team maneuvers their firetruck underneath the mass and discovers a [[rectal]]-like orifice to [[Enema|spray the shampoo up-into]]; moments before the creature splits into two, the team succeeds and the monster explodes. The governor declares Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison heroes; Wayne is made a fully-credentialed firefighter, and Ira and Allison begin dating.\n\nLater, Harry, Ira and Wayne are shown promoting Head & Shoulders for both hair-care and fighting the aliens.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Duchovny]] as [[Colonel]] (Ret.)
