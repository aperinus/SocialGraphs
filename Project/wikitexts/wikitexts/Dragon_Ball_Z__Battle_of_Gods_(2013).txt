While reviewing the current state of the universe, he is surprised to learn that [[Frieza]] was defeated by a Saiyan named [[Goku]]. He recalls that thirty-nine years prior, the Oracle Fish foretold that a mighty opponent would appear before Beerus called the ''Super Saiyan God''. Intrigued by the potential challenge, Beerus then tracks Goku to [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kai|King Kai]]'s planet. Goku excitedly challenges Beerus to a fight and despite powering up to Super Saiyan 3, is effortlessly defeated. Disappointed, Beerus departs in order to seek out the other Saiyans.\n\nOn Earth, [[Bulma]]'s birthday party is interrupted by Beerus' arrival. [[Vegeta]], aware of the might of the God of Destruction, casts his pride aside in order to appease him, who along with Whis, soon both develop a curiosity for Earth's [[cuisine]]. While the party is ongoing, [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pilaf Gang|the Pilaf Gang]] attempts (and fails) to infiltrate the party to steal the [[magic (supernatural)|magical]] Dragon Balls, and accidentally shoots [[Videl]] while making a scene. While [[List of Dragon Ball Characters#Dende|Dende]] is healing her, he learns that Videl is pregnant with [[Gohan]]'s child. As the celebration continues, Beerus is soon provoked by [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Mr. Buu|Buu]]<!--Do not change to \"Boo\". Wikipedia uses the spelling used by the most English Dub media sources, which is \"Buu.\" Any edits changing this will be reverted.--> who refuses to share any pudding. Beerus attacks Buu and decides to destroy the Earth when [[Android 18]], [[Tien Shinhan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], and Gohan attempt to fight Beerus but are all swiftly defeated. Vegeta reluctantly tries his hand at fighting Beerus as does [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Son Goten|Goten]] and [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], who fuse into Gotenks, but they both are beaten as well. Bulma becomes upset at the fighting ruining her party and scolds Beerus before slapping him. When Beerus hits her back, Vegeta, already in \"Super Saiyan 2\" form, is sent into fit of rage and despite faring the best in combat against Beerus of anyone thus far, is still defeated.\n\nAs Beerus prepares to obliterate the planet, Goku arrives and asks Beerus for more time to learn about the Super Saiyan God. Using the Dragon Balls, he summons Shenron and the eternal dragon reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the form. Thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pan|Videl's unborn child]] channeling their [[qi|energy]] together, Goku ascends to the level of Super Saiyan God. He confronts Beerus and they engage in an intense battle. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its apparent time limit. However, he acquires the form's godlike feeling which allows him to retain some of the power in his fight against Beerus who eventually decides to use a massive energy attack to truly put Goku to the test. Goku struggles to stop the energy sphere but after he laments on the potential deaths of his loved ones, he is able to absorb the attack and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. He recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns that there are other universes with other Gods of Destruction as well. Beerus decides to spare the Earth by only destroying a small rock (thus ''technically'' keeping his word), and he and Whis bid farewell as they depart back to their home world.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{|border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-style=\"background-color: rgb(255,85,0);\"\n!Character!!Japanese voice actor!!English voice actor\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Goku]] \n| [[Masako Nozawa]] || [[Sean Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[List of Dragon Ball characters#Beerus|Beerus]] \n| [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] || [[Jason Douglas]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[List of Dragon Ball characters#Whis|Whis]] \n| [[Masakazu Morita]] || [[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Vegeta]] \n| [[Ry\u014d Horikawa]] || [[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
