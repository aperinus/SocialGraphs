Its plot revolves around a group of people fascinated by the mythology surrounding the film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''; they go into the [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Black Hills]] where the original film was shot and experience supernatural phenomena and psychological unraveling.\n\nOriginally conceived by Berlinger and co-writer Dick Beebe as a psychological thriller and meditation on mass hysteria, ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' was significantly altered in postproduction, which Berlinger would later claim compromised his original vision. Among the changes were a new soundtrack, additional editing, and the integration of entirely new sequences.\n\nThe film was released in theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on October 27, 2000. It received negative reviews from critics but was a financial success, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $15 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is contextualized in the beginning blocks of text as a dramatic reenactment of events that occurred after ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' was released into theaters.\n\nIn November 1999, tourists and fans of ''The Blair Witch Project'' descend on the small town of [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], where the film was set. Local resident Jeff, a former psychiatric patient and obsessed fan, orchestrates a group tour of locations featured in the film. Among the group are [[graduate student]]s Stephen and his pregnant girlfriend, Tristen, who are researching mythology and mass hysteria; Erica, the [[Wiccan]] daughter of an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] minister; and Kim, a [[Goth subculture|goth]] with [[psychic]] proclivities. They camp for the night in the ruins of [[The Blair Witch Project#Plot|Rustin Parr]]'s house, where Jeff has placed surveillance cameras, hoping to capture supernatural occurrences. Jeff becomes unnerved when he notices a large tree located in the center of the house's foundation, claiming it was not there before. That night, another tour group arrives to camp at the ruins, but they are misdirected to Coffin Rock by Jeff and Stephen.\n\nAfter drinking and smoking marijuana all night, the group awakens in the morning to find Stephen and Tristen's research documents shredded and strewn through the woods and Jeff's cameras destroyed; his damaged tapes are uncovered beneath the house's foundation, the same spot the ''Blair Witch Project'' tapes were found in 1995. Tristen suffers a [[miscarriage]], and they rush her to the Burkittsville hospital. In her hospital room, Tristen sees a young girl walking backward. After she is discharged, the group retreats to Jeff's home, an industrial building that was once a factory. While Tristen rests, the group reviews Jeff's tapes, which uncover an image of Erica circling around a tree, nude. Distraught, Erica claims she has no memory of such an event and goes to pray in another room. When Kim tries to console her, Erica reveals rash-like symbols covering her body and proclaims the group has been marked for death.\n\nKim borrows Jeff's van to pick up coffee and alcohol in town. At the country store, she gets into an argument with the cashier. While driving away, she swerves to avoid a group of children in the road and crashes the van into a tree, denting the fender. The children disappear when she exits the van. Later, Kim finds a bloody nail file stuck among the bottles of beer she purchased. The following morning, Jeff looks outside and sees the front end of his van entirely caved in, to the point that it is undrivable; Kim insists that the accident was minor. The group realizes Erica is absent and searches the house. They attempt to call her father at his office but are told by his secretary that he has no children.\n\nMeanwhile, Tristen's disposition grows increasingly bizarre. The county sheriff, Cravens, calls Jeff, informing him the other tour group was found disemboweled on Coffin Rock, and threatens him. Later, while searching through a drawer, Kim finds a set of surveillance dossiers on herself and the others. She confronts Jeff, but he denies knowing the source of them. Shortly after, the group discovers Erica's corpse in a closet.\n\nTristen begins chanting about [[widdershins]] and speaking backward; this leads Kim to suggest they play Jeff's tapes in reverse. Upon doing so, they find the footage shows the high and drunken group descending into a demonic ritual and frenzied orgy led by Tristen, culminating in the murder of the other tour group at Coffin Rock. When they confront Tristen, she alternately pleads and goads them. Jeff, convinced Tristen is [[spirit possession|possessed]] by the Blair Witch, begins filming the confrontation, attempting to elicit a confession for Erica's death. The three follow Tristen to the second floor, where she ties a rope around her neck and taunts Stephen, daring him to push her. In a fit of rage, he pushes her over the balcony, killing her.\n\nLater, Jeff, Stephen, and Kim are arrested and interrogated by police. Each claim that a possessed Tristen was responsible. Their accounts are contradicted by various video footage: Security cameras captured Kim murdering the store cashier with her own nail file, while Jeff's home monitors show him, nude, hiding Erica's body in the closet; the [[Video camera|DV footage]] Jeff filmed during Tristen's confrontation shows her pleading for her life as they accuse her of being a witch, ending in Stephen mercilessly pushing her to her death. Meanwhile, as Jeff, Kim, and Stephen are shown this footage by police, funeral mourners arrive in the woods to remember the other tour group that was murdered.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jeffrey Donovan]] as Jeffrey Patterson\n* [[Erica Leerhsen]] as Erica Geerson\n* [[Stephen Barker Turner]] as Stephen Ryan Parker\n* [[Kim Director]] as Kim Diamond\n* [[Tristine Skyler]] as Tristen Ryler\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Sheriff Ronald Cravens\n* Lauren Hulsey as Eileen Treacle\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Rustin Parr\n* Kennen Sisco as Peggy\n* Kevin Murray as Doctor\n}}\n\n{{small|'''Note''': [[Heather Donahue]], [[Michael C.

However, [[Haxan Films]], who created the original film, was not ready to begin work on a follow-up, preferring to wait until the initial buzz had died down.<ref>{{cite web|author=Morris, Clint|url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/blair_int.htm|title=Interview with Daniel Myrick and Ed Sanchez|access-date=April 18, 2018|work=Movie Hole|via=Webwombat.co.au|archive-date=December 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216001102/http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/blair_int.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> In December 1999, Artisan decided to proceed without them, hiring [[Joe Berlinger]], known for his work on true crime documentaries (this was his first and last narrative film for nineteen years), to direct.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=01:03:35}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/10/24/joe_berlinger_bw2_interview.shtml |work=[[BBC]]|date=October 24, 2000|title=Joe Berlinger - ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2''|last=Mottram|first=James|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108104958/https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/10/24/joe_berlinger_bw2_interview.shtml|archive-date=November 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile developing the screenplay, Berlinger spent time in the real town of [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]] (the setting of ''The Blair Witch Project'') undertaking research and interviewing locals on how the release of the film had impacted their lives.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=14:40\u201314:50}} Many of the individuals Berlinger interviewed served as direct inspirations for the characters featured in the film.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=14:40\u201314:50}} His core theme when composing the screenplay with Dick Beebe was that the evil attributed to the Blair Witch may \"be human in origin as opposed to supernatural\".{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=13:56\u201314:15}} According to Berlinger, the character of Erica represented an aspect of this, specifically the frustrations that the [[Wicca]]n community voiced after the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'', which some felt misconstrued the tenets of Wicca and showed their religion in a negative light.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=13:56\u201314:15}}\n\nBerlinger was also inspired by the \"lazy consumption of media\"{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=27:48}} that led many to accept ''The Blair Witch Project'' as a true documentary; specifically, \"how readily [the public is] willing to accept that something shot on video is real\".{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=21:25}} He elaborated: \"On one hand, ''Blair Witch 2'' works as a standard horror movie...but it also is a meditation on violence in the media, and the nature of fanaticism and obsession...and the dangers of blurring the lines between reality and fiction\".{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=17:50}} Additionally, Berlinger incorporated elements of real-life subjects and places featured in his 1996 true crime documentary ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]]'',{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=20:10}} as well as narrative components of the stage play ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' by [[Luigi Pirandello]].{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=26:25}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nBerlinger based his casting decisions largely on group chemistry between the actors, as the film was anchored exclusively in their collective experience.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=11:28\u201312:09}} The casting period, according to Berlinger, only lasted for six weeks,{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=11:20}} in New York City.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=11:41}} Originally, Tristine Skyler auditioned for the role played by Erica Leerhsen,{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=12:11}} while Leerhsen auditioned for the role played by Kim Director.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=12:16}} Upon casting Leerhsen, who in reality was a short-haired blonde, Berlinger fitted her with hair extensions and had her hair dyed red for the part.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=12:45}} Jeffrey Donovan had also originally auditioned for the role played by Stephen Barker Turner, but Berlinger felt him a better fit for the leader of the group.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=12:49}}\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe majority of the film was shot over a period of 44 days<ref name=stranger /> in the spring of 2000 on location outside of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The exposition scenes featuring the characters camping were shot in [[Gwynns Falls Leakin Park]], and the stone ruins of the Rustin Parr house were constructed out of styrofoam.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=22:20}} The scene featuring Tristen in the hospital was shot at an abandoned sanitarium in Baltimore.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=28:20}} Jeff's loft house in the film is actually the Clipper Mill, located on the edge of Baltimore.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=30:50}} The documentary footage that opens the film features interviews from real residents of Burkittsville, Maryland.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=00:58}}\n\nBecause the original film had been parodied so much since its release, Berlinger deliberately avoided using any [[shaky camera]]work and \"the [stylistic] clich\u00e9s of bad documentary filmmaking\", opting to maintain an aesthetic at odds with the documentary form.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=16:40}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\nStylistically, ''Book of Shadows'' was the direct opposite of its predecessor: though the film occasionally utilizes the [[point of view shot|point of view]] camcorder/[[pseudo-documentary]] format used in the first movie, ''Book of Shadows'' more closely resembles the glossy, big-budget special effects-laden horror films that ''Blair Witch'' was a counter to. Berlinger has stated that he originally made the film with more of an ambiguous tone that focused on the characters' psychological unraveling after their night spent in the Black Hills, but Artisan forced him to re-cut the film and re-shoot certain scenes to add more \"traditional\" horror movie elements, thus creating what they saw as a more \"commercial\" film. Namely, the footage of the main characters murdering the foreign tourists was shot in Berlinger's backyard mere weeks prior to the film's release date, and was incorporated in the film as [[Fast cutting|flash cuts]] to add more visual violence.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=06:09, 13:08}} Furthermore, expository footage showing Jeff in a psychiatric hospital was also shot at the request of Artisan executives; these scenes were filmed at the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center on [[Randall's Island]] in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=03:44}} Berlinger later stated that he felt the gory sequences incorporated into the film \"fought against the ambiguity [he] tried to nurture\".{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=06:01}}\n\nAdditionally, the interrogation sequences which are intercut throughout the film were, per Berlinger's director's cut, arranged as a single eight-minute-long sequence bookending the film.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=06:58}} Instead, the studio requested Berlinger cut the sequence into isolated vignettes and intercut them throughout the film.{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=06:58}} This compromised Berlinger's original vision of a \"linear\" narrative that begins \"as a lighthearted romp in the woods...almost as a spoof of the [Blair Witch] phenomenon\" before descending into a \"downward spiral\".{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=20:29}}\n\nThe original cut of the film also featured [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[Witchcraft (1957 song)|Witchcraft]]\" during the opening credits, but was replaced by the studio with \"[[Disposable Teens]]\" by [[Marilyn Manson]].{{sfn|Berlinger|2000|loc=19:05}}\n\nMultiple [[fan edit]]s have since attempted to reconstruct Berlinger's original vision.\n\n=== Score and soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (soundtrack)|Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows (score)}}\n\n== Release ==\n=== Marketing ===\nThough ''Book of Shadows''' marketing campaign made no attempt to present the film as a \"true story\", a promotional \"dossier\" for the film, compiled by D.A. Stern, was released, including fabricated police reports and interviews surrounding the events in the film as if they were fact (a similar \"dossier\", also by Stern, was released as a companion piece to the first film). Additionally, similar to the first movie, each of the main characters retain the first names of their respective actors, though their surnames are changed slightly.\n\nOn September 29, 2000, the film's teaser trailer was released on the internet, available for streaming exclusively on ''[[Yahoo!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 29, 2000|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/sep/29/news|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727012801/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/sep/29/news|archive-date=July 27, 2020|title=Net debut for Blair Witch 2 trailer}}</ref> The trailer shows a half-naked woman with a twana symbol behind her back, discovering [[Book of Shadows]] in the woods, before she is attacked by an unknown man.<ref>{{Citation|work=Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|title=Teaser trailer|publisher=Artisan Entertainment|year=2000|people=Leehrsen, Erica; Donovan, Jeffrey}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on October 18, a three-day online \"Blair Witch Webfest\" was launched, which included involvement from artist [[Marilyn Manson]], whose music was featured on the film's soundtrack.<ref name=manson>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=114862&page=1|work=ABC News|title=Manson Label Releases Blair Witch 2 Soundtrack|date=October 6, 2000|access-date=April 18, 2018|author=ABC News Staff}}</ref> The cyber-convention included a contest whose grand prize winner received tickets to the opening of Manson's tour in [[Minneapolis]], as well as a private screening of ''Book of Shadows'' with Manson in attendance.<ref name=manson />\n\nOn October 22, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] premiered ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'', a [[pseudo-documentary]] following ''Book of Shadows''{{'}}s protagonist, Jeff and others who are transfixed by the Blair Witch phenomenon.

In a 2016 article published by ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'', Brendan Morrow defended the film, calling it \"an excellent 'descent into madness film'\" and noted the studio's intervention in post-production: \"In ''Book of Shadows'', Berlinger took his hatred of the first movie's dishonesty and made an entire film out of it, commenting on the danger of blurring the line between fiction and reality.

Both the DVD and VHS releases came with a featurette detailing \"The Secret of Esrever\" (\"Esrever\" is the word ''reverse'' spelled backwards),<ref name=ign /><ref name=dvdad /> a number of near-[[subliminal message]]s in the form of hidden words and images that were placed throughout the film.{{sfn|Hand|2004|p=126}} The featurette encouraged viewers to watch certain scenes in reverse and/or frame-by-frame in order to decode the \"secret\", and, through scrambled letters flashed throughout the program, offered five clues to where they could be found: \"door\", \"water\", \"mirror\", \"rug\" and \"grave\". These images were not included in the theatrical cut of the film, and were rather added specifically for the original home video releases. Subsequent releases, particularly in digital formats, did not have the clues.<ref name=ign />\n\nAn example of these messages can be seen in a scene early in the film where the main characters are in a graveyard, standing behind a tombstone inscribed with the word \"Treacle\". The shot briefly cuts away and then cuts back, though the same tombstone now reads \"Further\". This is seen for approximately one second until it cuts away again, and the tombstone once again reads \"Treacle\" for the remainder of the scene.\n\nWhen all of the clues were identified, the hidden words, when put in the correct order, spelled out \"seek me no further\", plus an extra hidden word, \"or\". Viewers could then go to the official Blair Witch website and type the words into a special search box: typing \"seek me no further\" would play an extra scene from the film, and typing \"seek me no further or\" would enable them to add their name to a list of people who had also decoded the message. As of 2008, this function is no longer available.{{efn-lr|After 2008, the ''Blair Witch'' website dismantled the \"Secret of Esrever\" feature; because the website featured flash graphics, archives on the [[Wayback Machine]] do not show the website in detail at the time of its functionality. However, a screen capture of the \"Secret of Esrever\" navigation page (with a description) exists in the book ''Brandchild: Remarkable Insights Into the Minds of Today's Global Kids and Their Relationships with Brands'' (2003).{{sfn| Lindstr\u00f6m|Seybold|2003|p=19}}}}\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn September 2009, Ed S\u00e1nchez and [[Daniel Myrick]] announced their intent to produce ''Blair Witch 3''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eduardo Sanchez Talks Seventh Moon, Plans for Blair Witch 3 |date=May 18, 2012|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|work=[[Dread Central]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023133142/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/13757/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-for-blair-witch-3/|archive-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/blair_int.htm| title = The Blair Witch Project 3: Interview | access-date = July 3, 2009 | work = Webwombat.com.au | archive-date = July 12, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090712034921/http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/blair_int.htm | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8187275.stm | title =  The legend of the Witch lives on: Interview | access-date = April 14, 2018 | work = BBC News | date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> The film would be a direct sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not refer to any of the events from ''Book of Shadows'', given the film's status as a [[play within a play|film within a film]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Returns?|date=May 18, 2012|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|work=[[Dread Central]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210233440/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3/|archive-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref> In 2011, S\u00e1nchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Project 3 Moves Forward Says Eduardo Sanchez|date=September 16, 2011|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-blair-witch-project-3-moves-forward-says-eduardo-sanchez|publisher=Movie Web|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> The film went into [[development hell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Planned Horror Movie Sequels We're Still Waiting to See |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/list/10-planned-horror-movie-sequels-were-still-waiting-see|publisher=FearNet|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[San Diego Comic Con]] held in July 2016, a film ''The Woods'' turned out to be the sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project'', entitled ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/blair-witch-project-sequel-secret-comic-con | title = Blair Witch trailer: Sequel release date set for September | author = Clark Collis |  magazine = Entertainment Weekly | date = July 22, 2016 | access-date = July 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lr}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite AV media|last=Berlinger|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Berlinger|title=Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|medium=DVD [[Audio commentary]]|publisher=Artisan Home Entertainment|date=December 20, 2000}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dimare|first=Phillip|year=2011|title=Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-1-59884-296-8}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Hantke, Steffan|last=Hand|first=Richard J.|chapter=Survival Horror and the ''Resident Evil'' Franchise|title=Horror Film: Creating and Marketing Fear|year=2004|publisher=Univ.
