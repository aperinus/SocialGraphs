Starring [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Vincent Cassel]] and [[Albert Dupontel]], the plot depicts the events of a tragic night in Paris as two men attempt to avenge the brutal rape and beating of the woman they love. The film was edited as [[One-shot film|continuous shot]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> and is told in [[reverse chronology|reverse order]], with each scene taking place chronologically before the one that precedes it.\n\nTheatrically released in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, ''Irr\u00e9versible'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]] and won the Bronze Horse at the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]]. Critical reception was mixed, with praise towards the performances and No\u00e9's direction, but criticism towards its graphic portrayal of violence and rape. American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called ''Irr\u00e9versible'' \"a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable\".<ref name=\"ebert\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a night in Paris, emergency personnel respond to an altercation at the Rectum, a gay [[BDSM]] club. Two men are taken outside the club: Marcus, who's being carried out on a stretcher; and Pierre, who's being arrested by the police.\n\nThe next scene shows a volatile Marcus and reluctant Pierre enter the Rectum in search of a perverted psychopath known as Le Tenia. Marcus then proceeds to get into a fight with a man he suspects of being Le Tenia, who ends up breaking his arm before attempting to rape him. Pierre comes to his rescue and beats the man to death with a nearby fire extinguisher as the man's companion watches in amusement.\n\nAs the film progresses, it's revealed the two men are attempting to avenge a brutal attack on Alex, Marcus' girlfriend and Pierre's ex. In the proper chronology, Alex leaves a party attended by the two men due to Marcus' behavior and walks home alone through a [[pedestrian underpass]] when she notices a transgender prostitute getting attacked by Le Tenia, who turns out to be the companion of the man killed at the Rectum. Upon realizing he's been seen, Le Tenia immediately turns his attention to Alex, brutally raping her before savagely beating her into unconsciousness. After Marcus and Pierre discover Alex being taken away by paramedics, they encounter street criminals Mourad and Layde, who offer to help them find the culprit. The group tracks down Concha, the prostitute from before, through an ID she left at the scene. Concha identifies Le Tenia as Alex's rapist, setting up the events at the Rectum.\n\nThe last scenes of the film depict Alex, Marcus and Pierre earlier in the day where it's implied Alex left the more reserved Pierre for the uninhibited Marcus because he couldn't satisfy her sexually, which the former still holds frustration over. The film then reveals that Alex received a positive result on a pregnancy test she took at the start of the day. In the final scene, Alex is shown reading in a park before the film transitions to a [[strobe]] effect that ends with the message \"''Le Temps Detruit Tout''\", which is French for \"''Time Destroys Everything''\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as Alex\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Marcus\n* [[Albert Dupontel]] as Pierre\n* [[Jo Prestia]] as Le Tenia\n* [[Fatima Adoum]] as
