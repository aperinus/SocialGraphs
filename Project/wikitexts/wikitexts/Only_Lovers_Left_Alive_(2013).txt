An international co-production of the United Kingdom and Germany, the film focuses on the romance between two [[vampire]]s, and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn 2016, the film was ranked among the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]] by 177 critics around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films|date=23 August 2016|website=bbc.com|access-date=23 June 2018}}</ref> In late 2019, it was named the fourth greatest film of the [[2010s]] by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s chief film critic [[Todd McCarthy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/10-best-films-decade-1260056|title=The 10 Best Films of the Decade|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=6 December 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMarried for centuries and now living half a world apart, two vampires wake as the sun goes down. Adam sits holding a [[lute]], in his cluttered [[Detroit]] [[Victorian house|Victorian]], as Eve wakes up in her bedroom in [[Tangier]], surrounded by books. Rather than feeding on humans directly, they are dependent on local suppliers of the \"good stuff,\" for fear of blood contaminated by the 21st century environment. Adam, still a famous musician, also fears exposure, visiting a local blood bank in the dead of night in disguise as \"[[Faust|Dr. Faust]]\", bribing \"[[Dr. Watson]]\" for his coveted [[O negative]]. Eve relies on their old friend, the author [[Christopher Marlowe]], who faked his death in 1593 and now lives under the protection of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nDespite having influenced the careers of countless famous musicians and scientists, Adam has become withdrawn and suicidal. His desire to reconnect through his music is at odds with the danger of recognition as well as his contempt for the corrupt and foolish humans he refers to as 'zombies'. He spends his days recording his compositions on outdated studio equipment and lamenting the state of the modern world, whilst collecting vintage instruments. He pays Ian, a na\u00efve young music fan, to procure vintage guitars and other assorted curiosities, including a custom-made wooden bullet with a brass casing he thinks of using to kill himself. Having acquired much scientific knowledge over the years, Adam has built contraptions to power his home and a vintage sports car with technology originally pioneered by [[Nikola Tesla]]. His reclusive nature adds to his mystique as a musician and composer; he is upset when some intrepid fans turn up on his doorstep. Ian promises to discreetly spread rumours about Adam living elsewhere to draw them away.\n\nWhen Eve phones, she recognises Adam is despondent and decides to come to Detroit to comfort him. Soon after she arrives, Adam goes out for more blood, and she discovers his revolver hidden under the bed with the wooden bullet. Her vampire senses reveal to her that the bullet is new, and she is worried. Eve confronts Adam when he returns, chiding him for wasting the life and opportunities he has to enjoy and appreciate the good things in the world, as well as their relationship. They spend their nights cruising the empty streets of Detroit, listening to music and playing chess. Their idyll is shattered by the arrival of Eve's younger sister, Ava, from [[Los Angeles]]. Ava gorges herself on their stash of the \"good stuff\" and, hungry for excitement, persuades them to go out to a local club with Ian, where they hear Adam's music played by the band [[White Hills (band)|White Hills]]. Ava offers Ian a hit off the flask she secretly filled with blood and brought to the club, but Adam snatches it from her with supernatural speed and insists they leave. Before dawn, Ava kills Ian by drinking too much of his blood, and Adam kicks her out of the house.\n\nAdam and Eve dispose of Ian's corpse in an acid pool in an abandoned factory. Ian's murder and the appearance of another group of Adam's fans at the house, compel the couple to hastily return to Tangier with only what they can carry onto the plane. Desperately hungry, they visit Marlowe and learn that their old friend and mentor has been poisoned by accidentally drinking contaminated blood. After they discuss how Marlowe secretly wrote most of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, Marlowe dies. Eve takes Adam's ready cash and leaves him with the promise of a gift. He is captivated by the music from a nearby club, where Lebanese singer [[Yasmine Hamdan]] is finishing a haunting song. Eve reappears with a beautiful [[oud]], and as they sit together outdoors and contemplate their likely demise, they spot a pair of young lovers kissing. \"What choice do we have?\" Adam remarks, before the two of them apologetically approach the couple with the intent of drinking their blood.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eve\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Adam\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as Ava\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Ian\n* [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Dr. Watson\n* [[Slimane Dazi]] as Bilal\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Christopher Marlowe]]\n* [[Yasmine Hamdan]] as Yasmine\n* [[White Hills (band)|White Hills]] as themselves\n\n==Production==\nIn August 2010, Jarmusch said that [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Mia Wasikowska]] and [[John Hurt]] had agreed to join the film, described by Jarmusch in May 2011 as a \"crypto-vampire love story\" but he did not have financing yet.<ref name=screendaily/><ref name=villagevoice/> Financing the film was a difficult process for the director and he explained at the world premiere at the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in May 2013 that, \"it's getting more and more difficult for films that are a little unusual, or not predictable, or don't satisfy people's expectations of something\".<ref name=\"Trek\">{{cite news|title=Cannes 2013: Only Lovers Left Alive a seven-year trek says Jim Jarmusch|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/25/jim-jarmusch-vampires-only-lovers-left-alive-cannes|access-date=21 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2013|author=Andrew Pulver}}</ref>\n\nJarmusch revealed in 2014 that, after seven years of frustration, Swinton said \"That's good news, it means that now is not the time.
