[[Kenan Thompson]] stars as the title character. ''Fat Albert'' transforms the cartoon characters into three-dimensional humans, who have to come to grips with the differences that exist between their world and the real world.\n\nThe film acts as a continuation of the series; Fat Albert and the gang leave their 1970s cartoon world, and enter the 2000s real world to help a teenage girl, Doris Robertson ([[Kyla Pratt]]), deal with the challenges of being unpopular. The film was released on December 25, 2004, and grossed $48 million against a $45 million budget.\n\nIt has a 23% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which calls it \"bland but good-natured\" in its critical consensus.\n\n==Plot==\nDoris Robertson, a depressed teenager, is grieving the death of her grandfather and resisting her foster sister Lauri's efforts to engage socially. Upon learning that her parents will be away for a two day business trip to the Poconos, Doris' tear hits her television remote, as ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' is on. The tear opens up a portal to the cartoon world, Fat Albert jumps out of the television upon seeing Doris (except real-life), knowing she has a problem.\n\nRudy, Dumb Donald, Mushmouth, Bucky, and Old Weird Harold jump out, too; Bill tells Russell to stay put and cover for them. Doris insists she is fine, but the gang knows otherwise. When the show ends, they have to wait until tomorrow's show to come back. They follow Doris to school and are amazed by the new technology.\n\nAlbert becomes infatuated with Lauri. Reggie, an annoying schoolmate with an obsessive crush on Lauri, challenges Albert to a track race that Albert wins. In another attempt to help Doris, the gang persuades cheerleaders to invite them all to an outdoor party. With some reluctance, Doris agrees to attend. While at the party, Lauri dances with Albert. Reggie desperately attempts to make her jealous by dancing with Doris. When Lauri does not notice him, he tries to forcibly kiss Doris. Doris yells at him and runs off. Albert warns the boy to stay away from Doris.\n\nThe next day, Doris goes to school but asks the gang to go to the park instead of following her. Harold, normally clumsy, joins in a basketball game and is able to play perfectly. Mushmouth, who cannot talk normally, is taught how to speak by a little girl. Donald goes to the library, where he can read and remove his pink face covering hat.\n\nWhen Doris takes them home, three of the gang members \u2013 Bucky, Harold, and Donald \u2013 jump into the television. ''Breaking News'' interrupts the show before the other four can enter. Albert and Bill have an argument in private about going back. The gang takes Doris and Lauri to a fair on a junk made car. Doris says she would date Rudy if he was a real person when he asks.\n\nSearching for guidance, Fat Albert meets his creator, [[Bill Cosby]], and tells him of the dilemma. Though frightened and skeptical at first, Cosby proceeds to explain to him that his character is based on Doris' grandfather, Albert Robertson, which explains Doris' confusion over why Fat Albert seems so familiar. Mr. Cosby warns Fat Albert he has to return to the cartoon world, or he will turn into celluloid dust.\n\nDevastated, Albert tells Lauri he must leave, but she thinks he is being insensitive. The next day, Mushmouth, Rudy, and Bill jump back into the television. Albert goes to a track meet where Doris and Lauri are competing and encourages Doris to a victory. Reggie, who witnessed that the gang is from the television, attempts to threaten Albert, but he pushes him aside. Albert rushes to the girls' house on a borrowed skateboard. He says goodbye to Doris and Lauri and jumps back into the television, and manages to take back the focus of the show from a gang of bullies that threatened to do so earlier in the film, as seen by Russell.\n\nSometime later, Cosby and his friends, who helped inspire the cartoon characters from the show, stand in front of their old friend Albert Robertson's grave. As the camera pans on each of the men, images of their counterparts are seen. Doris watches them from afar as the old men race away, showing that they are still kids at heart, the same kids from the television show that they helped Bill Cosby inspire. Before the ending credits start, Fat Albert encourages the audience to finish watching the credits and help each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kenan Thompson]] as Fat Albert Robertson\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Doris Robertson\n* [[Bill Cosby]] as Himself\n* [[Dania Ramirez]] as Lauri Robertson\n* [[Shedrack Anderson III]] as Rudolph \"Rudy\" Davis \n* [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]] as William Henry \"Bill\" Cosby Jr.\n* [[Marques Houston]] as \"Dumb\" Donald Parker\n* [[Jermaine Williams]] as James \"Mushmouth\" Mush\n* [[Aaron Frazier]] as \"Old Weird\" Harold Simmons\n* [[Alphonso McAuley]] as Bucky Miller\n* [[Omarion]] as Reggie\n* [[J.
