An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, it stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Lee Remick]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Harvey Spencer Stephens]] in his film debut, [[Billie Whitelaw]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]], and [[Leo McKern]]. The film's plot follows [[Damien Thorn]], a young child replaced at birth by his father, unbeknownst to his wife, after their biological child dies shortly after birth. As a series of mysterious events and violent deaths occur around the family and Damien enters childhood, they come to learn he is in fact the prophesied [[Antichrist]].\n\nReleased theatrically by [[20th Century Fox]] in June 1976, ''The Omen'' received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing over $60 million at the U.S. box office and becoming [[1976 in film|one of the highest-grossing films of 1976]]. The film earned two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for Jerry Goldsmith, his only Oscar win. A scene from the film appeared at number 16 on [[Bravo (American TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''. The film spawned a [[The Omen (franchise)|franchise]], starting with ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'', released two years later, followed by a third installment, ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'', in 1981, and ''[[Omen IV: The Awakening]]'' in 1991. A [[The Omen (2006 film)|remake]] was released in 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->American diplomat Robert Thorn and his wife Kathy are living in [[Rome]], where she gives birth to a boy who dies. Hospital chaplain Father Spiletto persuades Robert to secretly adopt a baby whose mother just died in childbirth. Robert does not tell Kathy the child is not their own. They name him [[Damien Thorn|Damien]].\n\nFive years later, Robert is Ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]] when mysterious events plague the Thorns: a menacing [[Rottweiler]] appears at their home, Damien's nanny publicly hangs herself during his fifth birthday party, new nanny Mrs. Baylock arrives unannounced, Damien violently resists entering church, and Damien's presence terrifies animals at a wildlife park. Father Brennan warns Robert about Damien's origins, hinting that he is not human and insisting Robert take [[Eucharist|Communion]]. He tells Robert that Damien is the son of Satan, that Kathy is pregnant, and that he will kill his unborn sibling and parents unless he dies. Later, Brennan is killed by a falling pole. Kathy tells Robert she wants an abortion, which he opposes. Damien knocks Kathy over a railing to the floor below, injuring her and causing a miscarriage.\n\nPhotographer Keith Jennings notices shadows in photographs of the nanny and of Father Brennan that presage their deaths. Keith shows Robert the photos along with news clippings and biblical passages that suggest the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. He accompanies Robert to Rome to investigate Damien's birth. They learn that a fire destroyed Kathy's maternity records and killed the staff on duty. They find Father Spiletto in a monastery, mute, blind in one eye, and partly paralyzed. He directs them to the cemetery where Damien's biological mother is buried. In Damien's mother's grave, Robert and Keith find a [[golden jackal|jackal]] carcass and, in the next plot, a child's skeleton with a shattered skull. Robert realizes that the jackal is Damien's mother and the child is his own murdered son, killed so Damien can take his place. A pack of Rottweilers drives Robert and Keith from the cemetery.\n\nRobert calls Kathy in hospital to tell her she must leave London. Before she can do so, Mrs. Baylock throws her to her death from a window. Robert and Keith meet Antichrist expert Carl Bugenhagen who says if Damien is the true Antichrist, he will bear a birthmark in the shape of [[Number of the beast|three sixes]]. Carl gives Robert seven daggers with which to kill Damien on hallowed ground. Afterwards, Keith is decapitated by a sheet of glass.\n\nRobert finds the birthmark on the sleeping Damien's scalp and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock, whom he stabs to death. Armed with the daggers, Robert drives Damien to a cathedral. His erratic driving draws the attention of the police. Robert drags a screaming Damien onto the altar to stab him but is shot to death by police before he can do so.\n\nThe double funeral of Kathy and Robert is attended by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] and the First Lady, who have Damien with them. Damien turns and [[Fourth wall|smiles at the camera]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Robert Thorn\n* [[Lee Remick]] as Katherine \"Kathy\" Thorn\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Keith Jennings\n* [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Mrs. Willa Baylock\n* [[Harvey Spencer Stephens]] as [[Damien Thorn]]\n* [[Patrick Troughton]] as Father Brennan\n* [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] as Father Spiletto\n* [[Leo McKern]] as Carl Bugenhagen (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Rietti]] as Monk\n* [[John Stride]] as The Psychiatrist\n* [[Anthony Nicholls (actor)|Anthony Nicholls]] as Dr. Fred Becker\n* [[Holly Palance]] as Nanny\n* [[Roy Boyd]] as Reporter\n* [[Freda Dowie]] as Nun\n* Tommy Duggan as Priest\n* [[Sheila Raynor]] as Mrs. Ingrid Horton\n* Robert MacLeod as Horton\n* [[Bruce Boa]] as Thorn's Aide 1\n* [[Don Fellows]] as Thorn's Aide 2\n* [[Patrick McAlinney]] as Photographer\n* [[Betty McDowall]] as American Secretary\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as embassy guard Marine Corporal\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Development ===\nAccording to producer [[Harvey Bernhard]], the idea of a motion picture about the [[Antichrist]] came after a discussion about the Bible with Bob Munger, a friend of Bernhard's. When Munger told him about the idea in 1973, the producer immediately contacted screenwriter David Seltzer and hired him to write a screenplay. It took a year for Seltzer to write the script.<ref name=gregory>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdR3br9OVJI The Omen Interviews with Gregory Peck 1976] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315211826/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdR3br9OVJI |date=2016-03-15 }} at [[YouTube]]</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=The Omen|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/55833-THE-OMEN?cxt=filmography |access-date=2021-12-03|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was considered by [[Warner Bros.

Peck got involved with the project through his agent, who was friends with producer Bernhard. After reading the script, Peck reportedly liked the idea that it was more of a psychological thriller rather than a horror film and agreed to star in it. He was at first displeased with the props and effects for making the death scenes but was relieved to find how restrained and non-exploitative they were in the final film.<ref name=gregory /><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIeslGvihCE Getting Gregory Peck in The Omen \u2013 Richard Donner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107021644/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIeslGvihCE&feature=youtu.be&list=PLjk3H0GXhhGcz4un-zws5sMlCLk3NNjDP |date=2015-01-07 }} on [[YouTube]]</ref>\n\nDespite Bernhard's claim,<ref name=gregory /> there were other actors considered for the role because studios were reluctant to cast Peck as a child killer.<ref name=\":0\" /> Warner Bros.

The Antichrist, Duren says, is only described as a follower of the Devil.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=59}} In the same vein, the film's portrayal of certain Catholic priests as the allies of the Antichrist owes much to [[Protestant fundamentalism|fundamentalist Protestant]] views of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and has nothing to do with [[Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]].{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=59-60}} The \"daggers of Megiddo\", which are the only things that can kill the Antichrist in ''The Omen'', are not mentioned in the Book of Revelation, which states that only Christ can kill the Antichrist.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=60}} Finally, Duren stated that the film massively distorts the Book of Revelation by requiring Robert Thorn to kill Damien with one of the sacred daggers as the only way to avert the Apocalypse. In fact, the Book of Revelation contends that the Apocalypse will be a horrific but necessary chapter in the future that will end in the ultimate triumph of good over evil and the salvation of humanity.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=60-61}} Duren wrote that, from a fundamentalist viewpoint, Damien should not be killed because his temporary rule as the dictator of the world will be followed by the eternal rule of Christ, but Seltzer needed to add dramatic tension to the story.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=60}} Duren noted that Munger, who served as the religious consultant on the film, should have been aware of the film's distortions of the Bible.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=61}}\n\nThe success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic [[John Kenneth Muir]] wrote: \"What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?\"{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=61}} Duren wrote that, though it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=61}} Beyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=61}} Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a \"fringe\" theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of ''The Omen'' it is now widely accepted as doctrine.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=55}} Duren notes that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the \"mark of the beast\" and speculates that audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the Book of Revelation, but because of the film's popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.{{sfn|Duren|2017|p=61-62}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Omen\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1976\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film music]]\n| length     = 34:16\n| label      = [[20th Century Fox]]\n| producer   = Jerry Goldsmith\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{listen\n | filename = Ave satani.ogg\n | title = Jerry Goldsmith \u2013 \"Ave Satani\"\n | description =\n | format = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n{{album reviews\n|rev1=[[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score={{rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-omen-1976-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000015357|title=Jerry Goldsmith: The Omen [1976] [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] | publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] | first= Anthony | last=Tognazzini | access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAn original score for the film, including the movie's theme song \"[[Ave Satani]]\", was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], for which he received the only [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] of his career. The score features a strong [[choral]] segment, with a foreboding [[Latin]] chant. The refrain to the chant is, \"Sanguis bibimus, corpus edimus, tolle corpus Satani\", Latin for, \"We drink the blood, we eat the flesh, raise the body of Satan\", interspersed with cries of \"Ave Satani!\" and \"Ave Versus Christus\" (Latin, \"[[Hail Satan|Hail, Satan]]!\" and \"Hail, Antichrist!\").{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Aside from the choral work, the score includes lyrical themes portraying the pleasant home life of the Thorn family, which are contrasted with the more disturbing scenes of the family's confrontation with evil.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} According to Goldsmith's wife, Carol, the composer initially struggled with ideas for the score until one evening when he suddenly, happily announced to her, \"I hear voices\", referring to an orchestral chorus or choir. The Latin of this song contains some errors: \"We drink the blood\" must be ''Sanguinem bibimus'' (accusative form of ''sanguis''),<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin is simple: sanguis, sanguinis
