It won the [[FIPRESCI]] Award at the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\n''The Death of a Cyclist'' begins with the return of Juan Fernandez Soler ([[Alberto Closas]]), a university professor, and Mar\u00eda Jose ([[Lucia Bos\u00e8]]), a wealthy married woman, from an adulterous endeavor. While speeding down the road, Mar\u00eda Jose and Juan hit a cyclist with their car. Although the cyclist was alive when they left him, his reported death causes both Mar\u00eda Jose and Juan great anxiety in their personal lives.\n\nFor Mar\u00eda Jose, the exposure of this crime (and thus the affair) would mean the potential loss of her world as a wealthy socialite. However, the cyclist's death causes Juan to instead reflect on his own life choices, including his life as a former [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|falange]] soldier, and the hypocrisy of his world as a member of the upper class. The suspense of these anxieties is exacerbated by the meddling Rafa ([[Carlos Casaravilla]]), who is a lowly art critic that has spent the past few months observing the socialites that he has surrounding himself with. His intentions to \"purify\" the upper class are revealed through his plan to expose Mar\u00eda Jose and Juan. Juan and Mar\u00eda Jose's differing responses to the cyclist's death are significant in the commentary surrounding the upper class provided in this film.\n\nBy the end of the film, Juan is ready to turn himself and Mar\u00eda Jose into the police. However, Mar\u00eda Jose would do anything to protect the world she is comfortable in. Thus, Mar\u00eda Jose runs Juan over in an attempt to return to her life as it was before, presumably murdering him. The action of running over Juan represents the upper class's obsession with staying in power.\u00a0 Yet, while returning to her husband after committing this crime, she is run off of a bridge by a cyclist and falls to her death. The last shot of this film includes the cyclist riding away, intentions unknown.<ref>{{Cite web |title=J.A.

The Rafa-Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9-Miguel interplay is sprinkled with irony, sarcasm, and suggestion, and comes to a boil with the help of social satire, revenge, paranoia, and suspicion. It's quite a soup, and Bardem has fun dipping into it. Contrary to the film's reputation as a stark rebuke of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]-era hypocrisy and corruption, ''Death of a Cyclist'' is perhaps most surprising and memorable for this half-terrifying, half-comical roundelay of three people caught in a web of misunderstanding (Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 mistakenly convinced that Rafa witnessed something of the bicycle accident) and distrust (each of them for the other).<ref>[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/a-second-look-emdeath-of-a-cyclistem Koehler, Robert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130155843/http://cineaste.com/articles/a-second-look-emdeath-of-a-cyclistem |date=2011-01-30 }}.

Last accessed: February 14, 2011.</ref>\n\nFilm critic Mark Mesaros discussed the stylistic aspects of the film, writing, \"''Death of a Cyclist'' is a [[polemical]] tale that borrows the grammar of the [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] murder mystery as well as the forbidden romance of [[film noir]] to achieve its ideologic ends... Beginning with the techniques that are most efficacious, it's necessary to emphasize Bardem's brilliant use of cuts and dissolves throughout. What will be remembered most by viewers is the way the film [[jump cut]]s effortlessly between the seemingly primary melodrama and scenes of so-called 'social realism'. At first the cuts are employed between [[bourgeois]] and [[working class]] milieus, but later more abstract associations will be made. It's apparent that our pair of privileged sinners lie totally outside of 'social reality': when their sports-car hits the cyclist we do not see his twisted frame, only the twisted frame of the bicycle, and the reactions of Juan and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9. Through the course of events Juan will be forced to interlope within the reality of the cyclist and his family, while Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 will be further ensconced in the delicate net of her delusion.\"<ref>[http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/death-of-a-cyclist Mesaros, Mark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123180342/http://www.cinelogue.com/reviews/death-of-a-cyclist |date=2010-11-23 }}.

Se\u00f1or Bardem's cinematic syntax has no capitals or punctuation marks. He jumps from one scene to another without terminal notifications or dissolves. You have to be awfully attentive to figure out where you are...Maybe they have cut this [[Path\u00e9]] picture, and the English subtitles are poor. But Se\u00f1or Bardem will have to do better to make his laurels look deserved.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E4D61538EF34BC4152DFBE668383649EDE Crowther, Bosley].
