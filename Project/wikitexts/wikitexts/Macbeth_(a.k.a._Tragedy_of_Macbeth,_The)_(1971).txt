A [[Film adaptations of William Shakespeare works|film adaptation]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy of the [[Macbeth|same name]], it tells the story of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] lord who becomes King of Scotland through treachery and murder. The film stars [[Jon Finch]] as the [[Macbeth (character)|title character]] and [[Francesca Annis]] as [[Lady Macbeth]], noted for their relative youth as actors. Themes of [[historic recurrence]], greater pessimism and internal ugliness in physically beautiful characters are added to Shakespeare's story of moral decline, which is presented in a more realistic style.\n\nPolanski opted to create an adaptation of ''Macbeth'' as a means of coping with the highly publicized [[Manson Family]] murder of his wife, [[Sharon Tate]]. Finding difficulty obtaining sponsorship from major studios, the production was funded by [[Playboy Enterprises]]. Filming was troubled by poor weather around the [[British Isles]]. ''Macbeth'' was screened out of competition at the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]], and was a [[box-office bomb|commercial failure]] in the United States. The film was controversial for its depictions of graphic violence and nudity, but has received generally positive reviews since its release, and was named [[National Board of Review Award for Best Film|Best Film]] by the [[National Board of Review]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], a Norwegian invasion of Scotland is suppressed by [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]], Thane of Glamis, and [[Banquo]]. A traitor, the [[Thane of Cawdor]], is captured, and [[King Duncan]] decrees Macbeth shall be awarded the title of Cawdor. Macbeth and Banquo do not hear of this news; when out riding, they happen upon [[Three Witches]], who hail Macbeth as Thane of Cawdor and future King, and Banquo as lesser and greater. At their camp, nobles arrive and inform Macbeth he has been named the Thane of Cawdor, with Macbeth simultaneously awed and frightened at the prospect of usurping Duncan, in further fulfilment of the prophecy. He writes a letter to [[Lady Macbeth]], who is delighted at the news. However, she fears her husband has too much good nature, and vows to be cruel for him. Duncan names his eldest son, [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]], Prince of Cumberland, and thus [[heir apparent]], to the displeasure of Macbeth and Malcolm's brother [[Donalbain (Macbeth)|Donalbain]]. The royal family and nobles then spend the night at Macbeth's castle, with Lady Macbeth greeting the King and dancing with him with duplicity.\n\nUrged on by his wife, Macbeth steps into King Duncan's chambers after she has drugged the guards. Duncan wakes and utters Macbeth's name, but Macbeth stabs him to death. He then murders the guards. Fearing a conspiracy, Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, and the Thane of [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]] realises Macbeth will be king. An [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] [[courtier]], he hails Macbeth at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]], while the noble [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]] heads back to his home in [[Fife]]. When Macbeth begins to fear possible usurpation by Banquo and his son [[Fleance]], he sends two murderers to kill them, and then sends Ross as the mysterious [[Third Murderer]]. Banquo is killed, while Fleance escapes. After Banquo appears at a banquet as a ghost, Macbeth seeks out the witches, who are performing a nude ritual. The witches and the spirits they summon deceive Macbeth into thinking he is invincible, as he cannot be killed except by a man not born of woman, and will not be defeated until \"Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.\"\n\nAfter Macduff flees to England, Ross leaves Fife's castle doors open, so Macbeth's murderers can kill [[Lady Macduff]] and the rest of the family and servants. With nobles fleeing Scotland, Macbeth chooses a new Thane of Cawdor, bestowing the title on Seyton over Ross. Disappointed, Ross joins Malcolm and Macduff in England, where the English King has committed forces led by [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Siward]] to overthrowing Macbeth and installing Malcolm on the Scottish throne.\n\nThe English forces invade, covering themselves by cutting down branches from Birnam Wood and holding them in front of their army to hide their numbers as they march on Macbeth in Dunsinane.  When the forces storm the castle, Macduff confronts Macbeth, and during the sword fight, Macduff reveals he was delivered by [[Caesarean section]]. Macduff beheads Macbeth, and Ross presents the crown to Malcolm. Meanwhile, Donalbain, out riding, encounters the witches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jon Finch]] as [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]\n* [[Francesca Annis]] as [[Lady Macbeth]]{{sfn|Ain-Krupa|2010|pp=78\u201379}}\n* [[Martin Shaw]] as [[Banquo]]{{sfn|Mazierska|2007|p=201}}\n* [[Terence Bayler]] as [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]\n* [[John Stride]] as Ross{{sfn|Mazierska|2007|p=201}}\n* [[Nicholas Selby]] as [[King Duncan]]{{sfn|Shakespeare|2004|p=xxxv}}\n* [[Stephan Chase]] as [[Malcolm (Macbeth)|Malcolm]]\n* [[Paul Shelley]] as [[Donalbain (Macbeth)|Donalbain]]\n* Maisie MacFarquhar as [[Three Witches|First Witch]]\n* Elsie Taylor as [[Three Witches|Second Witch]]\n* Noelle Rimmington as [[Three Witches|Third Witch]]\n* [[Keith Chegwin]] as [[Fleance]]\n* [[Diane Fletcher]] as [[Lady Macduff]]\n* Mark Dightam as [[Macduff's son]]\n* [[Bernard Archard]] as Angus\n* [[Sydney Bromley]] as Porter\n* [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] as Doctor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Hugh Hefner (1979).jpg|150px|thumb|[[Hugh Hefner]] and [[Playboy Enterprises]] provided funding for the film.]]\nDirector [[Roman Polanski]] had been interested in adapting a Shakespeare play since he was a student in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland,{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=146}} but he did not begin until after the murder of his pregnant wife, [[Sharon Tate]], and several of his friends by members of the [[Manson Family]] at his house in [[Beverly Hills]] on the night of 9 August 1969.

However, unlike Welles, Polanski chooses naturalism over [[expressionism]].{{sfn|Morrison|2007|p=116}} Author Ewa Mazierska wrote that, despite supposed [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] in presenting soliloquies as voiceovers, Polanski's ''Macbeth'' was \"absurdist\", not depicting history as an explanation for current events, but as a \"vicious circle of crimes and miseries\". Each [[coronation]] occurs after the predecessor is violently dispatched, and guests and hosts always betray each other, with Polanski adding Ross leaving Fife's castle doors open.{{sfn|Mazierska|2007|p=149}}\n\nDeanne Williams read the film as not only Polanski's reflections on the murder of [[Sharon Tate]], but on wider issues such as the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=146}} Francesca Royster similarly argues the use of English and Celtic cultures in the clothes and culture of the 1960s and 1970s, pointing to the publications of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the U.S. and the music of [[Led Zeppelin]], ties the film's past to the present.{{sfn|Royster|2016|pp=176\u2013177}} While Playboy Enterprises role was mainly to provide funding, Williams also saw Polanski's Lady Macbeth as embodying \"[[Playboy]] ''mythos''\" paradoxes, at times warm and sexy, at times a domestic servant, and at times [[femme fatale]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=153}}\n\nIn one scene, Macbeth's court hosts [[bear-baiting]], a form of entertainment in the Middle Ages in which a bear and dogs are pitted against each other. Williams suggested the scene communicates Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's growing callousness after taking power,{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=151}} while Kenneth S. Rothwell and Morrison matched the scene to Shakespeare's Macbeth describing himself as \"bear-like\".{{sfn|Rothwell|2008|p=254}}{{sfn|Morrison|2007|p=115}}\n\n[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|Annis's portrayal of Lady Macbeth has been likened to [[Lady Godiva]] (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]\nLiterary critic [[Sylvan Barnet]] wrote that the younger protagonists suggested \"contrast between a fair exterior and an ugly interior\".{{sfn|Barnet|1998|p=198}} Williams compared Lady Macbeth to [[Lady Godiva]] in her \"hair and naturalistic pallor\", suggesting she could fit in at the [[Playboy Mansion]].{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=153}} More \"ugliness\" is added by Polanski in the re-imagining of Ross, who becomes a more important character in this film.{{sfn|Kliman|1998|pp=137\u2013138}} As with the leads, Ross demonstrates \"evil-in-beauty\" as he is played by \"handsome [[John Stride]]\".{{sfn|Kliman|1998|p=138}}\n\nBarnet also wrote the changed ending with Donalbain meeting the witches replaced the message of \"measure, time and place\" with \"unending treachery.\"{{sfn|Barnet|1998|p=198}} Film historian Douglas Brode also commented on the added ending, saying it reflected Polanski's pessimism in contradiction to Shakespeare's optimism.
