The film was [[George Clooney]]'s directorial debut, was written by [[Charlie Kaufman]] and starred [[Sam Rockwell]] as Barris, as well as [[Julia Roberts]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and Clooney. It is based on Barris's 1984 \"[[unauthorized biography|unauthorized]] [[autobiography]]\" of the same name, in which he claimed to have been an assassin for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in addition to his show business career. These allegations have been denied by the CIA,<ref>Stein, Joel (January 13, 2003). [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html \"Lying to Tell the Truth\"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

''[[Television Academy Foundation ()|Television]]''. Accessed September 28, 2020.</ref>\n\nThe film had a long development process. [[Columbia Pictures]] briefly planned to produce a [[film adaptation]] in the late 1980s, to be directed by [[Jim McBride]]. The [[film rights]] were purchased in 1997 by producer [[Andrew Lazar]], who hired Kaufman to write a screenplay; the project then quickly attracted a string of well-known directors, including [[David Fincher]], [[Brian De Palma]] and [[Bryan Singer]], and lead actors, including [[Mike Myers]], [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Johnny Depp]]. When Clooney was hired to direct, he brought on Barris to consult on the project in order to provide additional authenticity. This in turn led to (uncredited) rewrites on the script, which Kaufman was unhappy with, including the removal of a drug addiction subplot. Clooney also championed the casting of Rockwell, who at that point was mostly unknown. To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Barrymore and Roberts to lower their salaries.\n\nThe film was released to favorable reviews from critics and was modestly successful at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the 2003 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nTired of being rejected by the beautiful women he lusts after, [[Chuck Barris]] moves to Manhattan to become an [[NBC page]] with dreams of becoming famous in television but is eventually fired. He moves back to Philadelphia and becomes [[Dick Clark]]'s personal assistant on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' in 1961. He writes the successful song \"[[Palisades Park (Freddy Cannon song)|Palisades Park]]\" and becomes romantically involved with a woman named Penny Pacino. Chuck is given permission to pitch the concept for ''[[The Dating Game]]'' at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. He is given $7,500 to create a [[television pilot]], but ABC abandons the idea in favor of ''[[Hootenanny (US TV series)|Hootenanny]]''.\n\nOne night after Barris is kicked out of a bar for fighting, he is approached by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Jim Byrd, who recruits him as an assassin. Returning from a mission in Mexico, Barris finds that Penny has become a hippie. Meanwhile, ABC [[green-light]]s ''The Dating Game'', and by 1967 the show is a phenomenon.\n\nOn a CIA mission in [[Helsinki]], Finland, he meets female operative Patricia Watson. He finds more success back home when ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' goes on air. He and Penny decide to move to Los Angeles, but Barris is cautious of marriage, much to Penny's dismay. In 1970, Byrd convinces Barris to go on a mission to [[West Berlin]] to assassinate Hans Colbert. Barris is introduced to German-American agent Keeler, whom he helps to kill Colbert. However, he is captured by the [[KGB]] and, after some weeks, freed during a west\u2013east spy exchange.\n\nIn 1976, Barris creates ''[[The Gong Show]],'' becoming famous as its host. Keeler is murdered and Byrd warns Barris of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the agency. His TV shows are canceled due to poor ratings, and Penny threatens to leave after catching him cheating. One night, Barris finds Byrd sitting atop the diving board of his backyard pool. Byrd reveals why he was chosen by the CIA to become an assassin: he is the son of a serial killer and had been raised as a girl by his mother, so he \"fit the profile\". Barris threatens Byrd, and after Byrd is shown dead moments later, we can see him holding a gun at him.\n\nFaced with the unpleasant truth about himself, Barris begins to spiral out of control. After almost having a [[nervous breakdown]] on ''[[The Gong Show]]'', Barris shuts himself away in a New York City hotel. Penny finds him and tries in vain to convince him to return to California to get married.\n\nBarris finally leaves his room to meet Patricia in Boston. After a cup of coffee, Barris collapses, seemingly poisoned. Patricia reveals that she is the mole. Barris has tricked Patricia into drinking from the poisoned cup, and she falls dead. After her death, he returns home and begins writing his autobiography, ''Confessions of a Dangerous Mind''. He finally decides to marry Penny. At the end of the ceremony, he sees some of the people he killed in the crowd. Distraught, he confesses to her his double life as a CIA assassin, but she merely laughs, assuming he is joking, and he decides not to correct her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Chuck Barris]]\n** [[Michael Cera]] as Young Chuck Barris\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Penny Pacino\n* [[George Clooney]] as Jim Byrd\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Patricia Watson\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Keeler\n* [[Jerry Weintraub]] as Larry Goldberg\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Instructor Jenks\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Simon Oliver\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Debbie\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Rod Flexner\n* [[Rachelle Lefevre]] as Tuvia\n* [[Kristen Wilson]] as Loretta\n* [[Daniel Zacapa]] as Renda\n* [[Emilio Rivera]] as Benitez\n* [[Carlos Carrasco (actor)|Carlos Carrasco]] as Brazioni\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Casting Executive\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Bachelor #1\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Bachelor #2\n* [[Jen Taylor]] And [[Spencer Kayden]] as Crowd Scenes (uncredited)\n\nBarris, [[Dick Clark]], [[Jim Lange]], [[The Unknown Comic|Murray Langston]], [[Jaye P.
