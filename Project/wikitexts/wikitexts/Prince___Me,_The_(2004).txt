The film focuses on Paige Morgan, a pre-med college student in [[Wisconsin]], who is pursued by a [[Denmark|Danish]] prince posing as an ordinary college student. The film had 3 [[direct-to-video]] sequels created under different writers and a new director, with [[Kam Heskin]] replacing [[Julia Stiles]] in the role of Paige Morgan: ''[[The Prince & Me 2: The Royal Wedding]]'' (2006), ''[[The Prince & Me: A Royal Honeymoon]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Prince & Me: The Elephant Adventure]]'' (2010).\n\n==Plot==\nPaige Morgan is an ambitious pre-medical student at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, [[Denmark]]'s [[heir apparent|Crown Prince]] Edvard prefers to live the life of a playboy, and when with his family often ignores or marginalizes his royal responsibilities.\n\nInspired by a television commercial showing Wisconsin co-eds flashing their breasts, Edvard meets with his parents, King Haraald and Queen Rosalind, and announces his intention to attend college in America\u2014specifically, Wisconsin, and to do so anonymously. The Queen then dispatches Edvard's [[majordomo]], S\u00f8ren, to chaperone the trip. Arriving at the university, Edvard orders S\u00f8ren to keep his identity a secret and to call him 'Eddie'.\n\nLater at a bar, Eddie sees Paige serving and asks her to take off her shirt, like on television. Paige angrily drenches Eddie with the drink hose and [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] escort Eddie from the bar. Eddie later apologizes to Paige, but she is annoyed when they are assigned as lab partners for an organic chemistry class. Since the class is important for Paige's medical school ambitions, she warns Eddie to not get in her way and reprimands him after he sleeps in through one of their lab experiments. Running out of money, Eddie gets a job in the deli section of the bar. Paige reluctantly helps him during his first day, and the two start to mend fences. Paige does well in science, but she struggles in an English literature class. Eddie uses his earlier education to help Paige gain a better understanding of [[William Shakespeare]], and Paige instructs Edvard in common household chores like laundry.\n\nSince Eddie is away from his family and unfamiliar with [[Public holidays in the United States|American holidays]], Paige invites him to her parents\u2019 dairy farm for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Paige's father explains how he struggles to keep the small farm afloat, and Eddie uses his mechanical skills to fine-tune a [[riding mower]] for a race, which he wins. Keith Kopetsky, a rival racer reveals to be a sore loser and punches Eddie. After the fight that follows, Paige treats his grazes and they kiss for the first time.\n\nBack at school, Eddie and Paige study for final exams. They sneak off to the library stacks to pursue a romantic encounter, where they kiss and take off his jacket and shirt. They are shortly ambushed by members of the Danish tabloid press. Once away from the mayhem, Paige learns his real identity and walks away from him through the rain. Just then, Eddie is notified by his mother that his father is very ill and she asks him to return home. While Paige is questioned at a [[oral exam|viva voce]] panel about Shakespeare, she realizes that she loves Edvard and runs to find him, but his roommate Scotty tells her that he has already left for Denmark. She follows him there and while being driven round [[Copenhagen]] is delayed by a royal parade. Paige leaves her taxi and is recognized from the papers by the crowd, who call Edvard\u2019s attention to her. He mounts her behind him on his horse, hurriedly opens a parliamentary session and takes her to the castle.\n\nThe queen objects to Edvard's choice, but the king tells him that if he loves Paige, he should marry her. Edvard proposes and Paige accepts. After witnessing him reconcile workers and employers in a parliamentary committee, the queen realizes that Paige has helped him grow up at last and will make a good queen. However, during Eddie's coronation ball, Paige remembers that she is betraying her ambition to become a doctor working in [[Third World]] countries, breaks off her engagement and returns home.\n\nKing Haraald abdicates and the newly crowned Edvard realizes that he too has responsibilities to shoulder. However, he arrives after Paige\u2019s graduation and tells her that she is his choice and he is willing to wait for however long it takes to achieve her dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Paige Morgan\n* [[Luke Mably]] as Edvard, Crown Prince of Denmark/Edvard III, [[Monarchy of Denmark|King of Denmark]] (\"Eddie Williams\")\n* [[Ben Miller]] as S\u00f8ren\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Rosalind, [[Queen consort]] of Denmark\n* [[James Fox]] as Haraald, King of Denmark\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Amy Morgan\n* John Bourgeois as Ben Morgan\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as John Morgan\n* [[Stephen O'Reilly (actor)|Stephen O'Reilly]] as Mike Morgan\n* Elisabeth Waterston as Beth Curtis\n* [[Eliza Bennett]] as Princess Arabella\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Scotty\n* Clare Preuss as Stacey\n* [[Yaani King]] as Amanda\n* [[Eddie Irvine]] as Himself\n* [[Angelo Tsarouchas]] as Stu\n* Jacques Tourangeau as Professor Amiel\n* [[Joanne Baron]] as Margueritte - Royal Designer\n* Stephen Singer as Professor Begler\n* [[Sarah Manninen]] as Krista\n* Tony Munch as Keith Kopetsky\n* John Nelles as Race Announcer\n* Claus Bue as [[Church of Denmark|Lutheran]] [[Archbishop]]\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack was released on March 30, 2004, in the United States by [[Hollywood Records]].<ref>[http://www.princeandme.com 'The Prince & Me' Official Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024075553/http://www.princeandme.com/ |date=2004-10-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Track listing===\n\n#\"Everybody Wants You\" - [[Josh Kelley]]\n#\"[[Just a Ride]]\" - [[Jem (singer)|Jem]]\n#\"Fire Escape\" - [[Fastball (band)|Fastball]]\n#\"Man of the World\" - [[Marc Cohn]]\n#\"Calling\" - [[Leona Naess]]\n#\"Good Intentions\" - Jennifer Stills\n#\"[[I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You]]\" - Marc Cohn\n#\"Symphony\" - [[Jessica Riddle]]\n#\"It Doesn\u2019t Get Better Than This\" - Katy Fitzgerald\n#\"Freeway\" - [[Scapegoat Wax]]\n#\"Presidente\" - [[Kinky (band)|Kinky]]\n#\"Drift\" - [[Forty Foot Echo]]\n#\"Party\" - [[The D4]]\n#\"Bloodsweet\" - [[Scapegoat Wax]]\n#\"Separate Worlds\" - [[Jennie Muskett]]<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6674371/a/Prince+&+Me.htm CD Universe- The Prince and Me Soundtrack<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics and [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rated it 27% based on 116 reviews, an overall \"rotten\" rating.
