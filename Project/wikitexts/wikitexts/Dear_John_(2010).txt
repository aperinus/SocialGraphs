It follows the life of a soldier ([[Channing Tatum]]) after he falls in love with a young woman ([[Amanda Seyfried]]). They decide to exchange letters to each other after he is deployed to the war. The film was released in North America on February 5, 2010, by [[Screen Gems]], and received mixed to negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2003, while serving in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]], [[Staff sergeant|Staff Sergeant]] John Tyree is shot in Afghanistan. In a voice-over, he recalls a childhood trip to the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and compares himself to a coin in the United States military, before stating that the last thing he thought of before he blacked out was \"you.\"\n\nTwo years earlier in Spring 2001, John is on leave in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He meets Savannah Curtis, a college student building homes with a group of co-eds for [[Habitat for Humanity]] while on spring break. Savannah invites John to a bonfire party where he meets her neighbor, Tim, and his autistic son, Alan. Over the course of two weeks, they go on several dates and eventually fall in love. Savannah also meets John's father who is obsessed with his growing [[coin collection]].\n\nSavannah mentions to John that his father may have [[Asperger's Syndrome]] like Tim's son, Alan. An upset John storms off and becomes involved in a fight, and he accidentally strikes Tim, breaking his nose. Savannah sees the commotion and stops speaking to John. John later apologizes to Tim, who offers to give Savannah a message. Savannah later visits John to spend one last day together. Before John leaves, they make a promise to continue their relationship via letters, and vow to tell each other everything.\n\nJohn and Savannah make plans to start a life together after John gets his discharge from the Army. However, when the [[September 11 attacks]] occur, John along with his team request to extend their deployments. As a result, their time apart from each other turn into months and then ultimately years. Back in Charleston, Savannah begins to spend more time with Tim, and decides that she wants to work with autistic children; she plans to build a farm and horse stables where they can enjoy the outdoors and animals. Over the next two years, John and Savannah's romance continues through their letters. Eventually one turns out to be a literal \"[[Dear John letter|Dear John]]\" letter, in which Savannah breaks up with John; she explains that while she still loves him, she has developed feelings for someone else and is engaged.\n\nIn 2003 after being shot in [[Afghanistan]], John is encouraged to return home but he re-enlists for a second time. Four more years pass, and John is informed that his father has had a stroke, and is sent home to be with him. In the hospital, John reads a letter to his father that he wrote for him; John's voice-over at the beginning of the film was from this letter, in which he told his father that the first thing to cross his mind after he was shot was coins, and the last thing to cross his mind before he lost consciousness was his dad. Soon afterward, his father dies.\n\nAfter the funeral, John visits Savannah and learns that the man she married was Tim, abandoning her dream of a riding camp for autistic kids because of Tim's fight against [[Lymphoma]]. Savannah takes John to the hospital to see him; Tim tells John that Savannah still loves John. Back at the house, John and Savannah enjoy a quiet evening together, and are tempted to pick up where they left off years earlier, but do not go through with their feelings. John says goodbye to Savannah and leaves, but is distraught.\n\nJohn sells his father's coin collection (except the valuable [[Mule (coin)|mule coin]] that he found with his father years ago) in order to raise money to help with Tim's cancer treatment, then he returns to the military, carrying the mule coin with him as a good luck charm. He receives a final letter from Savannah telling him that they received an anonymous donation but Tim died from his illness after only two months of treatment.\n\nMonths later, John, now a civilian, eventually returns home; while in town one day while parking his bike, he sees Savannah at a coffee shop. They reunite and share a hug.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as  SSG John Tyree\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Savannah Lynn Curtis\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as Tim Wheddon\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Bill Tyree\n* [[Luke Benward]] as Alan Wheddon\n** Braeden Reed as Young Alan Wheddon\n* [[Scott Porter]] as Randy\n* [[D.J.
