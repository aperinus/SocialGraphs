Starring [[Zbigniew Cybulski]] and [[Ewa Krzy\u017cewska]], it completed Wajda's war films trilogy, following ''[[A Generation]]'' (1954) and ''[[Kana\u0142 (film)|Kanal]]'' (1956). The action of ''Ashes and Diamonds'' takes place in 1945, shortly after World War II. The main protagonist of the film, former [[Home Army]] soldier Maciek Che\u0142micki, is acting in the [[anti-Communist]] underground. Maciek receives an order to kill Szczuka, the local secretary of the [[Polish Workers' Party]]. Over time, Che\u0142micki increasingly doubts if his task is worth doing.\n\n''Ashes and Diamonds'', although based on the novel that directly supported the postwar [[Communism in Poland|Communist system in Poland]], was subtly modified in comparison with the source material. Wajda sympathized with the soldiers of the Polish independence underground; thus, he devoted most of the attention to Che\u0142micki. During the three-month development of ''Ashes and Diamonds'', the director made drastic changes to the baseline scenario, thanks to his assistant director [[Janusz Morgenstern]], as well as Cybulski, who played the leading role. The film received permission from the authorities to be distributed only through Andrzejewski's intercession. The film did not receive permission to be screened at the main competition at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. However, ''Ashes and Diamonds'' appeared at the [[Venice Film Festival]], where it won the [[FIPRESCI]] award.\n\nAt first, ''Ashes and Diamonds'' met positive critical reception, both in Poland and worldwide. However, after the [[Revolutions of 1989]], it was criticized for falsifying the collective memory of Polish partisans. Nevertheless, the film has maintained its reputation as one of the most famous [[Cinema of Poland|Polish motion pictures]] in history.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn 8 May 1945, at the end of World War II, near a small country church, former [[Home Army]] soldiers, Maciek, Andrzej and Drewnowski, prepare to assassinate Konrad Szczuka, a political opponent and a secretary of [[Polish Workers' Party]]. The ambush fails, as the attackers later learn that they have mistakenly killed two innocents.{{sfn | Falkowska | 2007 | pp=54\u201355}}\n\nAndrzej and Maciek's superior, Major Waga, learns of the failed assassination attempt. Waga orders Andrzej and Maciek to attempt the mission for a second time. They come to the Hotel Monopol Restaurant, where a banquet in honour of the victorious war begins, but the combatants do not participate. While sitting in the bar, Maciek and Andrzej listen to the song \"[[The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino|The Red Poppies of Monte Cassino]]\" and reminisce over their fallen comrades. In honour of them, Maciek lights several glasses of [[rectified spirit]] on fire. Their hapless comrade Drewnowski gets drunk at the bar, where he discusses career prospects in postwar Poland with Pieni\u0105\u017cek, a representative of the democratic press.{{sfn | Falkowska | 2007 | pp=55\u201356}}\n\nDuring the party, he has a flirtatious conversation with a barwoman named Krystyna and invites her to his room. Afterwards, Maciek goes to his hotel room to check his gun. Krystyna comes to his room after her shift ends. As they lay naked in bed, they realize they are in love, but Krystyna doesn't want to become attached as Maciek doesn't plan to stay in town for long. They decide to go for a walk. It begins to rain, so Krystyna and Maciek decide to find shelter in a ruined church. Krystyna notices a poem inscribed on the wall, and Maciek recites it from memory in a somber tone. The lovers say their goodbyes, with Maciek promising he's going to try to \"change things\" so he can stay with her.\n\nMaciek returns to the bar where he discusses his sense of duty and obligation to the cause with Andrzej. However, Andrzej is unsympathetic to his plight and says Maciek will be a deserter if he does not fulfill his obligation to assassinate Szczuka. Meanwhile, a completely drunk Drewnowski spoils the banquet, covering the other guests with foam from a fire extinguisher, and leaves the ball in shame with his intended career as a Communist functionary in ruins. After the reception, Szczuka learns that his son Marek has been arrested for joining an underground militia.{{sfn | Falkowska | 2007 | pp=56\u201358}}\n\nMaciek waits for Szczuka to leave the hotel to meet his captured son, follows him, and shoots him to death. The next morning, Maciek plans to leave Ostrowiec by train. He tells Krystyna that he was unable to \"change things,\" leaving her heartbroken. She tells him to leave without saying another word, which he does. The hotel guests dance to a pianist and band playing [[Chopin|Chopin's]] [[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|\"Military\" Polonaise in A Major]]. On the way to the train station, Maciek observes Andrzej beating Drewnowski for his newfound, opportunistic support for the underground. Maciek flees when Drewnowski calls his name. He accidentally runs into some soldiers of the Polish People's Army and draws his pistol in panic. They shoot and fatally wound him. Maciek escapes to a garbage dump, but he collapses and dies in agony.{{sfn | Falkowska | 2007 | pp=59\u201360}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Zbigniew Cybulski]] as Maciek Che\u0142micki\n* [[Ewa Krzy\u017cewska]] as Krystyna\n* [[Wac\u0142aw Zastrze\u017cy\u0144ski]] as Szczuka\n* [[Adam Pawlikowski]] as Andrzej\n* [[Bogumi\u0142 Kobiela]] as Drewnowski\n* [[Stanis\u0142aw Milski]] as Pieni\u0105\u017cek\n* [[Ignacy Machowski]] as Waga\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\n[[File:Andrzej-Wajda-1963.jpg|thumb|[[Andrzej Wajda]], the director of the film, in 1963]]\n''Ashes and Diamonds'' is loosely based on the novel by [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], published for the first time in 1948.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=13\u201318}} The novel was a mandatory school set book in communist Poland and enjoyed respect among the contemporary authorities.{{sfn | Coates | 1996 | pp=288}} The first directors who tried to adapt the book into a film were [[Erwin Axer]] and [[Antoni Bohdziewicz]]. In Axer's script, which adhered to the spirit of the original, the roles were supposed to be more like caricatures. Historian Tadeusz Lubelski retrospectively commented on Axer's script with the following words: \"Communists are even more decent and busy, aristocrats and former Home Army members \u2013 even more vile and reckless.\"{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=177}} Bohdziewicz's script contained a similar propaganda message, depicting the command of the Polish resistance in a bad light. There, Major Waga blackmailed Maciek to kill Szczuka, threatening him with a war trial; in the end, Maciek decided to support Szczuka.{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=182}} However, none of these scripts were implemented, and policymakers considered Bohdziewicz's vision too \"defensive.\"{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=184}} [[Jan Rybkowski]] also planned to direct an ''Ashes and Diamonds'' adaptation, though he eventually decided to focus on a comedy titled ''Kapelusz pana Anatola'' (''Mr. Anatol's Hat''). Thus, he gave Andrzej Wajda an opportunity to launch a project.{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=176}}\n\nIn November 1957, Wajda carried out a letter conversation with Andrzejewski, during which the future director suggested several changes to the initial version of the story. A thread which concerned the judge Antoni Kossecki was deleted so that the main plot focused on the confrontation between Maciek and Szczuka. Also, Wajda suggested that the story be condensed to only one day, with Maciek acting as the central hero.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=20\u201329}}{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=184}} Wajda and Andrzejewski completed the screenplay in January 1958, giving it for scrutiny to the Commission for Screenplay Assessment. After long consideration, the Commission, whose members were [[Aleksander \u015acibor-Rylski]], Andrzej Braun, Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz, [[Tadeusz Konwicki]] and Andrzej Karpowski, decided to vote for the screenplay's acceptance.{{sfn | Coates | 2005 | p=39}}\n\n=== Development ===\nHaving the screenplay accepted, Wajda prepared for the development of ''Ashes and Diamonds'' within the [[KADR (studio)|\"KADR\" Film Unit]]. At first, the director intended to shoot the film in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. However, he finally chose an atelier in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the decision made due to possible savings and to prevent the policymakers from intervening too much in the film development. On 3 February 1958, the acting Chief of Cinematography Jerzy Lewi\u0144ski decided to start the production of ''Ashes and Diamonds'', without consulting the authorities.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=45}} The contract for the commission guaranteed Wajda a salary of 69,000 Polish zloty, whereas Andrzejewski received 31,500 Polish zloty.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=45}} The overall budget of ''Ashes and Diamonds'' is estimated at 6,070,000 Polish zloty.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=50}}\n\nWajda then began gathering the film crew. Stanis\u0142aw Adler became the producer, whereas Jerzy W\u00f3jcik took the cinematography, and Filip Nowak was commissioned to select music material for the film.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=50\u201351}} It was decided that ''Ashes and Diamonds'' be first filmed in the atelier, then in the open air.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=54}} The main scenography made in the atelier represented the Monopol Hotel restaurant. However, the film crew did also use authentic locations, such as the St. Barbara's Church in Wroc\u0142aw and a chapel near [[Trzebnica]].{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=50}}\n\nThe director experienced some issues with the selection of the future cast. However, he found support in the person of [[Janusz Morgenstern]], his assistant director. Morgenstern, more familiar with the acting market, encouraged Wajda to put [[Zbigniew Cybulski]] in the role of Maciek, although the director considered the candidature of [[Tadeusz Janczar]].{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=87\u201389}} Having come to the film set, Cybulski instantly refused to play in a partisan uniform suggested by costume designer Katarzyna Chodorowicz, and insisted on wearing his \"fifties' style dark glasses, jacket and tight jeans.\"{{sfn | Shaw | 2014 | p=50}} Wac\u0142aw Zastrze\u017cy\u0144ski, a theatrical actor with barely any film experience, was cast as Szczuka.{{sfn | Lubelski | 2000 | p=166}} [[Adam Pawlikowski]], a musicologist, took the role of Andrzej, whereas Cybulski's colleague [[Bogumi\u0142 Kobiela]] was cast as Drewnowski.{{sfn | Lubelski | 2000 | pp=166\u2013167}}\n\n=== Filming ===\nPhotography for ''Ashes and Diamonds'' started in March 1958, and finished in June 1958, after 60 shooting days.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=103}} The film was shot in 1:1.85 format, which had never been used before in Polish cinema.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=286}} During filming, the crew made crucial changes in the scenario, which affected the future reception of the film. For example, Cybulski suggested that Szczuka should hold Maciek while dying; Wajda added scenes containing Christian iconography; and Morgenstern invented the most widely known scene, during which Maciek and Andrzej light up the glasses filled with the [[rectified spirit]].{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=186}} The ending was changed, too; Wajda cut down the scene from the novel, during which some soldiers of Polish People's Army commented on Maciek's death with following words: \"Hey, you, ... what made you run away?\"{{sfn | Andrzejewski | 1980 | p=239}}{{sfn | Lubelski | 1994 | p=186}}\n\nThe most troublesome task was to convince the communist authorities to display ''Ashes and Diamonds''. Party intellectuals were dissatisfied with making Maciek Che\u0142micki the main character of the film. It was then that Andrzejewski himself, who\u2013with the support of his fellow writers\u2013convinced PZPR activists that the ideological message of the film was correct; without the help of the author of the novel, Wajda's work would have never been released.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=316}} The official screening took place on 7 July 1958, after which ''Ashes and Diamonds'' could be distributed in cinemas.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | p=317}} Despite the protests of [[Aleksander Ford]], who demanded that the authorities ban the film, its official premiere took place on 3 October 1958.{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=318\u2013319}} Nevertheless, due to the still existing doubts about its message, ''Ashes and Diamonds'' were banned from taking part in the main competition of the [[Cannes Film Festival]].{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=320\u2013321}} Then Lewi\u0144ski sent Wajda's work to the Venice Film Festival, where\u2013apart from the main competition\u2013it won the award of the [[International Federation of Film Critics]] (FIPRESCI).{{sfn | Kornacki | 2011 | pp=378\u2013379}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Ashes and Diamonds'' was an international success. According to Janina Falkowska, this is Wajda's most recognizable film,{{Sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=60}} and\u2013in the opinion of Marek Hendrykowski\u2013the most important achievement of the [[Polish Film School]], which highlights the director's characteristic style, while dealing with the Second World War.{{sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=60}} Despite the condemnation of the film by some Communist critics, many supporters of independent Poland identified themselves with the role of Maciek.{{sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=60}} Cybulski has been compared to [[James Dean]] in his performance, which was complemented by the fact that with his appearance, Polish actor personified the contemporary generation of the 1950s.{{sfn | Haltof | 2002 |p= 89}} In total, around 1,722,000 spectators watched ''Ashes and Diamonds'' during the opening year.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|p=413}}\n\n=== Critical reception in Poland ===\n[[File:Tomasz W\u00f3jcik - Ashes and Diamonds.jpg|thumb|''Ashes and Diamonds'', a poster by [[Tomasz W\u00f3jcik]], 2017]]\nPolish film critics generally were delighted with the film adaptation of Andrzejewski's novel. Stanis\u0142aw Grzelecki assessed ''Ashes and Diamonds'' as \"a new, outstanding work of Polish film art.\"{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} According to Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz, \"''Ashes and Diamonds'' is not a brilliant film, but it is certainly a great film\".{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} Jerzy P\u0142a\u017cewski called Wajda's film \"excellent.\"{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} Several other Polish film and literary critics\u2013[[Stanis\u0142aw Grochowiak]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]], [[Andrzej Wr\u00f3blewski]]\u2013also considered ''Ashes and Diamonds ''an exceptional work.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=343\u2013347}}\n\nIn the foreground, due to the then-prevailing Communist system, among the issues discussed by critics were attempts at ideological interpretation. The tragic actions of [[Home Army]] soldiers, who supposedly unjustly continued their struggle against the new political reality, were pointed out at that time. These voices, however, included Jan J\u00f3zef Szczepa\u0144ski's opinion, which was devoid of ideological tone. In his opinion, Wajda showed the viewer the qualities of Polish young people during the war.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=348\u2013362}} Simultaneously, critics connected with the authorities had doubts about whether the director would not glorify this generation, which would induce the audience's solidarity with the \"reactionary\" soldier. [[Zygmunt Ka\u0142u\u017cy\u0144ski]] and Wiktor Woroszylski had the greatest complaints about ''Ashes and Diamonds''. Ka\u0142u\u017cy\u0144ski sought an anachronism in the portrait of Maciek's persona, considering its styling more appropriate for contemporary times than for 1945. In turn, according to Woroszylski, \"the Home Army soldiers have been endowed with such a clear sense of the absurdity of their misdeeds that [...] hands are falling.\"{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=348\u2013362}} Marxist reviewers criticized ''Ashes and Diamonds'', highlighting its alleged lack of educational functions and the marginalization of Szczuka, who was depicted in the film as a mediocre party activist. Stanis\u0142aw Grochowiak, who found in Wajda's drama the \"eschatological dimension\" of the classical tragedy, rejected such propagandist interpretations.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=348\u2013362}}\n\nCritics looking for aesthetic issues in Wajda's work have interpreted it in a different way. Jerzy Kwiatkowski noted the high expression of adaptation in comparison with the original. Alicja Helman, in turn, put forward the opinion that \"there is everything in this film\u2013too much, too good, too beautiful\", but at the same time it emphasizes \"zeal, anxiety, takeover, great emotional passion\".{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=363\u2013369}} Ernest Bryll devoted a broader analysis to the evaluation of the antique structure of film work, with an inseparable fate showing the tragedy of the main character's actions.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|pp=363\u2013369}} The role of Zbigniew Cybulski, as well as the musical arrangement and the cinematography of [[Jerzy W\u00f3jcik (cinematographer)|Jerzy W\u00f3jcik]], were widely accepted.{{sfn|Kornacki|2011|p=369}}\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989]], ''Ashes and Diamonds'' faced the accusations of falsifying history. Wajda was supposed to falsify the reality because, in his film, the underground soldiers chased Communists, even though the reality was the opposite. Andrzej Werner accused the film of a historical lie,{{sfn|Werner|1987|pp=32\u201345}} while film critic Waldemar Cho\u0142odowski criticized Wajda's work for suggesting that the representatives of the underground should be isolated from society.{{Sfn|Lubelski|2000|p=157}} Krzysztof K\u0105kolewski deplored the fact that Wajda's ''Ashes and Diamonds'' for Polish and international audiences were for years a source of knowledge about the times after the Second World War. However, he also noted that the director\u2013in contrast to the author of the original\u2013toned down the propagandist message of the book, in which the underground soldiers were directly depicted as bandits.{{sfn|K\u0105kolewski|2015|pp=17\u201321}} Conversely, [[Tadeusz Lubelski]] stated that Wajda's version warms the image of the underground to a much greater extent than the ones proposed by Axer and Bohdziewicz. Unlike K\u0105kolewski, Lubelski was convinced that the moment of the [[Polish October]] was perfectly captured during the shooting of the film.{{Sfn|Lubelski|1994|pp=185\u2013187}}\n\n=== Critical reception outside Poland ===\nIn Western Europe, ''Ashes and Diamonds'' was widely praised by film critics. The Italian critic Nevio Corich found in the film a lyrical reference to Baroque art.{{Sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=62}} Some film experts, such as Fouma Saisho, pointed to the poetic qualities of the work. [[Georges Sadoul]] compared Wajda's work to those of the prominent director [[Erich von Stroheim]].{{Sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=62}} In his 1999 retrospective review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Derek Malcolm]] compared Maciek's death to the ending of [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Luis Bunuel's]] ''[[Los Olvidados]].''{{sfn|Malcolm|1999}} However, some critics were irritated by the alleged mannerism of the work and the exposition of Baroque ornamentation.{{Sfn|Falkowska|2007|p=62}} [[Dave Kehr]] from ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' shared an opinion that \"[f]ollowing the art cinema technique of the time, Wajda tends toward harsh and overstated imagery,\"{{sfn|Kehr|2017}} while the ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' review stated that \"Wajda's way is the sweet smell of excess, but some scenes remain powerfully memorable \u2013 the lighting of drinks on the bar, the upturned Christ in a bombed church, and Cybulski's prolonged death agonies at the close.\"{{sfn|''Time Out London''}} As David Parkinson from ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said, \"[Wajda's] final installment of the classic Polish trilogy is heavy in symbolism but remains affective and intimate viewing.\"{{sfn|Parkinson|2006}}\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n''Ashes and Diamonds'' received the FIPRESCI Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1959.<ref name=\"FilmPolski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php|title=Popi\u00f3\u0142 i diament|website=FilmPolski|language=pl|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> The film was also nominated twice for the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts award]], with Zbigniew Cybulski nominated in the \"[[BAFTA for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\" category and Andrzej Wajda nominated in the \"Best Film from any Source\".<ref name=\"BAFTA Awards2\">{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1960/film/film-and-british-film|title=Best Film from any Source|website=BAFTA Awards|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"BAFTA Awards\">{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1960/film/foreign-actor|title=Foreign Actor in 1960|website=BAFTA Awards|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''Ashes and Diamond''s is considered by film critics to be one of the great masterpieces of Polish cinema and arguably the finest film of Polish realist cinema.{{sfn|Schneider|2012|p=350}} [[Richard Pe\u00f1a]] in the book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'' considers the ending of the film to be one of the most powerful and often quoted endings in film history.{{sfn|Schneider|2012|p=350}} The film was ranked #38 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazines \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/100-greatest-world-cinema-films/default.asp?film=38|title=The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema \u2013 38.

Here, Cybulski's character is not a conspirator ready to act, but an unshaven, drunken mythomaniac recalling his alleged heroic deeds.{{Sfn|Lubelski|2015|p=252}}\n\nThe myth of Cybulski also resounded in Wajda's later films. In his works ''[[Landscape After the Battle]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wedding (1972 film)|The Wedding]]'' (1972), there is a renewed reference to the final dance.{{sfn|Garbicz|1987|p=323}} Under the influence of criticism from conservative reviewers, the director made ''The Crowned-Eagle Ring'' (''Pier\u015bcionek z or\u0142em w koronie'', 1992). This work included self-plagiarism of the scene of lighting glasses in a bar (Cybulski was imitated by Tomasz Konieczny, while Rafa\u0142 Kr\u00f3likowski embodied Adam Pawlikowski), but the scene was set in a different, self-ironic context.{{Sfn|Falkowska|2007|pp=63\u201364}} However, while conservative circles regarded Wajda's ''The Crowned-Eagle Ring'' as a fair settlement of accounts with the past period,{{Sfn|K\u0105kolewski|2015|pp=67\u201368}} the film aroused embarrassment among liberal critics, with Jakub Majmurek writing about \"the most painful aesthetic self-disgrace\" on the part of the director.{{Sfn|Majmurek|2013|p=9}}\n\nFormer [[Pink Floyd]] frontman [[Roger Waters]] claims that ''Ashes and Diamonds'' had \"an enormous impact\" on him as a young man,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muzyka.interia.pl/wywiady/news-andquot-solidarnosc-jest-przykladem-dla-reszty-swiataandquot,nId,1686464|title=\"Solidarno\u015b\u0107\" jest przyk\u0142adem dal reszty \u015bwiata|publisher=[[Interia.pl]]|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> and the lyrics of the [[Pink Floyd]] song \"[[Two Suns in the Sunset]]\" from the band's 1983 album ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' makes references to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://momentarycinema.com/2018/03/30/the-european-masterpieces-part-3-ashes-and-diamonds-1958-andrzei-wajda/|title=The European Masterpieces Part 3: Ashes and Diamonds (1958 Andrzej Wajda)|publisher=Momentary Cinema|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter watching the film ''Ashes and Diamonds'' for several times at Oslo in 1960, theatre director [[Eugenio Barba]] decided to go to Poland for his further studies in directing. He enrolled his name at Warsaw University but could not complete his studies and did apprenticeship with [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. Barba had written a book on his experiences in Poland under the name ''Land of Ashes and Diamonds'' (1999).<ref>Barba, Eugenio.
