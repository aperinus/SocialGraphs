The film won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the winter of 1943\u201344, Julien Quentin, a student at a [[Carmelite]] boarding school in occupied France, is returning to school from vacation. He acts tough to the students at the school, but he is actually a pampered boy who misses his mother deeply. Saddened to be returning to the monotony of [[boarding school]], Julien's classes seem uneventful until P\u00e8re Jean, the headmaster, introduces three new pupils. One of them, Jean Bonnet, is the same age as Julien. Like the other students, Julien at first despises Bonnet, a socially awkward boy with a talent for [[arithmetic]] and playing the [[piano]].\n\nOne night, Julien wakes up and finds Bonnet wearing a [[kippah]] and praying in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. After digging through his new friend's locker, Julien learns the truth. His real name is not Bonnet, but Jean Kippelstein. P\u00e8re Jean, a compassionate, sacrificing [[priest]] at the school, had agreed to grant secret asylum to hunted Jews. After a game of [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]], however, Julien and Jean bond and a close friendship develops between them.\n\nWhen Julien's mother visits on Parents' Day, Julien asks his mother if Bonnet, whose parents could not come, could accompany them to lunch at a gourmet restaurant. As they sit around the table, the talk turns to Julien's father, a factory owner. When Julien's brother asks if he is still for [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]], Madame Quentin responds, \"No one is anymore.\" However, the [[Milice]] arrive and attempt to expel a Jewish diner. When Julien's brother calls them \"''[[Collaborationism|Collabos]]''\", the Milice commander is enraged and tells Madam Quentin, \"We serve [[France]], madam. He insulted us.\" However, when a [[Wehrmacht]] officer coldly orders them to leave, the Milice officers grudgingly obey. Julien's mother comments that the Jewish diner appears to be a very distinguished gentleman. She insists that she has nothing against Jews, but would not object if the [[socialist]] politician [[L\u00e9on Blum]] were hanged.\n\nShortly thereafter, Joseph, the school's assistant cook, is exposed for selling the school's food supplies on the [[black market]]. He implicates several students as accomplices, including Julien and his brother, Fran\u00e7ois. Although P\u00e8re Jean is visibly distressed by the injustice, he fires Joseph but does not expel the students for fear of offending their wealthy and influential parents.\n\nOn a cold morning in January 1944, the [[Gestapo]] raid the school, searching for Jean Kippelstein. As his classroom is being searched, Julien unintentionally gives away Bonnet by looking in his direction. As the other two Jewish boys are hunted down, Julien encounters the person who denounced them, Joseph the kitchen hand. Trying to justify his betrayal in the face of Julien's mute disbelief, Joseph tells him, \"Don't act so pious. There's a war going on, kid.\" Disgusted, Julien runs off. Jean and Julien exchange books, a shared habit of theirs, as they pack away their belongings due to the closure of the school.\n\nAs the students are lined up in the school courtyard, a Gestapo officer denounces P\u00e8re Jean's actions and further accuses all French people of being weak and undisciplined. Meanwhile, P\u00e8re Jean and the three Jewish students are led away by the officers. P\u00e8re Jean shouts: \"''Au revoir, les enfants! \u00c0 bient\u00f4t!''\" to the children and they respond: \"''Au revoir, mon p\u00e8re!''\" As they leave the grounds, Jean glances over towards Julien briefly, and he waves in return.\n\nThe film ends with an older Julien providing a voiceover epilogue, in which he mentions that Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], whereas P\u00e8re Jean died at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]; the school later reopened in October. He explains that although more than 40 years have passed, he will remember every second of that January morning until the day he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gaspard Manesse]] as Julien Quentin\n* [[Rapha\u00ebl Fejt\u00f6|Rapha\u00ebl Fejt\u0151]] as Jean Kippelstein, alias \"Jean Bonnet\"\n* [[Francine Racette]] as Mme Quentin (Julien's mother)\n* Stanislas Carr\u00e9 de Malberg as Fran\u00e7ois Quentin (Julien's older brother)\n* [[Philippe Morier-Genoud]] as Father Jean/P\u00e8re Jean\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Father Michel/P\u00e8re Michel\n* [[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as Mlle Davenne\n* Fran\u00e7ois N\u00e9gret as Joseph (kitchen helper)\n* [[Peter Fitz]] as Dr. M\u00fcller\n* Pascal Rivet as Boulanger\n* Beno\u00eet Henriet as Ciron\n* Richard Leboeuf as Sagard\n* [[Xavier Legrand]] as Babinot\n* Arnaud Henriet as Negus\n* Damien Salot as Dupre\n\n==Actual events==\nThe film is based on events in the childhood of the director, [[Louis Malle]], who at age 11 was attending a [[Roman Catholic]] boarding school near [[Fontainebleau]]. One day, he witnessed a [[Gestapo]] raid in which three [[Jewish]] students and a Jewish teacher were rounded up and deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].  The school's headmaster, [[P\u00e8re Jacques]], was arrested for harboring them and sent to the [[concentration camp]] at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]. He died shortly after the camp was liberated by the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|U.S. Army]], having refused to leave until the last French prisoner was repatriated. Forty years later [[Yad Vashem]], Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, granted P\u00e8re Jacques the title of [[Righteous Among the Nations]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was extremely well received by critics and has a 97% \"Fresh\" rating at the review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 37 reviews, with the consensus: \"Louis Malle's autobiographical tale of a childhood spent in a WWII boarding school is a beautifully realized portrait of friendship and youth.\"<ref>{{Cite news |title=Movie Review: ''Les Enfants'', Malle's Tale of Occupied France |author=Thomas, Kevin |author-link=Kevin Thomas (film critic) |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=16 December 1987 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-16/entertainment/ca-19410_1_malle-enfants-les |access-date=29 June 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=''Au Revoir Les Enfants'' |author=Ebert, Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=18 March 1988 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880318/REVIEWS/803180301 |access-date=29 June 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=''Au revoir, les enfants'' (1987) |author=Canby, Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 February 1988 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DEEDD1639F931A25751C0A96E948260 |access-date=29 June 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=Corliss |first1=Richard |author-link=Richard Corliss |year=1988 |title=Cinema: Hard Rites Of Passage |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966751-2,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111070044/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966751-2,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 11, 2012 |access-date=29 June 2012 }}{{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/au_revoir_les_enfants/ |title=''Au Revoir, les Enfants'' |author=Rotten Tomatoes |year=2012 |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=Rottentomatoes.com |access-date=19 August 2022 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was also a box office success having 3.5 million admissions in France and grossing $4,542,825 in North America.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Box Office Champs, Chumps |author=Klady, Leonard |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=8 January 1989 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-08/entertainment/ca-258_1_box-office/2 |access-date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay was published by [[Gallimard]] in the same year.\n\n==Awards nominations==\n'''[[Academy Awards]]'''\n* [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] -
