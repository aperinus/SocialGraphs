The film retells the melodramatic [[Victorian era|Victorian]] tale of [[Sweeney Todd]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), an English barber and [[serial killer]] who murders his customers with a [[straight razor]] and, with the help of his accomplice, [[Mrs. Lovett]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), processes their corpses into [[meat pie]]s.\n\nHaving been struck by the cinematic qualities of Sondheim's musical while still a student, Burton had entertained the notion of a film version since the early 1980s. However, it was not until 2006 that he had the opportunity to realize this ambition, when [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] announced his appointment as replacement for director [[Sam Mendes]], who had been working on such an adaptation. Sondheim, although not directly involved, was extensively consulted during production. Depp, not known for his singing, took lessons in preparation for his role, which producer [[Richard D. Zanuck]] acknowledged was something of a gamble.\n\n''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'' was released in the United States on December 21, 2007 and in the United Kingdom on January 25, 2008. Grossing over $150 million worldwide, the film was praised for the performances of the cast, musical numbers, costume and set design, and faithfulness to the 1979 musical.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1846, Benjamin Barker, a barber, arrives in [[London]], accompanied by sailor Anthony Hope. Fifteen years earlier, he was [[Miscarriage of justice|falsely convicted]] and exiled to [[Australia]] for life by the cruel and corrupt [[Judge Turpin]], who lusted after Barker's wife [[Lucy Barker|Lucy]]. Barker, having escaped from his prison, adopts the alias \"[[Sweeney Todd]]\" and returns to his old [[Fleet Street]] shop, situated above [[Mrs. Lovett|Nellie Lovett]]'s meat pie shop, where she sells the \"worst pies in London\". Lovett tells him that once he was exiled, Turpin [[rape]]d Lucy, who then poisoned herself with [[arsenic]]. The couple's daughter, [[Johanna (character)|Johanna]], is now Turpin's [[Ward (law)|ward]]. Todd vows revenge and re-opens his barbershop after Mrs. Lovett, who loves him unrequitedly, presents him with his old [[straight razor]]s. Anthony becomes enamored with Johanna, but is caught by Turpin and driven away by his henchman, [[Beadle]] Bamford.\n\nTodd denounces faux-[[Italian people|Italian]] barber [[Adolfo Pirelli]]'s [[hair tonic]] as a fraud and humiliates him in a public shaving contest judged by Bamford. A few days later, Pirelli arrives at Todd's shop, with his boy assistant [[Tobias Ragg]]. Pirelli identifies himself as Todd's former assistant, Davy Collins, and threatens to reveal Todd's secret unless Todd gives him half his earnings. Todd bludgeons Collins unconscious with a tea kettle, hides him in a trunk, and later slits his throat upon finding him still alive.\n\nAfter receiving advice from Bamford, Turpin visits Todd for grooming, intent on marrying Johanna. Todd shaves Turpin, preparing to slit his throat; they are interrupted by Anthony, who reveals his plan to [[elope]] with Johanna before noticing Turpin. An angered Turpin renounces Todd's service and leaves. Todd swears revenge on the entire world, vowing to kill as many people as possible while he waits for another chance to kill Turpin. Mrs. Lovett gets the idea to bake Todd's victims into pies, and Todd rigs his barber chair to drop his victims' bodies through a trapdoor and into her [[Bakery|bakehouse]]. Anthony searches for Johanna, whom Turpin has sent to an [[insane asylum]] upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony.\n\nWith the barbering and pie-making businesses prospering, Mrs. Lovett takes Tobias (Toby) as her assistant and tells an uninterested Todd of her plans to marry him and move to the seaside. Anthony discovers Johanna's whereabouts and, following Todd's suggestion, poses as a [[wigmaker]]'s [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] to rescue her. Todd has Toby deliver a letter to Turpin, telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her. Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett of his suspicions, vowing to protect her.\n\nBamford arrives at the pie shop, informing Mrs. Lovett that neighbors have been complaining of the stink from her chimney. Todd distracts him with an offer of a free grooming and murders him. Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of Toby's suspicions, and the pair search for the boy, who is now hiding in the sewers after finding human remains in Mrs. Lovett's bakehouse. Meanwhile, Anthony brings Johanna, disguised as a sailor, to the shop, and has her wait there while he leaves to find Todd.\n\nA [[Begging|beggar]] woman enters the shop looking for Bamford, and Johanna hides in the trunk. The woman recognizes Todd, but upon hearing Turpin coming, Todd kills her and sends her through the trapdoor in the floor. As Turpin enters, Todd explains that Johanna had repented and is coming to him, then offers a free shave in the meantime. When Turpin finally recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, Todd stabs him several times, cuts his throat, and dumps him into the bakehouse. Johanna comes out of her hiding place, still disguised, and Todd prepares to kill her as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. However, hearing Mrs. Lovett horrifyingly scream in the basement when the dying Turpin grabs at her dress, Todd spares Johanna.\n\nTodd discovers that the beggar woman was his wife Lucy, whom he believed to be dead, and that Mrs. Lovett deliberately misled him so she could have him to herself. Enraged, Todd pretends to forgive her and dances manically with her before hurling her into the bakehouse oven as revenge, then cradles Lucy's dead body in his arms. Toby appears and Todd, now wishing to die, allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Sweeney Todd|Benjamin Barker / Sweeney Todd]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Mrs. Lovett|Nellie Lovett]]\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Judge Turpin]]\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Beadle Bamford\n* [[Jayne Wisener]] as [[Johanna (character)|Johanna Barker]]\n* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Adolfo Pirelli]]\n* [[Laura Michelle Kelly]] as [[Lucy Barker|Lucy Barker / Beggar Woman]]\n* [[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as Anthony Hope\n* [[Ed Sanders (actor)|Ed Sanders]] as [[Tobias Ragg|Tobias 'Toby' Ragg]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{Multiple image|perrow=3|total_width=340\n| image1 = Tim Burton (7587109150).jpg\n| image2 = John Logan headshot color 2009.jpg\n| image3 = Richard D.
