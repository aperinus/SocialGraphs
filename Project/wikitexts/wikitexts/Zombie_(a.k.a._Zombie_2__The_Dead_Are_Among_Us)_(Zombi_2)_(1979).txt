It was adapted from an original screenplay by [[Dardano Sacchetti]] to serve as a sequel to [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978), which was released in Italy with the title ''Zombi''. It stars [[Tisa Farrow]], [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]], and [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], and features a score by frequent Fulci collaborator [[Fabio Frizzi]]. Frizzi's score has been released independently of the film, and he has performed it live on tour.\n\nThe film tells the story of a Caribbean island cursed by [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] whose dead residents rise as zombies to attack the living. A scientist's daughter journeys to the island after her father's boat turns up abandoned in [[New York City]]. Intended by its writer as a return to \"classic zombie tales\", ''Zombi 2'' was filmed in Italy, with further location shooting in New York and [[Santo Domingo]].\n\nProduced on a small budget of 410 million [[Italian lira]], the film earned several times its production costs back in international gross. It attracted controversy upon its release in the United Kingdom, where it became listed as a \"[[video nasty]]\". However, in the subsequent years the film received a greater appreciation from critics, and has gained a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Antonio Bruschini |author2=Antonio Tentori|title=Lucio Fulci, il poeta della crudelt\u00e0|year=2004|publisher=Mondo Ignoto|location=Rome|isbn=88-89084-25-1|pages=67\u201370|language=it}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn abandoned boat drifts into [[New York Harbor]], and is boarded by two [[Water police|harbor patrolmen]]. A hidden zombie kills one of the patrolmen, but is shot by the patrolman\u2019s partner and falls overboard; the dead patrolman's body is taken to the morgue. Anne Bowles ([[Tisa Farrow]]) is questioned by police, as the boat belonged to her father. She claims he is conducting research on Matul, a Caribbean island. British journalist Peter West ([[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]]), is investigating the story; he and Bowles learn that Bowles' father is suffering from a strange illness on the island. They hire a boat and two guides\u2014Brian Hull ([[Al Cliver]]) and his girlfriend Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay)\u2014to reach Matul.\n\nMeanwhile, on Matul, British doctor David Menard ([[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]]), and his wife Paola ([[Olga Karlatos]]) have been researching the phenomenon of zombie reanimation. Paola wishes to flee the island, but Menard insists on staying. That night, Paola is alone in the house when a zombie tries to enter; she pushes the door shut but it breaks through with one arm. Paola is dragged through the hole and killed, with her eye being gouged out by splintered wood.\n\nApproaching Matul, Barrett dives in the ocean around the boat. She encounters a shark, and flees behind a reef only to be accosted by a submerged zombie. Surfacing, she reaches the boat while the shark and zombie attack each other. Eventually, the boat docks at Matul.\n\nMenard is alarmed to find that one of his colleagues, Fritz, has died of the zombie infection. He tells his remaining staff to shoot all the dead bodies in their heads. While digging a grave for a body, he hears a signal flare and follows it to discover the boat group. Menard sends them back to his mansion in order to fetch his wife, where they discover Paola's corpse being eaten by zombies. The group fends off an attack against them and escapes in a jeep, with West suffering an ankle injury when the vehicle veers off-road after slamming into a zombie. Resting in a jungle clearing, the group realize they have encountered a [[Conquistador]]-era graveyard; Barrett is killed when one of the corpses rises from the earth and bites out her throat.\n\nAs more corpses reanimate, the group flees to the local hospital, where Menard explains that the dead are rising as a result of a voodoo curse which he has been trying to stop. The hospital is besieged by zombies, and Menard is killed by a reanimated Fritz. As the zombies attempt to enter, those being treated for infection inside the hospital also reanimate, killing several hospital staff who have stayed behind. As the dead outside breach the door, Bowles and Hull set the building on fire; the undead Barrett bites Hull but is shot in the head by West. Bowles, West and Hull escape to the boat and leave the island. At the sea, Hull dies of his infection, and his body is locked in a cabin to be used as evidence of what has happened. However, as the boat approaches New York again, a radio broadcast reports that the city is under attack from zombies\u2014the result of the initial attack in the harbor.\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box\n|width=25em\n|quote=\n[''Zombi 2''] did not have the greatest of scripts but Richard [gave] every scene authority and colour.
