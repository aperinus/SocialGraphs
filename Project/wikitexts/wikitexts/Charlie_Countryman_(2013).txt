Her spirit appears to him, urging him to go to [[Bucharest]], and Charlie does so. He bonds with Victor, the [[Romania]]n man sitting next to him on the plane, who is returning home after seeing a [[Chicago Cubs]] game. During the flight, Victor dies, and his spirit asks Charlie to deliver a gift and a final message to his daughter.\n\nAt the airport, Charlie is [[taser|tased]] and questioned by security after trying to retrieve Victor\u2019s gift. He is instantly smitten with Victor's daughter, Gabi, and consoles her before parting ways. Taking a taxi into the city, he notices Gabi in her car and offers to drive her. They nearly collide with the ambulance transporting her father\u2019s body, which crashes. Gabi accompanies the body in another ambulance, leaving her car with Charlie, who finds a revolver in her purse with an inscription from \u201cNigel\u201d.\n\nHe drives to the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] where Gabi performs as a cellist, and she calls him with instructions to deliver her instrument to the conductor, Bela. Charlie waits while Gabi performs with the pit orchestra, and they are confronted by her estranged husband, Nigel. Staying at a [[hostel]], Charlie parties with his roommates Karl and Luc after they dose him with [[MDMA|ecstasy]], and is menaced by Nigel in the bathroom. Spotting Gabi, Charlie insists on following her and they spend the night out, sharing memories of their parents, and she promises him a kiss if he can find her the next day.\n\nAfter Karl takes an overdose of [[sildenafil|Viagra]], he and Luc bring Charlie to a strip club. They receive a bill for 9,900 [[Romanian leu]] (${{To USD|9900|ROU}}) and are threatened by the manager, Darko, who notices that Charlie recognizes pictures of Nigel and Gabi on his wall. Demanding to know Nigel\u2019s whereabouts, Darko lets them go. Charlie waits for Gabi at the Athenaeum, and Bela takes him to Gabi\u2019s home, where a memorial is being held for Victor. Gabi and Charlie share the kiss she promised him, and he tells her about meeting Darko. Nigel barges in and threatens Charlie, but Gabi forces him to leave at gunpoint. Once they are alone, she explains to Charlie how she met Nigel, realizing he was a violent criminal after they married, and that her father forced Nigel to leave Bucharest with the threat of an incriminating videotape that Darko wants to obtain. Charlie confesses he is in love with her, and they have sex.\n\nWaking up alone, Charlie finds a tape in Victor\u2019s collection labeled \u201cCubbies\u201d, revealed to be security footage of Nigel and Darko murdering a group of people. A shocked Charlie finds Gabi at a caf\u00e9 with Nigel and declares to them that he watched the tape. Nigel nearly kills him before the police arrive, escaping while Charlie is taken into custody. Bela arranges to have Charlie sent to [[Budapest]], bluntly stating that Gabi doesn't want to see him. Charlie is dropped off at the hostel to collect his belongings, but the owner warns him that men are waiting for him. Pursued by Darko\u2019s henchmen, Charlie escapes to Gabi\u2019s house only to find the tape missing. He is confronted by Darko, who has kidnapped and interrogated Karl and Luc. Gabi calls Darko to arrange a meeting, and he knocks Charlie unconscious.\n\nGabi finds Charlie outside the Athenaeum and tells him that he will never see her again. Having taken the tape, she prepares to leave with Nigel to meet Darko. Encouraged by another vision of his mother, Charlie tries to stop Nigel but is knocked out again. He is taken to the docks and hung by his ankle above the water, while Darko burns the tape. Nigel forces Gabi to shoot Charlie, but she spares him as the police arrive. Darko and his men flee, dropping Charlie into the water, while Nigel realizes Gabi loves Charlie and commits [[suicide by cop]]. Charlie emerges from the water alive and reunites with Gabi.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]] as Charlie Countryman\n*[[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Gabriella \"Gabi\" Ibanescu\n*[[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Nigel\n*[[Til Schweiger]] as Darko\n*[[Rupert Grint]] as Karl\n*[[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] as Luc\n*[[Ion Caramitru]] as Victor Ibanescu\n*[[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Bill\n*[[Melissa Leo]] as Kate Countryman\n*Andrei Finti as Bela\n*Gabriel Spahiu as Taxi Driver\n*[[Aubrey Plaza]] as Ashley\n*[[Vanessa Kirby]] as Felicity\n*Lia Sinchevici as Waitress\n*Ian Fisher\n\n[[John Hurt]] was a brief narrator for the film's original version released at Sundance, but his narration was edited out and is included on its Blu-ray release as an extra.\n\n==Production==\nIn early development, LaBeouf dropped out of the project and the title role was briefly given to [[Zac Efron]] before LaBeouf returned to the project in August 2010.

According to LaBeouf, he had to trip on the acid to really get into the head of his character and to emulate some of his acting heroes. \"There's a way to do an acid trip like ''[[Harold & Kumar]]'' and there's a way to be on acid.
