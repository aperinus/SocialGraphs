This is Lee's only complete directorial film and the last one released during his lifetime. The film co-stars [[Nora Miao]], [[Robert Wall]], and [[Paul Wei Ping-ao|Wei Ping-ou]], with [[Chuck Norris]] playing his debut screen role. ''The Way of the Dragon'' was released in Hong Kong on 30 December 1972, and in the United States in August 1974.\n\nThe film went on to gross an estimated {{US$|130 million}} worldwide (equivalent to over {{US$|700 million|long=no}} adjusted for inflation), against a tight budget of $130,000, earning a thousand times its budget. It was the highest-grossing [[Hong Kong film]] up until Lee's next film, ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Rome]], Chen Ching-hua and her uncle Wang experience trouble with their restaurant from a crime boss who wants their property. When Chen refuses to give it up, the boss sends gangsters there to scare away the customers. Appealing to an uncle in [[Hong Kong]], Chen receives help in the form of a young martial artist, Tang Lung (Bruce Lee). On his first arrival he is disoriented by his new surroundings and appears to be nothing but a country bumpkin. Disappointed, Chen asks what help he can be, but Tang confidently assures her that he is capable enough. At the restaurant, Tang learns that the staff have begun to learn [[karate]], much to the annoyance of Quen, an employee who favors Chinese [[Kung Fu]]. Tang advises Quen to be open-minded and make use of anything that works.\n\nBefore long, the gangsters appear at the restaurant and threaten the customers away while Tang is using the bathroom. Upset by Tang's poor timing, the staff question his skill and the usefulness of his style. When the gangsters later return, the staff engage the thugs in a fight, only to be beaten. However, Tang single-handedly defeats them, causing the staff to decide to train under him. Uncle Wang warns them that the gangsters will seek revenge, but Tang vows to protect the restaurant. Chen and Tang grow closer, and she takes him on a tour of Rome, though Tang is unimpressed by the city.\n\nHo, the crime boss's subordinate, returns with armed men and takes the restaurant staff hostage. Ho gives Tang a ticket to Hong Kong and tells him to go back. However, when his men escort Tang outside, Tang fights back and defeats the thugs with his two [[nunchaku]]s, followed by the help of the restaurant staff. Tang warns Ho not to return, and the thugs leave the restaurant. The staff celebrate their victory, but the gang boss threatens to have Tang killed unless he leaves by [[Chinese New Year]], and Uncle Wang urges Chen to convince Tang to leave.\n\nWhen Tang refuses to abandon the restaurant, an assassin tries to kill him from a nearby rooftop with a sniper rifle. Already fidgety from nearby fireworks, Tang survives the attempt. He then tracks down and defeats the assassin after tricking him into wasting his ammunition. When he returns to the apartment, he finds that Chen is gone. Assuming that Ho has kidnapped her, Tang goes to the boss' headquarters with the restaurant staff, defeating his men. Tang issues a final warning to the boss to leave the restaurant alone. The staff again celebrate, but a telegram for Tang cuts this short when they learn that he has been summoned back to Hong Kong. Tang assures them that he will not leave until the situation is resolved.\n\nHo hires two martial artists to challenge Tang - Japanese and European karate masters who initially refuse to work together. When the mafia boss indicates that money is no issue, Ho also recruits a world-class martial artist named Colt. Ho leads some of the restaurant staff to an isolated spot under the pretence of a truce, where the two martial artists ambush them. These initially defeat the staff, until Tang intervenes and leaves the staff to finish the last one off. Meanwhile, Ho lures Tang away to fight Colt at the [[Colosseum]].\n\nLeft behind, Uncle Wang knifes the two remaining members of the staff, as he wants to sell the restaurant to the crime boss and return to Hong Kong a rich man. In a decisive ten-minute battle, Tang disables Colt. When Colt refuses an opportunity for mercy, Tang kills him with reluctance. Tang then places Colt's [[Karate gi|gi]] and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] atop his dead body as a gesture of respect, before discovering Ho and chasing after him out of the Colosseum. As Tang and Ho return to the ambush site, the mob boss arrives and shoots both Ho and Uncle Wang. Then the police drive up, led by Chen, and arrest the boss as he tries to kill Tang.\n\nWith the matter finally resolved, Tang sets out to return to Hong Kong. As he leaves, Quen tells Chen that Tang is a loner who will never settle down.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Tang Lung\n*[[Nora Miao]] as Chen Ching-hua\n*[[Paul Wei Ping-ao|Wei Ping-ou]] as Ho\n*[[Huang Tsung Hsing|Huang Chung-hsin]] as Uncle Wang\n*[[Tony Liu]] as Tony \n*[[Unicorn Chan]] as Jimmy \n*Tommy Chen as Thomas \n*Chin Ti as Quen \n*Wu Ngan as Waiter \n*Robert Chan as Robert \n*[[Chuck Norris]] as Colt\n*[[Jon T.
