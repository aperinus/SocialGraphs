The first segment, in 1976, begins with the return of an artist, '''Gengnian''' to his wife, '''Xiuqing''' and son after several years of re-education during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He returns however, with injured hands and can no longer continue as an artist. He instead hopes to cultivate artistic aspirations in his son, '''Xiangyang''', who has taken to hurling stones at strangers with his friend '''Chicken Droppings'''. Though he eventually follows in his father's footsteps, Xiangyang resents his father's pressure and the two soon fall out.\n\nThe next segments, in 1987 when Xiangyang is a 19-year-old, and 1999, when he is in his 30s, continue to chart the course of Xiangyang and Gengnian's tense relationship. It is a moving film depicting the tension between Xianyang and his parents and also the marital relationship between his parents. The [[sunflower]] returns throughout the movie as a theme.\n\n== Releases ==\n''Sunflower'' received its international premiere at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2005.\n\nThe film was also shown at several international film festivals.\n\n*[[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] \u2013 '''Contemporary World Cinema''' September 10, 2005\n*2005 [[Chicago International Film Festival]], October 10, 2005<ref name=imdb>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401808/releaseinfo|title=Release Dates for Xiang Ri Kui|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-10-25}}</ref>\n*2005 [[San Sebastian Film Festival]]\n*2005 [[Pusan International Film Festival]] \u2013 '''Window on Asian Cinema'''\n*2006 [[Hong Kong International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/festival-reports/hkiff-2006-ben-cho/|title=When Hou Met Kuriyami: The Hong Kong International Film Festival Turns 30|author=Cho, Ben|publisher=[[Senses of Cinema]]|date=May 2006|accessdate=2007-10-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913004357/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/06/40/hkiff-2006-ben-cho.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-13}}</ref> April 11, 2006<ref name=imdb/>\n*2006 [[Bangkok International Film Festival]], \u2013 '''Windows on the World''', February 19, 2006<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokfilm.org/2006/en/films/film_detail.aspx?id=F0006|title=Films: Sunflower (xianrikui)|publisher=Bangkokfilm.org|accessdate=2007-10-21|archive-date=2022-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331040251/http://www.bangkokfilm.org/2006/en/films/film_detail.aspx?id=F0006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*[[2006 in film|2006]] [[Tokyo International Film Festival]], July 8, 2006<ref name=imdb/>\n*2007 [[Pacific Rim Film Festival]], October 10, 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacrimfilmfestival.org/schedule2007.html |title=Pacific Rim Film Festival Schedule |publisher=Pacific Rim Film Festival |access-date=2007-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708054520/http://www.pacrimfilmfestival.org/schedule2007.html |archive-date=July 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''Sunflower'' was also given a limited release in New York City on August 17, 2007.<ref name=VV>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0733,wallace,77512,20.html |title=Sunflower |author=Wallace, Julia |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |date=2007-08-14 |access-date=2007-10-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922140242/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0733,wallace,77512,20.html |archive-date=2007-09-22 |df= }}</ref> Playing on only one screen, the film has made less than $24,000 dollars in the US as contrasted to over $8 million from foreign releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sunflower.htm|title=Sunflower (2007)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Sunflower'' was shown at several international film festivals.
