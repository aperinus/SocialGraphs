It stars [[David Duchovny]] (in his first starring role after achieving success with ''[[The X-Files]]''), [[Timothy Hutton]], and [[Angelina Jolie]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuchovny plays Eugene Sands, a [[surgeon]] who has his [[medical license]] revoked after operating under the [[drug abuse|influence]] of [[amphetamine]]s and [[opiate]]s. Hutton's character, a crime lord named Raymond Blossom, happens upon him in a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] where Sands saves someone's life with an emergency procedure to inflate a [[pneumothorax|collapsed lung]]. Blossom hires Sands as his personal physician, patching up his accomplices when they cannot go to a [[hospital]], and tending to the crime boss and his [[gun moll|girlfriend]], Claire (Jolie). In the final act of the film, Claire and Sands become involved, and he must face up to conflicting loyalties to Blossom, Claire, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who has [[blackmail]]ed him into being an [[informant]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Dr. Eugene Sands\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Raymond Blossom\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Claire\n* [[Michael Massee]] as Gage\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Vladimir\n* [[Andrew Tiernan]] as Cyril\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as Yates\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Flick\n* Will Stewart as Perry\n* [[Philip Moon (actor)|Philip Moon]] as Casey\n*[[Pavel D. Lynchnikoff]] as Andrei\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Jim\n* Sandra Kinder as Sue\n* Bill Rosier as Jerry\n* [[Keone Young]] as Mr. Ksi\n* [[Stella Garcia]] as South African Businesswoman\n\n==Production==\nIts release was delayed due to initial negative reactions from test audiences. The film's trailer contained a brief glimpse of a sex scene between Duchovny and Jolie. The actress later confirmed that she had filmed two sex scenes for the movie, but that both of them were edited out of the final cut.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film did not fare well financially or with critics, scoring just a 16% at the review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/playing_god/?critic=columns|title=Playing God - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures|date=|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=August 18, 2021}}</ref> and making only $4,166,918 at the US theater [[box office]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/PLAYI.php|title=Playing God - Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information|date=|publisher=The Numbers|accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref> Popular film critic [[Roger Ebert]] however, gave the film three stars, saying \"This may not be a great movie, but for both Duchovny and Hutton, it's a turning point\", citing Duchovny's ability to \"stand above the action\" like Clint Eastwood; and Hutton's ability to create a real character as the villain, instead of merely filling a space.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170306/1023|title=rogerebert.com - Reviews: Playing God (xhtml)|date=1997-10-17|accessdate=2013-01-15|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with the [[New York Times]] dated 9 April 2000 David Duchovny himself, while talking about production difficulties, stated that \u201c\u2018Playing God' was a mistake only because we didn't have a script ready...
