It stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Gary Farmer]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[John Hurt]], [[Michael Wincott]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Mili Avital]], and [[Robert Mitchum]]. The movie, set in the late-[[1800s (decade)|1800s]], follows William Blake, a meek accountant on the run after murdering a man. He has a chance encounter with enigmatic Native American spirit-guide \"Nobody\", who believes Blake is the reincarnation of the visionary English poet [[William Blake]].\n\nThe film is shot entirely in [[monochrome]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/break-with-the-past/2005/09/08/1125772639995.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Break with the past | date=September 10, 2005}}</ref> [[Neil Young]] composed the guitar-dominated soundtrack with portions he improvised while watching the movie footage.

During the trip, the train Fireman ([[Crispin Glover]]) warns Blake against the enterprise. Arriving in town, Blake notes the hostility of the townsfolk towards him. He then discovers that the position has already been filled, and John Dickinson ([[Robert Mitchum]]), the ferocious owner of the company, drives Blake from the workplace by gunpoint.\n\nJobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell ([[Mili Avital]]), a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thel's ex-boyfriend Charlie ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) surprises them in bed, shoots at Blake, and accidentally kills Thel when she shields Blake with her body. The bullet passes through Thel and wounds Blake, who kills Charlie with Thel's gun before dazedly climbing out the window and fleeing the town on Charlie's horse. Company-owner Dickinson is Charlie's father and hires three legendary frontier killers\u2014Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny \"The Kid\" Pickett\u2014to bring Blake back \"dead or alive\".\n\nBlake awakens to find a large [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] man ([[Gary Farmer]]) trying to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blake's heart to remove, rendering Blake effectively a walking dead man. When he learns Blake's full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation of [[William Blake]], a poet whom he idolizes but of whom Blake is ignorant.<ref>In [//www.nytrash.com/deadman/deadjj.html an interview] Jarmusch states \"For Nobody, the journey is a continuing ceremony whose purpose is to deliver Blake back to the spirit-level of the world. To him, Blake's spirit has been misplaced and somehow returned to the physical realm.\"</ref> He decides to care for Blake and to use Native methods to help ease him into death.\n\nBlake learns of Nobody's past, marked by prejudice from both Native Americans and white people: Nobody's mother and father were from two opposing tribes, Piik\u00e1ni (Blackfoot) and Aps\u00e1alooke (Crow), respectively.<ref name=\"taubin\">{{cite web |last1=Taubin |first1=Amy |date=May 4, 2018 |title=Dead Man: Blake in America |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5619-dead-man-blake-in-america |access-date=9 May 2022 |website=The Criterion Collection |publisher=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> As a child, English soldiers abducted and brought him to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. They thus dub him Xebeche: \"He who talks loud, saying nothing\". Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the [[Pacific Ocean]] to return him to his proper place in the spirit-world.\n\nBlake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering [[wanted posters]] announcing higher and higher bounties for Blake's death or capture. Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a [[vision quest]]. On his quest, Blake kills two [[U.S. Marshal]]s, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn his pursuers accidentally kill. He paints his face with the fawn's blood and rejoins Nobody. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and continued his hunt alone.\n\nAt a trading post, a bigoted [[missionary]] ([[Alfred Molina]]) identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but instead dies at Blake's hands. Shortly after, Blake is shot again, and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody hurries to take him by river to a [[Makah]] village and persuades the tribe to give him a canoe for Blake's [[ship burial]]. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village, where the people pity him, before he collapses from his injuries.\n\nHe awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake sees Cole approaching Nobody. Too weak to cry out, he can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. Looking up at the sky one last time, Blake dies as his canoe drifts out to sea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as William Blake, a meek accountant from [[Cleveland, Ohio]]\n* [[Gary Farmer]] as Nobody, a strong and opinionated Native American forcibly raised by whites and later given the mocking name ''Xebeche'', or \"He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing\", by fellow natives\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Train Fireman, a coal-covered [[Fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] who welcomes Blake to the \"hell\" of Machine\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Cole Wilson, an infamous bounty hunter and murderous cannibal\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Conway Twill, a talkative bounty hunter\n* [[Eugene Byrd]] as Johnny \"The Kid\" Pickett, a young bounty hunter\n* [[John Hurt]] as John Scholfield, the business manager of Dickinson's factory\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as John Dickinson, a shotgun-toting industrialist in Machine (Mitchum's final film role before his death in 1997)\n* [[Iggy Pop]] as Salvatore \"Sally\" Jenko, a [[cross-dressing]], Bible-reading [[fur trade]]r at a campsite\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Charlie Dickinson, Thel's ex-boyfriend and John Dickinson's son\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Benmont Tench, a knife-toting fur trader at Sally's campsite\n* [[Mili Avital]] as Thel Russell, a former prostitute who makes and sells [[Artificial flower#Cloth and paper flowers|paper flowers]]\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Big George Drakoulias, a [[mountain man]] at Sally's campsite\n* [[Michelle Thrush]] as Nobody's girlfriend\n* [[Gibby Haynes]] as Man with gun in alley\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Trading Post Missionary, a corrupt missionary and businessman\n\n==Cultural allusions==\nThe film contains many references to [[William Blake]]{{'s}} poetry. Xebeche aka Nobody recites from several Blake poems, including ''[[Auguries of Innocence]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and ''The Everlasting Gospel''. When bounty hunter Cole warns his companions against drinking from standing water, it references the [[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell#Proverbs of Hell|Proverb of Hell]] (from the aforementioned ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell|Marriage]]''), \"Expect poison from standing water\". Thel's name is also a reference to Blake's ''[[The Book of Thel]]''.\n\nThe scenes with Thel culminating in the bedroom murder scene visually enact Blake's poem, \"[[The Sick Rose]]\": \"O rose, thou art sick. / The invisible worm, / That flies in the night / In the howling storm: / Has found out thy bed / Of crimson joy: / And his dark secret love / Does thy life destroy.\" The film's [[Dead Man (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] and promotional music video also features Depp reciting passages from Blake's poetry to music Neil Young composed for the film.\n\nAlthough the film is set in the 19th century, Jarmusch included a number of references to 20th century [[American culture]]. Benmont Tench, the man at the campsite played by [[Jared Harris]], is named after [[Benmont Tench]], keyboardist for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. Billy Bob Thornton's character, Big George Drakoulias, is named for record producer [[George Drakoulias]]. The name of Mitchum's character is a reference to rock producer Jim Dickinson.\n\nThe marshals chasing Blake are named Lee Hazlewood and Marvin Throne-berry, after [[Lee Hazlewood]] and [[Marv Throneberry]], and also an allusion to the American actor [[Lee Marvin]].<ref name=\"ccat.sas.upenn.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/105/Rea2.html |title=Rea, Jarmusch Interview |access-date=2009-06-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227233624/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/105/Rea2.html |archive-date=February 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Nobody's name (\"He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing\") is a reference to the [[James Brown]] song \"[[Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing]]\".<ref name=\"ccat.sas.upenn.edu\" /> Michael Wincott's character is shown in possession of a [[teddy bear]].

Jarmusch encouraged Young's improvisational music, as it would add to the film's spontaneous narrative. The soundtrack album consists of seven instrumental tracks by Young, with dialog excerpts from the film and [[Johnny Depp]] reading the poetry of [[William Blake]] interspersed between the music.\n\n==In other media==\n[[Gary Farmer]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Nobody in Jarmusch's subsequent film ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]'', in which he repeats one of his signature lines of dialogue, \"Stupid fucking white man!\"\n\n[[Johnny Depp]] makes a brief cameo as William Blake in [[Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki]]'s film ''[[L.A.
