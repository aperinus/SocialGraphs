It is based on the [[Atonement (novel)|2001 novel of the same name]] by [[Ian McEwan]]. The film chronicles a crime and its consequences over the course of six decades, beginning in the 1930s. It was produced for [[StudioCanal]] and filmed in England. Distributed in most of the world by [[Universal Studios]], it was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2007 and in North America on 7 December 2007.\n\n''Atonement'' opened both the 2007 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] and the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]], making Wright, at age 35, the youngest director ever to open the latter event. The film was a commercial success and earned a worldwide gross of approximately $129 million against a budget of $30 million. It received rave reviews, with critics praising its acting, emotional depth, Wright's direction, [[Dario Marianelli]]'s score, the cinematography and visuals.\n\n''Atonement'' won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] at the [[80th Academy Awards]] and was nominated for six others, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Ronan.<ref name=\"NomineesOscars2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.oscar.com/nominees/?pn=film&film=Atonement%20Film |work=Oscar.com |date=23 January 2008 |access-date=24 January 2008 |title=Academy Award nominations for 'Atonement' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129085058/http://www.oscar.com/nominees/?pn=film&film=Atonement+Film |archive-date=29 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> It also garnered fourteen nominations at the [[61st British Academy Film Awards]], winning both [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Production Design]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].<ref name=\"WinnersBAFTA2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.bafta.org/press/winners-announced,17,SNS.html |work=BAFTA.org |date=10 February 2008 |access-date=10 February 2008 |title=BAFTA Awards for 'Atonement' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211194947/http://www.bafta.org/press/winners-announced%2C17%2CSNS.html |archive-date=11 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1935 England, 13-year-old Briony Tallis, the youngest daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, is set to perform a play she wrote for an upcoming family gathering. She spies on her older sister, Cecilia and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (with whom Briony is infatuated), from her bedroom window.  During their (Cecilia's and Robbie's) argument near the fountain, Robbie accidentally breaks a vase and yells at Cecilia to stay where she is \u2013 so as to avoid cutting her feet on the broken pieces on the ground. Still angered, Cecilia then strips off her outer clothing, stares at him and climbs into the fountain to retrieve one of the pieces. Briony observes all this from the window, and misinterprets the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie.\n\nRobbie drafts a note to Cecilia to apologise for the incident. In one draft of the note, he pens his true, unfiltered feelings of attraction for Cecilia in very explicit language.  Although he never intends for Cecilia (or anyone else) to see this version of the note, he mistakenly places it (instead of the second more formal note he drafts) in an envelope which he asks Briony to deliver to Cecilia.   Only after Briony departs does he realise the wrong version of the note is in the envelope destined for Cecilia's hands.  Making matters worse, Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes the note to her 15-year-old visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \"sex maniac\". \nPaul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie and Cecilia are alone in the library, at which time he apologises to Cecilia for the obscene letter but, to his surprise, she confesses her secret love for him. They proceed to make passionate love against the wall in the library as Briony walks in and sees them together against the wall.  Briony mistakenly thinks her sister is being raped.\n\nDuring dinner, Lola's twin brothers go missing and the household organises into search parties. While participating in the search, Briony comes across Lola being raped by a man who flees upon being discovered.  The two girls talk and Briony becomes convinced that it was Robbie; a confused Lola does not dissent.  The girls return home.  Later, Robbie\u2014who finds the twins unharmed\u2014returns to the house to see everyone waiting for him suspiciously.  He ushers the twins inside and is promptly arrested despite Cecilia's pleas of his innocence.  Lola and Briony's testimony, along with her turning over the explicit letter convinces everyone but Cecilia of his guilt.\n\nFour years later, during the [[Second World War]], Robbie is released from prison on the condition that he joins the [[British Army|army]] and fights in the [[Battle of France]]. Separated from his unit, he makes his way on foot to [[Dunkirk]]. He thinks back to six months earlier when he met Cecilia, now a nurse. Briony, now 18, joined Cecilia's old nursing unit at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London rather than go to the [[University of Cambridge]]. She writes to her sister, but Cecilia cannot forgive her for her part in Robbie's arrest and conviction years earlier. Robbie, who is gravely ill from an infected wound and hallucinating, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he awaits [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]].\n\nLater, Briony, who regrets implicating Robbie, learns from a newsreel that Paul Marshall, who now owns a factory supplying rations to the British army, is about to marry Lola. Briony attends the wedding and she realises that it was Paul who assaulted Lola during the search for the twins years ago. Briony visits Cecilia to apologise directly, and suggests correcting her testimony to which Cecilia says she would be an \"unreliable witness\". Briony is surprised to find Robbie there living with her sister, while in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has still not accepted responsibility for her actions. Cecilia calms him down and then Robbie instructs Briony how to correct the record and get Robbie's conviction overturned. Briony agrees. Cecilia adds that Briony include what she remembers of Danny Hardman, but Briony points out that Paul Marshall was the rapist and Cecilia adds he has just married Lola and now Lola will not be able to testify against her husband.\n\nDecades later, when Briony is an elderly and successful novelist, she gives an interview about her latest and last book, an autobiographical novel titled ''Atonement.''  She explains she is dying from [[vascular dementia]].   During the interview, the audience learns that the portion of the book where Robbie and Cecilia are living together and she (Briony) attempts to apologize to them, is completely fictitious.  The sad reality is that she can never atone for her mistake\u2014Cecilia and Robbie were never reunited; Robbie died of [[sepsis|septicaemia]] at Dunkirk on the morning of the day of his evacuation; Cecilia died months later in the [[Balham tube station disaster|Balham tube station bombing]] during [[the Blitz]]. Briony admits that she hopes to give the two, in fiction, and in death, the happiness they never had because she was responsible for the awful mistaken identification regarding Lola's rape. The last scene shows an imagined, happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie staying in the house by the sea which they had intended to visit once they were reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Robbie Turner, the son of the Tallis family housekeeper with a [[Cambridge]] education courtesy of his mother's employer.\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters. \n* [[Romola Garai]] as Briony Tallis, aged 18, the younger Tallis sister and a nurse-in-training.\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Briony, aged 13, an aspiring novelist.\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as older Briony, now a successful novelist.\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Grace Turner, Robbie's mother and the Tallis family housekeeper.\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Lola Quincey, the visiting 15-year-old cousin of the Tallis siblings.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Paul Marshall, Leon Tallis's visiting friend.\n* [[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]] as Leon Tallis, the eldest of the Tallis siblings.\n* [[Harriet Walter]] as Emily Tallis, the matriarch of the family.\n* [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as Police Inspector.\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Tommy Nettle, one of Robbie's brothers-in-arms.\n* [[Nonso Anozie]] as Frank Mace, another fellow soldier.\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Sister Drummond.\n* [[J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier]] as Luc Cornet, a fatally wounded and brain-damaged French soldier whom the 18-year-old Briony comforts on his deathbed.\n* [[Michelle Duncan]] as Fiona Maguire, Briony's nursing friend at St Thomas' Hospital.\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Danny Hardman, a worker on the Tallis estate who is falsely accused of rape.\n\nIn addition, film director and playwright [[Anthony Minghella]] briefly appears as the television interviewer in the final scene.

He also sought out production designer [[Sarah Greenwood]], editor Paul Tothill, costume designer [[Jacqueline Durran]], and composer [[Dario Marianelli]], for the film\u2014all of whom previously worked together with Wright. In an interview, Wright states, \"It's important for me to work with the same people.

The first draft \u2013 written with director [[Richard Eyre]] in mind \u2013 took what Hampton called a more \"conventional, literary approach,\" with a linear structure, and a voiceover and the epilogue of the older Briony being woven in throughout the entire film instead of only at the end. Wright felt that the original approach owed more to contemporary filmmaking than historical filmmaking, while the second script was closer to the book.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/><ref name=\"focusfeatures1\"/>\n\nTo re-create the World War II setting, producers hired a historian to work with the department heads.

Set decorator [[Katie Spencer]] and production designer [[Sarah Greenwood]] both examined archives from ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' to find suitable locations for the interior and exterior scenes.<ref name=\"focusfeatures1\"/> [[Seamus McGarvey]], the cinematographer, worked closely with Wright on the aesthetics of the visualisation, using a range of techniques and camera movements to achieve the final result.\n\n===Casting===\nCasting the film was a lengthy process for Wright, particularly choosing the right actors for his protagonists. Having previously worked with [[Keira Knightley]] on ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005), he expressed his admiration for her, stating, \"I think she's a really extraordinary actress\".<ref name=\"independent2007\">{{cite web |last1=Staff |first1=Indy |title=Sitting Down with Joe Wright, Director of Atonement |url=https://www.independent.com/2007/12/13/sitting-down-joe-wright-director-atonement/ |website=Santa Barbara Independent |date=13 December 2007 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175557/https://www.independent.com/2007/12/13/sitting-down-joe-wright-director-atonement/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Referencing her character's unlikeability, Wright commended on Knightley's bravery in tackling this type of role without any fear of how the audience will receive this characterisation, stating \"It's a character that's not always likeable and I think so many young actors these days are terrified of being disliked at any given moment in case the audience doesn't come and pay their box-office money to see them again. Keira is not afraid of that. She puts her craft first.\"<ref name=\"independent2007\"/> As opposed to casting McAvoy, \"Knightley was in almost the opposite position\u2014that of a sexy, beautiful movie star who, despite having worked steadily since she was seven, was widely underestimated as an actress.\"<ref name=\"wmagazine1\">{{cite web |last1=Comita |first1=Jenny |title=Keira & James |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/keira-knightley-james-mcavoy/ |website=W Magazine |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175600/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/keira-knightley-james-mcavoy/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In preparation for her role, Knightley watched films from the 1930s and 1940s, such as ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', to study the \"naturalism\" of the performance that Wright wanted in ''Atonement''.<ref name=\"wildaboutmovies1\">{{cite web |title=Behind-the-Scenes of Atonement |url=https://www.wildaboutmovies.com/2008_movies/atonement/ |website=WildAboutMovies.com |access-date=4 January 2008 |archive-date=29 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429162401/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/AtonementMovie-AtonementTrailer-KeiraKnightleyJamesMcAvoy-FocusFeatures-2008AcademyAwar.php |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[James McAvoy]], despite turning down previous offers to work with Wright, nonetheless remained the director's first choice. Producers met several actors for the role of Robbie, but McAvoy was the only one who was offered the part. He fit Wright's bid for someone who \"had the acting ability to take the audience with him on his personal and physical journey.\" McAvoy describes Robbie as one of the most difficult characters he has ever played, \"because he's very straight-ahead.\"<ref name=\"wildaboutmovies1\"/> Further describing his casting process, Wright commented how \"there is something undeniably charming about McAvoy\".<ref name=\"theguardian2007\">{{cite web |last1=Addley |first1=Esther |title=I feel on the edge of failure |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/07/1 |website=The Guardian |date=7 September 2007 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175600/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/07/1 |url-status=live }}</ref> One of the most important qualities that particularly resonated with Wright was \"McAvoy's own working-class roots,\"<ref name=\"theguardian2007\"/> which McAvoy noted was something that Wright was very much interested in. Once Wright put both Knightley and McAvoy together, their \"palpable sexual chemistry\"<ref name=\"wmagazine1\"/> immediately became apparent. The biggest risk Wright took in casting McAvoy was that \"The real question was whether the five-foot-seven, slightly built, ghostly pale Scotsman had what it takes to be a true screen idol.\"<ref name=\"wmagazine1\"/>\n\nCasting the role of Briony Tallis also proved challenging, yet once Wright discovered [[Saoirse Ronan]] her involvement enabled Wright to finally commence filming. On the casting process for the role of Briony, Wright commented how \"We met many, many kids for that role. Then we were sent this tape of this little girl speaking in this perfect 1920s English accent. Immediately, she had this kind of intensity, dynamism, and willfulness.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair1\">{{cite magazine |last1=Sperling |first1=Nicole |title=Director Joe Wright on Discovering Saoirse Ronan and Getting Gary Oldman to Become Churchill |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/joe-wright-darkest-hour-director-interview-on-gary-oldman-saoirse-ronan-and-keira-knightley |magazine=Vanity Fair |date=15 December 2017 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224194128/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/joe-wright-darkest-hour-director-interview-on-gary-oldman-saoirse-ronan-and-keira-knightley |url-status=live }}</ref> After inviting Ronan to come to London to read for the part, Wright was not only surprised by her Irish accent, but immediately recognised her unique acting ability.<ref name=\"vanityfair1\"/> Upon casting Ronan, Wright revealed how completing this final casting decision enabled \"the film to be what it became\" and considered her participation in the film \"lucky.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stolworthy |first1=Jacob |title=Darkest Hour director Joe Wright shares candid thoughts on each of his films: 'I had a breakdown after making Atonement' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/darkest-hour-joe-wright-interview-films-gary-oldman-churchill-hanna-atonement-anna-karenina-saoirse-a8149826.html |website=Independent |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224181100/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/darkest-hour-joe-wright-interview-films-gary-oldman-churchill-hanna-atonement-anna-karenina-saoirse-a8149826.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Abbie Cornish]] was pegged for the role of 18-year-old Briony,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/65039 |title=Atonement begins for Keira Knightley |access-date=31 May 2020 |archive-date=7 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907063405/https://www.cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/65039 |url-status=live }}</ref> but had to back out due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crawleyscastingcalls.com/index.php?option=com_actors&Itemid=56&id=4300&lettre=C |title=All the Actors in Tony Crawley's Casting Calls |access-date=31 May 2020 |archive-date=7 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907063404/http://crawleyscastingcalls.com/index.php?option=com_actors&Itemid=56&id=4300&lettre=C |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Romola Garai]] was cast instead, and was obliged to adapt her performance's physicality to fit the appearance that had already been decided upon for Ronan and Redgrave.
