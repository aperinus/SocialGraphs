When he gets close to Atlantic City, the Porsche breaks down.\n\nWhile Charlie waits for the car to be repaired, a cab driver (who mistakes Charlie for being an Atlantic City high roller) takes him to an undercover [[casino]] that has a bar room and kitchen, so Charlie can get something to eat.\n\nAt the casino, Charlie earns the wrath of Denny Halloran (Alan C. Peterson), who takes exception to Charlie beating him at poker. In the resulting fight, Denny trips over a potted palm, accidentally hits his head on the sharp corner of a counter, and dies.\n\nCharlie is now on the spot, because Denny happens to be the son of a [[Organized crime|mob]] boss named Matt Halloran ([[Ken Pogue]]), who is the owner and [[Despotism|despot]] of the casino and most of the police force, including Chief Travers and Lt. Martins who think Charlie could be innocent.\n\nWrongfully accused of murdering Denny, Charlie finds himself on the run from both dirty cops and Matt's henchmen, all of whom want to collect the $50,000 bounty that Matt placed on Charlie. With only one ally, reluctant witness Karen Landers ([[Kelly Preston]]) who knows the truth and agrees to aid Charlie, Charlie finds himself in a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\nThe bodies pile up as Charlie dodges flying bullets and bowling pins, explosions from numerous assault weapons and miscellaneous shrapnel and twisted auto parts as he is pursued on a nightmare race through racetracks, amusement parks, bowling alleys and shopping malls by Matt's men, corrupt cops and Travers and Martins.\n\nAfter Karen is wounded and two dirty cops die chasing him Charlie surrenders himself to Travers and Martins but they are pursued by two of Matt's men, Sammy and Marv, and run off the road, Travers is killed and Martins is injured. Sammy and Marv take Charlie to Matt who tells them to kill Charlie, however, he kills Marv then Sammy by causing them to fall off of a roof. After killing Matt's other henchmen, Charlie and Matt confront each other at Matt's dog-race track. Matt dies as he is impaled by a mechanical pacer rabbit that was speeding toward him. Martins arrives after this and tells Charlie that \"they sure fooled with the wrong guy\", before placing a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Charlie Farrow\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Karen Landers\n* [[Ken Pogue]] as Matt Halloran\n* A.C.

We pose the question, `What would happen to me if I were caught up something in which I was an outsider, where all due process fell away and I were left alone?' \"<ref>Director keeps his roots; Run a new experience for Australian film-maker: [Final Edition]\nMARC HORTON Journal Staff Writer.
