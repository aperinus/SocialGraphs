The film's two leads are [[John Krasinski]] and [[Maya Rudolph]]. It is Mendes's first film without [[Thomas Newman]]'s collaboration.\n\n==Plot==\nVerona De Tessant ([[Maya Rudolph]]) and Burt Farlander ([[John Krasinski]]), are in their early thirties in the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] area and struggling to meet daily needs and build fulfilling lives. Learning they will soon become parents, they are confronted with the challenge of how \u2013 and where \u2013 to raise a child and build a happy family.\n\nSix months into Verona's pregnancy, they visit their only family in the area, Burt's parents, Gloria and Jerry ([[Catherine O'Hara]] and [[Jeff Daniels]]), only to find that they have decided to move to [[Antwerp]], Belgium, a month before the baby is due. They will be gone for two years and they have already rented their place to another couple, despite Burt's and Verona's situation. Frustrated with their selfishness and careless attitude, Burt and Verona decide this is an opportunity to find somewhere else to raise their family, as they both can work from home and live wherever they choose.\n\nThey first visit [[Phoenix, Arizona]], to see Verona's old boss, Lily ([[Allison Janney]]), her husband, Lowell ([[Jim Gaffigan]]), and their two children. Burt in particular is disturbed by Lily and Lowell's crass and mean-spirited behavior toward one another and their children.\n\nBurt and Verona next visit Verona's sister, Grace ([[Carmen Ejogo]]), in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. Verona urges Burt to try to persuade Grace to stay with her boring boyfriend. When Burt takes a call and displays his trademark humor, Grace tells Verona that she is lucky to have him and Verona agrees.\n\nThey next visit Burt's childhood friend and pseudo-cousin in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], \"LN\" (pronounced \"ellen\") ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a college professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] with inherited money and radical views about parenting. They bring a stroller as a gift, greatly angering LN as she and her husband Roderick's ([[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]) is a \"[[Continuum concept|continuum home]].\"<ref>The couple describe the continuum movement as fighting against the world's tendency to separate parents from their children; they recite the movement's mantra as \"the 3 S: No separation, no sugar, no strollers.\"</ref> When Roderick's condescension and LN's backhanded compliments to Verona get to be too much for Burt, he tells them they are horrible people and he and Verona leave but not before taking their son on a wild stroller ride through the house (which he enjoys).\n\nBurt and Verona then visit old college friends in [[Montreal]], Tom ([[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]]) and his wife, Munch Garnett ([[Melanie Lynskey]]), and their diverse family of adopted children. Verona and Burt are happy to have found a loving family and a nice town, deciding to move to Montreal. When they all go to dinner, Burt admits he has proposed to Verona many times, but she always refuses (this stems from anguish over her dead parents' inevitable absence from the wedding). After dinner, Tom tells Burt that Munch has recently suffered her fifth [[miscarriage]] and that they seem unable to have biological children.\n\nIn the morning, Burt receives an emergency call from his brother, Courtney ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), in [[Miami]], whose wife has left him. Burt and Verona fly to Miami, where Courtney worries about his young daughter and the potential effects of a divorce on her. Burt tries to comfort Courtney while Verona spends time with his daughter. Burt and Verona spend the night outside on a trampoline, promising to love each other and their daughter and have a happy home.\n\nThe next day, Verona tells Burt a story about her childhood house and her parents (who were both killed in a [[car crash]] when she was 22). Moved by her memory, they decide to settle in Verona's old family home on the [[Florida Panhandle]]. Realizing it is the place for them, they sit together happily, overlooking the water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Burt Farlander\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Verona De Tessant\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Grace De Tessant\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Jerry Farlander\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Gloria Farlander\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Lily\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as Lowell\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as LN\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as Roderick\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Munch Garnett\n* [[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]] as Tom Garnett\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Courtney Farlander\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Release ==\n''Away We Go'' had a limited theater release in the United States starting June 25, 2009.
