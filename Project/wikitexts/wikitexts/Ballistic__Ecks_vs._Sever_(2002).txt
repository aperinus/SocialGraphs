The film stars [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Lucy Liu]] as opposing secret agents who team up to fight a common enemy. It is an [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] among Canada, Germany and the United States.\n\n''Ballistic'' was universally panned by critics and has been frequently described as one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002)|worst films ever made]]. Grossing just $20 million against a $70 million budget, the film was also a [[box-office bomb]]. With a total of 119 reviews, the most for a film with a [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|0% approval rating]], ''Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'' is the worst-reviewed film in the history of [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nReturning home with his mother Vinn from a trip to [[Berlin]], Michael Gant, the son of [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) director Robert Gant, is kidnapped and his security detail is wiped out by the attacker, ex-DIA agent Sever. FBI agent Jeremiah Ecks left the agency after his wife Rayne was killed in a car bombing. His old boss, Julio Martin, asks him to investigate the Gant case. He claims that Rayne is still alive and he will give Ecks the information on her whereabouts if he helps take down Sever. Ecks agrees and discovers Sever is an orphaned Chinese girl the DIA adopted to train as a covert operative and assassin with \"no fear, no conscience, and no morality.\" Meanwhile, Robert Gant executes the only survivor of his son's security detail. He then orders his elite agents, led by A. J. Ross, to pursue Sever and rescue Michael.\n\nEcks joins Martin and [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]] agent Harry Lee in Vancouver, where Sever is hiding out. Ecks learns that Gant stole an experimental weapon codenamed Softkill, a [[Nanorobotics|nanorobot]] which operates in the [[Circulatory system|human circulatory system]] and can cause [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] at will. Gant had implanted Softkill in Michael in order to smuggle it into the United States. Ross and his men surround Sever in a shopping plaza, but she wipes out Ross's forces in a lengthy gun battle. Sever shoots Martin, and Ecks pursues Sever, climaxing with a fight that's cut off when Ross starts shooting at them with an [[M60 machine gun]], giving Sever a chance to escape.\n\nEcks is arrested by the [[Vancouver Police Department]] under the false pretense that he killed Martin. While being transported to jail, his convoy is attacked by Sever, who frees Ecks. After a lengthy car chase, Sever throws a piece of paper at Ecks and tells him to ask Gant about his wife. Ecks meets Rayne at an aquarium and it's revealed that her \"death\" was orchestrated by Gant. Rayne ended up believing Ecks had died while he thought she was gone. Rayne then married Gant under the name Vinn. It ends up that Gant had Sever's family killed; it was initially believed that kidnapping Michael was Sever's revenge. However, Rayne reveals that Michael is actually Ecks' son, and Sever's kidnapping was for his protection.\n\nEcks, Rayne, and Sever go to Sever's underground bunker in an abandoned trainyard, where Rayne is reunited with Michael. Gant and Ross arrive with an army of heavily-armed DIA agents, and a massive battle ensues. Ecks and Sever eventually gain the upper hand, and Sever kills Ross in a fight in the bunker. Gant tries to retrieve the Softkill in Michael's arm but is surprised to find it's not there. Sever kills Gant using a Softkill-loaded bullet and escapes as the police arrive. The film concludes with Ecks and Sever looking over the sea and Ecks thanking Sever for reuniting him with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as FBI Agent Jeremiah Ecks\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as DIA Agent Sever\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as FBI Agent Clark / DIA Director Robert Gant\n* [[Ray Park]] as DIA Agent A.J.

McElroy]] wrote a spec script titled ''Legion'', which McElroy said was an action thriller about ex L.A. cop who's called in to help track down a rogue CIA agent code-named Legion who went on a killing spree. After he and director [[Dwight H. Little]] made ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), the next movie they wanted to do was ''Legion'', which by then was re-titled into ''Gunner'', the name of the main hero character in the script. Between 1988 and 1989 they worked on the project at [[Vestron Pictures]], and [[Dolph Lundgren]] was going to star in the film, however, due to management changes in Vestron, producer [[Charles W. Fries]] stopped the development of the film. McElroy's script was left unproduced until about 1999 when it was picked up for production again, but this time with the new title, ''Ecks vs. Sever''. Originally the film was intended to star [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Jet Li]], and then after them [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Vin Diesel]] were going to star. After the director and cast were finally chosen in pre-production, McElroy's script was completely re-written by [[Peter M. Lenkov]]. The main reasons for re-writes included way too big and expensive action sequences, a wish for a more serious, darker, and grittier tone, and the story of McElroy's original script focusing more on themes of family love and loss and revenge. The entire subplot about nanotechnology was one of the things which were added to make the film more like ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). Sever was also changed from a male to a female character. Despite re-writing the entire script, Lenkov was not credited in the final film, and McElroy ended up getting only writing credit, despite very little similarities between his original script and Lenkov's re-write.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dolph-ultimate.com/dolph-in/legion3.html|title=DOLPH :: Legion / Gunner}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mosquito.net/dolphforum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2179|title=Ultimate Dolph \u2022 View topic - LEGION / GUNNER (Dwight H.
