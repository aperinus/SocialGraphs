Directed by Roy William Neill, it stars [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Dr. Watson]], with [[Hillary Brooke]] as the woman of the title and [[Henry Daniell]] as [[Professor Moriarty]]. The film follows an original premise with material taken from \"[[The Final Problem]]\" (1893) and \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\" (1903).<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyles|first=Alan|title=Sherlock Holmes: A Centenary Celebration |url=https://archive.org/details/sherlockholmesce0000eyle|url-access=registration|year=1986 |publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherlockholmesce0000eyle/page/96 96-97] |ISBN=0-06-015620-1 }}</ref>\n\nThis was [[Hillary Brooke]]'s third of three different roles in the [[Basil Rathbone]] ''Sherlock Holmes'' films, after ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes Faces Death]]'' (1943).<ref name=\"barnes\">{{cite book |last=Barnes|first=Alan|author-link=Alan Barnes (writer) |title=Sherlock Holmes on Screen |year=2002 |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd |pages=228 |ISBN=1-903111-04-8 }}</ref> Series regular [[Dennis Hoey]]'s [[Inspector Lestrade]] was replaced with [[Matthew Boulton (actor)|Matthew Boulton]] as [[Inspector Gregson]].<ref name=\"barnes\"/> This was [[Henry Daniell]]'s third of three different roles in the Rathbone ''Sherlock Holmes'' works, following the aforementioned ''...

Widower Sir George Fenwick ([[Paul Cavanagh]]), after a romantic night at the apartment of Lydia Marlowe ([[Hillary Brooke]]), is hypnotized into believing that he is responsible for the crimes. He is certain that he is guilty after he awakes from a stupor and finds a woman's forefinger in his pocket. His daughter comes to Holmes and Watson without realizing that [[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]]'s henchman is following her. She tells Holmes and Watson that she found her father burying a forefinger under a pile of soil. She has dug up the forefinger and shows it to them.\n\nFenwick is then found dead, obviously murdered by someone to keep him from talking. Holmes theorizes that Moriarty, who was supposed to have been hanged in [[Montevideo]], is alive and responsible for the crimes. Watson is then called to help a woman who fell over while feeding her pet bird. He leaves, and minutes later, Moriarty appears and explains that he faked the phone call so he could talk to Holmes. When Moriarty leaves, Watson returns. Holmes explains what Moriarty did, notices that a window shade that was shut in the empty house across the street is now open, and tells Watson to investigate.\n\nInside the empty house Watson, looking through the window, believes that he sees a sniper shoot Holmes in his apartment. Holmes then appears at the house and explains that he put a bust of [[Julius Caesar]] there because of the bust's resemblance to his own face (Holmes realized that as soon as he sat there, Moriarty would have him killed). Inspector Gregson takes the sniper, a hypnotized ex-soldier, away, but the sniper is kidnapped and later killed on Holmes's doorstep.\n\nHolmes now realizes that Moriarty's plan involves:\n:1) killing women and cutting off their forefingers,\n:2) making rich, single men believe they have committed the crime,\n:3) using this fake information to blackmail them, and\n:4) counting on the victims being too terrified to expose the scheme.\n\nHe befriends Lydia, whom he had seen with Sir George at a restaurant, suspecting that she is in cahoots with Moriarty. She takes him to her house, where he is apparently hypnotized. Moriarty enters and has one of his men cut Holmes with a knife to verify that he is hypnotized. He then tells Holmes to write a suicide note (which he does), walk out of Lydia's apartment onto the ledge, and jump to his death.\n\nWatson and the police then appear and grab the criminals. Holmes then reveals he was never really hypnotized, but secretly ingested a drug to make him appear as if he had been hypnotized and also insensitive to pain. Moriarty then escapes from the hold of a policeman and jumps from the top of Lydia's house to another building. However, he hangs onto a pipe which becomes loose from the building, causing him to fall to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Woman in Green (1945).webm|thumb|175px|thumbtime=37|upright=1.5|''The Woman in Green'']]\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n* [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Doctor Watson]]\n* [[Hillary Brooke]] as Lydia Marlowe\n* [[Henry Daniell]] as [[Professor Moriarty]] (\"Moriarity\" in closing credits)\n* [[Paul Cavanagh]] as Sir George Fenwick\n* [[Matthew Boulton (actor)|Matthew Boulton]] as [[Inspector Gregson]]\n* Eve Amber as Maude Fenwick\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] as Doctor Onslow \n* Tom Bryson as Corporal Williams\n* Sally Shepherd as Crandon, Marlowe's maid\n* [[Mary Gordon (actor)|Mary Gordon]] as [[Mrs. Hudson]]\n* Percival Vivian as Dr. Simnell (uncredited)\n* [[Fred Aldrich]] as Detective (uncredited) \n* Leslie Denison as Vincent (uncredited) \n* [[Olaf Hytten]] as Norris (uncredited)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hypnosis in popular culture#Film|Hypnosis in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0038259}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|TWIG1945}}\n* {{Amg movie|55070}}\n* {{tcmdb title|19192}}\n* {{AFI film|24664}}\n{{ external media\n|align  = right\n|width  = \n|video1 = [http://www.tcm.com/video/videoPlayer/?cid=75366&titleId=19192 ''The Woman in Green'' Trailer at TCM Movie Database]\n}}\n\n{{Sherlock Holmes screen adaptations}}\n{{Roy William Neill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Woman In Green, The}}\n[[Category:1945 films]]\n[[Category:1945 mystery films]]\n[[Category:American detective films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes films based on works by Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about hypnosis]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roy William Neill]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
