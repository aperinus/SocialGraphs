However, she is secretly a serial killer, murdering those who she perceives to slight her and her family or fail to live up to her moral standards.\n\nDuring breakfast, Detectives Pike and Gracey question the family about the vulgar harassment of their neighbor, Dottie Hinkle. Beverly is later revealed to be the perpetrator, retaliating against Dottie for having taken a parking space from her. At a [[Parent\u2013teacher association|PTA]] meeting, math teacher Paul Stubbins criticizes Chip's interest in horror films, believing that Beverly's parenting is adversely affecting his mental health. Subsequently, Beverly runs over Stubbins with her car, killing him; [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] LuAnn Hodges witnesses the murder. The following day, Misty is upset when Carl Pageant stands her up for a date. Beverly spots Carl with another girl at a [[Flea market|swap meet]] and fatally stabs him with a [[fire iron]].\n\nAt Gracey's suggestion, Eugene discovers Beverly's serial killer memorabilia beneath their mattress, which includes recordings from [[Ted Bundy]] on the week of his execution. That evening at dinner, Chip tells the family about his friend Scotty's suspicions. Beverly departs at that point; fearing for Scotty's life, the others head for his house. Unbeknownst to them, Beverly intends to kill Ralph and Betty Sterner for calling Eugene to treat the former's toothache on a day Eugene and Beverly planned to spend birdwatching, eating chicken, and critiquing Eugene's requests for perfect dental health. She stabs Betty with scissors borrowed from Rosemary Ackerman and pushes an air conditioner from their window onto Ralph. Meanwhile, the rest of the family and the police arrive at Scotty's house, only to find him masturbating to an erotic film.\n\nOn Sunday, police follow the Sutphins to church as Beverly is named as the prime suspect in the Sterners' murders. The service abruptly ends when everyone flees in panic after Beverly sneezes, during which she escapes as police attempt to arrest her. She hides at the video store where Chip is employed; Emmy Lou Jenson, a customer, argues with Chip over being fined for failing to rewind a videotape, calling him a \"son of a [[Psychopathy|psycho]]\". Beverly follows Jenson home and [[Lamb to the Slaughter|fatally strikes her]] with a leg of lamb as she watches ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]''. Scotty witnesses the attack nearby; Beverly spots him and pursues him after [[carjacking]] a passerby. Ending up at [[Hammerjack's]], Beverly immolates Scotty during a live performance. The Sutphin family arrive as Beverly is arrested.\n\nBeverly's trial becomes a media sensation; she is dubbed \"Serial Mom\", and both Chip and Misty profit off of her notoriety. During the opening arguments, Beverly's lawyer claims that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, but is promptly dismissed. Representing herself, Beverly systematically discredits every witness against her by exploiting their own vices, while Hodges is too high to provide credible testimony. During Pike's testimony, the courtroom is distracted by the arrival of [[Suzanne Somers]], who is cast as Beverly in a television film.\n\nBeverly is acquitted of all charges. Throughout the trial, Beverly expresses contempt at a particular juror for [[Labor Day#Unofficial end of summer|wearing white shoes after Labor Day]]. Beverly follows her to a payphone and fatally strikes her with the receiver. Before realizing the truth, Somers angers Beverly into an outburst attempting to pose for a [[photo op]]. The juror's body is then discovered.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Beverly Sutphin\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as Eugene Sutphin\n* [[Ricki Lake]] as Misty Sutphin\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Chip Sutphin\n* Scott Wesley Morgan as Detective Pike\n* [[Walt MacPherson]] as Detective Gracey\n* Patricia Dunnock as \"Birdie\"\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Dottie Hinkle\n* [[Mary Jo Catlett]] as Rosemary Ackerman\n* [[Justin Whalin]] as Scotty Barnhill\n* [[James C.
