The film stars [[George Clooney]] (who also co-produced), [[Julia Roberts]], [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]], [[Dominic West]], [[Caitr\u00edona Balfe]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]]. It follows financial [[Television presenter|television host]] Lee Gates and his producer Patty Fenn, as they are put in an extreme situation when an irate [[investor]] takes them and their crew as [[hostage]].\n\n''Money Monster'' had its world premiere at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival|69th Cannes Film Festival]] on May 12, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on May 13, 2016, by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing over $93 million.<ref name=\"Mojo\" /><ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/money-monster |title=Money Monster reviews |website=Metacritic |access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref><!-- Per WP:LEAD, the lead must summarize all parts of the article.

Do not remove.-->\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nFlamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, ''Money Monster''. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview about the crash, but he unexpectedly left for a business trip to [[Geneva]], Switzerland.\n\nMidway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000\u2014his entire life savings\u2014in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on the show. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver\u2014and with it, Kyle's leverage\u2014is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.\n\nWith the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and find Camby for him, though Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in [[Seoul]], Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it.\n\nLee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.\n\nOnce Camby finally returns, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to [[Johannesburg]]. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the ''Money Monster'' team contact a group of [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] to seek the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, but just clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.\n\nCamby had bribed a [[South Africa]]n miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. If his plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company.\n\nDespite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then, much to Lee's dismay, [[Suicide by cop|gets fatally shot by the police]]. Lee punches Camby with anger and disgust as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] announces that IBIS will be put under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].\n\nIn the final scene, Patty and Lee make peace, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Lee Gates\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Patty Fenn\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Kyle Budwell\n* [[Dominic West]] as Walt Camby\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as Diane Lester\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Captain Marcus Powell\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Ron Sprecher\n* [[Lenny Venito]] as Lenny, The Cameraman\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Lieutenant Nelson\n* [[Dennis Boutsikaris]] as Avery, Goodloe CFO\n* [[Emily Meade]] as Molly\n* Makhaola Ndebele as Moshe Mambo\n* [[Condola Rash\u0101d]] as Bree, The Assistant\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Won Joon\n* [[Olivia Luccardi]] as Arlene\n* [[Anthony DeSando]] as Officer Benson\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as A Team Leader\n* [[Grant Rosenmeyer]] as Dave\n* [[Greta Lee]] as Amy\n* Laura Meakin as Wall Street Woman\n* [[Cenk Uygur]] as Himself<ref>WORTHINGTON, Clint, \"[http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/film-review-money-monster/ Film Review: Money Monster]\" ''Consequences of Sound''.
