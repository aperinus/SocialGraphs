It marked the [[directorial debut]] of Rock, who had previously worked as a writer, producer, and actor.\n\nThe film's title refers to one of the key functions of the President of the United States, as the American [[head of state]]. This was the last film by cinematographer [[Donald E. Thorin]], who died in 2016, having not worked on a film in thirteen years.\n\n==Plot==\nMays Gilliam is the [[alderman]] for the 9th Ward in [[Washington, D.C.]] After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is unexpectedly chosen as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[candidate]] for the 2004 presidential election after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice-president Brian Lewis, the Democrats decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the 2008 presidential election.\n\nAt first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to damage his reputation. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother Mitch persuades him to speak out for what he believes in. He ditches the bland, boring, and uncontroversial speeches prepared for him and begins to talk honestly about major issues such as welfare, healthcare, income inequality, and society overall.\n\nAfter Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was \"kissing\" his opponent (taken from [[Bugs Bunny]]\u2013[[Elmer Fudd]] cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of [[Osama bin Laden]] saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls.\n\nAs election day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (despite them having reconciled with him afterwards), and [[nepotism|chooses his brother as his running mate]]. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the presidency, and proposes to Lisa by saying he wants to make her his [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Rock]] as Mays Gilliam, alderman, reluctant Presidential candidate and later President of the United States.\n*[[Bernie Mac]] as Mitch Gilliam, elder brother of Mays, Vice Presidential candidate and later Vice President of the United States.\n*[[Dylan Baker]] as Martin Geller\n*[[Nick Searcy]] as Brian Lewis, incumbent Vice President of the United States and Presidential candidate.\n*[[Lynn Whitfield]] as Debra Lassiter\n*[[Robin Givens]] as Kim, the psychotic ex-girlfriend of Mays who tries to win him back after his nomination but is taken away by security. \n*[[Tamala Jones]] as Lisa Clark\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Senator Bill Arnot\n*[[Keith David]] as Bernard Cooper\n*[[Stephanie March]] as Nikki, executive director of Internal Liaison\n*[[Jeremy Borash]] as Wrestling announcer\n*[[Ron Killings]] as Himself\n*[[Nate Dogg]] as Himself\n*[[Tracy Morgan]] as Meat Hustler\n*[[The Harris Brothers|Ron Harris]] as Wrestler (''uncredited'')\n*[[Jeff Jarrett]] as Himself\n*[[Road Dogg|B. G. James]] as Himself\n\n==Inspiration==\nRock said in ''[[HBO]] First Look'' that he got the idea from the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee [[Walter Mondale]], who chose [[Geraldine Ferraro]]\u2014a woman\u2014as his running mate. The Democrats knew they had little chance of defeating [[Ronald Reagan]], but selected Ferraro in hopes of gaining female support.\n\nIn one scene, Gilliam quotes \"[[The Roof Is on Fire]]\" by [[Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three]].\n\nAccording to the DVD audio commentary, the scene where Gilliam sings \"[[Deep in the Heart of Texas]]\" is a reference to ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', where [[Pee-Wee Herman]] does the same thing.\n\nPart of the presidential debate is a verbatim repeat of Monty Python's [[Argument Clinic]].\n\n==Cameos==\n* The [[ceremonial first pitch]] scene was filmed prior to a [[Baltimore Orioles]]\u2013[[Toronto Blue Jays]] game at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Camden Yards]] on August 24, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20020821&content_id=109247&vkey=pr_bal&fext=.jsp&c_id=bal|title=Chris Rock movie scene to be filmed Saturday night before the game|website=Baltimore Orioles}}</ref>\n* In the scene where Gilliam makes an appearance for [[Impact Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]], [[Road Dogg|B.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film maintains a score of 30% approval rating from critics, with the critical consensus reading, \"''Head of State'' squanders its potentially ripe premise with watered-down satire and formulaic gags.\" On [[Metacritic]], the film maintains a score of 44/100.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], writing for ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the film 3/4 stars, writing that it's \"an imperfect movie, but not a boring one and not lacking in intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/head-of-state-2003|title=Head of State Movie Review & Film Summary (2003) \u2013 Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.headofstate-themovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0325537|title=Head of State}}\n* {{amg title|id=276231|title=Head of State}}\n* {{mojo title|id=headofstate|title=Head of State}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|head_of_state}}\n\n{{Chris Rock}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2000s political comedy films]]\n[[Category:American political comedy films]]\n[[Category:American political satire films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy films]]\n[[Category:2003 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about elections]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Rock]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Dakota]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Rock]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Chris Rock]]\n[[Category:3 Arts Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ali LeRoi]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ali LeRoi]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
