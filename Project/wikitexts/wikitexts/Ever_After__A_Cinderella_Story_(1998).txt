[[Andy Tennant]] directed it, and it stars [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Dougray Scott]], and [[Jeanne Moreau]]. Tennant, [[Susannah Grant]], and Rick Parks wrote the screenplay. [[George Fenton]] composed the original music score. The film's closing theme song, \"[[Put Your Arms Around Me (Texas song)|Put Your Arms Around Me]]\", is performed by the rock band [[Texas (band)|Texas]].\n\nThe film removes the Cinderella tale's usual [[pantomime]] and comic/supernatural elements and instead treats the story as [[historical fiction]], set in [[Renaissance]]-era France. It is often seen as a modern, [[Third-wave feminism|post-feminist]] interpretation of the Cinderella story.<ref name=\"feminism\">{{cite book  | editor-last = Haase  | editor-first = Donald  |title = Fairy Tales and Feminism: New Approaches  | publisher = Wayne State University Press  | year = 2004  | isbn = 0-8143-3030-4}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[File:Lascapigliata.jpg|thumb|260x260px|The [[Leonardo da Vinci]] portrait ''[[Head of a Woman (Leonardo)|Head of a Woman]]'' (c. 1508) is portrayed in the film as a depiction of Danielle]] \nIn 19th century [[France]], the [[Brothers Grimm]] answer a summons from the Grand Dame at which she expresses her disappointment in their fantastic story of [[Cinderella]]. She produces a glass slipper and recounts Cinderella\u2019s actual story.\n\nIn [[French Renaissance|Renaissance-era]] France, eight-year old Danielle is the daughter of widower Auguste De Barbarac, a wealthy merchant who owns a manor in the country. Auguste returns home with his new wife, Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent, and her two daughters from her previous marriage, Marguerite and Jacqueline. A fortnight later, Auguste dies of a [[heart attack]]. In his final moments, he turns away from Rodmilla to tell his daughter that he loves her.\n\nTen years later, the manor is in debt due to Rodmilla\u2019s overspending on herself and her daughters. Danielle is now a servant in her late father's home and encounters the prince one morning as he is attempting to flee his royal responsibilities and see the world before his arranged wedding to Princess Gabriella of [[Spain]]. He gives Danielle some gold coins to keep their interlude secret and rides away, but is eventually caught by the Royal Guard after stopping a band of [[gypsies]] from robbing [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who King [[Francis I of France|Francis]] has invited to be the French Court's artist in residence.\n\nDanielle, dressed as a noblewoman, takes the gold coins to the palace to buy back a family servant who Rodmilla sold. Henry witnesses Danielle arguing with a slave holder and, impressed by her passionate argument, in which she quotes [[Thomas More]], orders the servant released. Henry, captivated by her intelligence, eagerly asks for her name. Danielle lies and gives her mother\u2019s name: Comtesse Nicole De Lancret.\n\nLater that night, King Francis strikes a deal with Henry: he will hold a masquerade ball at which Henry will announce his engagement to the woman of his choosing or else marry Princess Gabriella. Hearing this news, Rodmilla accelerates her efforts at getting Henry to notice Marguerite and is increasingly cruel to Jacqueline.\n\nHenry takes Danielle to visit a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] [[monastery]], where she confides in Henry about gaining a love of books from her late father and he admits that he envies her passion and strong convictions. On their way home, the gypsies accost them, but, amused by Danielle's confidence and strength of character, take them to their camp, where Henry and Danielle share their first kiss.\n\nThe next day, Danielle is exhausted and stands up to her stepmother. Rodmilla retaliates by giving Marguerite an exquisite gown and shoes that had been left to Danielle by her mother. Danielle confronts them, then attacks Marguerite for insulting her mother's memory. Marguerite then destroys Danielle\u2019s copy of ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', the last book Auguste gave her before he died. After Rodmilla has Danielle whipped, Jacqueline treats her wounds, expressing sympathy for Danielle and criticizing Marguerite for her cruelty.\n\nA despondent Danielle tries to tell Henry the truth, but her resolve melts when he tells her she has changed him as a man, inspiring him to build a [[university]]. They kiss passionately, but Danielle runs away.\n\nRodmilla deduces that Henry has been romancing Danielle and tells the Queen that she is engaged. She confronts Danielle about her deception and the whereabouts of her mother\u2019s dress and shoes, which have vanished. When she angrily refuses to produce the gown and shoes, Rodmilla locks her in the house\u2019s pantry. Da Vinci helps Danielle to escape and the manor's servants, who are loyal to Danielle, reveal that they had hidden the dress and shoes. Danielle arrives at the ball determined to tell Henry the truth, but Rodmilla exposes her before she can and, furious at her dishonesty, Henry rejects her. As Danielle tearfully runs out of the castle, she leaves a glass slipper behind. Da Vinci gives it to Henry and reprimands him.\n\nHenry agrees to marry the Princess of Spain, but calls it off when he realizes she too loves someone else. Jacqueline tells Henry that Rodmilla sold Danielle to the lecherous Pierre Le Pieu and he and Captain Laurent set off to rescue her, only to find that she has freed herself. Henry apologizes, professes his love for her and proposes marriage by slipping the glass slipper on her foot. Danielle happily accepts.\n\nRodmilla is summoned by King Francis inquiring if she lied to Queen Marie about Danielle. Queen Marie has Rodmilla stripped of her title and will have her and Marguerite banished to the Americas unless someone speaks for her. Danielle, now a princess, appears and vows to never think of Rodmilla again before asking the King and Queen to bestow on her the same \"kindness\" Rodmilla showed her.\n\nRodmilla and Marguerite are made to work as laundry servants, while Jacqueline is spared from punishment as she has always been kind to Danielle. As a wedding gift, Leonardo gives the royal newlyweds a painting of Danielle that resembles ''[[Head of a Woman (Leonardo)|Head of a Woman]]''.\n\nThe Grande Dame tells the Brothers Grimm that her great-great grandmother's portrait hung in Henry's university until the [[French Revolution]]. She concludes by telling them while Danielle and Henry, reals Cinderella and Prince Charming, did live happily ever after, the point is that they really lived (existed).\n\n==Historical context==\nWhile the story is fictional, it involves several historical figures, places and events. The film is set in the 16th and 19th centuries and features [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], King Henry (later [[Henry II of France]]), [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Brothers Grimm|The Brothers Grimm]], as well as allusions to the explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], the fairy tale collector [[Charles Perrault]], the [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonies in the New World]], and the [[French Revolution]].<ref>''Ever After'' (1998) the movie</ref>\n\nThough the main portion of the film takes place in early 1500s France,<ref name=\"Ever After: A Cinderella Story\">{{cite book |last1=Loggia |first1=Wendy |title=Ever After: A Cinderella Story |date=1998 |publisher=Dell |isbn=0440228158 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98rqUnHW61sC |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref> the royals shown are most likely not meant to be the historical figures for which they are named. King Francis I summoned Leonardo da Vinci to his court around 1516, three years before King Henry II was born; neither of King Francis I's wives was named Marie (the first was named [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany|Claude]] and the second [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]]). King Henry II was married to [[Catherine de' Medici]] at the age of 14 and had no known children with [[Diane de Poitiers]], a French noblewoman of great influence and the historical figure most likely represented by Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as [[Cinderella|Danielle de Barbarac]], the only child of the deceased Auguste de Barbarac and Nicole de Lancret\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Prince Henry of France \n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, Danielle\u2019s evil stepmother \n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as Grande Dame\n* [[Megan Dodds]] as Marguerite de Ghent\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Jacqueline de Ghent\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\n* [[Lee Ingleby]] as Gustave\n* [[Richard O'Brien]] as Monsieur Pierre Le Pieu\n* [[Timothy West]] as [[Francis I of France|King Francis]], Henry\u2019s father.\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] as Queen Marie, Henry\u2019s mother.\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Auguste de Barbarac\n* [[Peter Gunn (actor)|Peter Gunn]] as Captain Laurent\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Royal Page\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Ever After'' was filmed in [[Super 35]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clark |first=Jason |title=Ever After - Review |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/ever-after-a-cinderella-story-v163072/review |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=[[AllMovie]]}}</ref>\n\n===Locations and sets===\nThe castle shown in the film is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Hautefort]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of France.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hodges |first=Christopher |date=2018-08-31 |title=20 Crazy Details Behind The Making Of Ever After |url=https://screenrant.com/every-after-cinderella-movie-behind-scenes-making-trivia-details/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=[[ScreenRant]] |language=en-US}}</ref> Other featured ch\u00e2teaux are [[Ch\u00e2teau de F\u00e9nelon|de F\u00e9nelon]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Losse|de Losse]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Lanquais|de Lanquais]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Beynac|de Beynac]] as well as the city of [[Sarlat-la-Can\u00e9da]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ever After: A Cinderella Story tour {{!}} Decouvertes |url=http://decouvertes.fr/content/ever-after-cinderella-story-tour |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=decouvertes.fr}}</ref> The painting of Danielle is based on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Head of a Woman (Leonardo)|Head of a Woman]]'' (La Scapigliata).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kwan |first=Jamie |date=2021-02-10 |title=What do Leonardo da Vinci and Drew Barrymore have in common?
