The film was released on October 30, 2015, by [[The Weinstein Company]]. The film was not well-received by critics and grossed $36.6 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2022}}\nAdam Jones was the chef at a high-class [[Paris]]ian restaurant owned by his mentor Jean-Luc, until his drug use and temperamental behavior destroyed his career and the restaurant. In the aftermath, Adam went into self-imposed exile in [[New Orleans]] by shucking a million oysters to sober up, planning to head to [[London]] to restart his career and attempt to earn a third [[Michelin Guide#Stars|Michelin star]].\n\nIn London, Adam searches for old colleagues, beginning with his mentor's former [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]], Tony Balerdi, now a hotel manager of The Langham Hotel in London, under the ownership of the Balerdi family. Adam checks into one of The Langham's rooms then visits an old friend, Conti, and notes the talent of his [[Sous chef|sous-chef]] Helene, but she dislikes his arrogance and dismisses him immediately. A Paris colleague, Michel, whose restaurant Adam had sabotaged out of jealousy, tracks him down. After a brief fistfight, they talk and Michel forgives Adam then asks to work for him. Adam also visits a cutting-edge eatery run by Reece, with whom he has a long-standing rivalry, and the visit ends poorly. Adam's former drug dealer realizes he has returned to Europe and attempts to collect Adam's outstanding debt.\n\nAdam convinces famed restaurant critic Simone to dine at Tony's hotel. Tony realizes that Adam set this up and is reluctant to let him cook, but his kitchen is in such poor condition it would result in Simone shutting his restaurant down. Seeing no other way, he allows Adam to cook. Simone's favorable review convinces Tony to renovate the hotel's kitchen and hire Adam as head chef permanently. He stipulates that Adam must submit to weekly drug tests with Tony's psychiatrist Dr. Rosshilde. Adam agrees to the tests, although he is uninterested in therapy and throws himself into preparations for the grand opening. Another old friend, Max, joins Adam's team after being released from prison. Helene rebuffs further job offers until Conti fires her and sends her to Adam's kitchen. Helene is irate about being fired, but Adam convinces her to work for him by tripling her salary.\n\nOpening night is a disaster, and Adam furiously closes early, blaming Helene. He publicly humiliates her, escalating from verbal to physical aggression, and she quits. Adam goes on a talk show that he previously turned down to drum up publicity for the restaurant. At his second opening, a restaurant critic gives a positive review, enraging Reece. Tony convinces Helene to return with a doubled salary and some insight about Adam's behavior. Adam improves his attitude, but refuses her request for time off for her daughter Lily's birthday. Later, he notices his kitchen acting in a strange manner. Helene reveals that her daughter is at the restaurant under Tony's supervision, since she did not want to spend her birthday at home. Adam is upset, but relents and bakes Lily a birthday cake, which impresses Helene.\n\nWith the restaurant's reputation established, Adam sets his sights on three Michelin stars, still avoiding his drug dealer, even after Tony offers to pay off his debt. Adam takes Helene to the reopening of Reece's restaurant. Adam and Reece are civil, but the night derails when Adam spots his ex-girlfriend Anne Marie, the daughter of Jean-Luc. Adam finds Anne Marie surprisingly forgiving after he abandoned her in Paris and missed her father's funeral. The encounter leaves Adam shaken and introspective about his failure in Paris. Early the next morning, Helene finds him at the fish market where they kiss in the alley behind The Langham on the way back to the restaurant. They are interrupted by the drug dealer's thugs, who take Adam away. He returns that night during dinner service beaten and bruised.\n\nKaitlin, the front of house host, advises Tony that two Michelin reviewers have arrived, and he cooks for them rather than going to the hospital. They send their meals back as it's too spicy, and Michel reveals he sabotaged the sauce with cayenne pepper as revenge for Adam's past cruelty before walking out. On the verge of a breakdown, Adam leaves the restaurant.\n\nHe wanders the city, eventually arriving at Reece's restaurant drunk. Once inside, he begins to break down emotionally. Reece soothes him, and they part on better terms the following morning. Adam attends a group therapy session, then returns to the hotel, where he learns that Anne Marie has paid off his debt. She gives him her father's knives and tells him that she approves of Helene. Tony and Helene find Adam and tell him that the two men they thought were Michelin reviewers were actually just businessmen on a trip. Adam rejoices at the opportunity of a second chance, and he and Helene kiss.\n\nAltered by his experiences, Adam changes the way he runs the kitchen. As a result of his improved attitude and teamwork, the restaurant receives its third Michelin star. At the end, he sits down to eat the [[family meal]] with the kitchen crew, who are his new family.\n\n==Cast==<!--- opening credits order as far as Greene--->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Adam Jones\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Helene Sweeney\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Michel\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Tony Balerdi\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as Max\n* [[Sam Keeley]] as David\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Anne Marie\n* [[Matthew Rhys]] as Montgomery Reece \n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Simone\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Dr. Rosshilde\n* [[Lily James]] as Sara\n* [[Sarah Greene (actress)|Sarah Greene]] as Kaitlin\n* [[Henry Goodman]] as Conti\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Jack\n* Lexie Benbow-Hart as Lily{{div col end}}\n\n[[Jamie Dornan]] played the part of Leon Sweeney but his scenes were deleted.<ref name=\"Dornan\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn 2013, [[John Wells (filmmaker)|John Wells]] was set to direct a [[Comedy film|cooking comedy]] film, then titled ''Chef'', with [[Bradley Cooper]] signed to star as a former Paris chef, Adam Jones.<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite news| title=John Wells Deal To Direct Bradley Cooper In 'Chef'| url=https://deadline.com/2013/05/john-wells-cooking-up-deal-to-direct-bradley-cooper-in-chef-489129/| website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> [[Sienna Miller]] signed as lead actress.<ref name=\"MovieWeb\">{{cite news| title=Sienna Miller Boards John Wells' 'Chef' with Bradley Cooper| url=http://movieweb.com/sienna-miller-boards-john-wells-chef-with-bradley-cooper/| publisher=[[MovieWeb]]}}</ref> Omar Sy, [[Jamie Dornan]], Emma Thompson, Daniel Br\u00fchl, Alicia Vikander and Lily James were also set to star in the film.<ref>{{cite news| title=Jamie Dornan's First Movie After 'Fifty Shades of Grey' \u2013 Bradley Cooper's 'Adam Jones'| url=https://www.thewrap.com/jamie-dornans-first-movie-after-fifty-shades-of-grey-bradley-coopers-adam-jones/| work=[[TheWrap]]}}</ref> Dornan's appearance was later removed due to cuts and adjustments in the storyline and Lily James's role revealed to be a cameo.<ref name=\"Dornan\">{{cite magazine| title=Jamie Dornan's part in 'Burnt' has been cut| url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/22/jamie-dornan-cut-burnt| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| access-date=November 3, 2015}}</ref> Dornan's scenes were added to the home release.<ref name=\"Heimbrod\">{{cite web| url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/67689/20160105/fifty-shades-darker-star-jamie-dornans-deleted-scene-from-burnt-released.htm| archive-url=https://archive.today/20160210215933/http://www.designntrend.com/articles/67689/20160105/fifty-shades-darker-star-jamie-dornans-deleted-scene-from-burnt-released.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 10, 2016| title='Fifty Shades Darker' Star Jamie Dornan's Deleted Scene From 'Burnt' Released| work=Design & Trend| first=Mimi| last=Heimbrod| date=January 5, 2016| access-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref> In July 2014, it was reported that the film's title had been changed from ''Chef'' to ''Adam Jones'', to avoid confusion with [[Jon Favreau]]'s film ''[[Chef (2014 film)|Chef]]''.
