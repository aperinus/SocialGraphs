While waiting for her Canadian citizenship to come through, Kate has been planning their wedding and the purchase of their first house, complete with a white picket fence.\n\nWhen Charlie urges her to accompany him to Paris for an upcoming conference, she declines due to her fear of flying and her general intolerance for cheese, secondhand smoke, and the stereotypical idea she has about the French.\n\nA few days later, Kate's plans for the future are crushed when she receives a phone call from Charlie, who tells her he has fallen in love with a French \"goddess\" named Juliette and he will not be returning. Determined to win him back, Kate boards an Air Canada flight to Paris and is seated next to a Frenchman, Luc Teyssier, whose every word annoys her.\n\nUnknown to Kate, Luc is smuggling a vine cutting and a stolen diamond necklace into France, hoping to use both to start his own vineyard. With the help of a few drinks, Kate is able to tolerate her \"rude\" and \"nicotine saturated and hygiene-deficient\" seating partner long enough to arrive safely in Paris. Before deboarding, Luc sneaks the vine and necklace into Kate's bag, knowing she will not be searched at customs.\n\nAt the terminal, Luc is spotted by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon, who insists on giving him a ride during which he searches his bag. Jean-Paul knows of Luc's vocation, but feels \"protective\" of him as Luc once saved his life. Meanwhile, Kate arrives at the [[Four Seasons Hotel George V|H\u00f4tel George V]], where she encounters new levels of French sarcasm and rudeness from the [[concierge]].\n\nWhile waiting in the lobby with petty thief Bob, Kate sees Charlie and Juliette kissing passionately in a descending elevator and faints. Bob steals her bag and leaves just as Luc arrives. After reviving Kate, Luc realizes who has the necklace, goes with Kate to Bob's apartment, and recovers the bag, absent her money and passport.\n\nUpset with Luc, Kate heads off on her own, and learns that Charlie is traveling south to Cannes to meet Juliette's parents. Luc, meanwhile, realizes the necklace must still be in Kate's bag. He tracks her down to the train station, offers to help her \"win back Charlie\", and together they board a train to Cannes. That evening, Luc sees Charlie's picture from Kate's locket before she falls asleep. While she sleeps, he tries to check Kate's bag during which she, thinking it's Charlie, kisses him.\n\nThe next morning during breakfast, she describes it as a 'delicious dream' with which she woke up 'transformed,' only to sample some of the 452 [[List of French cheeses|official government cheeses of France]], despite being lactose intolerant. She gets an upset stomach shortly after and is violently ill, and they get off the train at Luc's hometown of La Ravelle in [[Paulhaguet]], where they stay at his family home and vineyard. Kate learns about Luc's past and how he gambled away his vineyard birthright to his brother in a single hand of poker; she also learns that while he may be a schemer, he knows a lot about wine, and dreams of someday buying land for his own winery. As they board the train to Cannes, Kate shows him that she, in fact, has the necklace.\n\nAt Cannes, they check into a room at the [[InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel|Carlton Hotel]] using a stolen credit card. Following Luc's advice, Kate confronts Charlie in front of Juliette on the beach, pretending to be indifferent to him. To make him jealous, Luc pretends to be Kate's lover, and it works. Later that afternoon, Jean-Paul approaches Kate, urging her to convince Luc to return the necklace anonymously to avoid jail. Luc was planning to sell the necklace at [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]], but agrees to Kate's \"new plan\" to have her sell the necklace, as that would be safer.\n\nAt dinner, Charlie apologizes to Kate and accompanies her to her room, where he tries to seduce her. Rejecting his advances, Kate realizes she no longer wants him, as she has fallen in love with Luc. Meanwhile, in an effort to \"ensure victory\" for her, Luc takes an all-too-willing Juliette to bed, seducing her, but his plan fails when he calls her \"Kate\".\n\nThe following morning, Kate tells Luc that Charlie wants her back, but quickly leaves the room, saying, \"Cartier is waiting\". She returns the necklace to Jean-Paul and purchases a Cartier check for $45,782 with her own savings to create the illusion that she sold it. After giving the check to Luc, she leaves for the airport pretending to meet Charlie. Soon after, Jean-Paul approaches Luc and reveals the charade and all that Kate has done for him. Luc rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and confesses his love for her and wants her to stay with him. Sometime later, Kate and he kiss and embrace in their beautiful new vineyard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Kate\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Luc Teyssier\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Charlie Lytton\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]] as Bob\n* [[Susan Anbeh]] as Juliette\n* [[Marie-Christine Adam]] as Juliette's mother\n* Jean-Paul Jaupart as Juliette's father\n* [[Renee Humphrey]] as Lilly\n* [[Michael Riley]] as M.

The hotel lobby was used for the scene where the petty thief Bob steals Kate's bag after she faints. Several scenes show the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the background\u2014the one site Kate longs to see most but keeps on missing. A phonebooth on [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] near the [[Arc de Triomphe]] was used for the scene where Kate calls Charlie's mother. Scenes were also filmed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Paris|American Embassy]] at 2 Avenue Gabriel, and the [[Embassy of Canada, Paris|Canadian Embassy]] at 35 [[Avenue Montaigne]]. The scene where Luc throws money on the sidewalk was filmed at the corner of rue Paul-Albert and rue Feutrier in [[Montmartre]].\n\nDriving scenes in Paris were filmed in front of the [[Louvre]] near the [[Louvre Pyramid]], along the [[Rive Droite]], and on [[Rue des Rosiers]], where Luc drives down a narrow, winding cobblestoned street. Additional Paris scenes were filmed at the [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] in Montmartre, the Grande Pharmacie de la Place Blanche at 5 [[Place Blanche]], the [[Trocad\u00e9ro|Palais de Chaillot]], and [[Abbesses (Paris M\u00e9tro)#Location|Place des Abbesses]], where Kate and Luc discuss his \"little problem\". The final scene filmed in Paris was at the [[Gare Saint-Lazare]] train station, where Luc is chased by Inspector Jean-Paul Cardon while trying to board a train south to Cannes.{{efn-ua|In fact the train to Cannes leaves from [[Gare de Lyon]] station, and not from Gare Saint-Lazare station.}}\n\nIn the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, the small village of [[Valbonne]], about fifteen minutes north of Cannes, was used for several scenes, including the scene where Luc fights with his brother in the main village square in front of the Hotel les Armoiries, an old seventeenth century building. Other scenes were filmed at the train station and nearby vineyards around La Ravelle, 84240 La Tour-d'Aigues, The train station near Meyrargues, [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], was also used in one scene.\n\nIn Cannes, several exterior shots of the Carlton Hotel were used to represent where the four main characters stay. There are interior scenes of the lobby and the brasserie used for morning breakfasts. Other scenes filmed here include the beach in front of the hotel along with the adjacent waterfront\u2014in particular the [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] boutique on the next corner. The grape harvest scenes were filmed at [[Ch\u00e2teau Val Joanis]] in [[Pertuis]], [[Vaucluse]]. Studio scenes were shot at [[Billancourt Studios|Paris Studios Cin\u00e9ma]].\n\n===Title===\nThe film was originally titled ''Paris Match'', a play on the name of the famous [[Paris Match|French newsmagazine]].

In his review in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Mick LaSalle wrote that director Lawrence Kasdan \"takes what could have been a fluffy comedy with lots of plot complications and picturesque scenery and instead puts his focus on the important things: on the characters played by Ryan and Kline and how they happen to be feeling.\" LaSalle also applauded Kasdan's sense of subtle comedy:\n\n{{blockquote|With his attention in the right place, Kasdan comes up with ways of using the setting to make emotional points. For example, though the film doesn't go out of its way to make you notice, Ryan keeps missing out on getting to see the Eiffel Tower. It's behind her as she's riding in a car, or she's turning toward it a second after they've turned out the lights. She doesn't know what she's missing\u2014until eventually she does.}}\nLaSalle found Kline's performance \"extraordinary\" and that he not only perfected the accent but the \"speech rhythms and the manner as well.\" LaSalle also praised Ryan's comic timing, which \"continues to delight.\"<ref name=\"sfgate\"/>\n\nIn her review in ''The Washington Post'', Rita Kempley, giving it a mixed review, wrote that the film \"isn't as passionate as the title suggests\u2014in fact, it's facile\u2014but Ryan and Kevin Kline, as her attractive opposite, are irresistible together.\" Kempley applauded the acting performances:\n\n{{blockquote|Kline's hilariously hammy l'accent puts Inspector Clouseau's to shame; his performance is the zaniest since ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]''. Ryan's Kate is even pickier than the heroine in ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' and melts just as endearingly. She and Kline spar convincingly; Doris Day and Rock Hudson had sexier scenes, but none this romantic.<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>}}\n\nIn his review in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', a disappointed Roger Ebert wrote, \"The characters in this movie may look like adults, but they think like teenagers.\" Although he acknowledged that the film was not without its charms\u2014Paris and Cannes being \"two of the most photogenic cities on earth\"\u2014Ebert concluded, \"Kline's Frenchman is somehow not worldly enough, and Ryan's heroine never convinces us she ever loved her fianc\u00e9 in the first place.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\nIn her review in ''The New York Times'', Janet Maslin called the film a \"romantic comedy with barely a laugh or a spark, and with a pace that makes it feel longer than Mr. Kasdan's previous work, ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]''.\"<ref name=\"nytimes-maslin\"/>\n\nReview aggregation website ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' gave the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 27 critics with a weighted average of 5.6/10.
