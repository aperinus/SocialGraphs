It marked a return to cinema for Fonda, being her first film in 15 years since ''[[Stanley & Iris]]'' in 1990. The film was negatively received by critics who praised Fonda's performance but panned the screenplay, and Lopez's performance. ''Monster-in-Law'' was a box office success, grossing $154&nbsp;million on a $43&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nCharlie Cantilini is a [[Temporary work|temp]]/[[Dog walking#Professional dog walkers|dog walker]]/yoga instructor and aspiring fashion designer from [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]], California, who meets doctor Kevin Fields. At first, she believes he is gay because of a lie his vindictive ex-girlfriend Fiona told her, but Kevin later asks her out and she feels she has finally found the right man.\n\nThings start to sour when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother Viola, a former newscaster-turned-talk show host who was recently replaced by someone younger, leading to her having a meltdown and attacking a guest on-air. Loathing Charlie immediately, Viola becomes more distraught when Kevin proposes to her, fearing she will lose her son just as she lost her career. Determined to ruin Kevin and Charlie's relationship, she enlists the help of her loyal assistant Ruby as well as Fiona. At the engagement party, Fiona kisses Kevin as he\u2019s dressing in his room, deeply hurting Charlie who feels out of place in Kevin\u2019s world, exactly as Viola and Fiona planned. Viola feigns an [[Panic attack|anxiety attack]] and moves in with Charlie while Kevin is away for a medical conference, hoping to drive her crazy with her antics.\n\nCharlie soon catches onto Viola's plan and retaliates by destroying her bedroom and tampering with her anti-psychotic medication (which Viola had replaced with vitamin C tablets). Charlie eventually confronts her, forcing her to move out. Finding no way to stop the wedding, Viola tricks Charlie into eating nuts during the rehearsal dinner, causing an extreme allergic reaction, resulting in Charlie's face swelling up. Luckily, it subsides by morning.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Viola turns up wearing an extravagant white dress instead of the [[Peach (color)|peach]]-colored one Charlie had specially made for her. This leads to a violent standoff between them, with Viola refusing to accept Charlie and declaring she will never be good enough for Kevin.\n\nSuddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother Gertrude, appears and they have an indignant argument, with Gertrude holding her responsible for the \"terminal disappointment\", from which Gertrude claims her son, Kevin's father, died many years earlier. Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's animosity towards Charlie, who decides to back down as she feels the same thing will happen to them in 30 years.\n\nCharlie leaves to tell Kevin the wedding is off, but before she can, Ruby finally gets through to Viola. Viola resentfully expresses disbelief over being compared to Gertrude, but Ruby points out that Viola is actually far worse, as Gertrude never tried to poison her (referring to the rehearsal dinner incident), as well as the fact that she wore black to Viola's wedding due to being \"in mourning\" for her son, a contrasting but still disrespectful mirror of Viola's own behavior. When Viola claims that she just wants her son to be happy, Ruby asks her what made her think he wasn\u2019t happy with Charlie.\n\nViola has an epiphany and ultimately realizes that she wants Charlie to stay and tells her that she will leave the two of them alone if that means her son is happy. Charlie, however, tells Viola that she wants her to be a part of their lives, with some boundaries and ground rules.\n\nCharlie and Kevin get married and, when she throws the bouquet, Viola (now wearing the peach-colored dress) catches it. As the newlyweds drive away to their honeymoon, Viola and Ruby leave to go out drinking.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Cantilini\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Viola Fields\n* [[Michael Vartan]] as Dr. Kevin Fields\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Ruby\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Remy\n* [[Monet Mazur]] as Fiona\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Morgan\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Kit\n* [[Elaine Stritch]] as Gertrude Fields\n* [[Stephen Dunham]] as Dr. Paul Chamberlain\n\n==Reception {{anchor|Critics|Critical response}}==\n{{As of|2021|08}}, the film holds an 18% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 169 reviews with an average rating of 4.28/10.

You write a role for her. It makes sense. It fits her. You like her in it. It gives her a relationship with Jennifer Lopez that could plausibly exist in our time and space. It gives her a son who has not wandered over after the \"E.R.\" auditions.

There's an audience for such stuff, but little enthusiasm or loyalty.
