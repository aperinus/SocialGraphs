It earned a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for Forster, and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Jackson and Grier. It was released on December 25, 1997, received positive reviews and grossed $74 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!---Synopsis to be between 400-700 words per Wikipedia policy.--->\nJackie Brown, a [[flight attendant]], smuggles money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie, a [[gun runner]] in Los Angeles. When Ordell's courier, Beaumont Livingston, is arrested, he hires [[bail bondsman]] Max Cherry to bail him out. To prevent Beaumont talking to the police, Ordell kills him.\n\nActing on information Beaumont gave them, [[ATF]] agent Ray Nicolette and [[LAPD]] detective Mark Dargus intercept Jackie with Ordell's cash and a bag of [[cocaine]]. After Jackie is sent to jail, Ordell hires Max to bail her out. Ordell arrives at Jackie's apartment, but she pulls a gun on him she stole from Max's glovebox. She negotiates a deal with Ordell: she will pretend to help the authorities while smuggling in $550,000 of Ordell's money.\n\nOrdell brings in Louis Gara, a criminal associate and former cellmate just released from prison. Meanwhile, Melanie Ralston, one of Ordell's women, attempts to convince Louis to betray Ordell and take the money for themselves. Louis tells Ordell, but Ordell replies that he is not concerned about her.\n\nUnaware of the plan to smuggle in $550,000, Nicolette and Dargus devise a sting to catch Ordell during a transfer of $50,000. Jackie plans to keep the $500,000 for herself. She recruits Max, offering him a cut. During a test run, Jackie smuggles in $10,000, with Nicolette and Dargus aware, to swap with Sheronda, Ordell's live-in girlfriend, at a shopping mall. After Jackie leaves, Max observes an unknown woman swap bags with Sheronda. He informs Jackie and she confronts Ordell, who states he used Simone Hawkins, one of his contacts, to secure his money as backup.\n\nOn the day of the transfer, Ordell discovers that Simone has left town with the $10,000. He reluctantly recruits Melanie to perform the swap instead. Jackie enters a dressing room in a department store to try on a suit. Though she has told Nicolette the exchange will take place in the food court, she has told Ordell she will swap bags in the dressing room. The bag contains only $40,000; Jackie leaves the rest in the dressing room for Max. Jackie takes $10,000 and places it on top of the bag she gives Melanie as a bonus. Jackie runs to the food court and finds Nicolette, claiming Melanie burst into the dressing room and stole the money.\n\nIn the parking lot, Melanie mocks Louis for forgetting where they parked. He loses his temper and kills her. Louis tells Ordell, who discovers that most of the money is missing. When Louis recalls seeing Max at the shopping mall, Ordell, furious, kills Louis.\n\nOrdell instructs Max to tell Jackie that Ordell will kill them if she does not return the money, and that if she goes to the police, he will name her as an accessory. Max goes to Ordell's house and tells him that Jackie, frightened, is waiting in Max's office with the money. Ordell holds Max at gunpoint as they enter his office. Jackie yells out that Ordell has a gun. Nicolette and Dargus, hiding in the back, ambush him and shoot him dead. The charges against Jackie are dropped, and she plans a trip to Madrid. Max declines her invitation to join her. They kiss goodbye and he watches her drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n<!-- Cast per opening credits order. -->\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Jackie Brown\n* [[Samuel L.

Tarantino initially planned to film either ''Freaky Deaky'' or ''Killshot'' and have another director make ''Rum Punch'', but changed his mind after re-reading ''Rum Punch'', saying he \"fell in love\" with the novel all over again.<ref name=\"Documentary\">''Jackie Brown: How It Went Down''. ''Jackie Brown'' DVD Special Edition. Miramax Home Entertainment. 2002.</ref> ''Killshot'' was later [[Killshot (film)|adapted into a film]], produced by ''Jackie Brown'' producer [[Lawrence Bender]]. While adapting ''Rum Punch'' into a screenplay, Tarantino changed the ethnicity of the main character from white to black, as well as renaming her from Burke to Brown, titling the screenplay ''Jackie Brown''. Tarantino hesitated to discuss the changes with Leonard, finally speaking with Leonard as the film was about to start shooting. Leonard loved the screenplay, considering it not only the best of the twenty-six screen adaptations of his novels and short stories, but also stating that it was possibly the best screenplay he had ever read.<ref name=\"Documentary\" />\n\nTarantino's screenplay otherwise closely followed Leonard's novel, incorporating elements of Tarantino's trademark humor and pacing.<ref name=\":0\" /> The screenplay was also influenced by [[blaxploitation]] films, but Tarantino said ''Jackie Brown'' is not a blaxploitation film.<ref name=\"Documentary\" />\n\n''Jackie Brown'' alludes to Grier's career in many ways. The film's poster resembles those of Grier's films ''Coffy'' and ''Foxy Brown'' and includes quotes from both films. The typeface for the film's opening titles was also used for those of ''Foxy Brown''; some of the background music is taken from these films including four songs from [[Roy Ayers]]'s original score for ''Coffy''.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\nThe film's opening sequence is similar to that of ''[[The Graduate]]'', in which [[Dustin Hoffman]] passes wearily through [[Los Angeles International Airport]] past white tiles to a somber \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" by [[Simon and Garfunkel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} In ''Jackie Brown'', Grier glides by blue tiles in the same spot on a moving sidewalk in the same direction to a soaring [[soul music]] song, \"[[Across 110th Street (song)|Across 110th Street]]\" by [[Bobby Womack]], which is from [[Across 110th Street|the film of the same name]] that was a part of the blaxploitation genre, just like ''Foxy Brown'' and ''Coffy''.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n===Casting===\nTarantino wanted [[Pam Grier]] to play the title character.

She asked if he had put them up because she was coming to read for his film, and he responded that he was actually planning to take them down before her audition, to avoid making it look like he wanted to impress her.<ref name=\"Documentary\" /> Several years after the release of the movie, [[Sylvester Stallone]] claimed that he turned down the role of Louis Gara.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/general/on-feuding-with-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-whats-wrong-with-todays-action-heroes/ |title=In conversation: Sylvester Stallone |date=March 6, 2012|access-date = February 24, 2016 |website=MacLean's |last=Johnson |first=Brian D.|archive-date = October 5, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201005150124/https://www.macleans.ca/general/on-feuding-with-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-whats-wrong-with-todays-action-heroes/|url-status = live}}</ref> Tarantino considered [[Paul Newman]], [[Gene Hackman]] and [[John Saxon]] for the role of Max Cherry, before casting Robert Forster.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2009/08/tarantino-week-revisiting-jackie-brown/|title = Tarantino Week: Revisiting 'Jackie Brown'|date = August 19, 2009|access-date = August 5, 2021|archive-date = August 5, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210805185207/http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2009/08/tarantino-week-revisiting-jackie-brown/|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theplaylist.net/quentin-tarantino-newman-hackman-jackie-brown-20200203/|title=Quentin Tarantino Says He Originally Considered Paul Newman & Gene Hackman for the Max Cherry Role in 'Jackie Brown'|access-date=August 5, 2021|archive-date=August 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210805185659/https://theplaylist.net/quentin-tarantino-newman-hackman-jackie-brown-20200203/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====''Out of Sight''====\nWhile ''Jackie Brown'' was in production, [[Universal Pictures]] was preparing to begin production on director [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Out of Sight]]'', an adaptation of the Leonard [[Out of Sight (novel)|novel of the same name]] that also features the character of Ray Nicolette, and waited to see whom Tarantino would cast as Nicolette for ''Jackie Brown''.<ref name=\"Documentary\" /> Michael Keaton was hesitant to take the part of Ray Nicolette, even though Tarantino wanted him for it.<ref name=\"Documentary\" /> Keaton subsequently agreed to play Nicolette again in ''Out of Sight'', uncredited, appearing in one brief scene.

There are several songs included that were featured in blaxploitation films as well, including [[Bobby Womack]]'s \"Across 110th Street\", from [[Across 110th Street|the film of the same name]], and [[Pam Grier]]'s \"Long Time Woman\", from her 1971 film ''[[The Big Doll House]]''. The original soundtrack also features separate tracks with dialogue from the film. Instead of using a new [[film score]], Tarantino incorporated [[Roy Ayers]]' [[funk]] score from the film ''[[Coffy]]''.\n\nA number of songs used in the film do not appear on the soundtrack, such as \"[[Cissy Strut]]\" ([[The Meters]]), and \"Piano Impromptu\" ([[Dick Walters]]).\n\n==Home media==\nThe Special Edition DVD, released by Buena Vista in 2002, includes an introduction from Tarantino, an hour-long retrospective interview, a subtitle trivia track and soundtrack chapter selection, a half-hour making-of documentary (\"''How It Went Down''\"), the entire \"''Chicks Who Love Guns''\" video as seen in the film, many [[Deleted scene|deleted and alternate scenes]], including an alternate opening title sequence, [[Gene Siskel|Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Ebert]]'s review, ''Jackie Brown'' appearances on MTV, TV spots and theatrical trailers, written reviews and articles and filmographies, and over an hour of trailers for Pam Grier and Robert Forster films dating from the 1960s onwards.<ref name=\"Documentary\" /> The box also includes a mini-poster of the film, similar to the one above, and on the back of that, two other mini-posters{{snd}}one of Grier, the other of Forster, both similar to the album cover.\n\nAlthough the Special Edition DVD's back cover states that the film is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it was actually shot with a 1.85:1 ratio, the only Tarantino-directed film to date shot in such a format with the exception of his segment in the film ''[[Four Rooms]]'', \"The Man from Hollywood\".\n\nOn October 4, 2011, Miramax released ''Jackie Brown'' on [[Blu-ray Disc]] along with ''Pulp Fiction''. The film is presented in 1080p HD in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. The disc was the result of a new licensing deal with Miramax and Lionsgate.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.miramax.com/press/lionsgate-studiocanal-and-miramax-enter-into-home-entertainment-distribution-agreement/ |title=Lionsgate, Studiocanal and Miramax enter into home entertainment distribution agreement |publisher=Miramax |date=February 11, 2011 |access-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302125120/http://www.miramax.com/press/lionsgate-studiocanal-and-miramax-enter-into-home-entertainment-distribution-agreement/|archive-date=March 2, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Life of Crime (film)|''Life of Crime'']] (2013)\n* [[Heist film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Jackie Brown}}\n* {{IMDb title|0119396}}\n* {{allrovi movie|158843}}\n* {{mojo title|jackiebrown}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|jackie_brown}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Elmore Leonard}}\n{{Quentin Tarantino}}\n{{Portal bar|Film|United States|1990s|Law}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1997 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1997 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:1990s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:A Band Apart films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in fiction]]\n[[Category:African-American-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Blaxploitation films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about cocaine]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Elmore Leonard]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Quentin Tarantino]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lawrence Bender]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1995]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Quentin Tarantino]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:Films about flight attendants]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
