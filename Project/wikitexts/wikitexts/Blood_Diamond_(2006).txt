The title refers to [[blood diamond]]s, which are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance conflicts, and thereby profit warlords and diamond companies around the world.\n\nSet during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] of 1991\u20132002, the film depicts a country torn apart by the struggle between government loyalists and insurgent forces. It also portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of civilians' hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections.\n\nThe film's ending, in which a conference is held concerning blood diamonds, refers to a historic meeting that took place in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]], in 2000. It led to development of the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]], which sought to certify the origin of rough diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds; the certification scheme has since been mostly abandoned as ineffective.\n\nThe film received mainly positive reviews, with praise directed toward the performances of DiCaprio and Hounsou. The film grossed $171 million worldwide and received five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for DiCaprio and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Hounsou. DiCaprio received a nomination for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] (also nominated that year in the same category for ''[[The Departed]]''). In addition, DiCaprio and Hounsou were nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Male Actor in a Leading Role]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Male Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[13th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 1999 in [[Sierra Leone]], a West African nation ravaged by a decade of [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]]. Rebel factions such as the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) frequently terrorize the countryside, intimidating [[Mende people|Mende]] locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate local is fisherman Solomon Vandy from [[Shenge]]. While his family escapes the rebels, Vandy is assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison, a ruthless warlord.\n\nOne morning, while [[Placer mining|mining a river]], Vandy discovers an enormous [[pink diamond]]. Captain Poison tries to take the stone, but the area is suddenly raided by government troops. Vandy buries the stone before being captured. Both Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in the Sierra Leone capital of [[Freetown]], along with Danny Archer, a [[White people in Zimbabwe|Rhodesian]] smuggler and [[mercenary]]. Archer, a veteran of the [[32 Battalion (South Africa)|32 Battalion]] during the [[South African Border War]], was jailed while trying to smuggle diamonds into [[Liberia]]. They were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap, a corrupt [[South Africa]]n mining executive and a major part of the international diamond industry.\n\nHearing of the pink diamond in prison, Archer arranges for himself and Vandy to be freed from detention. He travels to [[Cape Town]] to meet his employer, Colonel Coetzee, an [[Afrikaner]] formerly with the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]]-era [[South African Defence Force]], who now commands a [[private military company]]. Archer wants the diamond so he can sell it and leave the continent forever, but Coetzee wants it as compensation for Archer's botched smuggling mission. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will help recover the diamond.\n\nMeanwhile, RUF insurgents escalate hostilities; Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia is among those rounded up to serve as [[military use of children|child soldiers]] under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]], where Vandy encounters his wife and daughters in a refugee camp, but finds that his son has been taken by the RUF. Vandy and Archer plan to reach [[Kono district|Kono]], where Vandy buried the diamond, with an American journalist named Maddy Bowen, who is attempting to write an [[Investigative journalism|expos\u00e9]] on the illicit diamond trade. In exchange for her help, Archer promises to provide her the evidence she needs for her story.\n\nArcher and Vandy, disguised as [[Broadcast journalism|television journalists]], travel with Maddy and a press convoy destined for Kono, but the convoy is ambushed by rebels and the three are forced to flee. While trekking through the jungle, they encounter [[Kamajor]] militiamen, who take them to the home of a friendly local named Benjamin Kapanay. The kindhearted Kapanay offers to drive them to Kono, though he is injured by an RUF child soldier on the way. The trio arrive in Kono after a harrowing journey, where Coetzee and his private army\u2014contracted by the Sierra Leone government\u2014prepare to repulse the rebel offensive.\n\nArcher, having developed respect for Maddy, gives her the evidence and forces her to evacuate the country with other civilians; Archer and Vandy, having stolen weapons and supplies from Colonel Coetzee's army, set out for Captain Poison's encampment to retrieve the nearby diamond. Along the way, the two men begin fighting over what they perceive as the ultimate goal: Archer wants the diamond, while Vandy cares only about finding his son.\n\nThey arrive at the encampment where Archer, seeing they are heavily outnumbered, calls Coetzee's army via [[satellite phone]] to request an airstrike. Vandy, still desperate to find his son, sneaks into the encampment and locates Dia; due to Dia's [[brainwashing]], he refuses to acknowledge his father. Vandy is captured but manages to escape once Coetzee's army arrives. Vandy finds Captain Poison and beats him to death with a shovel as the mercenaries overwhelm the RUF defenders. Coetzee then takes Dia hostage and forces Vandy to produce the diamond, but Archer kills Coetzee after realizing the colonel would eventually kill them both. Dia briefly holds the pair at gunpoint, but Vandy is able to talk him down by reminding him of who he was before his kidnapping. Pursued by vengeful mercenaries, Archer discloses he has been mortally wounded and entrusts the stone to Vandy, telling him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with Archer's pilot, who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy, who is in Cape Town; they share final farewells as he asks her to assist Vandy and his family, and he gives her permission to finish her article. Archer finally takes in the beautiful African landscape before dying.\n\nVandy and Maddy meet in London, where they execute an undercover operation meant to expose the van de Kaap operation's dirty dealings. Vandy exchanges the pink diamond for \u00a32 million pounds and a reunion with his entire family. Maddy takes photographs of the exchange and publishes her expos\u00e9 on the diamond trade and van de Kaap's criminal actions. Later, Vandy appears as a guest speaker at a conference on [[blood diamonds]] in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], where he is met with a standing ovation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Daniel \"Danny\" Archer\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Solomon Vandy\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Maddy Bowen\n* Kagiso Kuypers as Dia Vandy\n* [[Arnold Vosloo]] as Colonel Coetzee\n* Antony Coleman as Cordell Brown\n* Benu Mabhena as Jassie Vandy\n* Anointing Lukola as N'Yanda Vandy\n* [[David Harewood]] as Captain \"Poison\"\n* [[Basil Wallace]] as Benjamin Kapanay\n* [[Jimi Mistry]] as Nabil\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Rupert Simmons\n* [[Marius Weyers]] as Rudolf van de Kaap\n* Keithian D.
