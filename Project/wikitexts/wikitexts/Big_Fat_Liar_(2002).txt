The film is an allusion to the Aesop's Fable, ''[[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]]'', with Jason Shepherd being analogous to the shepherd boy in the story and Marty Wolf, analogous to the wolf.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Big Fat Liar |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/big-fat-liar-review/ |access-date=2022-08-11 |website=Empire}}</ref> It was released in the United States on February 8, 2002.\n\n==Plot==\nJason Shepherd, a 14-year-old compulsive liar living in Greenbury, [[Michigan]], tries to lie his way out of a creative writing assignment but gets caught by his English teacher, who alerts his parents. He is given three hours to submit his essay and avoid repeating English in summer school. Inspired by his talent for lying, Jason writes a story titled \"Big Fat Liar\". While riding his sister's old bike to turn in the essay, Jason is run over by the limousine of an arrogant Hollywood screenwriter and producer, Marty Wolf, and he convinces Marty to give him a ride. Marty, also a compulsive liar, is in town shooting his film ''Whitaker and Fowl''. In a rush, Jason accidentally leaves his essay in the limo when it falls out of his backpack. Inspired, Marty keeps the story for himself. Realizing his essay is missing, Jason tries to explain what happened, but he is sent to summer school.\n\nJason and his best friend, Kaylee, discover Marty has plagiarized Jason's essay into a film when they see a theatrical trailer. They fly to [[Los Angeles]] while their parents are out of town for the weekend and sneak into Marty's studio office to request that Marty confess to his parents, but he purposefully burns Jason's essay and calls security to remove them. Angered, the two plot to inconvenience him until he confesses. Marty's former limo driver and struggling actor Frank Jackson agrees to help. They sabotage Marty through pranks such as dying his skin blue via his swimming pool and his hair orange via his shampoo. They also superglue his headset to his ear; trick him into going to a child's birthday party, where the children mistake him for the hired clown and attack him; and tamper with his car's controls. Marty's car is also rear-ended by a cranky elderly woman into a monster truck owned by the Masher, a wrestler, who destroys it.\n\nMarty plans to produce ''Big Fat Liar'' with [[Universal Pictures]], but new president Marcus Duncan, seeing the commercial and critical failure of ''Whitaker and Fowl'', declines to approve the budget, so Jason agrees to help Marty in exchange for his confession to his parents. With Jason's advice, Marty makes a successful presentation and gets the film approved by Universal, but Marty subsequently betrays Jason and calls security to remove him and Kaylee again. Marty's abused assistant, Monty Kirkham, offers to help Jason and Kaylee expose him. They rally Marty's other tormented employees, while Jason calls his parents to tell them the truth about the weekend.\n\nThe next morning, Marty heads to the studio to begin filming ''Big Fat Liar'', but his employees delay him through a number of mishaps. As Marty finally arrives, he encounters Jason, who kidnaps his stuffed monkey toy, Mr. Funnybones. Jason flees across the studio, luring Marty to a rooftop where he retrieves his toy and mocks Jason. Marty boastfully admits his actions, unaware the entire conversation is being witnessed by Jason's parents, the media, and Marcus, who immediately fires him. Jason thanks Marty for teaching him an important lesson about the truth. Marty furiously tries to attack him, but Jason leaps off the building and safely lands on a stunt cushion, where he finally regains his parents' trust.\n\nUniversal produces ''Big Fat Liar'' after Marty's firing while using the skills of people he had abused. The film becomes a critical success, and Jason receives full credit for his original story. Meanwhile, Marty declares bankruptcy and begins a new job as a birthday clown. At a party, the Masher orders the birthday boy, his son Darren, to kick Marty in his crotch.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Jason Shepherd, a 14-year-old compulsive liar and slacker.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Marty Wolf, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer and founder of the fictional Marty Wolf Pictures [[film studio]], which is associated with [[Universal Pictures]]: unlike Jason, Marty does not care how his lies affect other people.\n* [[Amanda Bynes]] as Kaylee, Jason's best friend, whom he often talks into helping out with his lies and schemes.\n* [[Amanda Detmer]] as Monty Kirkham, Marty's long suffering assistant.\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Frank Jackson, Marty's former limo driver and a struggling actor who helps Jason and Kaylee in their mission to get him back after being unfairly fired by him the year before.\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Ms. Phyllis Caldwell, Jason and Kaylee's eighth-grade English teacher.\n* [[Russell Hornsby]] as Marcus Duncan, who is promoted from vice-president to president of Universal Pictures.\n* [[Michael Bryan French]] as Harry Shepherd, Jason's father.\n* [[Christine Tucci]] as Carol Shepherd, Jason's mother.\n* [[Lee Majors]] as Vince, an aging, but nevertheless qualified, stunt coordinator.\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as Leo\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Jocelyn Davis, the senior vice-president of publicity at Marty Wolf Pictures.\n* [[John Cho]] as Dusty Wong, the director of the ''Big Fat Liar'' film.\n* Matthew Frauman as Lester Golub, a computer and special effects expert.\n* Don Yesso as Rocco Malone\n* Rebecca Corey as Astrid Barker, the receptionist at Marty Wolf Pictures who cares a lot about dogs.\n* Sparkle as Grandma Pearl, Kaylee's senile grandmother.\n* [[Taran Killam]] as Bret Callaway, a dim-witted [[skateboard]] punk who consistently bullies Jason and is tutored by Kaylee.\n* [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]] as Janie Shepherd, Jason's older sister who prefers spending time at her boyfriend Rudy's than looking after him.\n* [[Ned Brower]] as Rudy, Janie's boyfriend.\n* Michelle Griffin as Shandra Duncan, Marcus' wife.\n* [[Pat O'Brien (radio and television personality)|Pat O'Brien]] as himself, where he interviews Marty about ''Big Fat Liar'' and covering the premiere of ''Whitaker and Fowl''.\n* Brian Turk as The Masher, a wrestler and monster truck driver.
