The incident inspires him to go into the [[Arms Trade|arms trade]]. Yuri muses that the constant need for weapons is similar to the human need for food and drink, thus he can make a fortune. After successfully completing his first sale of an [[Uzi]] sub machine gun to a local mobster, Yuri convinces his younger brother Vitaly to become his partner.\n\nThe two brothers get their first big break during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], where they sell weapons to both Israeli and Lebanese troops despite witnessing the same weapons being used to commit war crimes and other atrocities. As Yuri begins to prosper by exploiting his growing network of business connections, he comes to the attention of [[Interpol]], in particular an idealistic agent named Jack Valentine, with whom he crosses paths on multiple occasions. Valentine represents a unique threat to Yuri because he is after glory, not money, and thus cannot be bought off.\n\nVitaly becomes addicted to [[cocaine]] after a [[Colombia]]n drug lord forces the brothers to accept several kilos of cocaine to pay for an arms sale of numerous [[Glock|Glock 17]] pistols. Yuri quietly checks Vitaly into a [[drug rehabilitation]] clinic and continues his business alone. He lures childhood crush Ava Fontaine to a false photo shoot, and they subsequently get married and have a son.\n\nFollowing the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Yuri flies to Ukraine and illegally buys Russian tanks, guns, and munitions through his uncle, a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] general who is overseeing the distribution of weapons to the newly-formed [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Ukrainian Army]]. However, his uncle is killed in a car bombing attack planted by Yuri's rival, arms dealer Simeon Weisz. Yuri then expands his business to Africa, where he begins a business relationship with Andre Baptiste Sr., a ruthless dictator engaged in a brutal civil war in [[Liberia]].\n\nDuring one flight into Africa in 2001, Yuri's plane is intercepted by Valentine and forced to land. Yuri escapes arrest by landing in a remote area and giving away all of his cargo to the locals. Yuri makes it back to his hotel and is surprised by Baptiste who coerces him into killing Simeon to avenge his uncle and eliminate his competition. Yuri gives in and shoots Simeon dead.\n\nValentine then tells Ava her husband is an [[arms trafficking|arms dealer]], prompting her to confront him. To please his wife, Yuri tries to legitimize his business in trading timbers, but soon becomes frustrated with the difficulties and lower earnings of honest work. When Baptiste visits him in person and offers him the largest payday of his career, a stash of valuable [[blood diamond]]s, Yuri goes back to crime.\n\nYuri picks up Vitaly to assist him with a major deal in [[Sierra Leone]], where a militia force allied with Baptiste is visibly preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Unable to stomach his guilt, Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal, but his brother refuses knowing that Baptiste's men will kill them for refusing to hand over the guns. Vitaly then steals a pair of grenades and uses them to destroy a truck full of weapons, accidentally killing Baptiste's son. He is gunned down by the militia, and while Yuri is spared for his relationship with Baptiste Sr., he only receives half of the diamonds he was promised because half of the shipment is destroyed. He then watches helplessly as the militia massacres the refugees.\n\nYuri ships his brother's remains back to the United States. He pays a doctor to forge a phony death certificate and remove the bullets from Vitaly's body, but one bullet remains, and Yuri is apprehended by federal agents. Meanwhile, while being followed by Valentine, Ava finds a security container belonging to her husband, establishing definitive proof of Yuri's guilt. Ava finds the container full of her paintings, which Yuri secretly bought to prop up her career as an artist. Ava takes their son and leaves him for good. When Yuri tries to reconcile with his parents, his mother angrily disowns him for getting Vitaly killed.\n\nValentine detains Yuri in anticipation of his trial and conviction, but Yuri is unfazed. He then tells Valentine that, in a matter of minutes, a high-ranking American army officer will arrive and release him without any charges being filed. He explains that while he may be a criminal, the U.S. government is willing to turn a blind eye to his crimes because most of his weapons end up in the hands of their allies, who they cannot be seen publicly supplying with arms. Valentine then hears a knock at the door and realizes that Yuri is right, but before walking away, he says \"I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there.\"\n\nYuri soon returns to the arms trade, claiming that it's what he does best. The film concludes with a statement on how the five largest arms producers in the world are also the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Yuri Orlov (largely based on the exploits of international arms dealer [[Viktor Bout]])<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-03-07|title='Lord of war' arms trafficker arrested|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/07/thailand.russia|access-date=2021-08-17|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Interpol Agent Jack Valentine\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Vitaly Orlov\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Ava Fontaine\n* [[Eamonn Walker]] as Andr\u00e9 Baptiste Sr. (largely based on former [[President of Liberia|President]] of [[Liberia]], [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]])<ref>{{Cite web|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Charles Taylor Convicted of War Crimes.
