It has an [[ensemble cast]] including five [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winners: [[Gene Hackman]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Jack Albertson]], [[Shelley Winters]] and [[Red Buttons]]. The plot centers on the fictional [[Poseidon (fictional ship)|SS ''Poseidon'']], an aging luxury liner on her final voyage from [[New York City]] to [[Athens]] before it is scrapped. On New Year's Day, it is [[Capsizing|overturned]] by a [[tsunami]]. Passengers and crew are trapped inside, and a preacher attempts to lead a small group of survivors to safety.\n\nThe film is in the vein of other all-star [[disaster film]]s of the early-mid 1970s such as ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974). It was released in December 1972 and was the highest-grossing film of 1973, earning over $125 million worldwide. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], making it one of the most nominated films of all time, and went on to win two Oscars, <ref name=\"Oscars1973\">{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1973 |title=The 45th Academy Awards (1973) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-08-28 |website=oscars.org |archive-date=2019-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524181333/https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1973 |url-status=live }}</ref> a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]], and a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/38807/The-Poseidon-Adventure/awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018202923/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/38807/The-Poseidon-Adventure/awards |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-18 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |title=NY Times: The Poseidon Adventure |access-date=2008-12-28}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'', also based on a novel by Gallico, was released in 1979.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding. Should not exceed 700 words. -->\nThe SS ''Poseidon'', an [[ocean liner]] slated for retirement, is traveling from New York City to Athens. Despite safety concerns from Captain Harrison,  the new owner's representative Linarcos insists he go full speed to save money, preventing ''Poseidon'' from taking on [[Ballast tank|ballast]].\n\nReverend Frank Scott, a minister who believes \"[[God helps those who help themselves]]\", is traveling to a new parish in Africa as punishment for his unorthodox views. Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo and wife Linda, a former prostitute, deal with her seasickness. Susan Shelby and her younger brother Robin are traveling to meet up with their parents, who are on vacation in Greece. Susan has a crush on Scott while Robin is interested in how the ship works and frequently visits the engine room. Retired Jewish hardware store owner Manny Rosen and wife, Belle, are going to Israel to meet their 2-year-old grandson for the first time. [[Haberdasher]] James Martin is a love-shy, health-conscious bachelor. The ship's singer, Nonnie Parry, rehearses for the New Year's Day celebration.\n\nPassengers gather in the promenade room to celebrate. The captain is called to the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in response to a report of an [[Submarine earthquake|undersea earthquake]]. He receives word from the lookout that a tsunami is approaching from the direction of [[Crete]]. He issues a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday distress signal]]. The ship is hit broadside and capsizes, floating upside-down.\n\nIn the dining room, survivors take stock of their predicament. Acres, an injured waiter, is trapped at the galley door now high above. At Martin's prompting, Scott determines that the escape route will be found \"upwards\", at the outer hull, now above water. Robin tells him the hull near the propeller shaft is only {{convert|1|in|cm|0}} thick. Scott believes they will all survive by travelling with him to the ship's engine room. He tries to convince the dozens of survivors to join him on the journey to the engine room but the ship's [[purser]] orders everyone to wait for help. Most of the survivors side with the purser.\n\nOnly the Rosens, the Rogos, Susan and Robin, Acres, Nonnie, and Martin agree to go with Scott, using the inner metal frame of the promenade room's Christmas tree as a makeshift ladder. After the group climbs up to the galley, there is a series of explosions. As seawater floods the dining room below, those remaining attempt to climb the tree, but their weight causes it to fall. Water fills up the room and ''Poseidon'' begins sinking.\n\nScott leads his group toward the engine room. While climbing a ladder inside a ventilation shaft, the ship rocks from more explosions. Acres falls and dies when the shaft explodes. Leaving the shaft, the group meets a large band of survivors led by the ship's doctor, heading toward the bow. Scott believes they are heading for their doom, but Rogo wants to follow them and gives Scott 15 minutes to find the engine room. Although he takes longer than allowed, Scott succeeds.\n\nThe engine room is on the other side of a flooded corridor. Belle reveals she is a former competitive swimmer and volunteers to go through, but Scott refuses her and dives in. Halfway through, a panel collapses on him. The survivors notice the delay, and Belle dives in. She frees Scott and they make it to the other side, but Belle suffers a heart attack. Before dying, she tells Scott to give her [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]] pendant to her husband, to give to their grandson. Rogo swims over to make sure Belle and Scott are all right, then leads the rest over. When Manny finds Belle's body, he is unwilling to go on, but Scott gives him her pendant, reminding him that he has a reason to live.\n\nScott leads the survivors to the propeller shaft room's watertight door, but additional explosions cause Linda to lose her grip and fall to her death. A heartbroken and infuriated Rogo blames Scott. A ruptured pipe releases steam, blocking their escape. Scott rants at God for the survivors' deaths as he leaps across a pool of flaming oil, grabbing onto the burning-hot valve wheel to shut down the steam. Scott tells Rogo to lead the group on before falling to his death.\n\nRogo leads the remaining survivors \u2014 Manny, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin \u2014 through the watertight doors and into the propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut through the hull, assist the six survivors from the ship, inform them that no one else survived, and fly them to safety.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding.
