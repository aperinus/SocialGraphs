It is based on [[George Plimpton]]'s 1997 book, ''Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career'' and  covers the period from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, during which [[Truman Capote]] researched and wrote his bestseller ''[[In Cold Blood]]'' (1965).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/movies/06leib.html |title=Playing a Historical Figure, You Can Copy ... or Conquer|author=Liebowitz, Ed |work=The New York Times|date=August 6, 2006}}</ref>\n\nCapote is played by [[Toby Jones]]. [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Daniel Craig]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] also have featured roles, with a supporting cast that includes [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Hope Davis]], and a song performance by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Truman Capote]], known in [[New York City]] society for his wit and fashion flair as much as he is recognized in literary circles as the celebrated writer of ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', reads a brief article about the murder of a farming family in [[Holcomb, Kansas]], in the back pages of the ''[[New York Times]]'' of November 16, 1959.\n\nCurious as to how the residents would react to a brutal massacre in their midst, the author and his friend, [[Nelle Harper Lee]], who has just published her novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', travel from New York to the rural Midwestern town, ostensibly so Capote can interview people for a magazine article. Once there, he realizes there might be enough material for what he eventually describes as a \"[[nonfiction novel]]\".\n\nCapote's dress and demeanor both amuse and dismay law enforcement officials. He allows the less ostentatious Lee to act as a buffer between himself and those whose trust he needs to gain in order to obtain as much background information as possible.\n\nThe [[Kansas Bureau of Investigation]]'s lead detective on the case, [[Alvin Dewey]], has refused to cooperate with the writer. But when his starstruck wife Marie meets Capote in a grocery store, she invites him and Lee to Christmas dinner. He eventually wins over his host with personal anecdotes about [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[John Huston]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and the like.\n\nAs a result, when ex-convicts [[Richard Hickock]] and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]] are apprehended in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and extradited to Holcomb, permission is given to Capote to interview them in their cells. The two defendants are tried and found guilty, but a lengthy period of [[appeal]]s begins. Capote's society and literary friends in New York, like [[Slim Keith]] and [[Babe Paley]], press him for juicy gossip about the case and inquire when they can expect to read the book.\n\nCapote forms an attachment to Smith. He empathizes with the convicted killer's unhappy childhood, and Smith's remorseful manner, genuine sincerity, and obvious intelligence impress him. The criminal's reciprocal feelings become evident, although Smith has difficulty dealing with his emotions. As soon as Smith learns that Truman plans to title his book ''In Cold Blood'', which suggests the author thinks of him only as a merciless killer, he violently subdues Capote and nearly rapes him.\n\nSmith steadfastly refuses to describe the night of the murders. This greatly angers Capote, who wants to hear details not only as a writer in search of the truth but as someone who finds it difficult to believe a loved one could be guilty of such a crime. Smith eventually acquiesces and discusses what transpired.\n\nCapote then finds himself entangled in a personal and professional dilemma. As much as he wants Smith to be sentenced to life in prison, a death by hanging would provide a far more sensational ending for readers of his book. He begins to unravel psychologically as the legal appeals drag on, unable to complete his book without an ending.\n\nYears go by. Hickock and Smith finally exhaust all their options and now ask that Capote be present at their April 14, 1965 execution. He complies reluctantly with their request. Afterward, he learns Smith bequeathed his meager belongings to him, and among them he finds a charcoal sketch of him the killer had drawn.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Toby Jones]] as [[Truman Capote]]\n**Zachary Burnett as Young Truman Capote\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as [[Harper Lee]]\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]]\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Richard Hickock]]\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as [[Alvin Dewey]]\n* [[Peter Bogdanovich]] as [[Bennett Cerf]]\n* [[Hope Davis]] as [[Slim Keith]]\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as [[Marella Agnelli]]\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as [[Diana Vreeland]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Babe Paley]]\n* [[Michael Panes]] as [[Gore Vidal]]\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as [[Jack Dunphy]]\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Kitty Dean\n* [[Libby Villari]] as Delores Hope\n* [[Gail Cronauer]] as [[Bonnie Clutter]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film's original title alternated between ''Have You Heard?'' and ''Every Word Is True''.\n\nThe fictional singer portrayed by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] was originally intended to be [[Peggy Lee]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rubin |first=Mark |date=October 20, 2006 |title=What Is This Miracle Called Movie Music? |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2006-10-20/412316/ |access-date=August 1, 2022 |website=[[Austin Chronicle]]}}</ref> The situation of an audience being held spellbound by a performer falling silent in the middle of a song was based on a real-life [[nightclub]] performance by [[Barbara Cook]].<ref>''Infamous'' DVD commentary by Douglas McGrath</ref>\n\nAccording to writer and director Douglas McGrath, in his DVD commentary, many of the scenes in ''Infamous'' occurred only in McGrath's imagination, most notably a dramatic sexual encounter between Capote and inmate [[Perry Edward Smith|Perry Smith]] (played by Craig).\n\n==Release==\n''Infamous'' premiered at the August 2006 [[Venice Film Festival]]. It differs from the earlier ''Capote'' in that it occasionally breaks away from the Kansas setting to allow Capote's [[Manhattan]] society friends and professional acquaintances to comment on and express opinions about him to an unseen interlocutor during mock interviews. It also is more explicit about the romantic feelings Capote and Perry Smith may have shared.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 74% approval rating with an average rating of 6.7/10 based on 155 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Though comparisons with last year's ''Capote'' may be inevitable, ''Infamous'' takes a different angle in its depiction of the author, and stands up well enough on its own.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/infamous/ |title=Infamous |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=November 4, 2022}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film achieved an average score of 68 out of 100, based on 34 critics, signifying \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/infamous |title=Infamous Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=August 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the critical discussion of the film focused on comparisons with the previous year's ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'', which had received considerable critical acclaim and for which [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] had won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as Capote.\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott|A.O. Scott]] called the film \"well worth your attention.

I do not begrudge the versatile, popular Philip Seymour Hoffman his Oscar for playing the tiny terror in ''Capote'', but he was doing an impression. In ''Infamous'' ... a diminutive actor with a titanic talent named Toby Jones literally becomes the man himself. This is no lisping impersonation learned from watching old [[Johnny Carson]] shows: Mr. Jones moves into Truman's skin, heart and brains. ''Infamous'' shows you the man's soul. It is a monumental achievement of great artistry and depth. In some ways, the movie is better, too ... [it] is infinitely fascinating, cinematically breathtaking and largely impeccable. It proves that there's more than one way to tell a story and view a life.

In the central role, British thesp Toby Jones is a good physical match for Capote, getting his flamboyant mannerisms and creepy, nasal voice down. But unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning turn, there's no texture, no under-the-skin sense of the conflict between Capote's ambition for his book and his compassion for, and attraction to, Perry ...

It's a worthy film in its own right, with its own virtues ... Either through studying Lee or channeling someone else, Bullock adopts mannerisms and facial expressions that are not her own for this role and then works them into a well-crafted portrait of a highly internal, observant and deep-revolving spirit.

''Infamous'' is inferior, although not drastically so, in almost every respect ... The most obvious comparisons are to be made about performances. Jones is a much more accurate physical representation of Capote than Hoffman, his high-pitched voice sounding a little more affected than his Oscar-winning predecessor. However, the relative shallowness of McGrath's screenplay doesn't offer as many emotional land mines for Jones to play. [He] delivers an uncanny impersonation, while Hoffman's portrayal was a studiously researched impression, a likely more challenging task.
