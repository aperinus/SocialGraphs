It stars [[Sandra Bullock]] as Leigh Anne Tuohy, [[Tim McGraw]] as Sean Tuohy, and [[Quinton Aaron]] as Oher.\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $309 million on a $29 million budget. Despite mixed reviews from critics, Bullock's performance was universally praised, leading to her winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Bullock also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]]. The film also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nSeventeen-year-old Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher has been in foster care with different families in [[Tennessee]], due to his mother's drug addiction, but every time he is placed in a new home, he runs back to her. His friend's father, on whose couch Mike has been sleeping, asks Burt Cotton, the football coach of Wingate Christian School, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Later, Michael is befriended by a younger student named Sean Tuohy, Jr./\"SJ\". SJ's mother, Leigh Anne, is a strong-minded [[interior designer]] and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Sr.\n\nThe school staff tells Michael that his father has died, apparently due to an accident. Later, Leigh Anne and Sean watch their daughter Collins playing volleyball. After the game, Sean notices Michael picking up food discarded on the bleachers. One night, Leigh Anne notices Michael walking alone on the road, shivering in the cold without adequate clothing. When she learns that he plans to spend the night huddled outside the closed school gym, Leigh Anne offers to let him sleep on the couch in the Tuohy home.\n \nThe next morning, Leigh Anne notices that Michael has left. Seeing him walking away, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Later, Leigh Anne drives Michael to his mother's house. He sees an eviction notice posted on the door, indicating that his mother is gone. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the Tuohy family; Leigh Anne's friends question this and suggest that Collins might not be safe around him, but Leigh Anne criticizes them. She later asks Collins how she feels about it. Collins replies that they cannot just throw Michael out. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was taken from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that, although he scored poorly in a career aptitude test, he ranked in the 98th percentile in \"protective instincts\". Michael eventually improves his grades enough that he can play [[American football|football]] at school. However, Michael appears to be hesitant to use his strength and size while practicing, Leigh Anne tells him, as an offensive lineman, he must protect his quarterback. From that moment, Michael improves dramatically, well enough to play at the college level. However, to do that, he must meet the minimum [[Grading in education|grade point average]] to get in so the Tuohys hire a private tutor for him, the outspoken and kind Miss Sue.\n\nLeigh Anne has a face-to-face conversation with Michael's mother about adopting him. Although she seems unresponsive in the beginning, the mother finally wishes Michael the best. Michael is heavily recruited by many prestigious schools. SJ talks to coaches and negotiates on Michael's behalf\u2014and his own. When Michael gets his grades high enough, he decides to attend the [[University of Mississippi]] (known colloquially as \"Ole Miss\"). But as Ole Miss was where Sean Sr. had played basketball, Leigh Anne had been a cheerleader, and Miss Sue had been as well, [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] investigator Granger is tasked to look into the matter to determine if the Tuohys took him in and unduly influenced him just so he would play for their [[alma mater]].\n\nMichael runs away before the interview is over and confronts Leigh Anne about her motives for taking him in. He then proceeds to find his biological mother in Hurt Village. A gang leader welcomes him back, offers him a beer, and makes sexually offensive insinuations about Leigh Anne and Collins. When Michael gets angry, the gang leader threatens to go after them, and as a result, Michael battles with him and other thugs. After thinking things over and questioning Leigh Anne, Michael tells Granger he chose Ole Miss because \"it's where my family goes to school.\" Michael is accepted into college and says his farewells to the Tuohy family.\n\nThe film ends with information about and photos of the real Tuohy family and Michael Oher. He was drafted by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]] and played in the [[National Football League]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast order and roles per \"Page 1\" of closing credits --->\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as [[Leigh Anne Tuohy]], Michael's adoptive mother\n* [[Tim McGraw]] as [[Sean Tuohy]], Michael's adoptive father\n* [[Quinton Aaron]] as [[Michael Oher|Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher]]\n** Brandon Rivers as Young Mike\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Miss Sue\n* [[Jae Head]] as Sean \"S.J.\" Tuohy Jr., Michael's adoptive younger brother\n* [[Lily Collins]] as Collins Tuohy, Michael's adoptive younger sister\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Coach Cotton\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Mrs. Boswell\n* [[Adriane Lenox]] as Denise Oher, Michael's biological mother\n* [[IronE Singleton]] as Alton, a gang leader/drug dealer\n\nA number of [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] coaches and recruiters make brief appearances as themselves: [[Phillip Fulmer]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Tom Lemming]], [[Houston Nutt]], [[Ed Orgeron]], [[Pepper Rodgers|Franklin \"Pepper\" Rodgers]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Tommy Tuberville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=4277330 |title=Prominent coaches turn actors for film |author=Schlabach, Mark |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=June 29, 2009 |access-date=July 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhile Oher's coach from high school, [[Hugh Freeze]], has an uncredited cameo as a coach watching some game film, the role of the high school coach is named Coach Cotton in the film.<ref name=Coaches>{{cite news |url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/7/21/16007256/hugh-freeze-fired-houston-nutt-michael-oher-the-blindside |title=Hugh Freeze, Houston Nutt, and Michael Oher just made 'The Blind Side' super weird |first1=Richard |last1=Johnson |first2=Jason |last2=Kirk |work=[[SB Nation]] |date=July 21, 2017 |access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> [[NFL]] [[NFL commissioner|commissioner]] [[Roger Goodell]] had an uncredited voice cameo announcing Michael's drafting into the [[Baltimore Ravens]] during the [[2009 NFL Draft]].\n\n==Production==\n''The Blind Side'' was produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]] and released by [[Warner Bros.]] The film's production budget was $29 million.<ref name=\"www.boxofficemojo.com\" /> Filming for the school scenes took place at [[Atlanta International School]] and [[The Westminster Schools]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and it features many of their students as extras.

O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented on the performances: \"Ms. Bullock is convincing enough as an energetic, multitasking woman of the New South, who knows her own mind and usually gets her own way. And Tim McGraw, as Leigh Anne's affable husband, Sean, inhabits his character comfortably and knows how to get out of Ms. Bullock's way when necessary.\" He found the movie to be \"made up almost entirely of turning points and yet curiously devoid of drama or suspense\" and called it a \"live-action, reality-based version of a Disney cartoon: it's the heartwarming tale of a foundling taken in by strangers, who accept him even though he's different and treat him as one of their own.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Bullock's character is an \"irrepressible hoot in writer-director John Lee Hancock's otherwise thoroughly conventional take on Michael Lewis' fact-based book.\" In spite of her \"feisty\" and \"energetic\" performance, he felt that there was a lack of development concerning Michael's character: \"Not until the end of the film do we ever get a chance to really see what's going on in Oher's head\u2014how he feels about being the chosen one plucked from the poverty-stricken projects of Memphis and thrown into this protected, nonliberal-leaning environment of privilege.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=15 November 2009 |author=Michael Rechtshaffen |title='The Blind Side': Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/blind-side-review-movie-2009-93755 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> Peter Bradshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Bullock's appearance as \"strangely humourless\" and felt that \"[t]here is something weirdly absent about this performance.\" Overall, he opined that the film provided \"a Photoshopped [''sic''] image of reality that is bland, parochial, and stereotypically acted,\" and concluded: \"There is a rich, complex story to be told about Michael Oher, and his mentor, Leigh Anne Tuohy.

She refers to a scene in which Oher returns to his stereotypically violent former neighbourhood, only leaving when Tuohy rescues him from it. She also argues that  the film portrays Oher as a  simpleton who uses instinct over intellect, as a psychological test concludes that  Oher has little \"ability to learn\" but much \"protective instinct\" (a scientifically nonsensical statement, according to DiAngelo).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Scott|first=A.
