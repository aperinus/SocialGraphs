After the dean threatens to [[expulsion (education)|expel]] him for these activities, Richie tries to win his tuition using his excellent [[poker]] skills in online gambling, but he loses all his money to a cheater, something he can prove by statistics.\n\nRichie travels to [[Costa Rica]] to confront Ivan Block, who runs the biggest empire of online gambling websites in the world, including the one Richie lost his money on. After Ivan sees the statistics, he finds that [[coder]]s have modified the software to allow them to cheat. After firing those involved, Ivan tells Richie he'll pay him millions per year to stay in Costa Rica and assist with the site.\n\nRichie slowly begins a romantic relationship with Rebecca Shafran, ex-lover of Ivan, who appears to have no objections. Ivan has Richie [[blackmail]] a gaming affiliate with videos of his infidelity to force him to sign with Ivan. [[FBI]] Agent Shavers kidnaps Richie and threatens to ruin his life in various ways if he does not assist in getting Ivan convicted. Shavers cannot do anything legally as he has no authority in Costa Rica, but he takes advantage of this to use tactics that would be illegal and unethical for law enforcement inside the U.S. Ivan tells Richie that everyone in the organization ends up confronted by Shavers at some point.\n\nOver time, Ivan's organization is revealed to be less than ethical. He sends Richie to [[bribery|bribe]] Costa Rica gaming director Herrera with too small a payment, which leads to Richie being beaten. Ivan tells him it comes with the territory of such a lucrative career. When Richie tries to leave the country, Shavers has drugs planted in his bag and offers to overlook them if Richie agrees to cooperate. A local police officer reveals that the police dislike Ivan but that he would buy his way out of any trouble and destroy whoever tried to take him down.\n\nRichie's friend Andrew Cronin, who works on the software design for Ivan, suggests that Ivan is running a [[Ponzi scheme]]; the players' accounts have no actual money, and Ivan uses the money as his bank account, keeping just enough to allow players to cash out when they need to. Aware that Richie might be wanting out, Ivan buys the massive poker debts of Richie's father and brings him to Costa Rica, using him as a hostage.\n\nIvan throws Herrera and his bodyguard into the river to get eaten by the crocodiles but pulls them out before they are eaten. Cronin disappears and is later found nearly beaten to death. Thanks to Rebecca betraying Ivan, Richie finds out that he has been setting him up all along; Ivan is about to move his operations out of Costa Rica, planning to leave Richie behind as the [[fall guy]]. Richie gives out massive bribes to local officials, including low-level police officers. When the moving day hits, Ivan calls to sarcastically apologize to Richie, telling him he will be busted, as Ivan flies away on a private jet.\n\nWhen Ivan lands, he finds he has been betrayed: the bribed pilot has instead flown him to [[Puerto Rico]], an American territory. Shavers and other FBI agents move in to arrest him as Richie and Rebecca fly away on the private jet. Shavers says they are free to go because Richie left a flash drive for him containing sufficient evidence to convict Ivan.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Billed Cast members with roles as listed in film -->\n<!-- Add other notable cast members outside bulleted list with citations -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Richie Furst\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as Rebecca Shafran\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Agent Shavers\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Ivan Block\n* [[Michael Esper]] as Billy \"Pet\" Petricoff\n* [[Oliver Cooper]] as Andrew Cronin\n* Christian George as Wilson\n* [[Yul Vazquez]] as Delegate Herrera\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Harry Furst\n* James Molina as Esteban\n* [[Louis Lombardi]] as Archie\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as Sergeant Barrancas\n* Bernie O.
