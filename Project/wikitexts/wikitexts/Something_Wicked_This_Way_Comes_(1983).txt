It stars [[Jason Robards]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Diane Ladd]], and [[Pam Grier]].\n\nThe title was taken from a line in Act IV of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'': \"By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes.\"\n\nThe film was shot in [[Vermont]] and at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]]. It had a troubled production \u2013 Clayton fell out with Bradbury over an uncredited script rewrite, and after test screenings of the director's cut failed to meet the studio's expectations, Disney sidelined Clayton, fired the original editor, and scrapped the original score, spending some $5 million and many months re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring the film before its eventual release.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Green Town, [[Illinois]], two young boys, a reserved Will Halloway, and somewhat rebellious Jim Nightshade, leave from an after-school detention for \"whispering in class\" and hurry off for home. The boys live next door to each other and were born a minute apart on Halloween. Will lives with his grey-haired father Charles and mother while Jim lives with his single mother; it is heavily implied that his father walked out on them. A lightning rod salesman named Tom Fury arrives and sells one to Jim, claiming that it will protect him from an upcoming storm. The boys soon hear of a carnival coming to town led by the ominous Mr. Dark.\n\nThe carnival arrives and is set up overnight. Will and Jim notice that many of the residents seem oddly entranced by some of the attractions such as the amputee bartender Ed who sees his missing arm and leg return in a mirror and the boys' teacher Miss Foley who wishes to regain her youth. Will and Jim see a carousel that is closed off and are confronted by Mr. Dark who quickly becomes suspicious of them. Later, they witness Mr. Dark using the carousel on his assistant Mr. Cooger who reverts to a little boy. Will and Jim head off to see Foley, but she is with her \"nephew\" who is actually Cooger and are forced to leave.\n\nFoley suddenly becomes younger, but loses her vision and is taken by Cooger to Dark. Will gets into an argument with Jim when the latter reveals that he has always been envious of the former being older and wants to use the carousel. However, they witness Fury being tortured by Mr. Dark who wants the secret of the upcoming storm and uses his other assistant the Dust Witch to seduce him, but to no avail. The boys run when they are found out and try to go to bed. In the middle of the night, the two are attacked by spiders, but the lightning rod that Fury gave Jim earlier saves them.\n\nIn the morning, Mr. Dark leads his carnival, now consisting of some of the townspeople, in a parade though Will and Jim deduce that it is a search party for them. Charles eventually figures out that the boys are in trouble and when confronted by Mr. Dark manages to deter him. Charles, Will and Jim head to the library where the former reveals that the carnival had come to town before and that his own father had fought them. Mr. Dark arrives searching for Will and Jim and offers Charles his youth back, but he resists. He knocks out Charles and makes off with the boys back to the carnival. Charles regains himself and heads to the carnival just as the storm arrives. He runs into Jim's mother and deters her before she too succumbs to Mr. Dark's powers.\n\nCharles heads into the hall of mirrors where Mr. Dark continues to taunt him about his age. However, Will declares his love for his father and repels the Dust Witch, allowing Fury to escape his imprisonment and impale her with a lightning rod. Will and Charles find Mr. Dark attempting to use the carousel with Jim in tow, but they rescue him just as lightning strikes the ride. As Mr. Dark begins to age and decay, Will and Charles express happiness to awaken Jim and the three flee just as the carnival begins to get sucked away into a giant twister. Will, Jim and Charles head back into town and begin to happily dance back home, with the danger now over.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Charles Halloway\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Mr. Dark\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Mrs. Nightshade\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Tom Fury\n* Vidal Peterson as Will Halloway\n** [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]] as Adult Will (Narrator)\n* Shawn Carson as Jim Nightshade\n* [[Mary Grace Canfield]] as Miss Foley\n** Sharan Lea as Young Miss Foley\n* [[Richard Davalos]] as Mr. Crosetti\n* [[Jack Dodson]] as Dr. Douglas\n* [[Bruce M.

Financing for the project never came, and Bradbury converted the screenplay into a novel, published in 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=58083|title=Detail view of Movies Page|website=www.afi.com|access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Bradbury agreed to write a new screenplay based on the novel for [[Jack Clayton]], who Bradbury previously worked with on ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In January 1973, [[Sam Peckinpah]] was announced as director for the film, with a script written by Bradbury.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daily News-Post from Monrovia, California on January 7, 1974 \u00b7 9|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/606940420/|access-date=2021-06-19|website=Newspapers.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy June 1976, Clayton had returned as director and the property was being developed by [[The Bryna Company]], a film production company formed by [[Kirk Douglas]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, California on July 28, 1976 \u00b7 Page 87|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/166561154/|access-date=2021-06-19|website=Newspapers.com|language=en}}</ref> Douglas became interested in the property after meeting Bradbury at a bookstore in [[Los Angeles]], and initially intended to star in the film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Douglas' son [[Peter Douglas]] was the producer of the film alongside [[Robert Chartoff]] and [[Irwin Winkler]]. They secured a deal with Paramount Pictures to finance the $6,000,000 production, which was to be filmed on location in [[Texas]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cinefantastique|url=http://archive.org/details/cinefantastique-v-05-n-02-fall-1976|title=Cinefantastique V 05 N 02 ( Fall 1976)|date=1976-10-01}}</ref> However, production never began and the film was eventually put into [[Turnaround (film industry term)|turnaround]] by Paramount CEO [[Barry Diller]] over the objections of feature division president [[David V. Picker]]. At various times, [[Mark Rydell]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] expressed interest in making the film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt this time [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was concentrating on films with more mature themes in an attempt to break free from their stereotype as an animation and family film studio. In 1981, Disney acquired the film rights to ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' and announced that it would go into production with a $16 million budget.<ref name=\":0\" /> The studio sought Bradbury's input on selecting a cast and director, and he suggested Clayton feeling they had worked well together at Paramount. Peter Douglas returned as the film's producer, but Kirk Douglas was unable to appear in the film despite playing a major role in its pre-production.<ref name=\":0\" /> In a 1981 issue of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Bradbury stated that his top choices to play Mr. Dark were [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. However, Disney decided to go with a relatively unknown actor instead in order to keep the budget down, and [[Jonathan Pryce]] was eventually cast.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on September 28, 1981, and progressed for 77 days. The production was mostly filmed on Disney's [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Newhall, California]], as shooting it on location would have been too costly.  Some exterior scenes were shot in [[Vermont]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the film progressed, two differing visions emerged for the film, with Bradbury and Clayton wishing to stay as faithful to the novel as possible, while Disney wanted to make a more accessible and family friendly film. Bradbury and Clayton fell out during production after Bradbury discovered that Clayton had hired writer [[John Mortimer]] to do an uncredited revision of Bradbury's screenplay at the studio's insistence.<ref>{{cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|url=https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bradburychronicl00well/page/306 306\u2013309]|isbn=0-06-054581-X}}</ref>\n\nAt a Q&A session following a 2012 screening of the film, actor Shawn Carson explained that he originally read some 10 times for the part of Will, but after a request from Bradbury, he read for and was cast in the part of Jim Nightshade instead. Although he had blond hair at the time, and co-star Vidal Petersen had dark hair, Carson's hair was dyed jet black and Petersen's was bleached blond to fit the new casting.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://vimeo.com/31208106|title=Something Wicked This Way Comes Q&A after screening With Shawn Carson and Barry Gordon |work=Vimeo }}</ref>\n\nFor the original score, Clayton picked [[Georges Delerue]] who had scored his films ''[[The Pumpkin Eater]]'' and ''[[Our Mother's House]]'', but his score (considered \"too dark\" by Disney) was later removed and replaced at short notice with a score by [[James Horner]]. A soundtrack album of Delerue's unused score was released by [[Intrada Records]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Expanded 'Edward Scissorhands' Soundtrack and Unused 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' Score to Be Released|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/12/08/expanded-edward-scissorhands-soundtrack-and-unused-something-wicked-this-way-comes-score-to-be-released/|website=Film Music Reporter|access-date=December 8, 2015|date=December 8, 2015}}</ref> Horner's replacement score was previously released by the same label in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/James-Horner-Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes-Original-Motion-Picture-Score/master/415027|title=James Horner - Something Wicked This Way Comes (Original Motion Picture Score)|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nEditor Barry Gordon was hired as assistant to the film's original editor, [[Argyle Nelson Jr.]] He recalled in 2012 that after Clayton submitted his original cut, Disney expressed concerns about the film's length, pacing and commercial appeal; the studio then took the project out of Clayton's hands and undertook an expensive six-month reshoot and re-edit. Nelson was let go for budgetary reasons, and although Gordon was originally prepared to follow Nelson and leave the production, Nelson encouraged him to stay, and Gordon edited the final cut (resulting in the film's dual editor credits).\n\nDisney spent an additional $5 million on re-filming, re-editing, and re-scoring the picture, and Gordon was required to make a number of changes to Clayton and Nelson's original cut, removing several major special-effects scenes, and incorporating the new material directed by visual effects artist [[Lee Dyer]], including a new spoken prologue narrated by [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]]. Among the casualties was a groundbreaking animation scene, which would have been one of the first major uses of [[computer-generated imaging]] in a Hollywood film; combining the then new technology of [[Computer animation|CGI]] with traditional animation, it depicted Dark's circus train rolling into town, and the carnival magically materialising \u2013 the smoke from the locomotive becomes the ropes and tents, tree limbs grow together to form a ferris wheel, and a spider web morphs into a wheel of fortune. The deleted scene was previewed in detail in the May\u2013June 1983 issue of ''[[Twilight Zone Magazine]]'', but in the event, the re-edit retained only a few seconds of the sequence. Another cut sequence depicted Mr. Dark using his sinister powers to send a huge disembodied hand to reach into the house to grab the boys \u2013 this mechanical effect was deemed not realistic enough by Disney executives, and was replaced by a new scene in which the room is invaded by hundreds of spiders. This was shot using real spiders, and years later Shawn Carson recalled the considerable discomfort he and Vidal Petersen experienced as a result being exposed to the irritating [[urticating hair]]s of the 200 tarantulas used in the sequence.\n\nThe original themes of Bradbury's novel, the suggestion of menace, the autumn atmosphere of an American Midwest township and the human relationships between characters that attracted Clayton escaped preview audiences completely, with Clayton heavily criticized. New special effects sequences were shot and a hastily composed new score by composer James Horner replaced Delerue's original music.<ref>Lerouge, Stephanie ''Georges Delerue Unused Scores'' 2011 CD liner notes</ref> Initial test screenings did not fare well with audiences, and Disney re-commissioned Bradbury to write an opening narration sequence and new ending.\n\nBradbury referred to the film's final cut as \"not a great film, no, but a decently nice one.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ray|last=Bradbury|title=Bradbury Speaks: Too Soon from the Cave, Too Far from the Stars|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow|year=2005|isbn=0-06-058568-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/bradburyspeaksto00brad/page/10 10]|url=https://archive.org/details/bradburyspeaksto00brad/page/10}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad scenes were filmed on the [[Sierra Railroad]] in [[Tuolumne County, California]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Jensen | first =Larry | author-link = | title =Hollywood's Railroads: Sierra Railroad | publisher =Cochetopa Press | series = | volume = Two| edition = | date =2018 | location =Sequim, Washington | pages =60 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RNswEACAAJ&dq=Hollywood%27s+Railroads&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKgvSWqYncAhXqhFQKHQdfCaAQ6AEINjAE | doi = | id = | isbn =9780692064726 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref>\n\n== Lost / rejected original version ==\n\nThe Center for Ray Bradbury Studies in Indianapolis have a copy of the original cut on VHS which may be the only surviving copy of Jack Clayton's original cut.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film grossed $8.4 million at the domestic box office against its $20 million budget.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''Chicago Sun Times'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote: \"It's one of the few literary adaptations I've seen in which the film not only captures the mood and tone of the novel, but also the novel's style. Bradbury's prose is a strange hybrid of craftsmanship and lyricism. He builds his stories and novels in a straightforward way, with strong plotting, but his sentences owe more to [[Thomas Wolfe]] than to the pulp tradition, and the lyricism isn't missed in this movie. In its descriptions of autumn days, in its heartfelt conversations between a father and a son, in the unabashed romanticism of its evil carnival and even in the perfect rhythm of its title, this is a horror movie with elegance.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=April 29, 1983 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Something Wicked This Way Comes |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/something-wicked-this-way-comes-1983 |access-date=October 10, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote the film \"begins on such an overworked [[Norman Rockwell]] note that there seems little chance that anything exciting or unexpected will happen. So it's a happy surprise when the film...turns into a lively, entertaining tale combining boyishness and grown-up horror in equal measure;\" according to Maslin, \"The gee-whiz quality to this adventure is far more excessive in Mr. Bradbury's novel than it is here, as directed by Jack Clayton.
