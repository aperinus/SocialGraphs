In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013.

It grossed over $542 million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director.

Please do not add to it without checking wordcount first.-->\nA beautiful and kind-hearted girl named Ella and her parents live happily in a large house with a few servants, until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries recently-widowed Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, forcing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move into the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money, and forces all of their chores upon Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[Ember|cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught over her step-family's treatment of her, Ella rides off into the woods, where she encounters Kit, the [[crown prince]], out hunting. He hides that he is a prince, and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nThat night, as her step-family is preparing to leave for the ball, Ella attempts to join them, wearing a refashioned dress of her mother's. Lady Tremaine and her daughters destroy the dress and leave Ella behind. She runs out to the garden in tears, and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into [[footmen]], and a goose into the [[coachman]]. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ball gown, and gives her a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the magic will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's step-family from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, Kit is delighted to see Ella and gives her the first dance. The Grand Duke, having promised Kit to the Princess Chelina of [[Zaragoza]] for political reasons, expresses his annoyance and is overheard by Lady Tremaine. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella bonds with the Prince. Before she can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her glass slippers. The Grand Duke pursues her; however, when the magic dissipates, Cinderella is able to hide in the woods. She returns home and hides the remaining glass slipper under the floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now the new king, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity. However, Lady Tremaine has found the slipper first, and declares she will only allow Ella to marry Kit on the condition that Ella make Lady Tremaine head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for the stepsisters. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, reveals the truth to him, and suggests the kingdom will be embarrassed by the \"scandal\" if a scullion marries the King. The Grand Duke agrees to make Lady Tremaine a countess, and secure her daughters advantageous marriages, if she will keep Ella and the truth hidden forever.\n\nAt the insistence of King Kit, who is unaware of these developments, the Grand Duke and the Captain of the Guard try the one intact slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it magically refuses to fit anyone. At Ella's house, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, then hears Ella singing \"[[Lavender's Blue]]\". The Grand Duke urges the group to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return. Ella and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother years ago.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits,

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F. Horn]] wished to make the film the \"definitive ''Cinderella'' for generations to come,\" and told him that \"if you need to spend a little more, spend it, to make sure it's one for the time capsule.\"<ref name=\"Rainey\">{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=James|title=Disney's Alan Horn Uses Low-Key Approach, Keen Creative Vision to Find Hits of the Future|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/alan-horn-disney-chairman-1201749971/|access-date=December 14, 2016|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media|date=April 11, 2016|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nThree-time Oscar-winning costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] was in charge of the costumes for the film. Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Carter said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colours. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolour painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train,\" said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand-painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite
