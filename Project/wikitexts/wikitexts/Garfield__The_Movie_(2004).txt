It is a live-action adaptation to [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]' [[Garfield|comic strip of the same name]]. Directed by [[Peter Hewitt (film director)|Peter Hewitt]], it stars [[Breckin Meyer]] as [[Jon Arbuckle]], [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as Dr. Liz Wilson and features [[Bill Murray]] as the voice of [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]], who was created with [[computer-generated imagery]], though all other animals were real. The film was produced by [[Davis Entertainment|Davis Entertainment Company]] and [[20th Century Fox]]. It was released in the United States on June 11, 2004. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $200 million on a $50 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> A sequel, ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties]]'', was released in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Garfield A Tail of Two Kitties (2006) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8ba1ffdc |access-date=2022-07-21 |website=BFI |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Garfield (character)|Garfield]], a fat, lazy and free-spirited orange cat, lives with his owner Jon Arbuckle in [[Los Angeles]], and passes his time by antagonizing Jon and teasing his aggressive [[Dobermann]] neighbor, Luca. Aside from Jon, Garfield maintains an unlikely friendship with a helpful mouse, [[Louis (Garfield)|Louis]], by constantly sparing him, and also socializes with his fellow neighborhood cats, [[List of characters in the Garfield franchise#Nermal|Nermal]] and [[List of characters in the Garfield franchise#Arlene|Arlene]].\n\nJon has begun habitually bringing Garfield to the [[veterinarian]], in order to see vet Dr. Liz Wilson, whom he is in love with. Jon tries to ask Liz out, but due to a misunderstanding, Jon is given custody of a dog named [[Odie]], who is lovable, playful and friendly. Regardless, Jon and Liz begin dating. Garfield, however, begins to dislike Odie and pokes fun at him in any given moment. Odie is brought to a [[dog show|canine talent show]], where Liz is a judge. Garfield gets involved in an altercation there with other dogs, which moves Odie to the center of the ring, where he does a successful [[Dance improvisation|improvised dance]] to the [[Black Eyed Peas]]' \"[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]\". A local television host named Happy Chapman, who is also a judge, is impressed with Odie's performance, and offers Jon a television deal for Odie, but Jon declines.\n\nWhen Garfield returns home, frustrated over Odie's presence in his life, he hits a ball, causing a chain reaction that leaves the house in disarray. When Jon finds out, he forces Garfield to sleep outside for the night. When Odie comes out to comfort Garfield, he gets inside and deliberately locks Odie out. Nermal and Arlene witness this as Odie runs away but is then picked up by an elderly woman named Mrs. Baker. Jon and Liz search for Odie while Garfield's friends angrily ridicule him for locking Odie out and making him run away the night before, although Garfield claims that he didn't mean for it to happen.\n\nMeanwhile, Happy Chapman, revealed to be allergic to cats, is jealous of his news reporter brother, Walter, and wants to be more by performing on \"[[Good Day New York]]\". Chapman and his assistant Wendell find a notice Mrs. Baker created of Odie and, recognizing the lucrative possibilities, claim Odie as Happy's own. When Garfield sees Odie on television and hears Chapman announce he and Odie are going to [[New York City]], Garfield sets out to rescue Odie. Jon discovers Garfield is also missing, so he tells Liz to start searching for him and Odie. Garfield gets into the broadcast tower via the air vents and finds Odie locked in a kennel, but Chapman enters and secures a shock collar to Odie, which, when activated, releases an electric shock that forces Odie to perform tricks.\n\nChapman heads for the [[train station]] with Garfield in close pursuit. However, an animal control officer catches Garfield, mistaking him as a stray. Meanwhile, Mrs. Baker tells Jon that Chapman took Odie, making him believe Garfield was taken by Chapman as well and then learn Chapman is leaving for the train station. Concurrently, Chapman's abandoned feline star Persnikitty, who dubs himself ''Sir Roland'', along with the other animals, releases Garfield from the pound. Chapman boards a New York-bound train, with Odie in the luggage car. After arriving just to see the train depart, Garfield sneaks into the train system control room and switches the tracks, leading to an impending multiple train wreck. Garfield hits an emergency stop button which halts all the trains just in the nick of time, then returns Chapman's train to the station. Garfield frees Odie and they prepare to leave. However, Chapman chases them and eventually corners the duo in a suitcase area. Chapman threatens Odie with the shock collar, but Garfield's friends from the pound, Louis & his entire rat family (whom Garfield had run into earlier), led by Sir Roland, attack Chapman and place the collar on his neck.\n\nShortly after, Garfield and Odie subdue Chapman by activating the collar. Jon and Liz arrive and find Chapman, whom Jon punches in the face for kidnapping his pets. Garfield, Odie, Jon, and Liz reunite and return home, while Chapman is arrested for his supposed involvement with the trains, as well as kidnapping Odie. Back home, Garfield regains his friends' respect as they hail him as a hero. Liz and Jon form a relationship, and Garfield learns a lesson about friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as [[Jon Arbuckle]], [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] and [[Odie]]'s owner.\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as [[Dr. Liz Wilson]], Garfield's vet, and Jon's love interest.\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as [[Happy Chapman]], a local television host, and his brother Walter J.
