The main location for filming was the estate of [[Castello di Brolio]], and a small villa on the property.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\nAmerican Lucy ([[Liv Tyler]]), 19, daughter of the (now deceased) poet and model, Sara Harmon, arrives at the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] villa of her mom's friends Ian and Diana Grayson ([[Donal McCann]] and [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]]). Other guests are: a NYC art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and dying English writer, Alex Parrish ([[Jeremy Irons]]).\n\nGoing for a swim, Lucy finds Diana's daughter Miranda Fox ([[Rachel Weisz]]) with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed ([[D. W. Moffett]]). Her brother, Christopher ([[Joseph Fiennes]]), has yet to arrive, on a road trip with Niccol\u00f2 Donati ([[Roberto Zibetti]]) from a nearby villa. Lucy hoped to see Niccol\u00f2, as she had met him four years ago and was her first kiss. They had briefly written; one letter in particular she had memorised.\n\nLucy's father sent her so Ian could sculpt her, but it's an excuse for him to send her to Italy. Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals she is a virgin, which he shares with the rest of the villa the next day. Furious, she decides to end her visit. However, before she can book the flight, Christopher and Niccol\u00f2 appear, and Lucy is happy, but disappointed Niccol\u00f2 did not recognise her.\n\nThat evening, Niccol\u00f2 and his brother, Osvaldo (Ignazio Oliva) come to the Graysons'. After dinner, the youth separate from the adults to smoke. Lucy is now over Parrish's betrayal, and they take turns recounting how they each lost their virginity. When it's Osvaldo's turn, he demurs, saying, \"I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one going on over there [at the adults' table].\" Lucy fawns over Niccol\u00f2 but gets sick on him.\n\nThe next day Lucy cycles to the Donati's, seeking Niccol\u00f2. She's told he's in the garden, where Lucy finds him with another. Upset, she hastily cycles away from the compound. When she passes Osvaldo, he cries out, \"Ciao, Lucy!\", she doesn't hear, then crashes. Ignoring his offer to help, she rides on.\n\nLucy, posing outdoors for Ian's sketch, exposes one of her breasts. When Niccol\u00f2 and Osvaldo arrive by car, Niccol\u00f2 ogles Lucy, but Osvaldo looks away. Lucy wanders off into an adjacent olive grove, followed by Niccol\u00f2. They begin to kiss, but Lucy soon pushes him away.\n\nRetreating to the guest house, Lucy shares her notebook with Parrish. It is one of her mother's last notebooks, containing a poem Lucy thinks holds clues to the identity of her real father. Throughout the film, she has been asking probing questions about her mother. Did Parrish ever know Sara to wear green sandals? Had Ian ever eaten olive leaves? Had Carlo Lisca ([[Carlo Cecchi]]), a war correspondent friend of the Graysons whom Sara had known, ever killed a viper? These images are all found in the poem, which Lucy now reads to Parrish. He agrees it must refer to her dad.\n\nThat evening, Lucy wears her mother's dress to the Donati's annual party. Soon after arriving, she sees Niccol\u00f2 with another girl and they do not speak. then she sees Osvaldo playing clarinet in the band. Later seeing him dancing with a girl, they exchange earnest glances. Lucy picks up a young Englishman to take back to the Grayson's villa. On the way out, Osvaldo chases Lucy down, saying he's interested in visiting America and would like advice. They agree to meet the next day. The Englishman spends the night with her at the villa, but without sex.\n\nThe next day, Parrish is hospitalized. Lucy skulks around his quarters in the guest house afterwards. Looking out a window, seeing Ian's sculpture of a mother and child, she has an epiphany. Lucy asks Ian where he was in August 1975, when she was conceived. He says he was here, fixing up the villa, possibly when he was doing Lucy's mother's portrait. He says they could ask Diana, but then remembers she was in London, finalizing her divorce. Without explicitly saying so, they realize Ian is Lucy's biological father, and she promises to keep the secret.\n\nMeanwhile, Osvaldo arrives. Lucy gets stung by bees as she exits Ian's studio so he helps, putting clay on the welts. Walking through the countryside, Osvaldo confesses he wrote to her once. This was the letter Lucy loved above all, the one she knew by heart. Osvaldo then takes her to the tree from the letter.\n\nLucy and Osvaldo spend the night under the tree. As they part the next morning, Osvaldo reveals that it was his first time, too.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Lucy Harmon\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as Christopher Fox\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Alex Parrish\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] as Diana Grayson\n* [[Donal McCann]] as Ian Grayson\n* Rebecca Valpy as Daisy Grayson\n* [[Jean Marais]] (in his last film role) as M.

\"The movie plays like the kind of line a rich older guy would lay on a teenage model, suppressing his own intelligence and irony in order to spread out before her the wonderful world he would like to give her as a gift....The problem here is that many 19-year-old women, especially the beautiful international model types, would rather stain their teeth with cigarettes and go to discos with cretins
