'''''The Pitfall''''' and '''''Kashi To Kodomo''''', is a 1962 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] directed by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]], written by [[K\u014db\u014d Abe]]. It was Teshigahara's first feature, and the first of his four film collaborations with Abe, the others being ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'', ''[[The Face of Another (film)|The Face of Another]]'' and ''[[The Man Without a Map]]''. Unlike the others, which are based on novels by Abe, ''Pitfall'' was originally a television play called Purgatory (Rengoku).<ref name=\"thesis\">[http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/bitstream/1828/301/1/The%20Word%20and%20The%20Image.pdf The Word and The Image: Collaborations between Abe K\u00f4b\u00f4 and Teshigahara Hiroshi - Yuji Matson]</ref> The film has been included in [[The Criterion Collection]].\n\n==Plot==\n''Pitfall'' is set against the background of labour relations in the [[Japan]]ese [[mining]] industry, but the film owes as much to [[surrealism]] as it does to \"socially aware\" drama. The mine in the film is divided into two pits, the old one and the new one, each represented by a different [[trade union]] faction. A mysterious man in white, whose identity we never learn,  murders an unemployed miner who bears an uncanny resemblance to the union leader at the old pit and bribes the only witness to frame the union leader of the new pit. The two union leaders go to the murder scene to investigate only to come across the body of the witness, who has subsequently been killed by the man in white. They blame one another and begin a fight which ends in the deaths of both. The film ends with the man in white observing them before riding off on his motorcycle, satisfied his mission is complete. Beyond this realistic plot, ''Pitfall'' shows us the realm of the dead as well as the living, as the ghosts of the victims look on, powerless to intervene in events and bring the truth to light.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Hisashi Igawa]] - Miner / Otsuka\n*[[Sumie Sasaki]] - Shopkeeper\n*[[Sen Yano]] - Toyama\n*[[Hideo Kanze]] - Policeman\n*[[Kunie Tanaka]] - Man in white suit\n*[[Kei Sat\u014d]] - Reporter\n\n==Production==\nThe film's focus on the exploitation of coal miners was likely influenced by Teshigahara and Abe's political leanings, and their sympathy with the Tokyo demonstrations in 1960 against [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Anpo]].<ref name=\"criterion\">James Quandt, Video Essay included on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release of ''Pitfall''</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], and incorporates [[stock footage]] of mining disasters and starvation that had afflicted the area.<ref name=\"criterion\"/> Many of the visual devices and themes are similar to the contemporaneous work of [[Sh\u014dhei Imamura]], whose 1959 film ''[[My Second Brother]]'' also featured Ky\u016bsh\u016b coal miners.<ref name=\"criterion\"/>\n\nTeshigahara often disagreed with his film crew, and fired two assistant directors who did not wish to include the scene in which the policeman rapes the shopkeeper.<ref name=\"criterion\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Pitfall'' was first distributed by [[Japan Art Theatre Guild]] (ATG) on a limited release on July 1, 1962.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=211}} ATG had only began distributing films on April 20, 1962.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=211}}\n\nThe film then appeared to be acquired by [[Toho]] for wider release on June 6, 1964.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=211}} The film was released in the United States in 1964 through Toho International.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=211}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*Booklet and commentary by [[Tony Rayns]] to the Eureka Masters of Cinema DVD edition.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0203612}}\n* {{Amg movie|229277}}\n* ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130121135521/http://www.filmref.com/directors/dirpages/teshigahara.html#pitfall Pitfall]'' at Strictly Film School\n* ''[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1962/cl002140.htm Pitfall]'' at the Japanese Movie Database {{in lang|ja}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/608-pitfall-outdoor-miner ''Pitfall: Outdoor Miner''] an essay by Howard Hampton at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Hiroshi Teshigahara}}\n\n[[Category:1962 films]]\n[[Category:1962 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Japanese avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Japanese drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Japanese black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films about the labor movement]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara]]\n[[Category:Toho films]]\n[[Category:1960s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
