Directed by [[John Huston]] and written by [[Carol Sobieski]], the cast includes [[Albert Finney]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Ann Reinking]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Geoffrey Holder]], [[Edward Herrmann]], with [[Aileen Quinn]] as the title character.<ref name=\"Annie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67443/Annie/full-credits.html|title=Annie|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030144207/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67443/Annie/full-credits.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the first film adaptation of the musical. \n\nSet during the [[Great Depression]] in 1933, the film tells the story of Annie, an orphan from New York City who is taken in by America's richest billionaire, [[Oliver Warbucks]]. [[Principal photography]] took place for six weeks at [[Monmouth University]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1981.\n\nProduced by [[Ray Stark]]'s Rastar and released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on May 21, 1982, ''Annie'' received mixed reviews from film critics and grossed $57 million on a $35 million budget. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Song Score and its Adaptation]]. A [[television film]] [[sequel]], titled ''[[Annie: A Royal Adventure!]]'' was released in 1995.  Then it was followed by three additional adaptations of the musical. In their first film collaboration, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] produced [[Annie (1999 film)|a second film adaptation]] made-for-television in 1999. Columbia released [[Annie (2014 film)|a third film adaptation]] on December 19, 2014.  A [[Annie Live!|fourth adaptation]] which was a live production of the musical was performed on December 2, 2021, on [[NBC]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1933, during the [[Great Depression]], a young [[orphan]] named Annie is living in the Hudson Street Orphanage in [[New York City]]. It is run by Agatha Hannigan, a cruel alcoholic who forces the orphans to clean the building daily. With half of a locket as her only possession, she remains optimistic that her parents, who left her on the doorstep as a baby, will return for her. Annie sneaks out with help from laundry man, Mr. Bundles, adopting a stray dog which she names Sandy. However, Annie is escorted back to the orphanage.\n\nGrace Farrell, secretary to billionaire [[Oliver Warbucks]], arrives to invite an orphan to live with Warbucks for a week, to improve his public image. Annie is chosen and she and Sandy travel to Warbucks' mansion, meeting his many servants and two bodyguards, Punjab and the Asp. Warbucks, at first dismissive of Annie due to her being female, is charmed into letting her stay. He takes Annie and Grace to [[Radio City Music Hall]] to watch a movie, ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'', and Warbucks begin to develop affection for Annie. Grace urges him to adopt Annie and he meets with Miss Hannigan, convincing her to sign the adoption papers.\n\nWarbucks reveals his plans to Annie, even offering her a new locket, but she declines. She explains the purpose of her broken locket and her hope that her parents will return with the other half. Warbucks appears on Bert Healy's radio show and offers $50,000 to find Annie's parents. This causes mass hysteria with many would-be parents appearing to claim the money. To escape the madness, Warbucks flies Annie to the [[White House]] in Washington D.C., introducing her to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]]. Roosevelt informs them of his plan to introduce a social welfare program to help America's impoverished and asks Warbucks to head it; Annie encourages him to help. Upon returning home, Annie is disheartened when Grace reveals none of the potential parents knew about the locket.\n\nHannigan is visited by her [[con artist]] brother Rooster and his girlfriend, Lily St. Regis; they plot to pose as Annie's parents to gain the reward. The trio searches the orphans' belongings and Hannigan reveals Annie's parents were killed in a fire; she possesses the other half of the locket. Annie's friends overhear the conversation and try sneaking out, but are discovered and locked away. Rooster and Lily succeed with the ruse, and Annie's departure from Warbucks is sombre. Annie is kidnapped minutes after leaving, but her friends reach Warbucks and tell him the truth; he informs the police, beginning a city-wide search.\n\nAnnie convinces the felons to pull over, only to escape and destroy Warbucks' cheque. Rooster chases Annie up a bridge in an effort to kill her; when Hannigan realizes his intentions, she desperately tries to stop him, but Rooster easily knocks her out and continues climbing. Punjab rescues Annie from Rooster and reunites her with Warbucks and Grace. Rooster and Lily are arrested and Annie is officially adopted by Warbucks. At a party that the orphans, a redeemed Hannigan, and the Roosevelts attend, Warbucks gives Annie the new locket as they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aileen Quinn]] as Annie Bennett Warbucks, a 10-year-old orphan girl.

He loves this kind of high risk situation.\"<ref name=times>Turan, Kenneth.

SM 40, May 2, 1982.</ref> The film cost over $35 million, with some suggesting it cost as much as $59 million after marketing and distribution, making it one of the most expensive films at the time, and the most expensive project financed by Columbia Pictures up to that point.<ref name=budget/>\n\n===Writing===\nSobieski, who wrote the screenplay, introduced major differences between the stage musical and the film adaptation. In the stage musical, it is [[Christmas]] when Miss Hannigan, Rooster and Lily are caught at the Warbucks mansion by the [[United States Secret Service]] thus foiling their plan to kidnap Annie, while in the film (due to summertime shooting) Annie ''is'' kidnapped and on the eve of the [[Fourth of July]], leading to Warbucks organizing a citywide search and a climactic ending on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&O Bridge]]. Punjab and The Asp, Warbucks's servants/bodyguards, from the original comic strip, appear in the film in supporting roles.\n\nMiss Hannigan's redemption at the end is also a new development on the part of the film \u2013 in the musical, Miss Hannigan briefly balks at Rooster's intention to make Annie \"disappear\" with his switchblade, but is soon lured by his promises of a life on Easy Street. In Meehan's 1980 novelization, Miss Hannigan shows no qualms whatsoever about Annie being killed. In both of these media, Miss Hannigan ends up being arrested alongside Rooster and Lily at the Warbucks mansion.\n\nThe film also featured five new songs, \"Dumb Dog\", \"Sandy\", \"Let's Go to the Movies\", \"Sign\" and \"We Got Annie\", and cut \"We'd like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover\", \"N.Y.C\", \"You Won't Be an Orphan for Long\", \"Something Was Missing\", \"Annie\" and \"New Deal for Christmas\". In addition, the song \"Maybe\" has two reprises whereas \"Little Girls\" and \"Easy Street\" do not.\n\n[[Martin Charnin]], the lyricist of ''Annie'', was not impressed with the cinematic interpretation. In a 1996 interview, he dismissed the adaptation and its production. \"The movie distorted what this musical was\", Charnin reported. \"And we were culpable for the reason that we did not exercise any kind of creative control because we sold the rights for a considerable amount of money.\" Charnin even said that Huston, who had never directed a musical before, and producer Ray Stark made major changes in the film that destroyed the essence of ''Annie''. Warbucks, played by Finney, \"was an Englishman who screamed\". Hannigan, played by Burnett, was \"a man-crazy drunk\", and Annie was \"cute-ed up\". Worse, the emotional relationship between Annie and Warbucks was distorted. They even downplayed the hit song \"Tomorrow\" because \"Stark thought it was corny\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Rizzo|first=Frank|title=Another Tomorrow For 'Annie,' Goodspeed's Guardian Angel|url=http://articles.courant.com/1996-09-29/entertainment/9609270030_1_charnin-first-goodspeed-opera-house-broadway-annie/2|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=September 29, 1996|access-date=June 7, 2012|archive-date=March 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324112924/http://articles.courant.com/1996-09-29/entertainment/9609270030_1_charnin-first-goodspeed-opera-house-broadway-annie/2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Woodrow Wilson Hall, West Long Branch, NJ - south view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shadow Lawn (New Jersey)|Wilson Hall]], at [[Monmouth University]] campus, New Jersey, was used as the exteriors of Oliver Warbucks's mansion.]]\n[[File:Erie-Lackawanna bascule E Newark jeh.jpg|thumb|right|The [[NX Bridge]] over the [[Passaic River]] in [[New Jersey]] where the climax was filmed.]]\n[[Principal photography]] took place in 1981 over the course of six weeks at Monmouth College, now [[Monmouth University]], in [[West Long Branch, New Jersey]], which has two mansions that were used in the film, one of which is the [[Shadow Lawn (New Jersey)|Shadow Lawn Mansion]].<ref name=\"times\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.app.com/story/news/history/erik-larsen/2014/12/16/daddy-warbucks-moved-monmouth/20506665/|title=When 'Daddy' Warbucks moved into Monmouth U|work=Asbury Park Press|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}</ref> The [[NX Bridge]], an abandoned railroad bridge over the Passaic River in Newark, was used for location shooting of one of the climactic scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hingepepper.com/anniemovie.htm |title=Jon Merrill's \"Annie\" movie trivia |publisher=Hingepepper.com |date=December 31, 2002 |access-date=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320081724/http://www.hingepepper.com/anniemovie.htm |archive-date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Vianna |first=Joao |url=http://news.jornal.us/article-5179.City-of-Newark-announces-2010-Passaic-Riverfront-boat-Tours.html |title=City of Newark announces 2010 Passaic Riverfront boat Tours |publisher=News.jornal.us |date=August 20, 2010 |access-date=2012-01-14 |archive-date=November 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122000747/http://news.jornal.us/article-5179.City-of-Newark-announces-2010-Passaic-Riverfront-boat-Tours.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMany of the street sets were filmed at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Burbank Studios]], 4000 Warner Boulevard, [[Burbank, California]]. [[Production designer]] [[Dale Hennesy]] overhauled the old \"Tenement Street\" back lot set at Warner Bros. by outfitting many of the New York styled apartment and store front facades with actual New York fire escapes and other treatments specifically brought in for this production. Hennesy died during filming and the back lot set was renamed \"Hennesy Street\" in honor of the late production designer.\n\nOriginally, the song \"Easy Street\" was going to be the biggest musical number in the film. For this purpose, a specially-created outdoor street set was built, costing more than $1&nbsp;million. It took one week to shoot the scene, but on reviewing the [[dailies]], the scene was considered to be \"overstuffed\" and \"sour.\" Therefore, a re-shoot was undertaken nearly two months after principal filming had been completed.

The film was released in a widescreen [[DVD]] edition on December 12, 2000.\n\nA \"Special Anniversary Edition\" DVD was released on January 13, 2004 (four days before producer Stark's death). Despite the fact that the first DVD was widescreen, the DVD was in [[pan and scan]] (but with [[DTS (sound system)|DTS sound]]). Reviewing the disc for [[DVD Talk]], [[Glenn Erickson]], while praising the film overall, called the pan and scan transfer an \"abomination that's grainy and lacking in color.\" He also noted that the short retrospective featurette with Ms. Quinn contained clips from the film in the correct aspect ratio. Erickson also called the music video of \"It's the Hard-Knock Life\" by [[Play (band)|Play]] \"pretty dreary\" and attacked the other, child-oriented extras by saying \"Musicals and kids' films aren't just for tots ... and this disc is little more than a headache.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9221/annie-1982/ |title=Annie (1982) : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |access-date=2012-01-14 |archive-date=December 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130814/https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9221/annie-1982/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, several countries in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] received widescreen versions of this edition including the United Kingdom. The film was released as a \"sing-along edition\" on Blu-ray on October 2, 2012, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the film and the 35th anniversary of the Broadway version set a revival in November 2012.\n\n==Television==\nThe film had its national television debut on February 24, 1986, on the [[NBC]] Monday Night Movie. To accommodate the broadcast restrictions, the film was shown in [[pan-and-scan]] and had its running time cut from 128 minutes to 96 minutes to run in the two-hour time slot with commercials.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Comic book adaptation===\n[[Marvel Comics]] published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artists [[Win Mortimer]] and [[Vince Colletta]] in ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #23 (Summer 1982).<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 36703|title= ''Marvel Super Special'' #23}}</ref> The adaptation was also available as an ''[[Marvel Treasury Edition|Annie Treasury Edition]]''<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 36907|title= ''Annie Treasury Edition''}}</ref> and as a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]].<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2645|title= ''Annie''}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Friedt|first= Stephan|title= Marvel at the Movies: The House of Ideas' Hollywood Adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 89|page= 66|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= July 2016|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n===India===\n* The 1983 Malayalam movie ''[[Ente Mamattukkuttiyammakku]]'' was reported to be inspired by this movie.<ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Row-over-Kerala-State-Films-Award/articleshow/15137396.cms</ref>\n\n* The 1993 Hindi film ''[[King Uncle]]'', starring Jackie Shroff, Shahrukh Khan, Anu Agarwal and Naghma, is loosely based on this film.\n\n===''Annie: A Royal Adventure!'' (1995)===\n{{Main|Annie: A Royal Adventure!}}\nA sequel, ''Annie: A Royal Adventure!'' was a made-for-television [[sequel]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 18, 1995. It starred [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]], [[Joan Collins]], [[George Hearn]] and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. Aside from a reprise of \"Tomorrow,\" there are no songs in it. No cast members from the 1982 film appeared in this sequel. Rooster, Lily and Grace Farrell were cut out of the sequel.\n\nIn the film, Warbucks (Hearn), Annie (Johnson), an eccentric scientist (McDiarmid) and one of the orphans travel to England where Warbucks is to be knighted by the King. However, the kids get mixed up in the scheme of an evil noblewoman (Collins) to blow up [[Buckingham Palace]] while all the heirs to the throne are present for Warbucks's knighting, thus making her queen.\n\n===''Annie'' (1999)===\n{{Main|Annie (1999 film)}}\nA made-for-TV movie version was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 7, 1999, starring [[Kathy Bates]] as Miss Hannigan, [[Victor Garber]] as Daddy Warbucks, [[Alan Cumming]] as Rooster, [[Audra McDonald]] as Grace, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Lily, and newcomer [[Alicia Morton]] as Annie. Produced by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in association with [[Columbia TriStar Television]], it received generally positive reviews and high ratings. It also earned two [[Emmy Award]]s and a 1999 [[George Foster Peabody Award]]. Although truer to the original stage musical than the 1982 version (as well as having a more comedic tone than the 1982 version's slightly dark one), it condensed much of the full story in order to make it more watchable for children. The film also featured a [[Cameo appearance|special appearance]] by [[Andrea McArdle]], star of the original Broadway production.\n\nThe film has aired on cable on [[Hallmark Channel]], [[ABC Family]] and [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] after its premiere on ABC.\n\n===''Annie'' (2014 film)===\n{{Main|Annie (2014 film)}}\nOn January 20, 2011, it was announced that [[Will Smith]] was planning to produce ''[[Annie (2014 film)|Annie]]'', a contemporary [[Film remake|remake]] of the 1982 film.
