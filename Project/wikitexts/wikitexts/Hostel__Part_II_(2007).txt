The film stars [[Lauren German]], [[Roger Bart]], [[Heather Matarazzo]], [[Bijou Phillips]] and [[Richard Burgi]], while [[Jay Hernandez]] briefly reprises his role from the first film. It was produced by [[Mike Fleiss]], Roth, and Chris Briggs, with [[Boaz Yakin]], [[Scott Spiegel]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]] serving as executive producers. The plot follows three American female art students in [[Rome]] who are directed to a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village where they are eventually kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill other people.\n\nAfter the significant box office receipts of ''Hostel'', Roth conceived a sequel set directly after the events of the first film, opting to include three female protagonists to \"up the ante.\"<ref name=el/> Filming took place in the fall of 2006 in [[Prague]] at [[Barrandov Studios]], with additional photography occurring in [[Iceland]] and Slovakia.\n\nBanned from theatrical release in several countries, ''Hostel: Part II'' had its world premiere at the [[Museum of the Moving Image]] in New York City on June 6, 2007, and was released theatrically in the United States two days later, on June 8. The film earned less than its predecessor at the box office, grossing $17 million in the United States by the end of its theatrical run,<ref name=\"BOM\">{{mojo title|hostel2}}</ref> whereas the original made $19 million in its opening weekend alone. Prior to its theatrical release, a [[workprint]] of the film leaked on the Internet, and one publication at the time claimed it was the \"most pirated film ever\",<ref name=pirate/> which Roth suggested was a factor in the film's box office returns.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events of ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005), Paxton suffers from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and lives in seclusion with his girlfriend Stephanie. After an argument where Stephanie denounces Paxton's paranoia as exaggerated and insufferable, she wakes to find his [[decapitation|headless]] corpse in their kitchen. An unmarked box containing Paxton's severed head is delivered to Elite Hunting boss Sasha.\n\nIn [[Rome]], [[Italy]], three American art students, Beth, Whitney, and Lorna, are convinced by Axelle, a nude model they are sketching, to join her on a luxurious spa vacation in [[Slovakia]]. The four check into a [[hostel]], where the desk clerk surreptitiously uploads their passport photos to an auction website. American businessman Todd and his best friend Stuart win the bids on Whitney and Beth. They then travel to Slovakia.\n\nLater that night, at the village's [[harvest festival]], Lorna discovers Beth has inherited a vast fortune from her mother. Stuart and Todd attend the festival; Todd remarks that Beth \"looks like her\",  and then Stuart approaches Beth and the two share a friendly conversation although strange. Meanwhile, Lorna is invited by Roman, a local man, on a boat ride. In a secluded area downstream, Roman kidnaps Lorna. Beth and Whitney leave the festival while Axelle volunteers to wait for Lorna.\n\nLorna wakes up naked and hung upside down above a bathtub. A woman enters the room and slashes at her with a [[scythe]] to collect her blood in the bathtub. She then bathes in the blood before slashing Lorna's throat. Meanwhile, Beth, Whitney, Axelle, and a local man, Miroslav, head to a spa to relax. Beth dozes off, and wakes up alone without her belongings. While looking for her friends, she is pursued by several men and flees the spa. In the woods, she is ambushed by a gang of violent [[gypsy]] street children, but is saved by Sasha and Axelle; Sasha executes one of the boys as punishment.\n\nLater at Sasha's remote mansion, Beth is pursued by the men from earlier and she realizes that they are associated with Sasha and Axelle. Looking for a hiding place, she discovers a room filled with human [[Headhunting|trophy heads]] (one of which is Paxton's). Beth is captured and taken to an abandoned factory and tied up in a room.\n\nBeth is soon joined by Stuart, who is supposed to kill her; it turns out Todd, who is wealthy while Stuart is not, paid for Beth for Stuart. Stuart appears to have second thoughts, unties Beth, explains the situation, and says he is \"not that guy.\" Beth goes to the door to try to leave, but someone knocks her out.\n\nIn another room, Todd terrorizes Whitney with a [[Saw#Types of saws|power saw]] but loses his nerve after accidentally [[scalping]] her without killing her. Horrified, Todd tries to leave, but is informed that he has to kill Whitney to leave. After Todd refuses, the guards unleash several dogs, which maul him to death.\n\nMeanwhile, Stuart, who was the one who knocked out Beth, has completely changed his mind and is revealed to be psychotic, now intent on torturing and killing Beth. He reveals that Beth bears an extremely close resemblance to Stuart's wife, whom Stuart hates but cannot kill because it is against the law and he would be the prime suspect. Stuart then begins to torture Beth.\n\nWith Todd now dead, the Elite Hunting Club offers the maimed Whitney to the other clients to kill, including an old Italian who is [[Cannibalism|eating]] Miroslav alive. Stuart, after discovering Todd's death, shows Beth the pictures of the maimed Whitney to frighten her, then accepts the club's offer, leaves Beth, and beheads Whitney.\n\nWhen Stuart returns, Beth seduces him into untying her from the chair. Stuart attempts to rape her, but she fights him off and chains him to the chair. Sasha and the guards arrive at her cell. Beth offers to buy her freedom with part of her inheritance, and though Stuart tries to outbid her, Sasha reveals that he knows that Stuart cannot afford to do so. Sasha tells her in order to leave, she must also kill someone. When Stuart insults Beth, she [[Emasculation|cuts off]] his entire [[Male reproductive system|genitalia]] and then feeds them to dogs, an act that gives pause to even the jaded guards, and leaving Stuart [[Eunuch|emasculated]] and bleeding to death. Satisfied, Sasha gives Beth an Elite Hunting tattoo, making her an official member.\n\nThat night, Axelle is lured by the Gypsy street children into the woods, where Beth ambushes and beheads her. Shortly after, the children start playing football with Axelle's severed head.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n<!-- Opening credits! -->\n* [[Lauren German]] as Beth Salinger\n* [[Bijou Phillips]] as Whitney Swerling\n* [[Vera Jordanova]] as Axelle Rassimov\n* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Lorna Weisenfreund\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Stuart\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Todd\n* [[Milan K\u0148a\u017eko]] as Sasha Rassimov\n* [[Stanislav Ianevski]] as Miroslav\n* Milda Havlas as Jedi, Desk Clerk\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Paxton Rodriguez\n* [[Jordan Ladd]] as Stephanie\n* Roman Janecka as Roman\n* Monika Malacova as Mrs. Bathory\n* [[Zuzana Geislerov\u00e1]] as Inya\n* Patrick Zigo as Bubblegum Gang Leader\n* [[Luc Merenda]] as Italian Detective\n* [[Edwige Fenech]] as Art Class Professor\n* Ivan Furak as Big Guard\n* [[Lillian Malkina]] as Make-Up Woman\n* [[Ruggero Deodato]] as Italian Cannibal<ref>{{Cite web|work=Movie Pilot|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3957261|title=7 Killer Facts About 'Hostel 2'|date=June 8, 2016|access-date=October 22, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211214155/https://moviepilot.com/posts/3957261|archive-date=December 11, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nRoth sought Lauren German for the lead role based on her performance in ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).<ref name=el>{{cite web|work=EmanuelLevy.com|author=Levy, Emanuel|url=http://emanuellevy.com/interviews/hostel-part-ii-roth-on-his-gory-sequel-8/|title=Hostel Part II: Roth on his Gory Sequel|date=June 3, 2007|access-date=October 22, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171023025715/http://emanuellevy.com/interviews/hostel-part-ii-roth-on-his-gory-sequel-8/|archive-date=October 23, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> \"Lauren has a sense of humor, but she can also handle those horrific, intense moments,\" explained Roth. \"I needed an actress who would be so vulnerable and so likeable, but then really strong when she needs to be.
