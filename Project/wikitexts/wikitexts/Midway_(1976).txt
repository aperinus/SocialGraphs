The film was made using [[Technicolor]], and its soundtrack used [[Sensurround]] to augment the physical sensation of engine noise, explosions, crashes and gunfire. Despite mixed reviews, ''Midway'' became the tenth most popular movie at the box office in 1976.\n\n==Plot==\nOn April 18, 1942 during [[World War II]], a squadron of [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] from the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} launches [[Doolittle Raid|a lightning raid on Tokyo]]. The strike stuns the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and its commander [[Admiral Yamamoto]]. With hard evidence of the threat posed by the carriers of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|American Pacific Fleet]] to the [[Japanese home islands]], Yamamoto devises a plan to lure out the American fleet and destroy it once and for all by forcing it to [[sortie]] against the invasion of [[Midway Island]].\n\nAt [[Pearl Harbor]], Captain Matt Garth is tasked with gauging the progress of decryption efforts at [[Station HYPO]], headed by Commander [[Joseph Rochefort]], which has partially cracked the Japanese Navy's [[JN-25]] code, revealing that a major operation will soon take place at a location the Japanese refer to as \"AF\". Garth is also asked by his son, naval aviator Ensign Tom Garth, to help free his girlfriend Haruko Sakura, an American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, who has been [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned]] with her parents, by calling in favors to have the charges against the family dropped. Yamamoto and his staff present their plans for Midway to the commanders who have been chosen to lead the attack, Admirals [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo|Nagumo]] and [[Tamon Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]] of the Japanese carrier force and Admiral [[Nobutake Kond\u014d|Kondo]] of the invasion force.\n\nAfter the inconclusive [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], Rochefort uses a simple ruse to confirm that \"AF\" is Midway. Now knowing the location and the approximate date of the attack, [[Admiral Nimitz]] and his staff send the carriers {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}, augmented by {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}}, hastily-repaired after being damaged at Coral Sea, to a point north of Midway and lie in wait for the Japanese fleet. Meanwhile, Matt has been unsuccessful in freeing the Sakuras, infuriating Tom.\n\nThe battle begins on June 4 as Nagumo's carrier force launches its air attack on Midway Island. The American base is damaged but the airstrip remains usable, meaning Midway can still launch aircraft. The Japanese fleet is then spotted by scouts; the American carriers launch their planes in response. Meanwhile, Nagumo is shocked to learn of a sighting by a scout plane of the ''Yorktown'', disrupting his plans for a second strike on Midway; he orders that his planes be rapidly re-armed with torpedoes for an attack on the American carrier.\n\nTorpedo bombers from ''Hornet'' are the first American planes to locate the Japanese fleet. They attack without fighter protection and are destroyed by the Japanese [[Combat Air Patrol]]. Tom is severely burned when gunfire starts a fire in his cockpit. The Japanese fighters are drawn down to wave-top altitude by the low-flying torpedo planes, leaving them out of position when dive-bombers from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' arrive. As the Japanese are preparing to launch their second wave, the American bombers attack and reduce three of the Japanese carriers \u2013 {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Kaga||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|S\u014dry\u016b||2}} \u2013 to burning wrecks within minutes.\n\nThe remaining Japanese carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} immediately launches aircraft. Following the returning American bombers, they soon discover ''Yorktown'' and inflict severe damage. The crew manages to bring the fires under control as a scout plane reports that ''Hiry\u016b'' has been spotted. Below decks, Matt meets Tom and reconciles with him. Due to a shortage of pilots, Matt joins the counterattack against ''Hiry\u016b'' just before its second wave of aircraft strikes. ''Yorktown'' is soon burning and the order is given to abandon ship.\n\n''Hiry\u016b'' is sunk, dealing a fatal blow to the invasion. The American planes return to ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet'' but Matt, his plane badly damaged, is killed during landing. Yamamoto receives news of the loss of his carrier force. The admiral orders a general withdrawal as he contemplates how he will apologise for his failure to [[Hirohito|the Emperor]].\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Charlton Heston]]\n|[[Captain]] Matthew Garth\n|\n|-\n|[[Henry Fonda]]\n|[[Admiral]] [[Chester W.

The Scotsman; Edinburgh (UK) [Edinburgh (UK)]03 Oct 2015: 34.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Midway FM2.jpg|thumb|Nine members of the cast pose with a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighter on the flight deck of {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}}]]\n''Midway'' was shot at the [[Terminal Island]] Naval Base, Los Angeles, California, the U.S. Naval Station, [[Long Beach, California]] and [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida. The on-board scenes were filmed in the Gulf of Mexico aboard {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}}. ''Lexington'', an {{Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}, was the last World War II-era carrier left in service at that point, although the ship was completed after the battle. She is now a museum ship at [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. Scenes depicting Midway Island were filmed at [[Point Mugu]], California. \"Point Mugu has sand dunes, just like Midway. We built an airstrip, a tower, some barricades, things like that,\" said Jack Smight. \"We did a lot of strafing and bombing there.\"<ref>Newspaper Enterprise Association, \"Filming of 'Midway': Making War for the Movies\", ''Playground Daily News'', Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Wednesday 8 October 1975, Volume 30, Number 209, page 5B.</ref> A [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina]] BuNo ''63998'', N16KL, of the [[Commemorative Air Force]], was used in depicting all the search and rescue mission scenes.\n\n===Sound===\nThe film was the second of only four films released with a [[Sensurround]] sound mix which required special speakers to be installed in movie theatres. The other Sensurround films were [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] (1974), [[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|''Rollercoaster'']] (1977), and ''[[Saga of a Star World|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (1978). The regular soundtrack (dialog, background and music) was monaural; a second optical track was devoted to low frequency rumble added to battle scenes and when characters were near unmuffled military engines.\n\n===Action===\nMany of the action sequences used footage from earlier films: most sequences of the Japanese air raids on Midway are stock shots from [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' (1970). Some scenes are from the Japanese ''Toho'' film ''[[Storm Over the Pacific|Hawai Middouei daikaikusen: Taiheiyo no arashi]]'' (1960) (which also stars Mifune). Several action scenes, including the one where a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] slams into {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}}'s bridge, were taken from ''[[Away All Boats]]'' (1956); scenes of Doolittle's Tokyo raid at the beginning of the film are from ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944). In addition, most dogfight sequences come from wartime gun camera footage or from the film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (1969).\n\nCast member [[Henry Fonda]] (Admiral Nimitz) had been one of the narrators of the 1942 [[John Ford]] documentary ''[[The Battle of Midway (1942 documentary)|The Battle of Midway]]'', some footage from which was used in the 1976 film. This was the third film dealing with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor with which Henry Fonda had been involved. Fonda first narrated the 1942 film The Battle of Midway and starred in the 1965 film ''[[In Harm's Way]]''. The only actress with a speaking part in the original film was Christina Kobuko as Horuko. In the TV version of the film [[Susan Sullivan]] appears playing Matt Garth's girlfriend. Later video versions dropped Sullivan to emphasize the essentially all-male cast and wartime action.\n\n[[File:Midway (film) screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese carrier hit by US bombs (for this scene, ''Midway'' editors used stock footage from the Japanese movie ''[[Storm Over the Pacific (film)|Storm Over the Pacific]] (\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u306e\u5d50 Taiheiyo no arashi)'', 1960).]]\nAs with many \"carrier films\" produced around this time, the US Navy ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers USS ''Lexington'' and USS ''Boxer'' played the parts of both American and Japanese flattops for shipboard scenes.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n\n''Midway'' proved extremely popular with movie audiences, and opened at number one at the US box office with an opening weekend gross of  $4,356,666 from 311 theatres.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=50 Top-Grossing Films|date=June 30, 1976|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Make Way For Midway (advertisement)|date=June 23, 1976|page=1}}</ref> It went on to gross over $43&nbsp;million at the box office, becoming the tenth most popular movie of 1976 with [[theatrical rental]]s of  $20,300,000.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=SECOND ANNUAL GROSSES GLOSS|last=Byron|first=Stuart|magazine=Film Comment|location=New York|volume=13|issue=2|date=March\u2013April 1977|pages=35\u201337}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"The movie can be experienced as pure spectacle, I suppose, if we give up all hopes of making sense of it.

All the same, commanding officers' staffs were generally bigger than the one or two men portrayed in the movie. Admiral [[Ernest King]], commander-in-chief of the navy, approved the Midway battle plan propounded by Nimitz. They were regularly in contact, so there was no need of sending fictional Capt. Vinton Maddox to consult Nimitz. There were numerous air attacks by Midway-based bombers on approaching Japanese fleets omitted by the script; these had the same effect as later carrier-based torpedo bombers destroyed by Japanese fleet air-defenses portrayed in the movie. The failure of the initial raids by land-based bombers only convinced Japanese commanders of their invincibility and incompetency of US military.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/miracleatmidway00pran|title=Miracle at Midway|last=Prange|first=Gordon W.|date=1982|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Goldstein, Donald M., Dillon, Katherine V.|isbn=0070506728|location=New York|oclc=8552795|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nDuring the American torpedo attacks, Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo and his subordinates are shaken by the American pilots' unexpected bravery. Nagumo remarks \"They sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans\". Similar to [[Isoroku Yamamoto's sleeping giant quote]] from the 1970 film ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', there is no evidence that Nagumo made this statement. When the ''Akagi'' is bombed, Nagumo is stunned by the force of the bomb's blast and is unable to get up, being tended to by Genda. Witnesses saw Nagumo standing near the ship's compass looking out at the flames on his flagship and two other carriers in a state of shock.

Nagumo, with a barely perceptible nod and tears in his eyes, agreed to go.<ref>{{cite book|first=Winston |last=Groom|title=1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls|year=2005 |page=238 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDVUcuAUCUwC&q=thorpe&pg=PA36|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802142504}}</ref>\n\nLater studies by Japanese and American military historians call into question key scenes, such as the dive-bombing attack that crippled the first three Japanese carriers. In the movie, American pilots jubilantly report that there are no fighters and the carrier decks are loaded with ammunition. As Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully write in \"[[Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway]]\" (2005), aerial photography from the battle showed nearly empty decks. Japanese carriers loaded armament onto planes below the flight deck, unlike American carriers (as depicted earlier in the film). The fact that a closed hangar full of armaments was hit by bombs made damage to ''Akagi'' more devastating than if planes, torpedoes and bombs were on an open deck.<ref>[[Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully]] (2005). \"[[Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway]]\" (pp. 431\u2013432).

Captain Matt Garth and his son, Ensign Thomas Garth, are fictional. Garth's contribution to planning the battle is based rather faithfully on actual work of Lieutenant-Commander [[Edwin T. Layton|Edwin Layton]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}. Layton served as Pacific fleet intelligence officer, spoke Japanese and was key to transposing raw outputs of cryptography analysis into meaningful intelligence for Nimitz and his staff.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Layton was an old friend of Joseph Rochefort.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Matt Garth's further exploits were pure fiction and resembled deeds of at least two more persons. First, an intelligence officer on Fletcher's [[Task Force 17]] staff and then the leader of the last attack made by dive bombers from USS ''Yorktown''. The latter was actually performed by VB-3 dive bomber squadron led by LCDR Maxwell Leslie.\n\nHistorical footage and atelier shots of warplanes action are mostly inaccurate in the movie. Most of the original footage portrays later and/or different events and thus planes and ships that were not operational during the battle or did not take part. Among the first aircraft shown taking off to defend Midway are two Army P-40 Warhawks. There were no P-40s stationed at Midway, only Marine F4F Wildcats and F2A-3 Buffalos. In the second air attack on Yorktown, the movie shows two Japanese planes hitting the aircraft carrier. There were no plane crashes into ships in this battle. In addition the Yorktown was damaged beyond saving by a Japanese torpedo fired from a submarine which had penetrated the destroyer screen rather than the air attack seen in the film. One of the most flagrant moments is Garth's collision at the very end of the movie, which is followed by the recording of a post-war [[Grumman F9F Panther]] jet plane crash which actually occurred on [[USS Midway (CV-41)]]. Like the USS Lexington used in filming, USS Midway is also preserved as a museum.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of historical drama films]]\n* [[List of historical drama films of Asia]]\n* [[Midway (2019 film)|''Midway'' (2019 film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0074899|Midway}}\n* {{tcmdb title|414244|Midway}}\n* {{AFI film|55596|Midway}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|midway|Midway}}\n\n{{Jack Smight}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midway 1976}}\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:1970s action drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s historical films]]\n[[Category:1970s war films]]\n[[Category:American action drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about the Battle of Midway]]\n[[Category:Works about Pacific theatre of World War II]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walter Mirisch]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n[[Category:Films set in the United States Minor Outlying Islands]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Pacific War films]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Navy in World War II]]\n[[Category:War epic films]]\n[[Category:World War II aviation films]]\n[[Category:World War II films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Epic films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Smight]]\n[[Category:Historical epic films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Isoroku Yamamoto]]\n[[Category:1976 drama films]]\n[[Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture]]\n[[Category:Films set on aircraft carriers]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
