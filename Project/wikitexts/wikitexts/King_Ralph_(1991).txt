Ward]] and starring [[John Goodman]], [[Peter O'Toole]], and [[John Hurt]].<ref>{{cite news|title= No Leading Man, King Ralph Insists  |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 12, 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-12/entertainment/ca-1411_1_king-ralph |access-date=September 26, 2013}}</ref> The film is about an American who becomes the unlikely [[King of the United Kingdom]] after an electrical accident wipes out the [[British Royal Family]].\n\nThe story is loosely based on the 1980 novel ''[[Headlong (Williams novel)|Headlong]]'' by [[Emlyn Williams]].<ref>[https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58923 King Ralph (1991)], AFI Catalog, [[American Film Institute]]</ref> Very little of the story survived the transition to the screen; characters were changed and the story made into a comedy. The film was a minor box office hit but was received negatively by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe entire [[British Royal Family]] is electrocuted and killed in a freak accident outside [[Buckingham Palace]] while having a royal portrait taken. Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the crown]]. After days of searching, a living heir is found: American Ralph Jones.\n\nShortly after being fired from his job as a [[lounge singer]] in [[Las Vegas]], Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant secretary Duncan Phipps that he has royal blood. His grandmother Constance had a brief encounter with the first [[Duke]] of Warren while a hotel waitress in the [[United States|US]]. A ring is  given as proof, a duplicate of the ring she used to wear that the Duke had given her.\n\nRalph is flown to [[London]], where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. On only his second day, he goes to a [[strip club]] and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer. He dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the [[House of Stuart]], of which he is patriarch. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a [[Abdication of Edward VIII|mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII]], Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a date with Miranda in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. The next day, she returns Graves' money, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. To preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him.\n\nDespite Ralph's reluctance to accept [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]] and his ineptness in formal affairs, he makes a positive impression on King Mulambon  of [[Zambezi]] during his [[state visit]]. They share concerns about the role of leadership they have assumed and the economic interests of their nations. Ralph accumulates a small but loyal following.\n\nIt is arranged for Ralph to marry Princess Anna of [[Finland]] to continue the royal bloodline and guarantee jobs for the UK in Finland's newly discovered [[oil reserves]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. On the night of the Finnish Royal Family's visit, Ralph is turned off by Princess Anna's unusually deep voice, her bizarre sexual preferences, and her nonchalant acceptance of arranged royal marriage. Miranda attends the royal ball as a set-up by Graves, and photos of her kiss with Ralph are shown to Anna's father King Gustav which, along with Ralph's wild musical number of \"[[Good Golly, Miss Molly]]\", results in Finland turning down the UK in favor of [[Japan]] for the offshore equipment contract.\n\nRalph accepts a stern rebuke from Cedric and endeavors to set things right. Miranda confesses her role in the scandal and he walks out on her. Becoming suspicious about his situation, Phipps tells Ralph that Cedric is also an heir to the throne (his great-grand-mother, a parlor maid, had a one night stand with a British prince) but had turned it down.\n\nRalph addresses [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], apologizing for his recent actions and informing the country he has organized with King Mulambon for Zambezi to purchase \u00a3200 million worth of British mining equipment and open three car engine plants in Britain, ensuring jobs for Miranda's family and thousands of other Britons. He then reveals Graves has been sabotaging his succession to the throne and has him arrested for violating the [[Treason Act of 1702]]. Finally, he announces he will [[Abdication|abdicate]] and reveals Cedric as his successor.\n\nCedric accepts his duty as King, Ralph is created the Third Duke of Warren, with a lucrative annual stipend and his own recording studio in his country estate. Cedric warns Ralph that since he has no children, he may have to be king again after he (Cedric) dies. Ralph marries Miranda and raises his son Ralph II with her while fronting his own singing group Ralph and the Dukettes. They perform a cover of \"[[Duke of Earl]]\" as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Goodman]] as Ralph Hampton Gainsworth Jones, a lounge singer from Las Vegas and heir to the British Throne.
