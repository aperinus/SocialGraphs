The story revolves around the theft of a famous diamond aboard a train.\n\nThe film's plot is a mostly original story not directly based on any of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s Holmes tales, but it uses minor plot elements of \"[[The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle]],\" \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]],\" \"[[The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax]],\" and ''[[The Sign of Four]]''.<ref>[[Alan Barnes (writer)|Alan Barnes]], ''Sherlock Holmes On Screen: The Complete Film and TV History'', Titan Books, Third Edition, January 31, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-85768-776-0}}, page 287</ref>\n\nThe film is one of four films in the series which are in the [[public domain]]. [https://publicdomainmovie.net/movie/terror-by-night]\n\n== Plot ==\nIn London, Vivian Vedder ([[Renee Godfrey]]) verifies that a carpenter has completed a coffin for her recently deceased mother's body, which she is transporting to Scotland by train. She boards the train that evening, as do Lady Margaret Carstairs ([[Mary Forbes]]), who owns and is transporting the famous ''Star of Rhodesia'' diamond; Lady Margaret's son, Roland (Geoffrey Steele); [[Sherlock Holmes]], whom Roland has hired to protect the diamond; [[Inspector Lestrade]] ([[Dennis Hoey]]), who is also worried about the diamond's safety; and [[Dr. Watson]] and Watson's friend Major Duncan-Bleek ([[Alan Mowbray]]). Holmes briefly examines the diamond.\n\nShortly afterward, Roland is murdered and the diamond is allegedly stolen. Lestrade, Holmes, and Watson learn nothing conclusive in questioning the other passengers. At one point during the investigation, Watson believes an elderly couple is guilty of the crime but the only crime that they have committed is stealing a teapot from a hotel. While searching the train, Holmes is pushed out of the train, nearly to his death, but climbs back into the day coach and discovers a secret compartment in the coffin carrying Miss Vedder's mother. He suspects that one of the people on the train is the notorious jewel thief Colonel [[Sebastian Moran]].\n\nUpon further questioning, Miss Vedder admits that a man paid her to transport the coffin. As Watson and Duncan-Bleek join the group, Holmes reveals that he swapped the diamond with an imitation while examining it. Lestrade ostensibly takes possession of the real diamond.\n\nIn the luggage compartment, Holmes and Watson find a train guard murdered with a poisoned dart. Meanwhile, a street criminal named Sands ([[Skelton Knaggs]]) incapacitates the conductor. Sands was hidden inside the coffin, and is in cahoots with Duncan-Bleek, who is, in fact, Colonel Moran. Sands and Moran go to Lestrade's room, where Sands knocks Lestrade unconscious and steals the diamond from him; but Moran double-crosses Sands, shooting him dead with the same dart gun he used to kill Roland and the guard.\n\nThe train makes an unexpected stop to pick up several Scottish policemen, led allegedly by Inspector McDonald (Boyd Davis). Holmes informs McDonald that Duncan-Bleek is really Moran, and McDonald arrests Moran and finds the diamond in his vest, but Moran seizes a policeman's gun and pulls the emergency cord to stop the train. During a scuffle in which the lights are turned off, Holmes subdues and handcuffs Moran, then secretly hides him under a table. When the lights are turned on again, the officers leave the train with Lestrade, his coat covering his face, believing he is Moran. As the train departs, Lestrade captures the thieves in the railway station, and Holmes reveals to Watson and Moran that he recognized McDonald as an impostor and recovered the diamond from him during the fight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n* [[Nigel Bruce]] as [[Dr. Watson]]\n* [[Alan Mowbray]] as Major Duncan-Bleek/[[Colonel Sebastian Moran]]\n* [[Dennis Hoey]] as [[Inspector Lestrade]] \n* [[Renee Godfrey]] as Vivian Vedder\n* [[Frederick Worlock]] as Professor Kilbane\n* [[Mary Forbes]] as Lady Margaret Carstairs\n* [[Skelton Knaggs]] as Sands\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Ticket Collector\n* Geoffrey Steele as The Honourable Roland Carstairs\n* [[Harry Cording]] as Mock the coffin maker\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n* [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)]]\n* [[List of American films of 1946]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0039017}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=Terror_By_Night}}\n* {{Amg movie|49133}}\n* {{tcmdb title|19193}}\n* {{AFI film|id=25003|title=Terror by Night}}\n* {{YouTube|id=svtwNtL_4UI|title=''Terror by Night''}}\n\n{{HolmesFilms}}\n{{Roy William Neill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Terror By Night}}\n[[Category:1946 films]]\n[[Category:1946 mystery films]]\n[[Category:American detective films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roy William Neill]]\n[[Category:Films set on trains]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes films based on works by Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films about theft]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
