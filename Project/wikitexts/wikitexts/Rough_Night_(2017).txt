Downs]]. It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Ilana Glazer]] and [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] in lead roles. while, Paul Downs, [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Demi Moore]] in supporting roles. The story follows a [[bachelorette party]] that goes wrong after a [[male stripper]] dies.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on June 16, 2017, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through [[Columbia Pictures]], received mixed reviews and grossed $47 million worldwide against a production budget of about $26 million hence becoming a [[box office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2006, four friends, Jess, Alice, Frankie and Blair, bond during their first year of college. A decade later they reunite as Jess is about to marry Peter. Alice decides that the four should spend the weekend in Miami partying. They are also joined by Pippa, Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. Alice, who considers herself to be Jess's best friend, is immediately jealous of Pippa.\n\nThe friends get high on cocaine and party at a club and then decide to hire a male stripper. At the vacation house, he makes Jess uncomfortable with his rough talk. Alice decides to take a turn and jumps  on him, causing them to both fall and the stripper to die after hitting his head on the fireplace. Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused. Peter thinks that she is leaving him and becomes distraught. His friends tell him that he should drive down to Miami to win her back.\n\nThe friends purchase a burner phone to call Blair's lawyer uncle. After telling them they moved the body, he tells them they could face up to fifteen years in prison unless no body is found. They decide to dispose of the body, throwing it into the ocean.\n\nAfter doing so, they think the neighbors' security camera caught them on tape, and send Blair to seduce them for the footage, only to discover the cameras don't work after she has slept with them. By this point, the body has washed up back on the shore and they must come up with a new plan to dispose of it.\n\nA police officer knocks on their door and Frankie knocks him out after he gropes her, only for them to realize he was the stripper they had hired, leaving them to wonder who was killed. They try to dispose of the body again, with the stripper's car, only to return defeated after a car accident. Then when Alice finds out Jess invited Frankie and Blair to a bridal shower over her, Jess berates her for her obsessive clinginess and storms off to prepare for the consequences.\n\nAt this point, two police officers arrive and tell the women they are not in trouble as the man they killed was a violent criminal who had been on the run from the police. As they interrogate the women Pippa realizes that the \"police\" are actually accomplices of the man killed. Realizing they are caught, the men tie up the women and the now-awakened stripper and threaten to shoot them.\n\nJess meanwhile has missed most of the drama due to being upstairs taking a shower in preparation for her mugshot. Realizing what has happened, she subdues one of the captors using hairspray and handcuffs and fights off the other one as he prepares to kill Blair. After Alice shoots the second captor, the first reappears, having removed the toy handcuffs, only to be run over by Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake on his roadtrip to Miami.\n\nJess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and they do it that weekend at a foam party with their friends. Frankie and Blair reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty, the police officer stripper from the bachelorette party.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pippa sings lyrics that allude to the evening, and after the credits Alice finds the thief's stolen diamonds that had been stashed in a box of naughty pasta from the bachelorette party.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Jessica \"Jess\" Thayer\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Pippa/Kiwi\n* [[Ilana Glazer]] as Frankie\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Blair\n* [[Paul W.
