As Williams notes, the actual onscreen title was \"Pit and the Pendulum\".</ref> is a 1961 [[horror film]] directed by [[Roger Corman]], starring  [[Vincent Price]], [[Barbara Steele]], [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]], and [[Luana Anders]].  The [[screenplay]] by [[Richard Matheson]] was loosely inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1842 [[The Pit and the Pendulum|short story of the same name]]. Set in sixteenth-century Spain, the story is about a young [[English people|Englishman]] who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently [[ghost]]ly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular [[torture device]] by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] [[sequence (film)|sequence]].\n\nThe film was the second title in the popular series of Poe [[film adaptation|adaptations]] released by [[American International Pictures#List of Corman-Poe films|American International Pictures]], the first having been Corman's '' [[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' released the previous year. Like ''House'', the film features [[widescreen]] [[cinematography]] by [[Floyd Crosby]], sets designed by [[art director]] [[Daniel Haller]], and a [[film score]] composed by [[Les Baxter]].  A critical and box-office hit, ''Pit''{{'}}s success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. The series ended in 1965 with the release of ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]''.\n\n[[Film critic]] [[Tim Lucas]] and writer [[Ernesto Gastaldi]] have both noted the film's strong influence on numerous subsequent [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] thrillers, from [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[The Whip and the Body]]'' (1963) to [[Dario Argento]]'s '' [[Deep Red]] '' (1975).<ref name=\"Lucas\">Lucas, Tim.

Nicholas and his younger sister Catherine offer a vague explanation that Elizabeth died from a rare blood disorder six months earlier; Nicholas is evasive when Francis asks for specific details. Francis vows not to leave until he discovers the truth behind his sister's death.\n\nFrancis again asks about his sister's death during dinner with the family physician, Dr. Leon. Dr. Leon tells him that his sister died of massive [[heart failure]], literally \"dying of fright\". Francis demands to see where Elizabeth died. Nicholas takes him to the castle's [[torture chamber]]. Nicholas reveals that Elizabeth became obsessed with the chamber's torture devices under the influence of the castle's \"heavy atmosphere\". After becoming progressively unbalanced, she locked herself into an [[Iron maiden (torture device)|iron maiden]], and died after whispering the name \"Sebastian\" one day. Francis refuses to believe Nicholas's story.\n\nFrancis tells Catherine that Nicholas appears to feel \"definite guilt\" regarding Elizabeth's death. In response, Catherine talks about Nicholas's [[psychological trauma|traumatic childhood]]. Their father was Sebastian Medina, a notorious agent of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. When Nicholas was a small child, he explored the forbidden torture chamber when his father entered the room with his mother, Isabella, and Sebastian's brother, Bartolome. Hiding in a corner, Nicholas watched in horror as his father repeatedly hit Bartolome with a red-hot poker, screaming \"Adulterer!\" at him. After murdering Bartolome, Sebastian began torturing his wife slowly to death in front of Nicholas.\n\nDr. Leon later informs Catherine and Francis that Isabella was not tortured to death; instead, she was entombed behind a brick wall while still alive. He explains, \"The very thought of [[premature burial|premature interment]] is enough to send your brother into convulsions of horror.\" Nicholas fears that Elizabeth may have been interred prematurely. The doctor tells Nicholas that \"if Elizabeth Medina walks the corridors of this castle, it is her spirit, not her living self.\"\n\nNicholas believes that his late wife's [[vengeful ghost]] is haunting the castle. Elizabeth's room is the source of a loud commotion, now ransacked and her portrait slashed. Her beloved [[harpsichord]] plays in the middle of the night. One of Elizabeth's rings shows up on the keyboard. Francis accuses Nicholas of planting the evidence of Elizabeth's \"haunting\" as an elaborate hoax. Nicholas insists that Francis open his wife's tomb. They discover Elizabeth's [[decomposition|putrefied]] corpse frozen in a position that suggests she died screaming after failing to claw her way out of her sarcophagus. Nicholas faints.\n\nThat night, Nicholas\u2013 now on the verge of insanity\u2013 hears Elizabeth calling him. He follows her ghostly voice down to her tomb. Elizabeth rises from her coffin and pursues Nicholas into the torture chamber, where he falls down a flight of stairs. As Elizabeth gloats over her husband's unconscious body, her lover and accomplice, Dr. Leon, appears. They had plotted to drive Nicholas mad so that she could inherit his fortune and the castle.\n\nLeon confirms that Nicholas \"is gone\", his mind destroyed by terror. Elizabeth taunts her insensate husband. Nicholas begins laughing hysterically while his wife and the doctor recoil in horror. Believing himself to be Sebastian, he replays the events of his mother and uncle's murders. Nicholas seizes Elizabeth, repeats his father's promise to Isabella to torture her, and gags and places her in an [[iron maiden]]. He overpowers Dr. Leon, believing him to be Bartolome, and Leon falls to his death in the pit while trying to escape.\n\nFrancis, having heard Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas also confuses Francis for Bartolome and knocks him unconscious. He straps him to a stone slab located directly beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum is attached to a clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, closer to Francis' torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the [[domestic worker|servants]]. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death. Francis is removed from the torture device, bleeding but still alive. As they leave the torture dungeon, Catherine vows that no one shall enter that room again. They slam and lock the door shut; the last scene shows that a gagged Elizabeth is still alive, trapped in the iron maiden.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Nicholas/Sebastian Medina \n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Francis Barnard \n* [[Barbara Steele]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Luana Anders]] as Catherine Medina\n* [[Antony Carbone]] as Doctor Leon\n* Patrick Westwood as Maximillian\n* Lynette Bernay as Maria\n* Larry Turner as Nicholas as child\n* Mary Menzies as Isabella\n* [[Charles Victor]] as Bartolome\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[20th Century Fox]] had announced plans to film the story in the late '50s, along with versions of \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" and \"[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]\", but the films were never made.<ref>{{Cite news|title=BRITISH MOVIE FRONT: Box Office Boom \u2013 'Horror' Harvest \u2013 Davis Theatre Elimination Plan|author=STEPHEN WATTS|date=Sep 28, 1958|work=New York Times|page=X9}}</ref>\n\nWhen Roger Corman's ''House of Usher'' was released in June 1960, its  box office success took AIP's [[James H. Nicholson]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] by surprise. Corman admitted, \"We anticipated that the movie would do well... but not half as well as it did.\" According to Richard Matheson, \"When the first film was a hit, they still didn't consider doing a Poe series. They just wanted another movie with a Poe title fixed to it.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>\n\nCorman felt Poe's two strongest stories after \"Usher\" were \"[[The Masque of the Red Death]]\", and '\"Pit and the Pendulum\". He considered making the former but was worried about similarities between the story and ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter.<ref name=\"cine\">[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/11/masque-of-the-red-death-retrospective/ \"Masque of the Red Death (1964) \u2013 A Retrospective\" By Steve Biodrowski, ''Cinefantastique'', November 20, 2007] accessed 20 August 2014</ref> However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make ''Pit'' as the second Poe film \"because it was a lot more graphic and in the second place, ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (1964 film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so when we did finally make ''Masque of the Red Death'' we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it.\"<ref name=\"french\">Lawrence French, \"The Making of ''The Pit and the Pendulum''\", ''The Pit and the Pendulum'', Bear Manor Media 2013</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\nMatheson's script freely devised an elaborate [[narrative]] that barely resembled Poe, with only the finale having any similarity at all to the original short story on which the film was based.  Corman noted, \"The method we adopted on ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third [[act (theater)|act]] to the motion picture... because a two-page short story is not about to give you a ninety-minute motion picture.  We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen.\"<ref name=\"Di Franco\">Di Franco, J. Philip (editor). ''The Movie World of Roger Corman'', Chelsea House Publishers, 1979. {{ISBN|0-87754-122-1}}</ref>\n\nMatheson's screenplay included a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to a time immediately preceding Elizabeth's illness, featuring Nicholas and Elizabeth horseback-riding and eating a picnic lunch.  Corman deleted the sequence prior to filming because he felt it violated one of his major theories regarding the Poe series:\n<blockquote>I had a lot of theories I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the [[unconscious mind]] of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]'', we never showed the real world. In ''Pit'', John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.<ref name = \"Williams\"/></blockquote>\nThe screenplay was modified from its original draft form during the film's shooting.  Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. Don Medina responds: \"Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (''turning'') What brings you to us?\" Price penciled in the suggestions \"that must be kept in constant repair\" and \"that cannot be stopped\". Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. During Nicholas' death scene, after falling to the bottom of the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, \"Elizabeth. What have I done to you?  (''beat'')  What have I done to you?\"  The camera was to then [[Cut (transition)|cut]] directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.<ref name = \"Williams\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was announced in August 1960, and filming began the first week of January 1961.\n\nAccording to Lucy Chase Williams' book, ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', the shooting schedule was fifteen days, and the film's budget was almost $1 million.<ref name = \"Williams\"/> Corman himself has said that the film's actual production cost was approximately $300,000.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Fischer, Dennis.

''Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts'', McFarland & Company, Inc., 1988. {{ISBN|0-89950-330-6}}</ref><ref name = \"McGee2\"/>\n\nCorman has noted that making the film was a pleasurable experience: \"I enjoyed ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' because I actually got the chance to experiment a bit with the movement of the camera. There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting [[film editing|cutting]] in the climax of the film.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>\n\nFilming went smoothly, and Corman attributed the ease of the production's shoot to the short but comprehensive [[pre-production]] planning he did with the major technicians:\n<blockquote>We achieved what we did on a low budget because we carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras.  Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with [[Cinematographer|director of photography]] Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set.<ref name = \"Lightman\"/></blockquote>\n[[File:PitFlash.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth Medina, in one of the film's tinted, nightmarish flashback sequences]]\nTo create the flashbacks revealing Nicholas' [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experiences]], Corman and Crosby attempted to shoot them in a manner that would convey to the audience the character's horror in dredging up nightmares trapped in his [[unconscious mind|subconscious]]. Corman insisted on these images having a [[dream|dream-like]] quality, \"twisted and distorted because they were being experienced by someone on the rim of madness.\"  Corman decided to film the flashbacks in [[monochrome]], since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in \"black-and white\" imagery.  Crosby used [[wide-angle lens]]es, violent camera movement, and tilted [[camera angle]]s to represent the character's feeling of hysteria. The sequences were then printed on [[film tinting|blue-tinted]] [[film stock|stock]] which was subsequently toned red during [[photographic processing|development]], effectively producing a [[wikt:two-tone|two-tone]] image. The highlights were blue, with the shadows rendered as red...producing a deep, bloody quality. The image was then run through an [[optical printer]] where the edges were [[vignetting|vignetted]] and a twisted linear distortion was introduced.<ref name=\"Lightman\">Lightman, Herb A. \"The Pit and the Pendulum: A Study In Horror Film Photography\", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', October 1961 issue.</ref>\n\nPrior to the start of filming, Corman had set aside one day of [[rehearsal]]s with his cast. \"Previously, I had painstakingly rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is nothing worse than to be on the set and ready to roll, only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions.\"<ref name=\"Lightman\"/>\n\n===Art direction===\nThe film's brief exterior [[prologue]] showing Kerr's arrival to the castle was filmed on the [[Palos Verdes]] coast. The rest of the production was shot in four interior [[sound stage]]s at the California Studios in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. To provide great freedom for  the planned camera movements, a castle set with many levels and ample space was designed by  Daniel Haller.\n\nBecause of the film's low budget, none of the sets could be constructed \"from scratch.\" After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the [[backlot]]s and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At [[Universal Studios]], he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props. At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone wall units. Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible.<ref name = \"Lightman\"/>  To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of cobwebbing was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.<ref>Smith, Don G. ''The Poe Cinema: A Critical Filmography''. McFarland & Company, 1999. p. 117 {{ISBN|0-7864-1703-X}}</ref>\n\nThe film's [[pressbook]] noted that the pendulum was eighteen-feet long and weighed over a ton and was constructed with a realistic rubber cutting blade.  The pendulum was rigged from the top of the sound stage  thirty-five feet in the air.<ref name = \"McGee\"/> In an interview, Haller provided details regarding the creation of the pendulum:\n<blockquote>I found that such a pendulum actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions.  At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest.  We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint.  The problem was to get it in exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him.  To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.<ref name = \"McGee2\"/></blockquote>\nTo visually enhance the size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40&nbsp;mm [[Panavision]] wide-angle lens and mounted at the opposite end of the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in [[matte painting|process extensions]] of the set, doubling its size onscreen.<ref name = \"Lightman\"/>\n\n==Response==\n===Box office===\n''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was a bigger financial hit than ''House of Usher'', accruing over US$2,000,000 in [[film distributor|distributors']] domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals versus the first film's US$1,450,000.<ref name=\"Gebert\">Gebert, Michael.

Lucas noted, \"It takes Corman's [[Freudian]] theories even further with a nightmarish flashback sequence that plants the seeds of Nicholas's breakdown, and would prove particularly influential on the future course of Italian horror \u2014 an influence that can be seen even in productions of the 1970s (''[[Deep Red]]'') and 1980s (''[[A Blade in the Dark]]'').\"<ref name=\"Lucas\"/> \nWriter K. Lindbergs has noted an \"obvious influence\" on [[Antonio Margheriti]]'s ''[[Castle of Blood]]'' (1964) and its [[remake]], ''[[Web of the Spider]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinebeats.blogsome.com/2006/05/06/|title=The Ghosts of Antonio Margheriti|access-date=2007-01-08|first=K|last=Lindbergs|publisher=Cinebeats|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101065513/http://cinebeats.blogsome.com/2006/05/06/|archive-date=2006-11-01}}</ref>\n\nScreenwriter [[Ernesto Gastaldi]] acknowledged that Ugo Guerra and Elio Scardamaglia, the producers of [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[The Whip and the Body]]'' (1963), had \"shown me an Italian print of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' before I started writing it:  'Give us something like this', they said.\" When asked if another of his films, ''[[The Long Hair of Death]]'' (1964), was inspired by Corman's film, Gastaldi replied, \"Yes, of course! ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' had a big influence on Italian horror films.  Everybody borrowed from it.\"<ref name=\"Gastaldi\"/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] felt that one of the film's most powerful shocks\u2014the discovery of Elizabeth's hideously decayed corpse\u2014had a major impact on the genre and served as one of the most significant horror sequences of the decade. In fact, shortly after seeing the film in eighth grade, a young King took inspiration from [[Monarch Books]]'s film tie-ins and wrote an eight-page novelization of ''The Pit and the Pendulum'', \"blissfully unaware that [he] was in violation of every plagiarism and copyright statute in the history of the world\", and managed to sell over thirty copies for 25\u00a2 each at his school before one of his teachers forced him to return the profits.<ref>{{cite book|author=King, Stephen|title=[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MvyTqyff_V4C&pg=PA47&dq=%22the+long+hitch+home+that+night%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X 47-50]}}</ref> King later wrote, \"Following the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] films, this becomes, I think, the most important moment in the post-1960 horror film, signaling a return to an all-out effort to terrify the audience...and a willingness to use any means at hand to do it.\"<ref name=\"King\">{{cite book|author=King, Stephen|title=[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]|publisher=[[Berkley Books]]|year=1981|isbn=978-0-425-18160-7}}</ref>\n\n==Padded television version==\nIn 1968, when the film was sold to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] for television airings, the network noted that the film was too short to fill the desired two-hour time slot. They requested that AIP extend the film's runtime.  Approximately five minutes of additional footage were subsequently shot by Corman's [[production assistant]] Tamara Asseyev.<ref name = \"Williams\"/>\n\nOf the original cast members, only Luana Anders was available at the time, and the new sequence featured her character, Catherine Medina, confined to a [[Psychiatric hospital|lunatic asylum]]. After much screaming and hair pulling, Catherine reveals the details of her horrific story to her fellow inmates, at which point the film itself follows as a flashback.<ref name=\"Williams\">Williams, Lucy Chase.
