It stars an ensemble cast, including [[Michael Caine]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Richard Chamberlain]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Slim Pickens]], [[Bradford Dillman]], [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] in his final film role. It follows a scientist and a group of soldiers preventing a Texas-sized swarm of [[Africanized bee|killer bee]]s from invading the city. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]]. It has been considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst#The Swarm (1978)|worst films ever made]].<ref name=\"lh\">''Halliwell's film and video guide 2002'' edited by John Walker.

After Baker contacts his commander, General Slater, they continue investigating who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane, who arrived after the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass which turns out to be bees, but the helicopters are destroyed by the bees. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson, one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.\n\nMeanwhile, in the countryside, the Durant family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The mother and father die from the bee stings, but Paul, their son, escapes in a [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Mustang]]. Although he is stung, Paul manages to make it into town and crashes into the [[Marysville, Texas|Marysville]] town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater confronts angry county engineer Jed Hawkins, who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.\n\nRecovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and his friends search for the hive to firebomb it in revenge for his family, which results only in angering the bees, who make their way to Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf\u00e9 waitress Rita. Reporter Anne McGregor watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees arrive at the train, killing several evacuees, including a love triangle made up of schoolteacher Maureen Scheuster, retiree Felix Austin, and town mayor and drug store owner Clarence Tuttle.\n\nRita tries to board the ill-fated train but is saved at the last minute by going into labor and is confined to the hospital. She gives birth to her child while falling in love with the doctor in the process; but Paul suffers a relapse from the effects of being stung earlier and later dies, devastating Helena and sending her into a rage about why the children have to die. The savage swarm heads for Houston, and Crane decides to drop eco-friendly poison pellets on them, hoping that the swarm senses will harm them and stay away from the city. Unfortunately, the plan fails. Dr. Krim self-injects an experimental bee venom antidote, planning to track the results, but the trial proves fatal and he dies. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees, ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard. However, at that moment, the alarm sounds, and the bees invade the plant, killing Andrews and Hubbard, destroying the plant, and wiping out an entire town.\n\nMeanwhile, in downtown Houston, Crane analyzes tapes from the bee invasion and comes to the conclusion that their alarm system attracted the swarm into the base. The bees invade once more, resulting in the deaths of Major Baker and Dr. Newman, one of Crane's associates. Slater sacrifices himself to save Crane and Helena from the bees. Helicopters lure the bees out to sea, where they douse the water with oil and set the swarm ablaze. Helena wonders if their victory was just temporary. Crane responds that he does not know, but decides that \"if we use our time wisely, the world just might survive.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Bradford Crane\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Helena Anderson\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as General Thaddeus Slater\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Dr. Hubbard\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Maureen Schuester\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Felix Austin\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Anne MacGregor\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as Dr. Andrews\n* [[Patty Duke]] as Rita Bard\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Jud Hawkins\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Major Baker\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as Clarence Tuttle\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Dr. Walter Krim\n* [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as General Thompson\n* [[Christian Juttner]] as Paul Durant\n* [[Morgan Paull]] as Dr. Newman\n* [[Alejandro Rey]] as Dr. Martinez\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry]] as Pete Harris\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was announced in 1974 at the height of the disaster-movie craze. It was part of $38 million worth of projects Allen had lined up, others including ''The Day the World Ended'' (a project which was retitled and released in 1980 as ''[[When Time Ran Out...]]''.) <ref>{{Cite news|title=Film disasters......hit Hollywood|author=Huddy, John.|date=June 9, 1974|work=Chicago Tribune|page=e18}}</ref> The script was written by [[Stirling Silliphant]], who had written ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' for Allen. He said in December 1974 that Allen hoped to start filming in April 1975.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A Burning Subject|author=Gary Arnold.|date=December 10, 1974|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=B11}}</ref> Production was delayed in part because Allen decided to leave Fox for Warner Bros.<ref name=\"new\">{{Cite news|title=A Cast of Millions Swarms on Screen|author=ROBERT LINDSEY.|date=October 12, 1977|work=New York Times|page=43}}</ref> Estimates of the numbers of bees used in the production ranged between 15 million and 22 million, including 800,000 bees with their stingers removed to enable the cast to work safely with them. About 100 people were employed in the production to care for and transport the bees during the film shoot. Olivia de Havilland was stung by a bee while filming. MacMurray retired from acting and died in 1991.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. It has a score of 9% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on twenty-three reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swarm |title=The Swarm (1978) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=August 5, 2021|language=en}}</ref> It was one of two disaster films (the other being ''[[Beyond the Poseidon Adventure]]'') directed solely by the \"master of disaster\" Allen, who had experience directing several films and many episodes of his TV shows - and both featured Michael Caine in the leading role. The film is listed in [[Golden Raspberry Award]] founder [[John J.B. Wilson]]'s book ''[[The Official Razzie Movie Guide]]'' as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made, where Wilson states that under Allen's unsubtle direction, \"despite the enormous production budget, ''The Swarm'' turned the tale of an invasion of killer bees into the ultimate [[B movie]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"nothing less than the ultimate apotheosis of yesterday's B-movie.\" Comparing the film unfavorably to recent blockbusters such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', which also evoked old B-movies, he wrote, \"Allen merely reproduces a tacky genre while spending a great deal of money doing it.

An expanded, remastered score was released in 2002 in a limited edition by Prometheus Records and contained over 40 minutes of previously unreleased material.

This extended version is also included on all [[DVD]] releases worldwide, alongside a 22-minute documentary, \"Inside ''The Swarm''\", and the original theatrical trailer.\n\nIt was first released to DVD by [[Warner Home Video]] on August 6, 2002, then reissued on January 28, 2016, under their [[Warner Archive Collection]] sublabel.\n\nThe film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 25, 2018, again through Warner Archive. Like the two previous DVD releases, it contains the 156-minute extended version, the original theatrical trailer, and the 22-minute making-of documentary.\n\nIn the U.S., the film was given a PG rating by the MPAA. In the U.K., the film was released with an A certificate in 1978. The BBFC rated the extended version 12.\n\n== Disclaimer ==\nThe ending credits to the film included a disclaimer that read: \"The African killer bee portrayed in this film bears absolutely no relationship to the industrious, hardworking American honey bee to which we are indebted for pollinating vital crops that feed our nation.\"<ref name=\"afi.com\">{{AFI film|57041}}</ref> According to an article in ''HR'' published on February 24, 1978, the American Bee Association considered taking legal action against the film's producers for defaming the [[western honey bee]], but whether the lawsuit was ever filed or not is unknown.<ref name=\"afi.com\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of films considered the worst]]\n* [[List of natural horror films#Honey bees|List of killer bee films]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{Amg title|48069}}\n* {{IMDb title|0078350}}\n* {{TCMDb title|92049}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|swarm}}\n* {{YouTube|JZamBZEDmKU|The Swarm \u2013 Movie Trailer}}\n* [http://www.iann.net/movies/swarm/ Irwin Allen News Network] (The Irwin Allen News Network's Swarm page)\n\n{{Irwin Allen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swarm, The}}\n[[Category:1978 films]]\n[[Category:1978 horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1970s thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s disaster films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American natural horror films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional bees]]\n[[Category:Films about bees]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on thriller novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Irwin Allen]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irwin Allen]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films set in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films set on trains]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Stirling Silliphant]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
