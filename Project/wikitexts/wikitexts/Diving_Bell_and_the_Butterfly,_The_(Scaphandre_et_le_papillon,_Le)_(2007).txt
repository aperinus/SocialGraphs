Based on [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]]'s 1997 [[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly|memoir of the same name]], the film depicts Bauby's life after suffering a massive [[stroke]] that left him with a condition known as [[locked-in syndrome]]. Bauby is played by [[Mathieu Amalric]].\n\n''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly'' won awards at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], the [[Golden Globes]], the [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTAs]], and the [[C\u00e9sar Awards]], and received four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations. Several critics later listed it as one of the best films of its decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade |title=Film Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade |last=Dietz |first=Jason |website=Metacritic |date=3 January 2010 |access-date=1 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428073436/http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade |archive-date=28 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> It ranks in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]]. The film is also on the DVD trailer for The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe first third of the film is told from the main character's, Jean-Dominique Bauby ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), or Jean-Do as his friends call him, first person perspective. The film opens as Bauby wakes from his three-week coma in a hospital in [[Berck-sur-Mer]], [[France]]. After an initial rather over-optimistic analysis from one doctor, a [[neurologist]] explains that he has [[locked-in syndrome]], an extremely rare condition in which the patient is almost completely physically paralyzed, but remains mentally normal. At first, the viewer primarily hears Bauby's \"thoughts\" (he thinks that he is speaking but no one hears him), which are inaccessible to the other characters (who are seen through his one functioning eye).\n\nA speech therapist and physical therapist try to help Bauby become as functional as possible. Bauby cannot speak, but he develops a [[Partner assisted scanning|system of communication]] with his [[speech and language therapist]] by blinking his left eye as she reads a list of letters to laboriously spell out his messages, letter by letter.\n\nGradually, the film's restricted point of view broadens out, and the viewer begins to see Bauby from \"outside\", in addition to experiencing incidents from his past, including a visit to [[Lourdes]]. He also fantasizes, imagining beaches, mountains, the [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress Eug\u00e9nie]] and an erotic feast with one of his transcriptionists. It is revealed that Bauby had been editor of the popular French fashion magazine ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', and that he had a deal to write a book (which was originally going to be based on ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' but from a female perspective). He decides that he will still write a book, using his slow and exhausting communication technique. A woman from the publishing house with which Bauby had the original book contract is brought in to take dictation.\n\nThe new book explains what it is like to now be him, trapped in his body, which he sees as being within an old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit with a brass helmet, which is called a ''scaphandre'' in French, as in the original title. Others around see his spirit, still alive, as a \"Butterfly\".\n\nThe story of Bauby's writing is juxtaposed with his recollections and regrets until his stroke.  We see his three children, their mother (whom he never married), his mistress, his friends, and his father. He encounters people from his past whose lives bear similarities to his own \"entrapment\": a friend who was kidnapped in [[Beirut]] and held in solitary confinement for four years, and his own 92-year-old father, who is confined to his own apartment, because he is too frail to descend four flights of stairs.\n\nBauby eventually completes his memoir and hears the critics' responses. He dies of [[pneumonia]] two days after its publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/europress/boyles200310100902.asp|title=Pre-Mortuarial Medicine|last=Boyles|first=Denis|date=10 October 2003|publisher=[[National Review]] Online|access-date=4 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407230911/http://www.nationalreview.com/europress/boyles200310100902.asp|archive-date=7 April 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7230051.stm|title=Diving Bell movie's fly-away success|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=8 February 2008|access-date=4 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=BlinkNYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/970615.mallon.html|title=In the Blink of an Eye|first=Thomas|last=Mallon|work=[[New York Times]]|date=15 June 1997|access-date=4 May 2014}}</ref> The closing credits are accentuated by reversed shootings of breaking [[glacier]] ice (the forward versions are used in the opening credits), accompanied by the [[The Mescaleros|Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros]] song \"Ramshackle Day Parade\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as C\u00e9line Desmoulins\n* [[Anne Consigny]] as Claude Mendibil\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Henriette Durand\n* Olatz L\u00f3pez Garmendia as Marie Lopez\n* [[Patrick Chesnais]] as Dr. Lepage\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Mr. Bauby Sr.\n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]] as Laurent\n* [[Marina Hands]] as Jos\u00e9phine\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as Roussin\n* [[Anne Alvaro]] as Betty\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as Joubert\n* [[Emma de Caunes]] as [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Empress Eug\u00e9nie]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Lebrun]] as Madame Bauby\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally to be produced by American company [[Universal Studios]] and the screenplay was originally in English, with [[Johnny Depp]] slated to star as Bauby. According to the screenwriter, [[Ronald Harwood]], the choice of Julian Schnabel as director was recommended by Depp. Universal subsequently withdrew, and [[Path\u00e9]] took up the project two years later.

He was terrified of death and had never been sick in his life. So he was in this bed at my house, he was staying with me, and this script arrived for ''The Diving Bell and the Butterfly''.
