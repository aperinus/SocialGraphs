It won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web | title=The awards of the Venice Film Festival | url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/history/awards1.html?back=true | publisher=Labiennale.org | access-date=2010-09-30 | archive-date=14 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214222519/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/history/awards1.html?back=true | url-status=live }}</ref> and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[69th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt the close of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, the besieged Irish rebels surrender to the [[British Army]] at the [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republican]] [[General Post Office, Dublin|headquarters]] in [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin]]. Several key figures of the Rising, including [[Patrick Pearse]], [[Thomas MacDonagh]], [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] and [[James Connolly]], are executed. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] is spared execution due to his American citizenship, but is imprisoned alongside [[Michael Collins (Irish Leader)|Michael Collins]] and [[Harry Boland]].\n\nThe [[1918 Irish general election]] results in the victorious [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party [[Irish Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declaring Irish independence]] and in so doing beginning the [[Irish War of Independence]]. De Valera is elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|President]] and Collins is appointed Director of Intelligence for the emerging [[Irish Republican Army (1919-1922)|IRA]]. [[Eamon Broy|Ned Broy]], officially a member of the loyalist [[G Division (Dublin Metropolitan Police)|G Division]] sympathises with the independence cause and tips Collins off that the [[Dublin Castle|Castle]] intends to arrest the entire [[Government of the 1st D\u00e1il#2nd Ministry|Cabinet]] that evening. De Valera, sensing that the arrest will spark an international outcry, dissuades his cabinet from going into hiding and persuades them to allow their arrests to take place. Collins and Boland evade arrest, though there is no response to the wider action.\n\nAs the last senior leader still free, Collins begins a counter-intelligence campaign with help from Broy. Numerous assassinations of agents and Irish collaborators are carried out by [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|the IRA's Dublin Brigade]]. De Valera soon breaks out of [[HM Prison Lincoln|Lincoln Prison]], but announces on his return to Ireland that he will go to the [[United States]] to seek President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s official recognition of the [[Irish Republic]]. The war continues to intensify; the British assign [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] Officer Soames to counter the IRA, though he and several of his agents are assassinated in an [[Bloody Sunday (1920)#Morning: IRA assassinations|attack]] orchestrated by Collins. To retaliate, the [[Black and Tans]] are sent to Dublin to brutally suppress unarmed civilians in support of independence, culminating in a [[Bloody Sunday (1920)#Afternoon: Croke Park massacre|massacre at Croke Park]], in which 14 people are killed during a peaceful [[Gaelic football]] game. Broy's assistance to Collins is also discovered by Soames, who subsequently has Broy tortured and killed.\n\nDe Valera returns from America having been unable to secure President Wilson's support. The British hint at direct communication with the Irish, though Collins' [[guerilla warfare|guerilla campaign]] has boded poorly for Ireland's image. De Valera therefore decrees that the IRA must fight as a conventional army, though Collins knows that this will just lead to another defeat against the might of the [[British Empire]]. Adamant in his approach to securing peace, de Valera orders an attack on [[The Custom House]], but the IRA suffers heavy casualties and [[Burning of the Custom House|the attack fails catastrophically]]. Despite the desperate situation the IRA now finds itself in, the British unexpectedly call for a ceasefire.\n\nCollins is sent to [[London, England|London]] to negotiate Irish interests as part of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], which is signed in 1921. Though the Republic is not immediately granted independence, the treaty enables Ireland to achieve it over time while remaining a British [[dominion]] during the interim as well as losing six of the nine [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] counties, which will remain in the UK. De Valera, who sought unconditional independence for Ireland, is furious upon learning of this and he and his supporters, including Boland, resign in protest. The subsequent people's vote backs the terms of the treaty, but de Valera rejects the result and in 1922 leads a seizure of the [[Four Courts]] in Dublin. The IRA, led by Collins, is ordered to retake it. In the subsequent [[Battle of Dublin]], Boland is killed.\n\nDevastated upon learning of his friend's death, Collins journeys to [[West Cork]], where de Valera is in hiding, to mediate peace. Collins, however, is misdirected by de Valera's associates and is led into an ambush in which he is shot and killed. [[Kitty Kiernan]], Collins' love interest, is informed of his death just as she tries on a wedding gown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as [[Harry Boland]]\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as [[Ned Broy]]\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Kitty Kiernan]]\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Joe O'Reilly\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Liam Tobin]]\n* [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] as Smith\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as [[Cathal Brugha]]\n* [[Owen O'Neill]] as [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]]\n*[[Owen Roe (actor)|Owen Roe]] as [[Arthur Griffith]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Soames, the British [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] officer who commands the [[Cairo Gang]]\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Collins' Assassin\n* [[Ian McElhinney]] as Belfast Detective\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as [[Tom Cullen (Irish republican)|Tom Cullen]]<!--, who is subject imprisonment and torture by the Castle before being recruited as an IRA assassin.-->\n* Gary Lydon as Squad Youth\n*[[Jean Kennedy Smith]] (Uncredited cameo)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Cimino]] wrote a script and was involved in pre-production work on a possible Collins film for over a year in the early 1990s, with [[Gabriel Byrne]] marked down to star. However, Cimino was fired over budget concerns. [[Neil Jordan]] mentions in his film diary that [[Kevin Costner]] had also been interested in developing a movie about Collins and had visited [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]] and the surrounding areas.<ref name=\"Jordan\">Neil Jordan, ''Michael Collins'', Plume Press, 1996 {{ISBN|0-452-27686-1}}</ref>\n\nThe eventual film was scripted and directed by Neil Jordan and was an [[international co-production]] between companies in Ireland and the United States.<ref name=\"Irish\">{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/estudiosirlandeses/merivirta07.pdf |title=Between Irish National Cinema and Hollywood: Neil Jordan's Michael Collins |access-date=2010-09-30 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172641/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/estudiosirlandeses/merivirta07.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> With a budget estimated at $25 million, with 10%-12% from the [[Irish Film Board]], it was one of the most expensive films ever produced in Ireland.<ref name=\"Goldstone\">Goldstone, Patricia.

It also led to [[Warner Bros.]] executive Rob Friedman pressurising the director to reshoot the ending to focus on the love story between Collins and Kiernan, in an attempt to downplay the breakdown of Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations.<ref name=\"Goldstone\"/>\n\nA number of Irish actors auditioned for the part of de Valera but Jordan felt they were performing a stereotype of de Valera rather than finding his true character. Jordan discussed the role with [[John Turturro]] before casting Alan Rickman. Jordan initially envisioned Stephen Rea playing Harry Boland, but then decided the role of Broy would give Rea more of a challenge. [[Matt Dillon]] and [[Adam Baldwin]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"Jordan\" /> Aengus O'Malley, a great grandnephew of Michael Collins, played the role of a student filmed in [[Marsh's Library]].\n\n==Historicity==\nAlthough based on historical events, the film contains some alterations and fictionalisations, such as the dramatised circumstances of Harry Boland's death and Ned Broy's fate, as well as significant alterations to the formative years of [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and the prelude to the events of Bloody Sunday at [[Croke Park]]. Neil Jordan defended his film by saying that it could not provide an entirely accurate account of events since it was a two-hour film that had to be understandable to an international audience that would not know the minutiae of [[Irish history]].<ref>\"Michael Collins\", ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', 27 October 1996.</ref> The documentary on the DVD release of the film also discusses its fictional aspects.\n\nThe critic [[Roger Ebert]] referred to the closing quotation from de Valera that history would vindicate Collins at his own expense by writing that \"even Dev could hardly have imagined this film biography of Collins, which portrays De Valera as a weak, mannered, sniveling prima donna whose grandstanding led to decades of unnecessary bloodshed in, and over, Ireland.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\nAccording to [[Alan Rickman]], in the script there was a scene which made it clear that his character was not involved in the death of Michael Collins. However, this was cut (either by the director or the studio) in order to focus on a more romantic rather than political ending.<ref>\"Acting Against Expectations\", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 5 May 2001.</ref> Jordan has said that he never intended to indicate that de Valera had a hand in the assassination and has called the film's portrayal of de Valera \"unfair\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Meskill |first=Tommy |date=2022-08-21 |title=Film portrayal of de Valera 'unfair' - Neil Jordan |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2022/0821/1316892-jordan-collins-movie/ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nBoland did not die in the manner suggested by the film. He was shot in a skirmish with Irish Free State soldiers in The Grand Hotel, [[Skerries, Dublin|Skerries]], County Dublin, in the aftermath of the Battle of Dublin. The hotel has since been demolished, but a plaque was put where the building used to be. His last words in the film (\"Have they got Mick Collins yet?\") are based on a well-known tradition.<ref>Fitzpatrick, David.

[[Frank Patterson]] also performs with the Cafe Orchestra in the film and on the album.\n\n==Ratings==\nThe [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|Irish Film Censor]] initially intended to give the film an over-15 certificate, but later decided that it should be released with a PG certificate because of its historical importance. The censor issued a press statement defending his decision, claiming the film was a landmark in Irish cinema and that \"because of the subject matter, parents should have the option of making their own decision as to whether their children should see the film or not\".<ref name=\"Irish\"/> The video release was given a 12 certificate.\n\nThe film was rated 15 in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AFF066354 |title=MICHAEL COLLINS &#124; British Board of Film Classification |publisher=BBFC.co.uk |access-date=2016-11-28 |archive-date=19 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819181639/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AFF066354/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was rated R in the United States by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\n''Michael Collins'' opened in 6 theatres in the United States on 11 October 1996 and grossed $182,221 for the weekend.
