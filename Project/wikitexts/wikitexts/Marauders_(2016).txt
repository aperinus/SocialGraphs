Miller]] and written by Michael Cody and [[Chris Sivertson]]. The film stars [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Dave Bautista]], and [[Adrian Grenier]]. Meloni plays an FBI agent investigating a series of brutal bank robberies that seem to be personally targeting a ruthless CEO played by Willis. [[Lionsgate Premiere]] released the film on July 1.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Cincinnati]], four masked robbers get away with $3 million in cash from Hubert National Bank after the crew's leader executes manager Steven Hutchinson point-blank. [[FBI Special Agent]] Jonathan Montgomery heads the joint robbery-homicide investigation with Cincinnati PD. [[Forensics]] techs find a print matched to a dead Army Ranger named TJ Jackson. According to the official report, in 2011, TJ's unit went rogue, capturing civilian Alexander Hubert to collect a ransom. The exchange went awry and Alexander and the Rangers were killed by a [[Special Forces]] team. TJ's body was never recovered. As the sole heir, Jeffrey Hubert, Alexander's brother, became president of Hubert International. By tracking the serial numbers, the FBI discovers the robbers donated the money to a City Mission charity fund.\n\nIn a second heist at a different Hubert bank location, the robbers steal cash and the contents of personal safety deposit boxes belonging to Hubert and Ohio Senator Cook. David Dagley, a member of Hubert's security detail, is lured to the bank then stabbed to death in an ambush. The killer leaves a bullet with TJ's fingerprint on it. Dagley was Commanding Officer of the Rangers who snatched Alexander Hubert but didn't take part in the ransom scheme. The getaway vehicle is discovered registered to TJ's brother, James. Montgomery receives photo evidence of an apparent homosexual affair between Hubert and Cook, and the robbers attempt to persuade Montgomery into investigating Hubert's corruption. Converging on the Main Branch for the third robbery, the gang surprise the FBI during an interview with Hubert. High-powered rifle firefights erupt across the lobby as the men engage in close quarters combat. One thief is killed, and the three others retreat into the downtown traffic. Victims Hutchinson and Dagley are found to be old members of an elite platoon with Cook.\n\nMontgomery is sent a file stolen from Hubert detailing the conspiracy to commit murder and military cover-up. It leaks to the media, and the truth finally outs: Hubert conspired with Cook to prevent Alexander from taking over the company. They briefed the Ranger unit with false mission intel of a terrorist threat in [[Costa Rica]]. The Rangers sent in were then assessed as rogue agents and ambushed by a Special Forces team with no knowledge of the Rangers' innocence. TJ was the sole survivor, saved by then-Special Forces sniper Wells.\n\nWith his assets frozen, Hubert hastily makes large unauthorized cash withdrawals to flee the country. TJ is tracked by the FBI to a concert venue and taken into custody. FBI Special Agent Wells is revealed to be the thief crew leader, and three special forces members that attacked TJ's squad are accomplices. He planned the heists as vengeance for the Ranger massacre he took part in. Recalling a key detail in a map location, detective Mims predicts Wells as the thief and arrives as Wells preps to leave the stash spot with the cash. Tormented by a guilty conscience and his wife's terminal cancer prognosis, Mims pleads with Wells to allow him to return the stolen money and atone. Wells tries to reason with Mims but kills him as Mims raises his weapon.\n\nSome time later, Montgomery tracks Hubert to [[Tijuana]], Mexico. He finds Wells preparing to kill Hubert in a restaurant and suggests Wells absolve his transgressions by using the stolen money to help others. Montgomery takes a seat at Hubert's table, sips wine in remembrance of his wife, then stabs Hubert with a concealed blade. Wells shoots Hubert's bodyguard, shares a glance with Montgomery, and leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Special Agent Jonathan Montgomery \n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Jeffrey Hubert\n* [[Dave Bautista]] as Agent Stockwell\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Special Agent Wells\n* [[Texas Battle]] as Ranger TJ Jackson\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Detective Brian Mims\n* Lydia Hull as Special Agent Lydia Chase\n* Tyler Jon Olson as Detective Zach Derohan\n* Christopher Rob Bowen as Bradley Teegan\n* [[Danny A.
