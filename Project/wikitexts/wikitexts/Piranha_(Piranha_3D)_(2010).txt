Local cop Julie Forester ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) must join forces with a band of unlikely strangers\u2014though they are badly outnumbered\u2014to destroy the ravenous creatures before everyone becomes fish food.\n\n''Piranha 3D''\u00a0was theatrically released in the United States on August 30, 2010, by [[Dimension Films]]. The film received generally positive reviews, with film critics praising it as a fun and entertaining\u00a0[[B-movie]]. It was a box office success, grossing over $83 million worldwide against a $24 million budget. A sequel,\u00a0''[[Piranha 3DD]]'', was released in 2012 to critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary serves as an overview of the film's events. Per WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, the plot summary should not go below or exceed 400-700 words. -->\n\nFisherman Matt Boyd is fishing in Lake Victoria, [[Arizona]] when a small [[earthquake]] hits, splitting the lake floor and causing a whirlpool. Boyd falls in and is eaten by a school of prehistoric [[piranha]]s that emerge from the chasm.\n\nAs [[spring break]] begins, Jake Forester reunites with his old crush Kelly and meets her arrogant boyfriend, Todd Dupree. Jake meets Derrick Jones, a sleazy pornographer as well as Danni, one of his actresses. Derrick convinces Jake to show him good spots on the lake for filming a [[Pornographic film|pornographic movie]]. Jake's mother, Sheriff Julie Forester, searches for the missing Matt Boyd with Deputy Fallon. They find his mutilated body and contemplate closing the lake. However, this decision is made difficult with thousands of partying college students on spring break, which is important for bringing [[revenue]] to the small town. The next morning, a lone cliff diver is attacked and devoured by the piranhas.\n\nJake's siblings Zane and Laura take a canoe to go fishing on a small [[sandbar]] island and become stranded in the middle of the lake due to Zane neglecting to properly secure the [[canoe]]. Jake runs into Kelly, who accepted Derrick's invitation on board his boat, and meets Derrick's other actress Crystal and his cameraman Andrew.\n\nJulie takes a team of [[seismologist]] divers: Novak, Sam, and Paula to the fissure. Novak speculates that the rift leads to a buried prehistoric lake. Paula and Sam [[scuba dive]] to the bottom and discover a big cavern filled with large piranha egg stocks. Both are eaten by the piranhas before they can alert the others. Novak and Julie find Paula's corpse and pull it onto the boat, capturing a lone piranha, which they take to Carl Goodman, a retired [[marine biologist]]. He explains that this piranha is a super aggressive prehistoric species known as ''[[Pygocentrus nattereri]]'', or the Original Piranha, long believed to have been extinct for over 2 million years and theorizes that the piranhas must have survived through [[cannibalism]]. The species is able to vigorously devour its prey in seconds.\n\nJulie, Novak, Fallon and Deputy Taylor Roberts try to evacuate the lake but their warnings are ignored until the piranhas begin to attack the tourists, turning the party into a bloodbath. Novak boards a [[jet-ski]] with a shotgun to help while the rest of the team try to save the others. Almost everyone in the lake is either brutally wounded or killed by the piranhas, including Todd, who attempts to escape but his boat's motor is snagged by a random party-goer and his boat quickly mobbed and capsized.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake spots Laura and Zane on the island and forces Derrick to rescue them. Derrick crashes the boat, flooding the lower deck and causing the boat to begin sinking. Kelly is trapped in the kitchen while Derrick, Crystal and Andrew fall overboard. Andrew escapes to the shore alive while the piranhas feast on Crystal. Danni manages to get a partially-eaten Derrick back on board, where he eventually dies.\n\nDeputy Fallon makes a last stand, taking a boat motor and using its propeller as a makeshift chainsaw to shred many piranhas, with the cost of his legs. Julie and Novak reach Jake on a [[Motorboat|speedboat]] and attach a rope to his boat. Julie, Danni, Laura and Zane start crossing the rope but the piranhas latch onto Danni's hair, causing her to fall into the water, where she is ripped apart and devoured. The others make it across safely but the rope comes loose. Jake ties the line to himself and goes to save Kelly. He ties her to him and lights a flare after releasing the gas from stored propane tanks. Novak speeds the boat away just as the piranhas surround Kelly and Jake. They are dragged to safety as the propane tanks explode, killing most of the piranhas.\n\nA terrified Mr. Goodman calls Julie, who tells him that they seem to have killed the majority of the piranhas. Goodman tells her that the reproductive glands on the piranha they obtained were not mature, which means the fish they have killed were only the babies. As Novak wonders aloud where the mature ones are, an adult human-sized piranha leaps out of the water and eats him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Sheriff Julie Forester\n* [[Steven R.
