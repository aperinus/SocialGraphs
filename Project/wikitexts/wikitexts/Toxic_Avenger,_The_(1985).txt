It is the first installment of [[The Toxic Avenger (franchise)|''The Toxic Avenger'']] franchise. The film was released by [[Troma Entertainment]], known for producing low budget [[B-movies]] with [[Camp (style)|campy]] concepts and gruesome violence. Virtually ignored upon its first release, ''The Toxic Avenger'' caught on with filmgoers after a long and successful [[midnight movie]] engagement at the [[Bleecker Street Cinema]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in late 1985. It is now regarded as a [[cult following|cult classic]].\n\nThe film has generated a [[The Toxic Avenger (franchise)|media franchise]] including three film [[sequel]]s, a [[The Toxic Avenger (musical)|stage musical production]], a video game and a [[Toxic Crusaders|children's TV cartoon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/575_lloyd_kaufman.htm |title=Lloyd Kaufman |access-date=2008-06-05 |last=Westbrook |first=Caroline |date=2003-11-07 |publisher=Something Jewish}}</ref> In 2019, it was announced that [[Legendary Entertainment]] would be producing a reboot of the film, with original creators [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and [[Michael Herz (producer)|Michael Herz]] of [[Troma Entertainment]] serving as producers and [[Macon Blair]] serving as writer and director.<ref>{{cite web |title=Macon Blair to Direct and Write 'Toxic Avenger' Reboot for Legendary |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/macon-blair-toxic-avenger-reboot-1203169334/ |website=Variety|date=21 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMelvin Ferd Junko III is a weakling who works as a [[janitor]] at a health club in the fictional town of Tromaville, [[New Jersey]], where the customers\u2014particularly Bozo, Slug, Wanda and Julie\u2014harass him constantly. His tormentors murder a young boy on a bike with their car and take photos of the carnage afterward. They trick Melvin into wearing a pink tutu and amorously hugging a sheep. He is chased around the health club and out a second story window. He falls into a drum of toxic waste, which sets him on fire. After running down the street, Melvin douses the flames in his bathtub. The chemicals transform him into a hideously deformed mutant with superhuman size and strength.\n\nA group of drug dealers, led by Cigar Face, are trying to buy off a police officer named O'Clancy. When he refuses to accept the money, Cigar Face and his gang prepare to [[castrate]] him. Melvin appears and kills the criminals, then leaves a mop on their faces as a calling card. Cigar Face escapes, promising to take revenge. Melvin returns home, but his mother is terrified of him and will not let him in the house, so Melvin, publicly dubbed \"The Monster Hero\" (also known as \"The Toxic Avenger\" or \"Toxie\") and hailed as a hero, builds a makeshift home in the junkyard.\n\nA gang of three men hold up a Mexican restaurant and attack a blind woman named Sara. They kill her guide dog and attempt to rape her, but are stopped by Melvin, who wreaks bloody vengeance on them. Toxie takes Sara back to her home, where they get to know one another and subsequently become romantically involved. Melvin continues to fight crime, including drug dealers and [[Child prostitution|pimps for underage prostitutes]], and also takes revenge on the four tormentors who caused his transformation. He attacks Wanda in the health club's sauna and burns her backside on the heater. He later returns to the club, pursues Julie into the basement, and cuts off her hair. He confronts Bozo and Slug after they steal a car, ending in Slug getting thrown out of the moving car and Bozo driving off the side of a cliff, killing him.\n\nAs Melvin gives aid to the people in the city, Mayor Belgoody, the leader of Tromaville's extensive crime ring, is terrified of what is happening to his goons. He is worried that it will lead back to him and wants Melvin taken care of. A group of men, led by Cigar Face, surround Melvin with guns. Just before they fire on him, he leaps up to a fire escape, so that they shoot each other.\n\nWhen Melvin kills a seemingly innocent old woman in a dry cleaning store (she is in fact a leader of an underground [[human trafficking]] ring), Belgoody calls in the [[United States National Guard]]. Back in his junkyard home, Melvin is horrified at what he has become. He and Sara decide to move away from the city and take a tent into nearby woods. They are eventually discovered, and the Mayor and the National Guard come to kill him, but the people of Tromaville refuse, and Melvin's mother arrives and identifies the mutant as her son. The Mayor's evil ways are revealed, and Melvin proceeds to rip out Belgoody's organs to see if he has \"any guts\". The Toxic Avenger continues to combat crime in Tromaville.\n\n==Cast==\n* Mitch Cohen as Melvin Ferd Junko III/The Toxic Avenger\n** Kenneth Kessler as The Voice of Maelvin Ferd Junko III/The Toxic Avenger\n* Mark Torgl as Melvin Ferd Junko III\n* Andree Maranda as Sara\n* [[R.

Previously the production company focused on sex comedies such as ''[[Cry Uncle!]]'' and ''[[Squeeze Play!]]''. Subsequently, Troma focused almost exclusively on horror films.<ref name=\"Official site\"/>\n\nIn 1975, [[Lloyd Kaufman]] had the idea to shoot a [[horror film]] involving a health club while serving as the pre-production supervisor on the set of ''[[Rocky]]''. At the [[Cannes Film Festival]], Kaufman had read an article that said horror films were no longer popular, so Kaufman claims that he decided to produce his own version of the horror film. The film's final outcome was less a bona fide horror film and more of a campy superhero-spoof with extreme violence embedded throughout. The setting of the movie in a health club and the movie was given a working title of ''Health Club Horror''.<ref name=\"Official site\">{{cite web |url=http://www.toxicavenger.com/movies/ta1/index.html |title=The Original Toxic Avenger |access-date=2008-06-05 |publisher=Troma Entertainment, Inc.}}</ref><ref name=\"pittnews\">{{cite web|url=https://pittnews.com/article/33678/archives/read-your-own-damn-story-about-making-your-own-damn-movie/|title=Read your own damn story - about making your own damn movie|access-date=August 3, 2006|last=Leitner|first=Lucy|date=23 November 2004|publisher=The Pitt News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622103620/http://www.pittnews.com/node/4516|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography for ''The Toxic Avenger'' took place at various locations in [[New Jersey]], including [[Jersey City]], [[Boonton]], [[Paramus]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]], and [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]] during the summer of 1983.<ref>The Star Ledger.
