It stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Chris Tucker]], and [[Milla Jovovich]]. Primarily set in the 23rd century, the film's central plot involves the survival of planet Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former [[special forces]] major, after a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his cab. To accomplish this, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack of a malevolent cosmic entity.\n\nBesson started writing the story that was developed as ''The Fifth Element'' when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable facilities could not be found; filming took place in [[London]] and [[Mauritania]] instead. He hired comic artists [[Jean Giraud|Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud]] and [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], whose books inspired parts of the film, for production design. Costume design was by [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].\n\n''The Fifth Element'' received mainly positive reviews, although some critics were highly negative. The film won in categories at the [[51st British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]]s, the [[23rd C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Award]]s, the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[Lumi\u00e8res Award]]s, but also received nominations at the [[18th Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry]] and [[1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards|Stinkers Bad Movie Award]]s. ''The Fifth Element'' was a strong financial success, earning more than US$263{{nbs}}million at the box office on a $90{{nbs}}million budget. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the international box office until the release of ''[[The Intouchables]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans meet their human contact, a priest of a secret order, at an [[ancient Egypt]]ian temple. They take the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil<!--lower case--> that appears every five thousand years, and promise to return the weapon before the great evil's re-emergence. The weapon consists of the four [[classical element]]s, as four engraved stones, plus a [[sarcophagus]] containing a \"fifth element\".\n\nIn 2263{{efn|The film's opening scene states the year is 1914 and the following scene in space states it is \"300 years later\". However, Korben's alarm clock shows the year as 2263. The year is given as 2257 on the DVD sleeve notes published by Path\u00e9 in 1997, and as 2259 by Besson in ''The Story of The Fifth Element''.}}, the great evil appears in deep space as a giant living fireball. It destroys an armed Earth spaceship as it heads to Earth. The Mondoshawans' current human contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories of the great evil's history and of the weapon that can stop it.\n\nOn their way to Earth, a Mondoshawan spacecraft carrying the weapon is ambushed and destroyed by a crew of Mangalores, alien mercenaries hired by Earth industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working for the great evil. A severed hand in metal armor from the wreckage of the spacecraft is brought to New York City. From this, the government uses biotechnology to recreate the original occupant of the sarcophagus, a humanoid woman named Leeloo who remembers her previous life. Alarmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and high security, she escapes and jumps off a ledge, crashing into the [[Flying car (aircraft)|flying taxicab]] of Korben Dallas, a former major in Earth's [[Special Forces]].\n\nDallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, who recognize her as the Fifth Element. As Leeloo recuperates, she tells Cornelius that the stones were not onboard the Mondoshawan ship. Simultaneously, the Mondoshawans inform Earth's government the stones were entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg reneges on his deal with the Mangalores for failing to obtain the stones and kills some of them. Earth's military sends Dallas to meet Plavalaguna; a rigged radio contest provides a cover, awarding Dallas a luxury vacation aboard a flying hotel on planet Fhloston, accompanied by flamboyant talk-show host Ruby Rhod. It includes a concert by Plavalaguna, and learning that Leeloo shares his mission, Dallas lets her accompany him. Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple, then stows away on the luxury spaceship. The Mangalore crew, pursuing the stones for themselves, also illegally board the ship.\n\nDuring the concert, the Mangalores attack and Plavalaguna dies. Dallas extracts the stones from her body and kills the Mangalore leader, causing the others to surrender. Zorg arrives, shoots and traumatizes Leeloo, and activates a [[time bomb]]. He flees with a carrying case he presumes contains the stones, but returns when he discovers it is empty. He deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg. Meanwhile, Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and Rhod escape with the stones in Zorg's private spaceship.\n\nAs the great evil approaches Earth, the four meet David at the temple. They deploy the stones, but Leeloo, having learned of humanity's own terrible history of war, has given up on life. Dallas declares his love for her and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of the stones, emitting divine light onto the great evil and defeating it. She and Dallas are hailed as heroes and, as dignitaries wait to greet them, the two passionately embrace in a recovery chamber.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Korben Dallas\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Leeloo\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Vito Cornelius\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Ruby Rhod\n* [[Luke Perry]] as Billy Masterson\n* [[Brion James]] as General Munro\n* [[Tommy Lister Jr.|Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister Jr.]] as President Lindberg\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Fog\n* [[Charlie Creed-Miles]] as David\n* [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] as Right Arm\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as General Staedert\n* [[John Bluthal]] as Professor Pacoli\n* [[Ma\u00efwenn|Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco]] as Diva Plavalaguna\n* [[Sonny Caldinez]] as Emperor Kodar Japhet\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn an interview, Besson stated ''The Fifth Element'' was not a \"big theme movie\", although the film's theme was an important one. He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states, \"What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?\" and agree with her.<ref name=stephen/> Jay P.

The authors criticized the film for erasing women from the introductory scenes, noting that only two appeared in the first twenty minutes: an androgynous, mostly speechless presidential aide, and Leeloo undergoing reconstruction. When females appear in the film, they are presented as passive objects, such as the sexualised flight and [[McDonald's]] attendants; or stripped of their femininity, such as the \"[[Butch and femme|butch]]\" Major Iceborg.<ref name=women>{{cite journal |last1=Ott |first1=Brian L |last2=Aoki |first2=Eric |year=2001 |title=Counter-Imagination as Interpretive Practice: Futuristic Fantasy and ''The Fifth Element'' |doi=10.1080/07491409.2004.10162471 |hdl=10217/644 |url=https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/644/SCOMblo00002.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=149\u2013176 |s2cid=53953295 |access-date=3 August 2019|hdl-access=free }}</ref>\n\nStefan Brandt, in the book ''Subverting Masculinity'', also said that the film \"echoes stereotypical beliefs about gender\" of all females in the film. He said that Leeloo left her passive role only during her fight with the Mangalores. Except for Tiny Lister's portrayal of the President, Brandt said that all males in the film were shown as unmanly as possible in various ways, such as Ruby Rhod's effeminacy, Vito Cornelius's clumsy form of speech, and General Munro's stupidity; their purpose was to make Korben's masculinity appear \"god-like\" by comparison.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brandt |first=Stefan |chapter=American Culture X: Identity, homosexuality, and the search for a new American hero |title=Subverting Masculinity: Hegemonic and Alternative Visions of Masculinity in Contemporary Culture |editor1-last=West |editor1-first=Russell |editor2-last=Lay |editor2-first=Frank |year=2000 |pages=67\u201393 |publisher=Rodopi |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-90-420-1234-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the book ''The Films of Luc Besson'', Susan Hayward considered ''The Fifth Element'' to be a classic story of a man \"making his break from the tribe, proving his manhood, overthrowing the malevolent forces, and killing the chief, finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage\".{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=98}} Korben's journey, however, is threatened not only by the Mangalores and Zorg, but also by Leeloo, who does not relent or help him until the last minute, when she accepts his declaration of love.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=98}} The love story within ''The Fifth Element'' was considered to be one of the main narratives in the film, and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=98}} Hayward also considered the film to grapple with [[ecology|environmental damage]], in so far as waste and pollution are visible throughout the film.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|pages=91\u201392}} Whereas [[science-fiction film]]s often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity, ''The Films of Luc Besson'' included ''The Fifth Element'' among the minority of science-fiction films that \"hold up a mirror\" and show humankind as responsible.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=92}} Hayward said the film was skeptical of capitalist [[consumerism]], in so far as the gadgets Zorg collected in his office suggested that he had an unhealthy obsession for [[technology]].{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=92}} The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=92}}\n\n==Production==\nAs a teenager, Besson envisioned the world of ''The Fifth Element'' in an attempt to alleviate boredom.

There, he meets Leeloo, a \"sand-girl\" who has the \"beauty of youth\" despite being over 2,000 years old.{{sfn|Besson|1997|pages=8\u20139}}\n\nBesson continued to work on the story for years. By 1991, when his documentary film ''[[Atlantis (1991 film)|Atlantis]]'' was released, he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and [[Patrice Ledoux]] from [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while looking for actors for the film, Besson met [[Franco-Belgian comics|French comics]] creators [[Jean Giraud]] and [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]] and recruited them{{sfn|Besson|1997|pages=9\u201310}} for the film's production design.<ref name=av>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/rip-moebius-comics-legend-and-imetal-hurlant-ico-f-70686 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111072039/http://www.avclub.com/article/rip-moebius-comics-legend-and-imetal-hurlant-ico-f-70686 |archive-date=11 November 2014 |title=R.I.P.

M\u00e9zi\u00e8res showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change character Korben Dallas's background from a worker in a rocket-ship factory to a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City.{{sfnm|1a1=Besson|1y=1997|1p=158|2a1=M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|2y=2004|2p=65}} Besson's production also hired five other artists for the project. In addition, the noted fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] was hired to create the costumes. The team spent a year creating more than 8,000 drawings.\n\nDuring this time, Besson approached both [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Mel Gibson]] for the lead role. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'' and ''[[Billy Bathgate (film)|Billy Bathgate]]'', had been received poorly. Gibson eventually turned down the role.{{sfn|Besson|1997|pages=10\u201311}} While the production team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one willing to take on a budget approaching nearly $100{{nbs}}million. In December 1992, production stopped{{sfn|Besson|1997|page=149}} without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.{{sfn|Besson|1997|page=11}}\n[[File:Fifth Element Circles of Power.png|thumb|alt=screenshot of a flying taxi in the film, placed above a drawing of a flying taxi from a comic book|Korben's flying [[taxicab]] (top), which was inspired by the comic album ''[[The Circles of Power]]'', drawn by artist [[Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]].{{sfn|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|2004|page=65}}]]\n\nBesson wrote and directed the commercially successful film ''[[L\u00e9on: The Professional]]'' (1994).
