Originally produced for [[Channel 4]], the film is a form of [[murder mystery]], set in rural [[Wiltshire]], England in 1694 (during the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]). The period setting is reflected in [[Michael Nyman]]'s [[film score|score]], which borrows widely from [[Henry Purcell]], and in the extensive and elaborate costume designs (which, for effect, slightly exaggerate those of the period). The action was shot on location in the house and formal gardens of [[Groombridge Place]].<ref>The location is given as \"Groombridge\" for example in [http://www.bfi.org.uk/greenaway/material.php?theme=2&type=Photograph&title=draughtsman the stills page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310015518/http://www.bfi.org.uk/greenaway/material.php?theme=2&type=Photograph&title=draughtsman |date=10 March 2012 }}</ref> The film received the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association)|Grand Prix]] of the [[Belgian Film Critics Association]].\n\n==Plot==\nMr Neville ([[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]]), a young and conceited artist, is contracted  by Mrs Virginia Herbert ([[Janet Suzman]]) to produce a series of twelve landscape drawings of her country house, its outbuildings and gardens, as a gift for her cold and neglectful husband, who is currently away on business.\n\nPart of the contract is that Mrs Herbert agrees to comply with Mr Neville\u2019s sexual demands. Several sexual encounters between them follow, each indicating reluctance or distress on the part of Mrs Herbert, and sexual aggression or insensitivity on the part of Mr Neville. During his stay, Mr Neville becomes disliked by several of the estate's inhabitants and visitors, especially by Mrs Herbert's son-in-law, Mr Talmann ([[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]]).\n\nEventually Mrs Herbert, wearied by Mr Neville\u2019s excessive sexual appetite, tries to terminate the contract before the drawings are completed. But Neville refuses and their encounters continue as before. Then Mrs Herbert's married but childless daughter, Mrs Talmann ([[Anne-Louise Lambert]]), frustrated by her husband\u2019s lack of interest in sex, blackmails Neville into a second contract, in which he agrees to comply with her sexual demands, rather than she with his. Mrs Talman wishes to become pregnant, and knows this is unlikely to happen with her husband.\n\nMr Herbert does not return when expected, and his dead body is eventually discovered in the moat. Mr Neville completes his drawings and leaves, but returns to make an unlucky thirteenth drawing. During his visit, he is surprised when Mrs Herbert propositions him for sex, and they make love. Mrs Herbert also indicates that her daughter\u2019s plan to conceive a child by Mr Neville has been successful.\n\nIn the evening, while Mr Neville is apparently finishing the final sketch, he is approached by a masked man, obviously Mr Talmann in disguise, who is then joined by the estate manager and Mrs Herbert's former fianc\u00e9, Mr Noyes, her neighbour Mr Seymour, and the Poulenc twins, eccentric local landowners.\n\nThe party accuses Mr Neville of the murder of Mr Herbert, for the drawings can be interpreted to suggest more than one illegal act and to implicate more than one person. They also accuse him of the sexual violation of Mrs Herbert, as evidenced by his sexual congress with her that afternoon.\n\nNeville realises, too late, that he has been entrapped by Mrs Herbert. Despite his protests, the group of men blind him and beat him to death, finally casting his body into the moat at the place where Mr Herbert's corpse was found.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]] as R.

Because Mr. Talmann was impotent, they used Mr. Neville as a stud. Mr. Herbert was murdered at the site where Mr. Neville is murdered. (In the original treatment, Mr. Herbert is murdered on his return on the 12th day and the site was vetoed as a painting site, because it was instead to be used as a murder site.)\n\n== Background ==\nThe film was inspired when Greenaway, who trained as an artist before becoming a filmmaker, spent three weeks drawing a house near [[Hay-on-Wye]] while holidaying with his family. Much like Mr. Neville in the final film, every day he would work on a particular view at a set time, to preserve the lighting effects while sketching from day to day. The hands shown drawing in the film are Greenaway's own, as are the completed drawings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/01/1|title=Murder he drew|last=Greenaway|first=Peter|date=2003-08-01|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe original cut of the film was about three hours long. The opening scene was about 30 minutes long and showed each character talking, at least once, with every other character. Possibly to make the film easier to watch, Greenaway edited it to 103 minutes. The opening scene is now about 10 minutes long and no longer shows all the interactions among all of the characters.  Some anomalies in the longer version film are deliberate anachronisms: the depiction of the use of a cordless phone in the 17th century and the inclusion on the walls of the house of paintings by Greenaway in emulation of [[Roy Lichtenstein]] which are partly visible in the released version of the film.<ref>Willochet, Paula. ''Peter Greenaway in Indianapolis'' lecture, Introduction. 1997.</ref>\n\nThe released final version provides fewer explanations to the plot's numerous oddities and mysteries. The main murder mystery is never solved, though little doubt remains as to who did it. The reasons for the 'living statue' in the garden and why Mr. Neville attached so many conditions to his contract were also more developed in the first version.\n\n==Locations==\n[[Groombridge Place]] was the main location in this tale of 17th-century intrigue and murder.\n<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1982/01/the-draughtsman2019s-contract-1982/|title=Kent Film Office The Draughtsman's Contract Film Focus}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = The Draughtsman's Contract\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| cover        =\n| caption      =  \n| released     = 1982\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Contemporary classical music]], [[Film score]]s; [[minimalist music|minimalism]]\n| length       = 40:42\n| label        = [[Piano Records|Piano]]<br>[[DRG Records|DRG]] (Italy)<br>[[Charisma Records|Charisma]]/[[Caroline Records|Caroline]] (CD)\n| producer     = [[David Cunningham (musician)|David Cunningham]]\n| prev_title   = [[Michael Nyman (1981 album)|Michael Nyman]]\n| prev_year        = 1981\n| year         = 1982\n| next_title   = [[The Cold Room]]\n| next_year    = 1984\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r84971}}</ref>\n| rev2      =\n| rev2Score =\n}}\n[[Michael Nyman]]'s score is derived from [[ground bass|grounds]] by [[Henry Purcell]] overlaid with new melodies.  The original plan was to use one ground for every two of the twelve drawings but Nyman states in the liner notes that this was unworkable.  The ground for one of the most popular pieces, \"An Eye for Optical Theory\", is considered to be probably composed by [[William Croft]], a contemporary of Purcell.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The goal was to create a generalized memory of Purcell, rather than specific memories, so a piece as readily recognizable as \"[[Dido's Lament]]\" was not considered an acceptable source of a ground.  Purcell is credited as a \"music consultant\".\n\nThe album was the fourth album release by Michael Nyman and the third to feature the [[Michael Nyman Band]]. \"It's like [[harpsichord]] and a lot of [[string section|strings]], woodwind and a bit of [[Brass section|brass]],\" remarked [[Neil Hannon]], frontman of [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]. \"Somehow they just manage to\u2026 rock.
