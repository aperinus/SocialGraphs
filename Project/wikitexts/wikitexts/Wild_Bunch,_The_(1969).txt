The gang is ambushed by Pike's former partner, Deke Thornton, who is leading a posse of [[bounty hunter]]s hired by corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan. The bloody shootout that results kills more than half of the gang. Pike uses a serendipitous [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] parade to shield their getaway, and many citizens are killed in the crossfire.\n\nPike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, and the inexperienced Angel (A fifth man is mercy-killed by Pike after being blinded by buckshot). They are dismayed when the loot from the robbery turns out to be nothing more than worthless steel washers planted by Harrigan. Needing money, the group heads for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes. Crossing the [[Rio Grande]], they take refuge that night in the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertista]] officer in the [[Mexican Federal Army]], who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of [[Pancho Villa]].\n\nPike's gang visits the general at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde, hoping to find a paying job. A jealous Angel spots Teresa, his former lover, in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed before Pike defuses the situation and offers their services. Mapache tasks the gang to steal a weapons shipment from a [[U.S. Army]] train so that Mapache can resupply his army's dwindling stocks of ammunition and appease Commander Mohr, his [[German Empire|German]] military adviser, who wishes to obtain samples of American armaments. The reward will be a cache of gold coins.\n\nAngel gives up his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border; the robbers blow up a [[trestle bridge]] spanning the Rio Grande as they try to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river. The bounty hunters, despite being tired and exhausted, quickly resume their pursuit at Thornton's urging.\n[[File:Wild Bunch Agua Verde.jpg|thumb|left|The director sets up the climactic gun battle sequences at \"Agua Verde\" (the Hacienda Ci\u00e9naga del Carmen).]]\n\nPike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresa's mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured, beaten, and dragged through town on a rope tied to the back of Mapache's car. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened.\n\nSykes is wounded by Thornton's posse while securing spare horses. When Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, Pike defends him, stating that he (Thornton) \"gave his word\" to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch refutes this, angrily declaring \"That ain't what counts, it's who you give it to\". Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a [[brothel]], Pike and the others arm themselves and decide to take their friend back by force.\n\nMapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire, and the general is gunned down. As the nearby soldiers are paralyzed with shock over the death of their commander, Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody gunfight, during which Pike, Dutch, the remaining gang members, Mohr's aide, every member of Mapache's staff, and most of the assembled troops are killed.\n\nThornton finally catches up and finds that his quarry is already dead. However, he finds a loaded revolver on Pike's belt, taking it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time passes, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angel's village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gang's deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Holden]] as Pike Bishop\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as \"Dutch\" Engstrom\n* [[Robert Ryan]] as Deke Thornton\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as Freddie Sykes\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Lyle Gorch\n* [[Jaime S\u00e1nchez (actor)|Jaime S\u00e1nchez]] as Angel\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Tector Gorch\n* [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]] as General Mapache\n* [[Strother Martin]] as Coffer\n* [[L.

A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film, ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), and his firing from the set of ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film ''[[Noon Wine#1966 version|Noon Wine]]'' (1966).\n\nAt the time, [[William Goldman]]'s screenplay for ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' had recently been purchased by [[20th Century Fox]]. An alternative screenplay available at the studio was ''The Wild Bunch''. It was quickly decided that ''The Wild Bunch'', which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced to beat ''Butch Cassidy'' to the theaters.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last =Carroll | first =E.

He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period but also the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in ''Major Dundee'', including slow motion action sequences (inspired by [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s work in ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession, and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in ''The Wild Bunch''.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|author-link= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=310\u2013331 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hoberman|first=J.|title=The Charge of the Peckinpah Brigade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/movies/03hobe.html|access-date=May 21, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 2005|quote=To see the extended \"Major Dundee\" is to see the smoking ruin from which Peckinpah's masterpiece arose.}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Wild Bunch Peckinpah & Holden.jpg|thumb|Peckinpah's conception of Pike Bishop was strongly influenced by actor William Holden]]\nPeckinpah considered many actors for the Pike Bishop role before casting [[William Holden]], including [[Richard Boone]], [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Lee Marvin]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Gregory Peck]], and [[James Stewart]].

Harris was never formally approached; Keith was asked, but he turned it down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the [[World War II]] action movie ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967).

Peckinpah and his cinematographer, [[Lucien Ballard]], also made use of telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes between them and the camera; most of the people in the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch.\n\nBy the time filming wrapped, Peckinpah had shot {{convert|333000|ft|m}} of film with 1,288 camera setups. Lombardo and Peckinpah remained in Mexico for six months editing the picture. After initial cuts, the opening gunfight sequence ran 21 minutes. By cutting frames from specific scenes and intercutting others, they were able to fine-cut the opening robbery down to five minutes. The creative montage became the model for the rest of the film and would \"forever change the way movies would be made\".<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|author-link= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=356 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8 }}</ref>\n\nPeckinpah stated that one of his goals for the movie was to give the audience \"some idea of what it is to be gunned down\". A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the \"gunfire\" effects to be used in the film. Not satisfied with the results from the [[bullet hit squib|squib]]s his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated and finally hollered: \"That's not what I want! ''That's not what I want!''\" He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: \"THAT'S the effect I want!!\"\n\nHe also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted that each different type of firearm have its own specific sound effect when fired.<ref>{{cite book |first=Garner |last=Simmons | title=Peckinpah, A Portrait in Montage| publisher=University of Texas Press |year = 1982|pages=103 | isbn= 0-292-76493-6}}</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nThe editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dancyger|first=Ken|title=The Technique of Film and Video Editing|year=2010|publisher=Focal Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-240-81397-4|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m20GrX-ZmmoC&q=peckinpah+the+wild+bunch+editing&pg=PA144}}</ref>\n\nLou Lombardo, having previously worked with Peckinpah on ''Noon Wine'', was personally hired by the director to edit ''The Wild Bunch''. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions.\n\nOne of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series ''[[Felony Squad]]'' he had edited in 1967. The episode, entitled \"My Mommy Got Lost\", included a slow motion sequence where [[Joe Don Baker]] is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second.<ref name=\"david a. cook\">{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |chapter=Ballistic Balletics: Styles of Violent Representation in The Wild Bunch and After |title=Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch |url=https://archive.org/details/sampeckinpahswil00prin |url-access=limited |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Prince |year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521586062|page=[https://archive.org/details/sampeckinpahswil00prin/page/n157 145]}}</ref> Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: \"Let's try some of that when we get down to Mexico!\" The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second.

Peckinpah and his editors cut the film to satisfy the new, expansive R-rating parameters which, for the first time, designated a film as being unsuitable for children. Without this new system in place, the film could not have been released with its explicit images of bloodshed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prince |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen Prince |title=Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch |url=https://archive.org/details/sampeckinpahswil00prin |url-access=limited |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-58433-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sampeckinpahswil00prin/page/n27 15]\u201316 |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Prince |chapter=Savage Poet of American Cinema}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nCritics of ''The Wild Bunch'' note the theme of the end of the outlaw gunfighter era. For example, the character Pike Bishop advises: \"We've got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.\" The Bunch lives by an anachronistic code of honor that is out of place in 20th-century society. Also, when the gang inspects Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's ''Ride the High Country'' (1962) and ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite book |first=Garner |last=Simmons| title=Peckinpah, A Portrait in Montage| publisher=University of Texas Press |year = 1982|pages=82 | isbn= 0-292-76493-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe violence that was much criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: \"The point of the film is to take this fa\u00e7ade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people.\" Peckinpah used violence as a [[catharsis]], believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, observing that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, which troubled him.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|author-link= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=334 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8 }}</ref>\n\nBetrayal is the secondary theme of ''The Wild Bunch''. The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them (\"$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties\"). However, Bishop says, \"When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjLdMBBPQUcC&pg=PA163 |page=163 |title=Sam Peckinpah's Feature Films |last=Dukore |first=Bernard Frank |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-252-06802-5}}</ref> Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable.
