It follows Diana Guzman, a troubled teenager from [[Brooklyn]] who decides to channel her aggression by training to become a [[Women's boxing|boxer]], despite the disapproval of both her father and her prospective trainers and competitors in the male-dominated sport.\n\nKusama wrote the screenplay for ''Girlfight'' after learning to box, wanting to make a film about the sport with a female protagonist. Although she struggled to find financiers for the film's $1 million (U.S.) budget, the production was eventually funded by [[John Sayles]], [[Maggie Renzi]] and the [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|Independent Film Channel]]. Rodriguez was cast in the lead role, despite having never acted before, and trained for four months to prepare for the role before filming commenced in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]].\n\n''Girlfight'' premiered on January 22, 2000, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Grand Jury Prize. It was released theatrically on September 29, 2000, and grossed $1.7 million at the box office. The film was well received by critics, who offered particular praise to Rodriguez for her performance and Kusama for her direction. Both Kusama and Rodriguez received numerous accolades, including two [[National Board of Review Awards]], two [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations, and two [[Gotham Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nDiana Guzman is a Brooklyn teenager whose hot temper gets her into trouble at school as she repeatedly starts fights with other students. Her frustration stems from her unhappy home life; she lives in a public housing estate with her brother Tiny and their single father, Sandro. Sandro pays for Tiny's boxing training in hopes of his becoming a professional boxer, although Tiny would prefer to be an artist.\n\nAfter visiting Tiny's gym and intervening in a spar to defend him, Diana asks the trainers to let her box, too. She is told she can train there, but not compete in actual fights. When she learns that she cannot afford coaching from Tiny's trainer, Hector Soto, she asks her father for an allowance but he tells her to get a job. She resorts to stealing his money instead and returns to the gym, where Hector begins to teach her the basics of boxing.\n\nDiana's first spar is with Adrian Sturges, whom she later meets again when Hector takes her to a professional fight. Adrian invites Diana to dinner after the fight and kisses her after walking her home. One night after a spar which gave Diana a black eye, Sandro sees Diana and Adrian together and confronts her, assuming that she is in an abusive relationship. She storms out of the apartment and spends the night with Adrian. When he asks about her parents, she reveals that her mother died by suicide several years ago. When Diana returns to her apartment, Tiny offers to give up boxing so that she can use the coaching money he gets from their father.\n\nDiana later goes to Hector's birthday party, but leaves when she sees Adrian getting friendly with his ex-girlfriend. When Diana and Adrian spar at their next session in the gym, he is reluctant to hit her, and she leaves before he can talk to her. Diana's first amateur match is scheduled against another girl, but when her opponent pulls out she ends up fighting a man, Ray Cortez. Sandro arrives in the middle of the fight to see the match end in Ray's disqualification for illegal shoving. When Diana arrives home, Sandro berates her for looking like a loser. She retaliates by beating him to the floor and accuses him of abusing her mother to the point of suicide.\n\nAfter weeks of rigorous training, Diana wins another amateur fight, this time against a girl, Ricki Stiles. Although Diana has accepted Adrian's apology, tensions rise between them again when they learn that they both have advanced to the finals in their division to fight each other. Adrian refuses to fight a girl and Diana struggles to convince him to view her as a legitimate opponent. He turns up for the fight on the day, however, and after an even match, Diana wins with a unanimous decision by the judges. After the fight, Adrian fears that he has lost Diana's respect, but she tells him she respects him even more for fighting her, and they reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Diana Guzman\n* Jaime Tirelli as Hector Soto\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Sandro Guzman\n* Santiago Douglas as Adrian Sturges\n* [[Ray Santiago]] as Tiny Guzman\n* Victor Sierra as Ray Cortez\n* Elisa Bocanegra as Marisol\n* Shannon Walker Williams as Veronica\n* [[Louis Guss]] as Don\n* [[Herb Lovelle]] as Cal\n\n==Production==\n[[File:John Sayles.jpg|thumb|right|Filmmaker John Sayles provided funding for the film's budget after its only financier backed out.]]\n''Girlfight'' was written and directed by [[Karyn Kusama]], marking her feature film debut. Her aim was to subvert \"the classic boxing story\" with a female lead, having taken up boxing herself in 1992 at the famous [[Gleason's Gym]] in [[Brooklyn]]. After writing the script, she struggled to persuade production companies to finance the film; numerous producers suggested that Kusama cast a white woman in the lead role rather than a Latina and felt that having a female protagonist was \"unappealing [and] unbelievable\". [[Maggie Renzi]], Sarah Green and Martha Griffin eventually agreed to produce the film, and found a financier in 1999 to provide the $1 million (U.S.) budget. Two days before pre-production on the film was set to begin the financier backed out, but Renzi and her partner [[John Sayles]]\u2014an independent filmmaker and Kusama's former mentor\u2014decided to provide funding for the film's entire budget themselves. The [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|Independent Film Channel]] later contributed $300,000 towards the budget.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/movies/film-now-it-s-women-s-turn-to-make-it-in-the-ring.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]]|title=FILM; Now It's Women's Turn to Make It in the Ring|first=Dinitia|last=Smith|date=October 1, 2000|access-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nKusama initially sought to cast a professional actor to play Diana but felt that many of those who auditioned were overly feminized and \"polished\" and decided to cast an untrained actor instead.<ref name=filmmaker>{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/summer2000/features/contenders.php#.VH_jKclA9Fp|title=Contenders|work=[[Filmmaker Magazine]]|date=Summer 2000|first=Peter |last=Bowen |access-date=December 4, 2014}}</ref> [[Michelle Rodriguez]], who had worked as a [[film extra]] but had never auditioned for a speaking role before, attended an open casting call for the lead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998084,00.html|title=Cinema: Her Fighting Chance|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Christopher John |last=Farley |date=October 2, 2000|access-date=December 4, 2014}}</ref> Although Kusama described Rodriguez's audition as \"a disaster\", she won the role because out of 350 auditionees Kusama \"could not find anyone who could come close to her in physical power\".<ref name=nytimes/> Since Rodriguez was not a boxer, she trained at Gleason's Gym five to six days a week for four months in preparation for filming,<ref>{{cite news|title=Spotlight On Michelle Rodriguez Actress Lands Knockout Role In 'Girlfight'|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-09-30/entertainment/3314003_1_girlfight-karyn-kusama-santiago-douglas|date=September 30, 2000|work=[[The Morning Call]]|access-date=December 4, 2014}}</ref> as did Santiago Douglas, who played Adrian.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2383679/article-Hoboken-s-Latin-actor-Girlfight--s-Santiago-Douglas-performs--sings-in--Punto-45--drama?mobile_view=false|title=Hoboken's Latin actor Girlfight' s Santiago Douglas performs, sings in 'Punto 45' drama|work=[[Hudson Reporter]]|date=August 13, 2002|first=Eugene|last=Mulero |access-date=December 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Girlfight'' was filmed over 24 days<ref name=bomb>{{cite news|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2337/|title=Karyn Kusama|first=Bette|last=Gordon|issue=73|work=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]|date=Fall 2000|access-date=November 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214234821/http://bombmagazine.org/article/2337/|archive-date=December 14, 2014}}</ref> in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]].<ref name=nytimes/> For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers shot in a warehouse in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].<ref name=bomb/> The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the [[boxing ring|ring]] but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring.
