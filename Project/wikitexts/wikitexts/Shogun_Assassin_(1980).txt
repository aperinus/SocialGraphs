Both were originally released in 1972.  There were six films in all in the series. These, in turn, were based on the long-running 1970s [[manga]] series ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'' created by the writer [[Kazuo Koike]] and the artist [[Goseki Kojima]].\n\nThe project was directed by Robert Houston and his partner [[David Weisman]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Andy Warhol]] and director of ''[[Ciao! Manhattan]]'' (1972). A fan of the original ''Kozure \u014ckami'' films, Weisman had obtained the rights for $50,000 from the American office of [[Toho]] Studios. The film was distributed by [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]] to the [[grindhouse]] movie circuit in the United States, and then later as a video cassette from [[MCA/Universal]] Home Video. When released in the United Kingdom by the [[Vipco]] video tape label in 1983, ''Shogun Assassin's'' extreme violence almost caused it to be banned in the UK by the [[Home Office]]. Vipco played this for publicity in the cover art of their 2000 release on DVD, which was stamped \"Banned since 1983!\" The poster and title treatment was created by artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]]. Jim\u2019s son Gibran Evans voiced the narrative as Daigor\u014d. In 2006 it was restored and re-released on DVD in the United States by [[AnimEigo]].\n\nThe title character, [[Lone Wolf and Cub#Plot summary|Ogami Itt\u014d]], is played by [[Tomisaburo Wakayama]], brother of the producer, [[Shintaro Katsu]], who is known for playing [[Zatoichi]] in a series of 26 films starting in the 1960s. As a result, it has garnered a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://nitehawkcinema.com/movies/shogun-assassin/\n| title=Shogun Assassin\n| publisher=[[Nitehawk Cinema]]\n| access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| title=Cult Cinema: An Introduction\n| first1=Ernest\n| last1=Mathijs\n| first2=Jamie\n| last2=Sexton\n| publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]\n| date=2012-03-30\n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&q=shogun\n| isbn=9781444396430}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2015}}\nAs the opening credits roll, an abbreviated version of Ogami Itt\u014d's ([[Tomisaburo Wakayama|Tomisabur\u00f4 Wakayama]]) past as Shogunate Decapitator and his wife's murder by ninja are seen, with Daigor\u014d (Akihiro Tomikawa) providing the narration.\n\nTwo hooded samurai attack Ogami while he is pushing a cart with Daigor\u014d inside. Ogami fends off the attack of the first, breaking the samurai's sword and splitting his head. The second attacker jumps over the first, with the first still clasping Ogami's blade. Ogami pulls off a handrail from the cart and a blade shoots out, transforming it into a spear that impale the second attackers. As the first is dying, he reminds Ogami that he is marked for death.\n\nAs Ogami and Daigor\u014d sit by a roadside fire and eat their evening meal, Ogami remembers how he offered the infant Daigor\u014d the life\u2013death choice: either Ogami's sword (which would mean that Daigor\u014d would join him on his mission of vengeance against the Shogun) or Daigor\u014d's ball (which would mean that Daigor\u014d would be killed so that he could be with his mother in heaven). Daigor\u014d chooses the sword. The next day, the Shogun's officials bring Ogami the Shogun's orders: either swear eternal loyalty or commit ''[[seppuku]]''  with Daigor\u014d. Ogami chooses to fight his way to freedom with Daigor\u014d, only to have his path blocked by the Shogun and his men. The Shogun challenges Ogami to fight his son Kurando in a duel; if Ogami wins, he wins his freedom. Ogami accepts. Despite Kurando's having the strategic advantage of having the sun behind him and Daigor\u014d riding on Ogami's back, a mirror bound on Daigor\u014d's forehead reflects the sun into Kurando's eyes, blinding him long enough for Ogami to slice off Kurando's head.\n\nOgami and Daigor\u014d journey on, never stopping in one place for very long as the Shogun's ninjas are always following them. As they wander, Daigor\u014d recalls how the Shogun's other son Lord Bizen ([[Taketoshi Nait\u00f4]]) and his men were given orders to kill him. Even though Bizen's men are wearing chain mail beneath their robes, Ogami's skill and blade are too powerful. Ogami lures Lord Bizen into the middle of a stream and uses an underwater sword-slash technique to kill him. Ogami sees the Shogun watching from a distance and he swears to the Shogun that he will destroy him and all of his ninjas.\n\nThe Supreme Ninja ([[Kayo Matsuo]]) receives orders from the Shogun to kill Ogami and Daigor\u014d. Lord Kurogawa ([[Akiji Kobayashi]]) does not believe the Supreme Ninja's women are up to the task, so she proves otherwise by having her ninjas to kill Kurogawa's strongest ninja Junai.\n\nOgami and Daigor\u014d meet secretly with a client to discuss an assassination request. Ogami is asked to kill Lord Kiru (the Shogun's brother), and in return he will receive a thousand pieces of gold. Ogami accepts the mission and is told that Lord Kiru is being escorted by a three-brother team known as the 'Masters of Death.'\n\nDuring Ogami and Daigor\u014d's journey, they are attacked several times by The Supreme Ninja's women, but Ogami kills them each time. Ogami finally faces the Supreme Ninja herself. She attacks Ogami with a weighted net that contains fishhooks, but Ogami cuts himself free and the Supreme Ninja flees by running away backward.\n\nOgami and Daigor\u014d keep on traveling, but they now come face-to-face with Lord Kurogawa's entire ninja force. Pushing Daigor\u014d in his cart to safety, Ogami uses the spear blades in the cart's handrails to attack. All but two of the ninja are cut down, but Ogami is left wounded. He manages to push Daigor\u014d to the safety of a deserted hut before collapsing from loss of blood. Daigor\u014d goes in search of water for his father, finally bringing it back in his mouth, then takes some food offerings from a roadside shrine, leaving his jacket in honorable exchange.\n\nThe Supreme Ninja meets with Lord Kurogawa to report her failure, but Lord Kurogawa has another plan: to strike at Ogami through Daigor\u014d.\n\nLater that night, Daigor\u014d is lured outside the hut by the sound of a woman singing. Waking up to find Daigor\u014d gone, Ogami searches for his son. He finds Daigor\u014d is a prisoner of Lord Kurogawa and the Supreme Ninja. Daigor\u014d is tied up and suspended over a deep well; Kurogawa demands that Ogami surrender or he will drop Daigor\u014d down the well. Ogami refuses, so Kurogawa and his men attack. Kurogawa lets go of the rope suspending Daigor\u014d over the well, but Ogami manages to stamp his foot down on the rope and kill Kurogawa (and his two ninjas) at the same time. Ignoring the Supreme Ninja, who has not moved throughout the fight, Ogami carefully pulls Daigor\u014d, who has survived, up to safety. Instead of killing the Supreme Ninja, Ogami walks away with Daigor\u014d.\n\nOgami and Daigor\u014d board a ship which is carrying the 'Masters of Death' to their rendezvous with Lord Kiru. Also on board is the Supreme Ninja. Rebels attack the 'Masters of Death', but are easily dispatched. During the night, the remaining rebel starts a fire on board the ship. In the ensuing inferno, the 'Masters of Death' tell Ogami that they recognize him but that they will not attack him as long as he makes no move against them, and they leave him. The companionway is blocked by flames, so he cuts through the deck planking. Ogami then puts Daigor\u014d in his cart and throws them both overboard to safety before pole-vaulting himself into the sea. The Supreme Ninja attacks Ogami from underwater but he overpowers her. Getting Daigor\u014d, himself and the Supreme Ninja to shore and to the shelter of a fisherman's hut, he strips all three of them naked and gathers them close together, telling the Supreme Ninja that they must share their body heat or die. The Supreme Ninja does not understand why he would save her and realizes she cannot kill Ogami or his son. The next day, Ogami and Daigor\u014d leave her there, knowing that she will have to return to the Shogun, report her failure and commit suicide.\n\nThe 'Masters of Death' escort Lord Kiru and his entourage through a desert of sand dunes, where they are attacked by a rebel force concealed under the sand. The 'Masters of Death' then fight off and kill all of the rebels, and Lord Kiru is taken to safety. However, they have not gone far before they see Daigor\u014d standing in their way. He points to Ogami, who is waiting. The 'Masters of Death' finally face off against Ogami, but one by one they are cut down and killed. Ogami then chases after Lord Kiru's procession, killing and driving off the guards. Lord Kiru protests that he is the Shogun's brother, but Ogami tells Kiru that the \"Shogun means nothing\" to him. Ogami then cuts Lord Kiru down.\n\nAs he and his father walk away from the carnage, Daigor\u014d looks back one last time and says via voice-over, \"I guess I wish it was different ... but a wish is only a wish\". The final shot is a freeze-frame close-up of Daigor\u014d's face looking back.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Cast\n!Character\n!Live actor\n!English dub actor\n|-\n!Lone Wolf\n|[[Tomisaburo Wakayama|Tomisaburou Wakayama]]\n|[[Lamont Johnson]]\n|-\n!Supreme Ninja\n|[[Kayo Matsuo]]\n|[[Sandra Bernhard]]\n|-\n!Eldest Master of Death\n|Minoru Ooki\n|\n|-\n!Middle Master of Death\n|[[Shougen Nitta]]\n|\n|-\n!Youngest Master of Death\n|[[Shin Kishida]]\n|\n|-\n!Daigorou\n|[[Akihiro Tomikawa]]\n|[[Gibran Evans]]\n|-\n!Azami\n|[[Reiko Kasahara]]\n|\n|-\n!Lord Kurogawa\n|[[Akiji Kobayashi]]\n|\n|-\n!Lord Bizen\n|[[Taketoshi Naito]]u\n|\n|-\n!The Shogun\n|[[Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d]]\n|\n|}\nOther English dub actors:\n* [[Marshall Efron]]  \n* [[Lennie Weinrib]] \n* [[Sam Weisman]] \n* [[Mark Lindsay]] \n* [[Robert Houston (actor)|Robert Houston]] \n* [[David Weisman]]\n\n==Production==\n''Shogun Assassin'' is a combination of two Japanese films, predominantly that of ''Baby-cart at the River Styx'' (1972) and 12 minutes of ''Sword of Vengeance''.<ref name=\"mfb-review\" /> In Japan the movie is known as ''\u5b50\u9023\u308c\u72fc,, Kozure Okami.''\n\n==Release==\n''Shogun Assassin'' was released theatrically in the United States 11 November 1980 where it was distributed by [[New World Pictures]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=282}} ''Shogun Assassin'' was released to home video by AnimEigo in 2006.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=282}}\n\n==Reception==\nFrom contemporary reviews, [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote ''Shogun Assassin'' \"is as furiously mixed up as  ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]''\" and that outside \"the little-boy's narration, the movie's not much fun once you've gotten the picture, which is that of a tubby, outcast samurai wandering the length and breadth of Japan, pushing an antique baby carriage that contains his tiny, remarkably observant son.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/11/21/archives/shogun-assassin.html | title=Shogun Assassin | last=Canby|first=Vincent|authorlink=Vincent Canby| newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1980-11-21 | access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> John Pym (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') found that \"the impetus of the original director's intention seems somehow to have been turned round by having the story related from the point of view of the uncomprehending Daigor\u014d\", whose narration he compared to that of Linda Manz's ''[[Days of Heaven]]'').<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Kozure Ohkami-Sanzu no Kawa no Ubaguruma (Shogun Assassin)|page=248|volume=48|issue=564|year=1981|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|last=Pym|first=John|issn=0027-0407}}</ref> \"What has evidently animated this American version is the packaging of ample bloodshed with the minimum of explanation.
