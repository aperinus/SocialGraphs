It was entered into competition at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]] (\"Official Selection 2000\"), and later went on to win awards around the world. In a 2014 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' poll, film critics voted ''The Gleaners and I'' the eighth best documentary film of all time.<ref name=\"BBC-doc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28602506 |title=Silent film tops documentary poll |access-date=1 August 2014 |work=BBC News}}</ref> In 2016, the film appeared at No. 99 on [[BBC]]'s [[100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|list of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title= The 21st Century's 100 Greatest Films |work=[[BBC]] |date=23 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Varda released a followup, ''The Gleaners and I: Two Years Later'' ({{lang-fr|Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse... deux ans apr\u00e8s}}), in which she revisited some of the people and themes of this film.\n\n==The subjects==\nFor the film, Varda traveled throughout rural and urban [[France]] to document various types of [[gleaning|gleaners]] who, whether due to necessity or for artistic or ethical reasons, gather crops left in the field after the harvest or food and objects that have been thrown out. She also included some of the people on the peripheries of the gleaning culture. There are interviews with, among others, a [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] 2-star chef who gleans and a wealthy restaurant owner whose ancestors were gleaners; the owners of a few [[vineyard]]s, among whom are [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jean Laplanche]] and the great-grandson of [[physiologist]] and [[chronophotographer]] [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]]; artists that incorporate recycled materials into their work, including [[Louis Pons]], who explains that junk is a \"cluster of possibilities\"; lawyers who discuss the French laws regarding gleaning versus abandoned property; and an urban gleaner named Alain, who has a master's degree and teaches French to immigrants. Two of the most notable symbols from the film are the numerous heart-shaped potatoes Varda finds in a field and a clock without hands she finds on the street.\n\nIn order to find the subjects, Varda claimed her method was to ask all the people she knew to talk to everyone\u2014\"the peasants, the owners, the farmers, the fruit growers\u2014about our film. I said to my assistant, 'Call everybody you know.'\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Melissa|date=2001|title=The Modest Gesture of the Filmmaker|url=https://excocinema.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/agnes_verda_interview.pdf|journal=Cineaste|volume=26|pages=25}}</ref> Referring to these subjects, Varda stated that \"The more I met them, the more I could see I had nothing to make as a statement.

Varda referred to her filmmaking process as \"cin\u00e9criture\" (\"cinema-writing\"), saying that the process of encountering subjects, choosing shots and music, editing, and writing narration is \"all chance working with me, all this is the film writing that I often talk about.\"<ref name=\"Zeitgeist Films\">Zeitgeist Films.</ref> As such, she said the objects she found, such as the heart-shaped potato, were \"[strokes] of luck\",<ref name=\"Zeitgeist Films\"/> as were some of the shots. For example, in one scene, Varda forgot to turn off her camera, so, as the camera hung at her side, it filmed the shifting ground and the dangling lens cap. Varda chose to put this footage in the finished film with a jazz music background, calling it \"The Dance of the Lens Cap\".\n\nIn addition to footage relating to \"gleaning\", ''Gleaners'' also includes more self-referential footage, such as a scene in which Varda films herself combing her newly discovered gray hair, or the several closeups of her aging hands. In one scene, she \"catches\" numerous trucks on the freeway, first encircling each truck by putting her hand in front of the camera lens and then closing her hand as she drives past \"just to play.\"\n\n==Production==\nThe film was filmed between September 1999 and April 2000 in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]], [[Jura (department)|Jura]], [[Provence]], the [[Pyrenees]], and the suburbs of [[Paris]]. In the press kit, Varda wrote that she and her team would travel and shoot for roughly two weeks at a time and immediately proceed to edit while scouting for additional locations. She also traveled alone to get many of her \"gleaned\" shots and would go to markets between 2 and 4 p.m.\n\nVarda produced the film under Cine-Tamaris, a company she founded in 1954 and that had produced most of her previous films. It was distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]] in New York, a company that has distributed films from such directors as [[Christopher Nolan]] and [[the Brothers Quay]].<ref name=\"Zeitgeist Films\"/>\n\n==Release & reception==\n''The Gleaners and I'' debuted out of competition at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]] (\"Official Selection 2000\"). Later that year, it had its North American premiere at the [[2000 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>Portuges, Catherine. \"The Gleaners and I.\" American Historical Review 106.1 2001. 305.

Even Varda, herself, remarked at the film's success, saying: \"I've never in my entire career felt that people have loved a film of mine as much as this one.\u201d<ref>Darke, Chris. \"Refuseniks (Agnes Varda's DV Documentary, the 'Gleaners and I').\" ''SIGHT AND SOUND'' 11.1 (2001): 30-3.</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe film won awards around the world, including top honors at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]], Prague [[One World Film Festival]], and [[European Film Awards]], and from the [[National Society of Film Critics]] (USA), [[New York Film Critics Circle]], [[Boston Society of Film Critics]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], [[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]], and [[Online Film Critics Society]].

Ruby. \"Gleaners Over Gladiators.\" ''The Nation'' 272.14 (2001): 33.</ref> Guest argues that the ease with which Varda blends documentary and narrative technique is a key reason her films continue to be so relevant, especially \"as we witness a resurgence of documentary and a particularly strong interest in hybridized modes of fiction/nonfiction cinema\"(48). Jake Wilson, on the other hand, conjectures that Varda, perhaps not fully realizing it, tapped into the cultural zeitgeist and constructed a film that \"embodies a quasi-anarchist ethos\" built on a \"resistance to consumerism, a suspicion of authority, and a desire to reconnect politics with everyday life.\"\n\nOne notable aspect of the film is that, in making a film about gleaning, Varda recognized that she, too, was a gleaner. \"I'm not poor, I have enough to eat,\" she said, but she pointed to \"another kind of gleaning, which is artistic gleaning. You pick ideas, you pick images, you pick emotions from other people, and then you make it into a film.\"<ref>Anderson, M., and A. Varda. \"The Modest Gesture of the Filmmaker - an Interview with Agnes Varda.\" ''CINEASTE'' 26.4 (2001): 24-7.</ref> To do her gleaning, Varda chose to use a digital video camera, and there are several scenes in which she shows and discusses the camera itself. In so doing, she transforms a film about waste into a reflexive meditation on the art of digital documentary. While Varda did not pioneer the reflexive documentary (that honor goes to [[Dziga Vertov]] and his 1929 masterpiece ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''),<ref>Chapman, Jane. ''Issues in Contemporary Documentary''. p. 144 Cambridge: Polity, 2009. Print.</ref> her work had long been notable for its \"reflexive and first-person tendencies.\"<ref>Guest, Haden. \"Emotion Picture: Agnes Varda's Self-Reflexive the Beaches of Agnes and the Cinema of Generosity.\" ''Film Comment'' 45.4 (2009): 44. Print.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that makes ''The Gleaners and I'' especially noteworthy in the context of cinematic history is the fact that a filmmaker of Varda's stature chose to abandon high-end film equipment for low-end digital video. For Varda, the decision was in many ways a practical one. As she noted in an interview with Melissa Anderson for ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cin\u00e9aste]]'', \"I had the feeling that this is the camera that would bring me back to the early short films I made in 1957 and 1958. I felt free at that time. With the new digital camera, I felt I could film myself, get involved as a filmmaker.\u201d<ref>Anderson, M., and A. Varda. \"The Modest Gesture of the Filmmaker - an Interview with Agnes Varda.\" CINEASTE 26.4 (2001): 24-7.</ref> Varda's choice to make a camcorder a primary tool of production, as well as a central element of her film, can be seen as an implicit, if not explicit, recognition of a new digital era in documentary filmmaking. Yet, for Varda, \u201cthe first-person, artisan film-making encouraged by digital video [was] nothing new.\u201d<ref name=\"Darke, Chris 2001\"/> While she acknowledged video's convenience, she downplayed any larger significance: \"What's missing in all this talk of digital technologies is the understanding that [...] they're not ends in themselves.\"<ref name=\"Darke, Chris 2001\"/> For Varda, digital cameras and editing equipment were simply tools that enabled her to film by herself and get closer to people \"and to collapse the time lapse between wanting to film something and actually being able to do it.\"<ref name=\"Darke, Chris 2001\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Gleaners]]'' painting by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]] completed in 1857.\n* ''[[The Gleaners (album)|The Gleaners]]'', a 2019 studio album by American jazz bassist [[Larry Grenadier]], inspired by the film.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Notes==\n* Ebert, Roger. \"The Gleaners and I.\" rogerebert.com. rogerebert.com, 11 May 2001.
