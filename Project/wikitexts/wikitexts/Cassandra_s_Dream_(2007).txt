They name it ''Cassandra's Dream'', after a greyhound that won Terry the money to buy the boat. Knowing nothing of [[Greek mythology]], they are unaware of the ominous antecedents of this name\u2014the ancient prophetess [[Cassandra]], whose prophecies of doom went unheeded by those around her.\n\nWhile driving home from a day's sailing in a borrowed car, Ian crosses paths with beautiful actress Angela Stark, with whom he becomes infatuated.\n\nTerry has a [[gambling addiction]] that sinks him deeper in debt. Ian wishes to invest in hotels in [[California]] to finance a new life with Angela.  To overcome their financial problems, they ask Howard for help. He agrees to help them, but asks for a favor in return: they must murder someone for him. Howard faces imprisonment for unspecified crimes and his future is threatened by Martin Burns, a former business partner who plans to testify against him. Howard asks his nephews to get rid of Burns, and in return he will reward them financially. After initial reluctance, the brothers agree.\n\nThey make two [[Improvised firearm|zip guns]], untraceable and easily destroyed. Lying in wait in Burns' home, their plan is foiled when Burns arrives with a woman. Their resolve shaken, they leave and agree to commit the murder the next day.\n\nThe next day, they succeed in carrying out the murder and later destroy the guns. Ian is content to move on as if nothing happened, but Terry is consumed by guilt and begins abusing alcohol and other drugs. His behavior frightens his fianc\u00e9e, who tells Ian about the situation and that Terry believes he has killed someone. After Terry confides that he wants to turn himself in to the police, Ian goes to Howard for advice. They agree there is no alternative but to get rid of Terry. Ian plans to poison Terry during an outing on the boat. Ian can't bring himself to kill his own brother, and attacks him in a fit of rage. In the chaos, Terry knocks Ian down the steps into the cabin, killing him.\n\nThe boat is later discovered adrift by the police, who deduce that Terry killed Ian and then drowned himself. The last shot is of ''Cassandra's Dream'', still in beautiful condition despite the tragedies it set in motion.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Terry Blaine\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Ian Blaine\n* [[John Benfield]] as Brian Blaine\n* [[Clare Higgins]] as Dorothy Blaine\n* [[Ashley Madekwe]] as Lucy\n* [[Andrew Howard]] as Jerry\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as Angela Stark\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Kate\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Howard Swann\n* [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as Martin Burns\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Fred\n* [[Richard Lintern]] as Director\n* [[Jennifer Higham]] as Helen\n* [[Lee Whitlock]] as Mike\n* [[Hugh Rathbone]], Allan Ramsey, [[Paul Marc Davis]], Terry Budin-Jones, Franck Viano, Tommy Mack as Poker Players\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Cassandra's Dream (soundtrack)}}\nThis is the first Woody Allen film since ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' to have an original score commissioned for it.
