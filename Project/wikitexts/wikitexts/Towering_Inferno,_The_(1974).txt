The tower, {{convert|1688|ft|m}} tall and 138 stories, is the world's tallest building. During testing, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor just after another such short occurs in the main utility room. Upon learning this, Roberts sees the wiring is inadequate and suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and Duncan's son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who feigns innocence.\n\nDuring the dedication ceremony, chief of public relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower's lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the [[San Francisco Fire Department]] is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor, where Giddings is fatally burned pushing a guard away from the fire. Roberts reports the fire to Duncan, who is courting Senator Gary Parker for an [[urban renewal]] contract and refuses to order an evacuation.\n\nSFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran arrives and forces Duncan to evacuate the guests from the Promenade Room on the 135th floor. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to bring the project back under budget and suggests other subcontractors did likewise. Fire overtakes the express elevators, killing a group whose elevator stops on the engulfed 81st floor. Bigelow and his girlfriend Lorrie are killed when a separate fire traps them in the Duncan Enterprises offices on the 65th floor. Lisolette Mueller, a guest being wooed by [[Confidence trick|con man]] Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a deaf mother and her two children. Security Chief Jernigan rescues the mother, but a ruptured gas line explodes and prevents Doug and the rest of the group from following. The explosion destroys one of the emergency stairwells which they must traverse to reach an exit door leading to a service elevator which can take them to the 134th floor, below the Promenade Room. They await firemen sent to blow up hardened cement blocking their access.\n\nAs firemen begin to bring the fire under control on floor 65, the electrical system fails, deactivating the passenger elevators; O'Halloran must [[Abseiling|rappel]] down the elevator shaft to safety.  As firemen ascend to free the blocked door at the Promenade Room, an explosion on the 104th floor destroys a section of the remaining emergency stairwell, blocking the last means of escape from the floors above.  After the stuck door is freed, thus reuniting Lisolette and the children with Roberts and the others, Simmons ignores the advice of the firemen and makes a futile attempt to escape down the stairwell, but is fought back by the flames and is forced to retreat.\n\nAn attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when two women run up to the aircraft, causing the pilot to try to evade them, crashing and setting the roof ablaze. A Navy rescue team attach a [[breeches buoy]] between the Promenade Room and the roof of the adjacent 102-story Peerless Building, and rescue a number of guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a [[fall arrest|gravity brake]] on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for twelve people, including Roberts' fianc\u00e9e Susan Franklin, Lisolette, and the children saved earlier by her and Robert's efforts in the stairwell. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator to her death and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, but O'Halloran rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.\n \nAs fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group of men led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy which is subsequently destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Senator Parker and several other men. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Halloran and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with [[plastic explosive]]s. Most of the remaining party-goers appear to survive as water rushes through the ruined building, extinguishing the flames.\n\nHarlee Claiborne, in shock upon hearing of Lisolette's death, is given her cat by Jernigan. Duncan consoles his grieving daughter and promises that such a disaster will never happen again. Roberts accepts O'Halloran's offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper. O'Halloran drives away, exhausted.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Michael O'Halloran, [[San Francisco Fire Department|SFFD]] 5th Battalion Chief\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Doug Roberts, the Glass Tower architect\n* [[William Holden]] as James Duncan, the builder\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Susan Franklin, Doug Roberts' fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Harlee Claiborne, the con-man who flirts with Mrs. Mueller\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Patty Duncan Simmons, James Duncan's daughter\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as Roger Simmons, the electrical engineer and Duncan's son-in-law\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as Lisolette Mueller\n* [[O.

(Allen and Matthews were husband and wife.) Paul Newman's son Scott played the [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] fireman afraid to rappel down the elevator shaft.\n\n=== McQueen and Newman ===\nMcQueen, Newman, and William Holden all wanted [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]]. Holden was refused, his long-term standing as a box office draw having been eclipsed by both McQueen and Newman. To provide dual top billing, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen lower left and Newman upper right. Thus, each appeared to have \"first\" billing depending on whether the credit was read left-to-right or top-to-bottom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.art.com/asp/sp-asp/_/pd--10134441/The_Towering_Inferno_Style_A.htm|title=Art.com - Posters, Art Prints, Framed Art, and Wall Art Collection|website=www.art.com|access-date=November 26, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228081439/http://www.art.com/asp/sp-asp/_/pd--10134441/The_Towering_Inferno_Style_A.htm|archive-date=December 28, 2004|url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first time this \"staggered but equal\" billing was used in a movie, although it had been considered earlier for the same two actors regarding ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' until McQueen turned down the [[Sundance Kid]] role. McQueen is mentioned first in the film's trailers. In the cast list rolling from top to bottom at the film's end, however, McQueen and Newman's names were arranged diagonally as at the beginning; as a consequence, Newman's name is fully visible first there.\n\nBoth Newman and McQueen were paid $1 million.<ref>Crisis King Casts Another Peril: Movies King of the Crises Casts Another Peril Warga, Wayne.

Guillermin says that Newman and McQueen were very good to work with and added considerably to their roles.<ref name=\"star\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|title=Lord of Disaster|first=Lowell|last=Goldman|date=November 1990|page=60|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-160/page/n60/mode/1up?q=toreadors+guillermin}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]], orchestrated by [[Herbert W. Spencer]] and Al Woodbury, and recorded at the 20th Century Fox scoring stage on October 31 and November 4, 7 and 11, 1974. The original recording engineer was Ted Keep.\n\nSource music in portions of the film includes instrumental versions of \"Again\" by [[Lionel Newman]] and [[Dorcas Cochran]], \"You Make Me Feel So Young\" by [[Josef Myrow]] and [[Mack Gordon]], and \"The More I See You\" by [[Harry Warren]] and [[Mack Gordon]].{{sfn|Eldridge|Williams|2001|page=13}}\n\nA snippet of a cue from Williams\u2019 score to ''[[Cinderella Liberty]]'' titled 'Maggie Shoots Pool' is heard in a scene when William Holden's character converses on the phone with Paul Newman's character. It is not the recording on the soundtrack album but a newer arrangement recorded for ''The Towering Inferno''. An extended version is heard, ostensibly as source music in a deleted theatrical scene sometimes shown as part of a longer scene from the TV broadcast version.\n\nOne of the most sought-after unreleased music cues from the film is the one where Williams provides low-key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire. O'Hallorhan orders Duncan to evacuate the party; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son-in-law Roger. Titled \"The Promenade Room\" on the conductor's cue sheet, the track features a ragged ending as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing. Because of this, ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' did not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning song \"[[We May Never Love Like This Again]]\" was composed by [[Al Kasha]] and [[Joel Hirschhorn]] and performed by [[Maureen McGovern]], who appears in a cameo as a lounge singer and on the score's soundtrack album, which features the film recording plus the commercially released single version. Additionally, the theme tune is interpolated into the film's underscore by Williams. The song's writers collaborated on \"[[The Morning After (Maureen McGovern song)|The Morning After]]\" from ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning song which was also recorded by McGovern, although hers was not the vocal used in that film.\n\nThe first release of portions of the score from ''The Towering Inferno'' was on [[Warner Bros. Records]] early in 1975 (Catalog No. BS-2840)\n\n# \"Main Title\" (5:00)\n# \"An Architect's Dream\" (3:28)\n# \"Lisolette And Harlee\" (2:34)\n# \"Something For Susan\" (2:42)\n# \"Trapped Lovers\" (4:28)\n# \"[[We May Never Love Like This Again]]\" \u2013 Kasha/Hirschhorn, performed by Maureen McGovern (2:11)\n# \"Susan And Doug\" (2:30)\n# \"The Helicopter Explosion\" (2:50)\n# \"Planting The Charges \u2013 And Finale\" (10:17)\n\nA near-complete release came on the ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' label (FSM) on April 1, 2001 and was produced by Lukas Kendall and Nick Redman. FSM's was an almost completely expanded version remixed from album masters at Warner Bros. archives and the multi-track 35mm magnetic film stems at 20th Century Fox. Placed into chronological order and restoring action cues, it became one of the company's biggest sellers; only 4000 copies were pressed and it is now out of print.\n\nReports that this soundtrack and that of the film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (also composed by Williams) borrowed cues from each other are inaccurate. The version of \"Main Title\" on the FSM disc is the film version. It differs from the original soundtrack album version. There is a different balance of instruments in two spots, and in particular the snare drum is more prominent than the album version which also features additional cymbal work.
