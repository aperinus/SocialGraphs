Directed by [[Gary Hustwit]], it was released in 2007 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the typeface's introduction in 1957 and is considered the first of the [[Design Trilogy]] by the director.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Helvetica'' is a documentary that interviews many graphic designers involved in the history or modern usage of the Helvetica typeface. The initial interviews discuss the original creator Alfred Hoffmann, and his goals for creating a clean, legible type relating to the ideals of the [[Modernism|Modernist]] movement. Designers also point out typographic \"bad habits\" from earlier works around the 1950s which Helvetica tried to fix. For example, illegible hand-made lettering and cramped cursive.\n\nThroughout the film, various montages of Helvetica appearing in urban scenes and pop culture intersperse the interviews.\n\nLater, other interviewers point out criticisms of Helvetica. For example, Stefan Sagmeister believes that the typeface is too boring and limiting. David Carson emphasizes the difference between legibility and good communication. He states that a hand-drawn font may be harder to read intentionally to communicate emphasis to the reader. Other designers dislike Helvetica on the grounds of ideology. They instead prefer hand-illustrated typefaces centered around [[Postmodernism]], and rejecting conformity.\n\nAnother set of interviews including Michael Place reveal a third stance on Helvetica. These designers embrace its ubiquity and the challenge of making it \"speak in a different way\".\n\nThe film concludes with comments on the increasing prevalence of graphic design as self expression, citing the social media website [[Myspace]], and its feature allowing users to fully customize the styling of their page.\n\n==Interviewees==\n* Manfred Schulz\n* [[Massimo Vignelli]]\n* [[Rick Poynor]]\n* [[Wim Crouwel]]\n* [[Matthew Carter]]\n* Alfred Hoffmann, Eduard Hoffmann's son\n* [http://www.fontbureau.com/people/MikeParker Mike Parker] Linotype's typographic development director.\n* Otmar Hoefer\n* Bruno Steinert\n* [[Hermann Zapf]]\n* [[Michael Bierut]]\n* [http://www.randomhouse.com/author/results.pperl?authorid=47087 Leslie Savan]\n* [[Tobias Frere-Jones]]\n* [[Jonathan Hoefler]]\n* [[Erik Spiekermann]]\n* [[Neville Brody]]\n* [http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/publisher/lars-mueller Lars M\u00fcller]\n* [[Paula Scher]]\n* [[Stefan Sagmeister]]\n* [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]]\n* [[Experimental Jetset]]\n* [http://wearebuild.com/ Michael C.

What they do is more than just logos and corporate branding - they design the type that we read every day in newspapers and magazines, onscreen and on television. Fonts don't just appear out of Microsoft Word: there are human beings and huge stories behind them.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/apr/16/helvetica-watch-film-here Helvetica \u2013 watch the design documentary here] 16 April 2013</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Helvetica'' premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival in March 2007.
