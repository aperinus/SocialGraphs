The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina, an emigr\u00e9e from [[Venezuela]].<!--Stated in this article as well as the film script: http://www.terranerdica.com.br/index.php/10-filmes-franceses-que-voce-precisa-assistir/--> Michel also has a relationship with Nicole Horner, another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel. He is cruel to the students, beats Nicole, and mocks Christina about her heart condition.\n\nUnable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in [[Niort]], a town several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and, driving back to the school, dump his body in the neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the top, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Then, the suit that Michel had been wearing when they drowned him is returned from the dry cleaners. When the proprietor of the dry cleaners also returns a key to a room in nearby hotel that was with the clothes, Christina goes to the room. There the cleaning man tells her that Michel had kept the room for awhile but was rarely if ever seen and stored nothing there.\n\nNicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she finds it is not actually Michel's body. There, she meets Alfred Fichet, a retired senior policeman now working as a private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.\n\nChristina, Nicole and other teachers find a student who claims that Michel has ordered him to rake leaves as punishment for breaking a window. After hearing this, Christina's heart condition grows worse, and her doctors fear she may die soon unless she maintains strict bed rest. When the school photograph is taken, the result seems to show Michel's spectral figure in the window behind the students. Unnerved, Nicole leaves the school; she asks Christina to come too, but she is too ill and afraid.\n\nChristina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. That night, Christina hears noises and wanders round the school. When she realizes that someone is following her, she runs back to her room. There she finds Michel's corpse submerged in the bathtub, which is full of water. Michel rises from the tub, and Christina has a heart attack and dies. Michel and Nicole have set up Christina from the beginning, with Michel acting as a vengeful ghost to scare Christina to death. However, Alfred hears their celebration and figures out everything, telling them they will get 15 to 20 years, depending on the judge.\n\nThe school is closed in the wake of the scandal. As the children and teachers leave, the same boy who had earlier broken a window breaks another. When asked how he got his slingshot back, the boy says that Christina gave it to him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Simone Signoret]] as Nicole Horner\n* [[V\u00e9ra Clouzot]] as Christina Delassalle\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Michel Delassalle\n* [[Charles Vanel]] as Alfred Fichet\n* [[Jean Brochard]] as Plantiveau\n* [[Pierre Larquey]] as M.

In the book, the action takes place between [[Enghien-les-Bains]] and [[Nantes]] but Clouzot transposed it to [[Saint-Cloud]] and [[Niort]], his own birthplace.<ref name=\":1\" /> He wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the insurance scam that was the criminal motive in the book. He switched the gender of the murderers and invented the private-school setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Le cin\u00e9ma policier fran\u00e7ais|last=Gu\u00e9rif|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=1986|publisher=Artefact|isbn=2851994034|location=[S.l.]|pages=113|oclc=489779740}}</ref> Susan Hayward suggests that the gender switch made by Clouzot was caused not so much by censorship considerations (in the source novel, Lucienne and Mireille turn out to be a pair of lesbian lovers) but by his desire to create a sizeable role for his wife.<ref>Hayward, p. 15</ref> The book has only one principal female character, Lucienne, since the supposed victim, Mireille disappears early on. Vera with her distinctly feminine demeanor was ill-suited for the role of Lucienne (called Nicole in the film). So in Clouzot\u2019s script, Mireille (now named Christina) is the one who has a weak heart, and is the object of manipulation of her husband Michel and his mistress Nicole. Clouzot also followed the convention that the culprits should be exposed by the detective in the end (another departure from the novel where the authors let them get away).<ref>{{Cite book|title=French film noir|last=Buss|first=Robin|date=2001|publisher=Marion Boyars|isbn=0714530360|location=London|pages=24|oclc=44652477}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nClouzot cast [[Simone Signoret]] in the role of Nicole. He previously filmed her husband [[Yves Montand]] in ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'', and the two couples became friends. The director was also aware of Vera\u2019s limitations as an actress and needed someone to lend her support in such a demanding role. Signoret signed an eight-week contract but the shooting actually took 16 weeks. She ended up being paid for only eight weeks of work despite staying until the end of the filming because she neglected to read the small print.<ref>Hayward, p. 16</ref>  Signoret\u2019s co-star Paul Meurisse also recalls in his memoirs that the actress was further bemused by Clouzot\u2019s constant attempts to find clever ways of lighting Vera's face while muting the light on Signoret so she wouldn't upstage his wife.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Les \u00e9perons de la libert\u00e9|last=Meurisse|first=Paul|date=1979|publisher=R.

Clouzot then was trying to sell his song lyrics to [[\u00c9dith Piaf|Edith Piaf]], Meurisse's lover at the time. By the late 1940s Meurisse had become an established stage and screen actor, known for the roles of icy and sophisticated villains, and he seemed a natural choice for the role of Michel.<ref>Hayward, p. 17-18</ref>\n\nThe film featured two Clouzot regulars: [[Pierre Larquey]] as M. Drain and [[No\u00ebl Roquevert]] as M. Herboux. [[Michel Serrault]] made his screen debut as M. Raymond, one of the schoolteachers. [[Charles Vanel]]\u2014who previously co-starred in Clouzot's ''The Wages of Fear''\u2014was cast as the seemingly inept Inspector Fichet.\n\nClouzot also auditioned 300 children and selected 35. Among them were Jean-Philippe Smet (the future [[Johnny Hallyday]]), [[Patrick Dewaere]]'s brother Yves-Marie Maurin, and [[Georges Poujouly]], who previously received acclaim in [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment|Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment's]] ''[[Forbidden Games]]''.<ref>Hayward, p. 19</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe filming began on August 18, 1954 and finished on November 30 the same year.<ref name=\":0\" /> Clouzot asked his assistant Michel Romanoff to find a suitable filming location for the boarding school. The latter discovered a decrepit chateau in [[L'\u00c9tang-la-Ville|L'Etang-la-Ville]] between Saint-Cloud and the [[Bois de Boulogne|Bois-du-Boulogne]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/cinema/20171027.OBS6631/les-diaboliques-histoire-d-un-tournage-electrique.html|title=Les Diaboliques\", histoire d'un tournage \u00e9lectrique|last=Loison|first=Guillaume|date=2017-11-07|website=L'Obs|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> The building and its surroundings matched the director\u2019s vision perfectly since they projected the desired mood of decay and neglect. The adjacent swimming pool was dirty and full of slime. Clouzot spent five weeks shooting at this location.<ref name=\":2\">Hayward, p. 20</ref>\n\nThe screenplay placed Nicole\u2019s house in Niort, but the actual house used for the filming was in [[Montfort-l'Amaury]], just opposite the building that previously appeared in Clouzot's ''[[Le Corbeau]]''. The morgue scenes were shot in the Institut M\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gal in Paris. The rest was filmed at Saint-Maurice Studios southeast of Paris which took additional nine weeks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe cinematographer [[Armand Thirard]] used two camera crews to speed up the shooting that was falling behind the schedule. Despite his efforts, the filming took twice longer than the projected 48 days.<ref>Hayward, p. 20-21</ref>\n\nOriginally the film was to be called ''Les Veuves'' (\u2018The widows\u2019) but this was deemed unmarketable. Eleven weeks into filming it was changed to ''Les D\u00e9moniaques''.<ref name=\"Hayward2005\" /> Eventually it was renamed ''Les Diaboliques'' but this title was already used for [[Les Diaboliques (short story collection)|a collection of short stories]] by the 19th century writer [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]]. Clouzot was permitted to use this title but only on the condition if he gave the author a proper mention.<ref name=\"Hayward2005\" /> He did it by opening the film with a quote from the preface to d\u2019Aurevilly's work: \"A portrait is always moral when it is tragic and shows the horror of the things it represents.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Framed : lesbians, feminists, and media culture|last=Mayne, Judith.|date=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0816634564|location=Minneapolis|pages=49|oclc=43555067}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film created a sensation upon its original release, and was a success at the [[box office]] with 3,674,380 admissions in France alone. It has often been likened to the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]; some sources say that Alfred Hitchcock missed out on purchasing the rights to the Boileau and Narcejac novel by just a few hours, Clouzot getting to the authors first.<ref>[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], in his book-length interview ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967), suggested that Boileau and Narcejac then wrote ''[[The Living and the Dead (Boileau-Narcejac novel)|D'Entre les Morts]]'' specifically for Hitchcock, who adapted the latter book for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).

Kearney]] and directed by [[Curtis Harrington]], and starring [[James Caan]] and [[Katharine Ross]], has a different basic situation, but similar twists at the end, and again features [[Simone Signoret]] as the corrupt woman of mystery.\n\nBritish filmmaker [[Jimmy Sangster]] cited it as a major influence on his writing and directing, stating:  \"most of my 'psycho' type movies ... were derivative of each other and they all went back to my original inspiration: ''Les Diaboliques''. I'm not the only one to follow that path. I guess I just did it more than most.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hammer films' psychological thrillers, 1950-1972|last=Huckvale|first=David|date = 28 February 2014|isbn=978-1-4766-0421-3|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=11|oclc=870994470}}</ref>\n\nAn American version of ''Les Diaboliques'', titled ''[[Reflections of Murder]]'', was made by ABC-TV in 1974 with [[Tuesday Weld]], [[Joan Hackett]], and [[Sam Waterston]].

Chechik]], and starring [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Isabelle Adjani]] in the leading female roles, with [[Chazz Palminteri]] as the husband and [[Kathy Bates]] as the detective.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] in July 1999 and was then re-released on DVD and Blu-ray in May 2011.
