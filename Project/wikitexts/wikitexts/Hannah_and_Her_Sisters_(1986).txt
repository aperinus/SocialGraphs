The film was written and directed by [[Woody Allen]], who stars along with [[Mia Farrow]] as Hannah, [[Michael Caine]] as her husband, and [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Dianne Wiest]] as her sisters.\n\nThe film's ensemble cast also includes [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], [[Lloyd Nolan]] (who died four-and-a-half months before the film's release), [[Max Von Sydow]], and [[Julie Kavner]]. [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Fred Melamed]], [[Lewis Black]], [[Joanna Gleason]], [[John Turturro]], and [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] all have minor roles, while [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] and [[Sam Waterston]] make uncredited cameo appearances. Several of Farrow's children, including [[Soon-Yi Previn]] (who married Allen in 1997), have credited and uncredited roles, mostly as Thanksgiving [[Extra (actor)|extras]].\n\n''Hannah and Her Sisters'' was, for a long time, Allen's biggest box office success (forgoing adjustment for inflation), with a North American gross of US$40 million. The film won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. It is often considered one of Allen's major works, with critics continuing to praise its writing and ensemble cast.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is told in three main [[Story arc|arc]]s, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties, held at [[The Langham (apartment building)|The Langham]], hosted by Hannah, and her husband, Elliot.  Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.\n\nElliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having an affair with somebody.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.\n\nHannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.  Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.  However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.  He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce.  A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.  When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.  His [[existential crisis]] leads to unsatisfying experiments with [[religious conversion]] to Catholicism and an interest in [[Krishna Consciousness]].  Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' in a movie theater.  The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.\n\nHolly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.\n\nA minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.  Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.\n\nBy the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at [[Columbia University]]. Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.  The film's final shot reveals that Holly is married to Mickey and that she is pregnant.\n\n==Influences==\nPart of the film's structure and background is borrowed from [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' (1982). In both films, a large theatrical family gather for three successive years' celebrations (Thanksgiving in Allen's film, Christmas in Bergman's). The first of each gathering is in a time of contentment, the second in a time of trouble, and the third showing what happens after the resolution of the troubles. The sudden appearance of Mickey's reflection behind Holly's in the closing scene also parallels the apparition behind Alexander of the Bishop's ghost. Additional parallels can be found with [[Luchino Visconti]]'s 1960 film ''[[Rocco and His Brothers]]'', which, besides the connection to its name, also uses the structural device of dividing sections of the film for the different siblings' plot arcs.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=7344|title= Rocco And His Brothers|work= The Spinning Image|access-date= April 10, 2014|first= Dan|last= Schneider|year= 2012|archive-date= April 13, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131524/http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=7344|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Mickey, Hannah's ex-husband\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Elliot, Hannah's husband\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Hannah\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Holly, Hannah's sister\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as April, Holly's business partner\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Lee, Hannah's sister\n* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Evan, Hannah's father\n* [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as Norma, Hannah's mother\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Dusty\n* [[Max Von Sydow]] as Frederick, Lee's domestic partner\n* [[Lewis Black]] as Paul\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Mary\n* [[Christian Clemenson]] as Larry\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Gail, Mickey's production assistant \n* [[J.

Woody Allen then re-read the novel ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' \"and I thought, it's interesting how this guy gets the various stories going, cutting from one story to another. I loved the idea of experimenting with that.\"<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news|title=Auteur! Auteur!|last=James|first=Caryn|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 19, 1986|page=SM18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nHe was particularly intrigued by the character of Nicholas Levin \"who can't seem to find any meaning to life, he's terribly afraid of dying. It struck home very deeply. I thought it would be interesting to do one story about the relationship between three sisters and one story about someone else and his obsession with mortality.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nAllen admits the role of Hannah was based on Farrow being \"a romanticized perception of Mia. She's very stable, she has eight children now, and she's able to run her career and have good relationships with her sister and her mother. I'm very impressed with those qualities, and I thought if she had two unstable sisters, it would be interesting.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nAllen says he was also inspired by the title. \"I thought I'd like to make a film called ''Hannah and Her Sisters''\", he said, saying this prompted him to give Hannah two sisters.<ref name=\"new\"/> He was interested in making something about the relationship between sisters which he felt was more complex than that between brothers. \"Maybe that comes from childhood; my mother had seven sisters and their children were female so all I knew were aunts and female cousins.\"<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nMia Farrow later wrote that Allen had been intrigued about the subject of sisters for a long time. His earlier co-stars [[Janet Margolin]] and [[Diane Keaton]] both had two sisters each, and Farrow had three. She says Allen gave her an early copy of ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' saying she could play whatever sister she wanted, but that \"he felt I should be Hannah, the more complex and enigmatic of the sisters ... whose stillness and internal strength he likened to the quality [[Al Pacino]] projected in ''[[The Godfather]]''\".<ref>{{harvnb|Farrow|1997|p=225}}</ref>\n\nFarrow wrote, \"It was the first time I criticized one of his scripts. To me, the characters seemed self-indulgent and dissolute in predictable ways. The script was wordy but it said nothing.\" She claims \"Woody didn't disagree and tried to switch over to\" an alternative idea, \"but preproduction was already in progress, and we had to proceed\".<ref>{{harvnb|Farrow|1997|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\nShe later elaborated:\n<blockquote>It was my mother's stunned, chill reaction to the script that enabled me to see how he had taken many of the personal circumstances and themes of our lives, and, it seemed, had distorted them into cartoonish characterizations. At the same time he was my partner. I loved him. I could trust him with my life. And he was a writer: this is what writers do. All grist for the mill. Relatives have always grumbled. He had taken the ordinary stuff of our lives and lifted it into art. We were honored and outraged.<ref name=\"Farrow266\">{{harvnb|Farrow|1997|p=226}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFarrow admitted \"a small sick feeling ... deep inside me\" which \"I shared with nobody was my fear that ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' had openly and clearly spelled out his feelings for my sister. But this was fiction, I told myself ... So I put those thoughts out of my mind.\"<ref name=\"Farrow266\"/>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Hannah and Her Sisters'' opened on February 7, 1986, in 54 theaters, where it grossed $1,265,826 ($23,441 per screen) in its opening weekend, the first time an Allen film had debuted in theaters in cities other than New York City.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|title='Down and Out' Up and Over Last Week's Nat'l B.O.
