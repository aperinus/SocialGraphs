In 2003, she is stationed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Pakistan]]. She and CIA officer Dan Fuller attend the [[black site]] interrogations of [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]] ([[Reda Kateb]]), a detainee with suspected links to several of the [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]] and who is subjected to [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|approved torture interrogation techniques]]. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in [[Saudi Arabia]], but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]]. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.\n\nIn 2009, Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica travels to a US base in Afghanistan to meet a Jordanian doctor, highly placed in al-Qaeda, who has offered to become a US spy for $25 million. Instead, he turns out to be a triple agent loyal to al-Qaeda, and Jessica is killed, along with several other CIA officers, when he detonates a suicide vest in what will come to be known as the [[Camp Chapman attack]], the worst attack on CIA personnel in 25 years.\n\nThomas, an analyst who linked the Abu Ahmed lead, shares with Maya an interrogation of a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier: Ibrahim Sayeed traveled under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining the account of Ahmed's \"death\" in 2001.\n\nA Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother to Dan for a [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo Bicolore]]. Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls [[tradecraft]], thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown.\n\nThe CIA puts the compound under surveillance, but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President [[Barack Obama]], the CIA director holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60\u201380% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] flies two [[stealth helicopter]]s from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]] and the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|Special Activities Division]] to raid the compound. The SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people in the compound, including a man whom they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse.\n\nShe boards a military transport back to the U.S., the sole passenger. She is asked where she wants to go and begins to cry.\n\n==Cast==\n'''CIA'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Maya Harris, a [[CIA]] [[intelligence analyst]]<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|title=Bin Laden Film's Focus Is Facts, Not Flash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/movies/zero-dark-thirty-by-kathryn-bigelow-focuses-on-facts.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2012|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Brooks|last2=Barnes|access-date=February 28, 2017|archive-date=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421025012/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/movies/zero-dark-thirty-by-kathryn-bigelow-focuses-on-facts.html?_r=0|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Dan Fuller, a CIA [[intelligence officer]]\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Jessica Karley, a senior CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Strong]] as George Panetta, a senior CIA supervisor<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph Bradley, Islamabad CIA [[Station Chief]]\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Jack Fuller, a CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Steve Bradley, a CIA analyst\n* [[Fredric Lehne]] as Fred \"The Wolf\" Guerrero, a CIA section chief\n* [[John Barrowman]] as Jeremy Karley, a CIA executive\n* [[Jessie Collins]] as Debbie Stone, a CIA analyst\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Larry Handley, a CIA [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] operative\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Hakim, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as John Simmons, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Thomas, a CIA analyst\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''US Navy'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Patrick Grayston, [[SEAL Team Six|DEVGRU]] (SEAL Team 6) team leader\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Justin Lenihan, DEVGRU operator. \n* [[Callan Mulvey]] as Saber Till, DEVGRU operator. \n* [[Taylor Kinney]] as Jared Bradley, DEVGRU operator\n* [[Mike Colter]] as Mike, DEVGRU operator\n* [[Frank Grillo]] as DEVGRU Commanding officer\n* [[Christopher Stanley]] as [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]] Commander Vice Admiral [[Bill McRaven]]{{#tag:ref|This is the spelling used by the film's end credits|group=N}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Other'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Tom Donilon]] \n* [[Mark Valley]] as [[C-130]] pilot\n* [[John Schwab]] as Deputy [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]\n* [[Reda Kateb]] as [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]], a terrorist who is tortured for information\n* [[Homayoun Ershadi]] as [[Hassan Ghul]]\n* Yoav Levi as [[Abu Farraj al-Libbi]]\n* [[Ricky Sekhon]] as [[Osama bin Laden]], leader and founder of [[Al Qaeda]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Titles===\nThe film's working title was ''For God and Country''.<ref name=\"EW22\">[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/28/zero-dark-thirty-documents/ No conspiracy: New documents explain Pentagon, CIA cooperation on 'Zero Dark Thirty'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831234236/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/28/zero-dark-thirty-documents/ |date=August 31, 2012}}; ''Entertainment Weekly''; August 28, 2012.</ref> The title ''Zero Dark Thirty'' was officially confirmed at the end of the film's teaser trailer.<ref>[https://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/20120806bin-laden-movie-trailer-zero-dark-thirty.html Bin Laden movie trailer is out; filmmakers are talking]; azcentral.com; August 6, 2012.</ref> Bigelow has explained that \"it's a military term for 30 minutes after midnight, and it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire decade-long mission.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/06/zero-dark-thirty-first-look |title=First Look: Obama not in 'Zero Dark Thirty' thriller about hunt for Osama bin Laden&nbsp;\u2013 Exclusive |publisher=Insidemovies.ew.com |date=August 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all |access-date=2013-01-19 |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904062219/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/06/zero-dark-thirty-first-look/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nBigelow and Boal had initially worked on and finished a screenplay centered on the December 2001 [[Battle of Tora Bora]], and the long, unsuccessful efforts to find Osama bin Laden in the region. The two were about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed.\n\nThey immediately shelved the film they had been working on and redirected their focus, essentially starting from scratch. \"But a lot of the homework I'd done for the first script and a lot of the contacts I made, carried over,\" Boal remarked during an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. He added, \"The years I had spent talking to military and intelligence operators involved in [[counter-terrorism]] was helpful in both projects. Some of the sourcing I had developed long, long ago continued to be helpful for this version.\"<ref name=\"EW1\"/>\n\nAlong with painstakingly recreating the historic night-vision raid on the Abbottabad compound, the script and the film stress the little-reported role of the tenacious young female CIA officer who tracked down Osama bin Laden. Screenwriter Boal said that while researching for the film, \"I heard through the grapevine that women played a big role in the CIA in general and in this team. I heard that a woman was there on the night of the raid as one of the CIA's liaison officers on the ground \u2013 and that was the start of it.\" He then turned up stories about a young case officer who was recruited out of college, who had spent her entire career chasing bin Laden. Maya's tough-minded, monomaniacal persona, Boal said, is \"based on a real person, but she also represents the work of a lot of other women.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/secrets-of-zero-dark-thirty-20130111 |author=Hill, Logan |title=Secrets of 'Zero Dark Thirty' |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=January 11, 2013 |access-date=September 19, 2017 |archive-date=September 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905121153/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/secrets-of-zero-dark-thirty-20130111 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2014 [[Jane Mayer]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that \"Maya\" was modeled in part after CIA officer [[Alfreda Frances Bikowsky]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unidentified-queen-torture |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=The Unidentified Queen of Torture |magazine=The New Yorker |date=December 18, 2014 |access-date=December 22, 2014 |archive-date=December 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220092405/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unidentified-queen-torture |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Zero Dark Thirty'' producers built a real compound in Jordan, based on what they could learn (from diagrams and reporting) about the building where the CIA\u2019s pursuit ended.
