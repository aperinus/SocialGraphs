It stars an [[ensemble cast]], with [[James Stewart]], [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Peter Finch]], [[Hardy Kruger]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Ian Bannen]], [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]], [[Christian Marquand]], [[Dan Duryea]] and [[George Kennedy]].\n\nThough the film was not a financial success, it was well-received by critics, who praised Aldrich\u2019s direction and the performances of its cast. It was nominated for two [[Academy Award]]s: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Bannen and [[Academy Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] for [[Michael Luciano]]. Hardy Kr\u00fcger was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor]],{{efn|Kr\u00fcger later rejected the nomination.}} and Aldrich was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].\n\n''The Flight of the Phoenix'' was remade in 2004, titled as [[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|''Flight of the Phoenix'']].\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Towns is the pilot of a twin-engine [[Fairchild C-82 Packet]] cargo plane flying from [[Jaghbub, Libya|Jaghbub]] to [[Benghazi]] in [[Libya]]; Lew Moran is the navigator. Passengers include Capt. Harris and Sgt. Watson of the [[British Army]]; Dr. Renaud, a French physician; Heinrich Dorfmann, a [[Germany|German]] [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineer]]; and an oil company accountant named Standish. There are also several oil workers, including Trucker Cobb, a foreman suffering from mental fatigue; Ratbags Crow, a cocky [[Scotland|Scot]]; Carlos and his pet monkey; and Gabriele.\n\nA sudden sandstorm disables the engines, forcing Towns to crash-land in the [[Sahara]] desert. As the aircraft comes to a stop, two workers are killed and Gabriele's leg is severely injured.\n\nThe radio is unusable, and the survivors are too far off course to be found by searchers. Aboard the plane is a large quantity of pitted [[Date (fruit)|dates]] but only enough water for ten to fifteen days if rationed. Captain Harris sets out to try and find an oasis. When Sgt. Watson feigns an injury to stay behind, Carlos volunteers, leaving his pet monkey with Bellamy. Harris and Towns refuse to allow the mentally-unstable Cobb to go along, but Cobb defiantly follows anyway and later dies of exposure in the desert. Days later, Harris returns to the crash site alone and barely alive. Sgt. Watson discovers and then ignores him, though others later find him.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorfmann proposes a radical idea: building a new aircraft from the wreckage. The C-82 has twin booms extending rearwards from each engine and connected by the [[tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]]. Dorfmann wants to attach the outer sections of both wings to the left engine and left boom, discarding the center fuselage and both inner wing sections of the aircraft. The men will ride atop the wings. Towns and Moran believe he is either joking or delusional. The argument is complicated by a [[personality clash]] between Towns, a proud traditionalist aviator, and Dorfmann, a young, arrogant engineer. Moran struggles to maintain the peace.\n\nTowns initially resists Dorfmann's plan, though Renaud sways his opinion, saying activity and hope will help sustain the men's morale. Dorfmann supervises the reconstruction, while Towns remains skeptical. During the work, the fatally-injured Gabriele commits suicide, depressing the men to where they consider abandoning the new plane's construction. Dorfmann, caught exceeding his water ration, justifies it, saying he has been the only one working continuously. He promises to not do it again but demands everyone work equally hard from then on.\n\nStandish christens the nearly completed aircraft, \"Phoenix\", after the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird]] that is reborn from its own ashes. When a band of Arabs camp nearby, Harris and Renaud leave to make contact while the others (and the aircraft) remain hidden. The two men are found murdered the next day. Additionally, Towns and Moran are stunned to learn that Dorfmann designs [[radio-controlled aircraft|model airplanes]] rather than full-sized aircraft. Dorfmann defends himself, claiming the aerodynamic principles are the same, and many model planes require more exacting designs than full-size aircraft. With no other choice, Towns and Moran forge ahead with the plan without telling the others about Dorfmann.\n\nThe Phoenix is completed but untested. Only seven [[Coffman engine starter|starter cartridges]] are available to ignite the engine. The first four startup attempts are unsuccessful. Over Dorfmann's vehement objections, Towns fires the fifth cartridge with the ignition off to clear the engine's cylinders. The next startup is successful. The men pull the Phoenix to a nearby hilltop, then climb onto the wings. When Towns guns the engine, the Phoenix slides down the hill and over a lake bed before taking off. After a successful landing at an oasis with a manned oil rig, the men celebrate and Towns and Dorfmann are reconciled.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Stewart]] as Frank Towns\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as Lew Moran\n* [[Peter Finch]] as Captain Harris\n* [[Hardy Kruger]] as Heinrich Dorfmann\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Trucker Cobb\n* co-starring [[Ian Bannen]] as Crow\n* [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] as Sergeant Watson\n* [[Christian Marquand]] as Dr. Renaud\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Standish\n* also starring [[George Kennedy]] as Bellamy\n* [[Gabriele Tinti (actor)|Gabriele Tinti]] as Gabriele\n* Alex Montoya as Carlos\n* featuring Peter Bravos as Tasso\n* William Aldrich as Bill\n* and [[Barrie Chase]] as Farida\n}}\n\n==Song==\n*The Phoenix Love Theme \"Senza Fine\" sung by [[Connie Francis]]\n*Music & Italian lyrics by [[Gino Paoli]]\n*English lyrics by [[Alec Wilder]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Locations===\nPrincipal photography started April 26, 1965, at the [[20th Century-Fox]] Studios and 20th Century-Fox Ranch, California. Other filming locations, simulating the desert, were Buttercup Valley in the [[Algodones Dunes]], California and [[Pilot Knob (Imperial County, California)|Pilot Knob Mesa]], California. The flying sequences were all filmed at Pilot Knob Mesa near [[Winterhaven, California|Winterhaven]], located in California's [[Imperial Valley]], on the western fringes of [[Yuma, Arizona]].\n\n===Aircraft used===\n[[File:Fairchild C-82A N53228 Film LGB 17.10.70.jpg|thumb|right|Fairchild C-82A N53228 painted in the markings of the fictional Arabco Oil Company for the film]]\n\nIn 2005, Hollywood aviation historian Simon Beck identified the aircraft used in the film:\n* Fairchild [[C-82 Packet|C-82A Packet]], N6887C&nbsp;\u2013 flying shots.\n* Fairchild C-82A Packet, N4833V&nbsp;\u2013 outdoor location wreck.\n* Fairchild C-82A Packet, N53228&nbsp;\u2013 indoor studio wreck.\n* Fairchild R4Q-1 [[C-119 Flying Boxcar|Flying Boxcar]] (the USMC C-119C variant), BuNo. 126580&nbsp;\u2013 non-flying ''Phoenix'' prop.\n* [[Tallmantz Phoenix P-1]], N93082&nbsp;\u2013 flying ''Phoenix'' aircraft.\n* [[North American O-47]]A, N4725V&nbsp;\u2013 second flying ''Phoenix''.\n\nThe C-82As were from Steward-Davies Inc. at Long Beach, California, while the O-47A came from the [[Planes of Fame]] air museum in [[California]]. The R4Q-1 was purchased from Allied Aircraft of [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The aerial camera platform was a [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25J Mitchell]], ''N1042B'', which was also used in the 1970 film ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]''.\n\nAlthough principal photography was completed on August 13, 1965, in order to complete filming, a [[North American O-47]]A (N4725V) from the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California was modified and used as a flying ''Phoenix'' stand-in. With the canopy removed, a set of skids attached to the main landing gear as well as ventral fin added to the tail, it sufficed as more-or-less a visual lookalike. Filming using the O-47A was completed in October/November 1965. It appears in the last flying scenes, painted to look like the earlier Phoenix P-1.\n\nThe final production used a mix of footage that included the O-47A, the \"cobbled-together\" Phoenix and Phoenix P-1.\n\n===Death of stunt flyer Paul Mantz===\nThe flying sequences were flown by famous racing/stunt/movie pilot and collector of warplanes [[Paul Mantz]], co-owner of [[Frank Tallman|Tallmantz Aviation]], filling in for his partner [[Frank Tallman]], who had injured his leg.\n\nOn the morning of July 8, 1965, Mantz was flying the [[Tallmantz Phoenix P-1]], the machine that was \"made of the wreckage\", performing [[touch-and-go landing]]s for the cameras, when the fuselage buckled during a touchdown. The movie model broke apart and cartwheeled, killing Mantz and seriously injuring stuntman Bobby Rose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Mantz-P1.htm |title=Final Flight - 'Phoenix' |publisher=Check-six.com |access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref>\n\nThe final credit on the screen was, \"It should be remembered... that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer gave his life in the making of this film...\"\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened in selected theaters on December 15, 1965, with a full release in 1966. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' dismissed it as \"grim and implausible\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9E03E6DF153DE532A25752C0A9649C946791D6CF |title=Movie Review\u2014Screen: From the Ashes: 'Flight of the Phoenix' on View at 2 Theaters |work=The New York Times |date=1966-02-01 |access-date=2018-01-19}}</ref> while ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film as an \"often-fascinating and superlative piece of filmmaking highlighted by standout performances and touches that show producer-director at his best.\"<ref>''Variety'' staff (1964).
