The film was based on the novel ''The Dead Heart'' by [[Douglas Kennedy (writer)|Douglas Kennedy]]. \"[[Woop Woop]]\" is an [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian colloquialism]] referring to a fictional location in the middle of nowhere.\n\n==Plot==\nTeddy ([[Johnathon Schaech]]) is a [[New York City|New York]] bird smuggler who goes to Australia to replace a flock of escaped birds after a deal goes awry. While there, he has a wild liaison with a quirky, sexually ravenous girl, Angie ([[Susie Porter]]), who, after a brief courtship, knocks him unconscious and kidnaps him. When he awakes, he finds himself \"married\" to her - not legally - and stranded in Woop Woop, a desolate, dilapidated town hidden within a crater-like rock formation in [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] territory. The residents are people who lived there at an [[asbestos]] [[mining]] [[camping|camp]] before the land was handed over to the Aboriginal peoples; following a tragedy in 1979, Woop Woop was abandoned and literally \"erased\" from the Australian map. Not content with the deal given to them by the mining company (from [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]), they opted to return to their old lives in Woop Woop. At first, they repopulated themselves incestuously, which caused wide mental instability. A rule was then enacted (\"Rule #3\"), preventing residents from sleeping with their relatives. Since then, outsiders like Teddy have been occasionally kidnapped to keep Woop Woop populated.\n\nTheir only export is dog food made from road-killed [[kangaroos]]. The town is run by Angie's father, Daddy-O ([[Rod Taylor]]), in an authoritarian manner, that he disguises as communal (he and the other town elders keep the best luxuries for themselves in secret while doling out only the usual canned [[pineapple]] and sub-par [[tobacco]] to the others). The only entertainment available to the residents is old [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]] films and soundtracks, the latter of which they play constantly. These are presumably leftover from the town's last official contact with the civilized world.\n\nAfter witnessing another kidnapping, 'Midget,' the local hairdresser, is shot dead by Daddy-O during an attempted escape. Teddy soon realizes he will be trapped in Woop Woop for life unless he finds a way out for himself. Initially, he repairs his VW van, which had been vandalized by the locals, only to have it vandalized again by Daddy-O. In addition, the [[Australian Cattle Dog]] that he adopts is shot as part of 'Dog Day.' He befriends a couple of locals, including the scruffy, affable Duffy and Krystal, Angie's sister, who help him confront Daddy-O's iron-fisted reign and arrange an escape plan. Duffy, reprimanded by Daddy-O for breaking 'Rule #3,' nonetheless elects to stay in Woop Woop, while Teddy, Krystal, and Krystal's pet [[cockatoo]] escape.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Teddy\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Daddy-O\n* [[Susie Porter]] as Angie\n* [[Dee Smart]] as Krystal\n* [[Richard Moir]] as Reggie\n* [[Maggie Kirkpatrick]] as Ginger\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as Blind Wally\n* Mark Wilson as Duffy\n* [[Paul Mercurio]] as Midget\n* Baden Jones as Leon\n* [[Rachel Griffiths]] as Sylvia\n* [[Tina Louise]] as Bella\n\n==Soundtrack==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ann Danielewski]] -->\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WelcomeToWoopWoppSoundtrackCover.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the Soundtrack to 'Welcome to Woop Woop'.{{deletable file-caption|Wednesday, 14 September 2022|PROD}}]] -->\nA soundtrack was released by [[Universal Music Group]].\n# \"[[Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps]]\" - [[Cake (band)|Cake]]\n# \"[[There Is Nothing Like a Dame|There is Nothin' Like a Dame]]\" - [[Reel Big Fish]]\n# \"Timebomb\" - [[Chumbawamba]]\n# \"[[I Cain't Say No|I Can't Say No]]\" - [[Poe (singer)|Poe]]\n# \"Welcome to Your Life (Woop, Woop)\" - [[Boy George]]\n# \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" - [[Merril Bainbridge]] and [[Shaggy (artist)|Shaggy]]\n# \"[[Bali Ha'i]]\" - [[Moodswings (band)|Moodswings]] and [[Neneh Cherry]]\n# \"Dog's Life\" - [[eels (band)|eels]]\n# \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]\" - [[Robin S.]]\n# \"[[Climb Every Mountain]]\" - [[Peggy Wood]] and [[Junior Vasquez]]\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Welcome to Woop Woop'' has an overall approval rating of 29% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_woop_woop/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=5 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nElliot's earlier film release, ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' had been a Cannes hit in 1994.
