The [[screenplay]] focuses on two [[working-class]] women who smuggle illegal immigrants from [[Canada]] to the [[United States]]. The film received two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Melissa Leo]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] ([[Courtney Hunt]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set shortly before [[Christmas]] in the [[North Country, New York|North Country]] of [[Upstate New York]], near the ''Akwesasne'' ('Where the Partridge Drums') [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] and the border crossing to [[Cornwall, Ontario]]. Ray Eddy ([[Melissa Leo]]) is a [[discount store]] clerk struggling to raise two sons with her husband, a compulsive gambler who has disappeared with the funds she had earmarked to finance the purchase of a [[Mobile home|double-wide mobile home]]. While searching for him, she encounters Lila Littlewolf ([[Misty Upham]]), a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo-parlor]] employee who is driving his car, which she claims she found abandoned with the keys in the ignition at the local [[bus station]]. The two women, who have both fallen on hard economic times, form a desperate and uneasy alliance and begin smuggling illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States across the frozen [[St. Lawrence River]] for $1,200 each.\n\nRay's older son T.J. wants to find a job and help support the family so they can afford to eat something more substantial than [[popcorn]] and [[Tang (drink)|Tang]]. He and his mother clash over whether he should remain in high-school and look after his little brother Ricky or drop out to work. To make matters worse, T.J. sets an outside corner of the trailer afire with a torch in an attempt to unfreeze the water pipe. Lila longs for the day she will be able to reclaim and live with her young son, who was taken from her by her mother-in-law immediately after his birth.\n\nBecause the women's route takes them from an [[Indian reservation]] in the US to an [[Indian reserve]] in Canada, they hope to avoid detection by local law-enforcement. However, their problems escalate when they are asked to smuggle a [[Pakistan]]i couple and Ray, fearful their [[duffel bag]] might contain explosives, leaves it behind in sub-freezing temperatures, only to discover it contained their infant baby when they arrive at their destination. She and Lila retrace their route and find the bag and the baby, which Lila insists is dead, but which she revives moments before being reunited with the baby's parents. The experience leaves her shaken, and she announces she no longer wants to participate in the smuggling operation. But Ray, needing just one more crossing to finance the down payment on her mobile home, coerces her into joining her for one last journey.\n\nThey pick up two  Asian women from a strip club for crossing. When the club owner tries to short them, Ray successfully threatens him with a gun. When she is re-entering her car, the irate club owner retaliates by shooting Ray in the ear. Shaken, her fast and erratic driving catches the attention of the provincial police. Ray tries to elude capture by crossing the frozen river where one of the wheels of the car breaks through the ice. The four women abandon the vehicle and take refuge at the Indian reservation.\n\nBecause the police are demanding a scapegoat, the tribal head decides to excommunicate Lila for five years due to her smuggling history which involved the death of her Mohawk husband. Surprised then saddened by the news, Ray gives in to Lila's pleas to go free for the sake of her children. However, running through the woods, Ray has a fit of conscience and returns. Ray gives her share of money to Lila with instructions for taking care of her (Ray's) sons and seeing through the purchase plans for a mobile home. Ray and the illegal immigrants are surrendered to the police and a trooper speculates she will have to serve four months in jail. Ray calls her son T.J. to explain what has happened.\n\nLila pushes her way into her mother-in-law's home and reclaims her infant son. She and the baby show up at the Eddy trailer while T.J. is still on the phone with his jailed mother. In a day scene, T.J. completes the welding of a bicycle-propelled carousel bearing his younger brother and Lila's strapped in baby. He pedals the carousel while Lila smiles on. A truck nears carrying the new mobile home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Ray Eddy\n* [[Misty Upham]] as Lila Littlewolf\n* [[Charlie McDermott]] as Troy \"T.J.\" Eddy, Jr.\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as State Trooper Finnerty\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Jacques Bruno\n* James Reilly as Ricky Eddy\n* Dylan Carusona as Jimmy\n* Jay Klaitz as Guy Versailles\n* Michael Sky as Billy Three Rivers\n* John Canoe as Bernie Littlewolf\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview screenwriter/director Courtney Hunt conducted shortly before the film's release, she discussed its prevalent theme of a mother's love for her children being a culturally universal trait. She stated the most important moment in her life was the birth of her daughter and how that event made all her other goals lesser priorities. By showing how such intimacy knows no bounds, culturally or socially, Hunt said she hoped her film would enable audiences to break down their assumptions about others around them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zoom-in.com/sundance/podcasts/on_the_circuit_frozen_river |title=Zoom-In.com interview |access-date=2008-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922022857/http://www.zoom-in.com/sundance/podcasts/on_the_circuit_frozen_river |archive-date=2008-09-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHunt's husband is from [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]].
