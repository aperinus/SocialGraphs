The film is inspired by the story of the [[MIT Blackjack Team]] as told in ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House]]'', the best-selling 2003 book by [[Ben Mezrich]]. The film stars [[Jim Sturgess]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Liza Lapira]], [[Jacob Pitts]], [[Aaron Yoo]], and [[Kieu Chinh]]. Despite its largely mixed reviews and controversy over its casting choices, ''21'' was a box office success, and was the number one film in the United States and Canada during its first and second weekends of release.\n\n==Plot==\nBen Campbell, a mathematics major at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], is accepted into [[Harvard Medical School]] but cannot afford the $300,000 tuition. He applies for the prestigious Robinson Scholarship which would cover the entire cost. Despite having a [[Medical College Admission Test]] score of 44 (at the time, MCAT scoring was on a scale of 3-45,) and high grades, he faces fierce competition, and is told by the director that the scholarship will only go to whichever student dazzles him.\n\nBack at MIT, a professor, Micky Rosa challenges Ben with the [[Monty Hall Problem]] which he solves. After looking at Ben's 97% score on his latest non-linear equations test, Micky invites Ben to join the [[MIT Blackjack Team]], consisting of fellow students Choi, Fisher, Jill and Kianna. Using [[card counting]] and covert signalling, they increase their probability of winning at casinos, leading them to earn substantial profits.\n\nOver many weekends, the team is flown to [[Las Vegas Valley]] and Ben comes to enjoy his luxurious life as a high roller big player. The team is impressed by Ben's skill but Fisher becomes jealous and fights him while drunk, leading Micky to expel him. The head of security, Cole Williams, has been monitoring the team and begins to focus on Ben.\n\nBen's devotion to blackjack causes him to neglect his role in an engineering competition, which estranges him from his friends. During the next trip to Las Vegas, he is emotionally distracted and fails to walk away from the table when signaled, causing him to lose $200,000. Micky is angered and quits the team, demanding Ben repay $200,000. Ben and three of the students decide that they will continue to play blackjack without Micky but they are caught by Williams, whom Micky tipped off. Williams beats up Ben and warns him not to return. He also reveals his own personal history with Micky Rosa, once a successful card counter who got Williams fired after winning over a million dollars in one night at his casino while he was away at his father's funeral.\n\nBen learns he is ineligible for graduation because his course taught by an associate of Micky's is marked as incomplete (with Micky's influence, the professor initially gives Ben a passing grade throughout the year without him having to work or even show up to class). His winnings are stolen from his dormitory room. Suspecting Micky, Ben confers with the other blackjack students and they persuade Micky to make a final trip to Vegas before the casinos install [[biometric software]]. The team puts on disguises and returns to [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|Planet Hollywood]], winning $640,000 before Williams spots them.\n\nMicky flees with the bag of chips, jumping into a limousine but realizes it was a setup when he discovers that the bag is full of chocolate coins. It is revealed that Ben and Williams made a deal to lure Micky to Las Vegas so that Williams could capture him. Williams' men take Micky and Cole explains he's going to get in contact with a friend of his with the IRS about Micky's untaxed winnings. In exchange, Williams commits to allowing Ben to keep his winnings for that day, but later double-crosses him as he is leaving, taking the bag of chips at gunpoint. When Ben protests, Williams explains he needs retirement funds, whereas intelligent people like Ben will always find a way to succeed.\n\nBen's long-time friends (with whom he has reconciled) Miles and Cam also turn out to be quite good at card-counting while working with Choi and Kianna during Micky's capture and as such, the 6-person team make a lot of money despite Williams's robbery of Ben and Micky's chips. The film ends with Ben recounting the tale to the dazzled and dumbfounded scholarship director.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Ben Campbell\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Jill Taylor\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Micky Rosa\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Choi\n* [[Liza Lapira]] as Kianna\n* [[Jacob Pitts]] as Fisher\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Cole Williams\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Terry\n* [[Josh Gad]] as Miles\n* [[Sam Golzari]] as Cam\n* Helen Carey as Ellen Campbell\n* [[Jack Gilpin]] as Bob Phillips\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe filming of ''21'' began in March 2007. Principal filming of the [[Las Vegas]] scenes took place at the [[Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino]], the [[Red Rock Casino]], and the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Casino]] in Las Vegas. Filming also took place at Harvard Medical School, [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], in Cambridge, and the [[First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston|Christian Science Center]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. As Massachusetts Institute of Technology did not allow filming on campus, the MIT school and dorm interiors, the gymnasium and the alumni reception were all shot at [[Boston University]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 36% of 172 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 5.20/10.

A featurette included with the DVD completely and accurately describes the \"Hi-Lo\" system used by the MIT Blackjack Club and by Rosa's team in the film.\n\nThe writers of the film were told by the producers that MGM Studios would finance the film, though all \"MGM\" casinos (including one used by the real MIT Blackjack Team) are owned by [[MGM Resorts International]] and are no longer related to MGM Studios. As another DVD featurette reveals, the casinos (including MGM Resorts) saw the film as an attention-getter; people who saw it would be encouraged to go to Vegas and play. The film withheld critical strategy details (such as the conversion from the \"running count\" to a \"true count\"), and most beginning card counters underestimate the number and value of the mistakes they make.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n<!-- https://www.amazon.com/Music-Motion-Picture-21-Various/dp/B0013FNC7E -->\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = 21\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      = blank\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{film date|2008|3|18}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = 21 - Music from the Motion Picture\n | type        = Soundtrack\n | single1     = [[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" ([[Soulwax]] Remix)\n | single1date = February 19, 2008\n | single2     = [[Big Ideas (song)|Big Ideas]]\n | single2date = August 11, 2008\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1=[[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score={{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n}}\nThe soundtrack was released at the same time as the film.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1334045|pure_url=yes}} |title=21 [Original Soundtrack] |access-date=2008-04-02 |first=Marisa |last=Brown |work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n\n# [[The Rolling Stones]]\u2014\"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" (Remixed by [[Soulwax]]) (6:07)\n# [[MGMT]]\u2014\"[[Time to Pretend]]\" (Super Clean Version) (4:20)\n# [[LCD Soundsystem]]\u2014\"[[Big Ideas (song)|Big Ideas]]\" (5:41)\n# [[David Sardy|D.
