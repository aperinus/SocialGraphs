The film was directed by [[Christian Alvart]] and produced by Robert Kulzer, [[Jeremy Bolt]] and [[Paul W. S. Anderson]], the latter two through their [[Impact Pictures]] banner. Travis Milloy wrote the screenplay from a story by Milloy and Alvart. It stars [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]].\n\nFilming began in Berlin in August 2008. ''Pandorum'' was released on 25 September 2009 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=41441 |title=Pandorum |work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P |access-date=25 June 2009}}</ref> and on 2 October 2009 in the UK. The film's title is a fictional [[slang term]] for a form of psychosis called Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome (ODS) caused by [[outer space|deep space]] and triggered by emotional stress. This leads to severe [[paranoia]], [[delirium]], and nosebleeding.\n\nThe film was poorly received and a [[box office flop]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words.  This is currently 699 words. -->\nAfter [[human overpopulation]] depletes Earth's resources, humanity builds an [[interstellar ark]], the ''Elysium''. It carries 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to colonize Tanis, an [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]. The passengers are placed in [[sleeper ship|hypersleep]], and a rotating crew wake biennially to maintain the ship. Eight years into the mission, the ship receives a transmission from Earth: \"You're all that's left of us. Good luck, God bless, and godspeed.\"\n\nSome unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, awaken. Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial [[amnesia]] and possibly suffering from pandorum, a space-related disorder that causes psychosis when under emotional duress. The ship experiences power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, and they are unable to enter the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. While Payton stays behind to access the ship's computer, Bower uses the ventilation system to search for the reactor.\n\nBower first finds a disemboweled body and a wounded mechanic who tells him to escape \"them\". The noise summons a group of cannibalistic humanoids who appear to respond mostly to sound. He continues on and encounters an environmental scientist, Nadia, and a farmer, Manh, who does not speak English; both are hostile. He encourages them to band together, and the trio flees into a barricaded chamber, where they find a cook named Leland. Leland has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and resorting to cannibalism. Payton encounters Corporal Gallo, who claims the ship is lost in space and that he killed his team in self-defense.\n\nLeland feeds Bower's group and shows them mural drawings depicting what has happened: after Earth vanished following an unknown catastrophe, Gallo went insane, killed his crew, and induced pandorum in other passengers. After goading them into a violent and tribal culture, Gallo went back into hypersleep. Aided by accelerated evolution from an enzyme meant to help colonists adjust to life on Tanis, the descendants have turned into cannibalistic mutants. Leland gases the group, intending to eat them, but Bower convinces him the reactor must be stabilized.\n\nAs they search the ship for the reactor, Bower hopes to find his wife in an area for family in hypersleep but remembers that she died with everyone else on Earth when she refused to join him.  This revelation almost makes him give up and pushes him closer to insanity. After surviving an encounter with the cannibals, Bower's group finds the reactor. A crowd of mutants sleep under the reactor, and Bower crosses a walkway to reset it. The walkway collapses, and Bower climbs down into the mutant pit to reach a ladder. While Manh distracts the mutants, Bower restarts the reactor, killing many mutants.  Leland flees, and Manh is cornered by the mutant leader. Manh kills the leader but is killed by a mutant child he hesitates to slay.\n\nGallo becomes increasingly agitated, and Payton prepares a sedative. As they wrestle over the sedative, Gallo is revealed to be a hallucination as Payton IS Gallo. Gallo killed the real Payton long ago when he developed pandorum upon hearing Earth was gone. Because he went into Payton's pod, Gallo mistakenly believed himself to be Payton when he woke up with amnesia. Leland reaches the bridge, and Gallo kills him with the sedative. When Bower and Nadia confront him, Gallo opens the shutters on the bridge's windows, revealing that the ship is adrift in deep space with no stars visible. The shock pushes Bower further toward insanity. Taking advantage of Bower's mental state, Gallo argues they must maintain the violent society rather than revive civilization.\n\nNadia observes [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] ocean life through the windows, and the computer displays that 923 years have elapsed since the mission launched. The ship reached Tanis 800 years ago and landed itself in the ocean. Bower hallucinates a mutant attack and breaks a window. As water pours into the ship, Nadia and Bower climb into a hypersleep pod and eject it. The flood triggers an emergency protocol which ejects the remaining 1,211 pods to the surface, while Gallo and the remaining mutants drown. Bower and Nadia surface near a lush [[coastline]], and they witness the other pods ascend.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lieutenant Payton/Older Corporal Gallo \u2013 The Ship's Lieutenant and captain, later revealed to be Corporal Gallo\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Corporal Bower \u2013 The ship's Corporal and presumed head mechanical engineer\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Younger Corporal Gallo \u2013 A Corporal who went insane and killed his team, and believed himself to be Payton throughout most of the movie\n* [[Antje Traue]] as Nadia \u2013 the ship's environmentalist, who teams with Bower \n* [[Cung Le]] as Manh \u2013 an agricultural farmer, who teams with Bower and Nadia\n* [[Eddie Rouse]] as Leland \u2013 the mentally unstable cook who has resorted to cannibalism. \n* [[Andr\u00e9 Hennicke]] as hunter leader \u2013 leader of the Hunters\n* [[Norman Reedus]] as Shepard \u2013 a mechanic whom Bower encounters\n* [[Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring]] as Young Bower's Father\n* Niels-Bruno Schmidt as Insane Officer Eden\n\n== Production ==\nThe film began life as a [[Spec script|preliminary script]] written by Travis Milloy in the late 1990s. The story was originally set on a prison ship named ''Pandorum'', transporting thousands of Earth's deadliest prisoners to another planet; the cannibal hunters were the end result of the prisoners' degeneration. The characters played by [[Antje Traue]] and [[Cung Le]] were inmates. [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]'s character was a non-prisoner who did not trust anyone.\n\nBelieving no studio would want to make the film, Milloy thought about making it as a low-budget film shot on video in an abandoned paper mill with unknown actors. However, it attracted the attention of filmmaker [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] and [[Jeremy Bolt]], and they gave it to Impact Pictures, who green-lit it. The producers gave the script to director [[Christian Alvart]] who was struck by the similarities to his own screenplay titled ''No Where''. His dramatic story was about four astronauts aboard a settlers' ship who suffer from amnesia. Alvart decided that they should meld the two screenplays together, and the producers and Milloy agreed. With the ship now changed to a settler's ship, the use of the word \"Pandorum\" was changed from the name of the ship to a type of mental illness caused by sustained deep space travel.<ref name=\"fieldingonfilm1\">{{cite web|url=http://fieldingonfilm.com/wp/travis-milloy-writer-pandorum/ |title=Travis Milloy |publisher=Fielding on Film |date=9 December 2011 |access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Pandorum'' was announced in May 2008 with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster in lead roles. Christian Alvart was attached to direct the film, based on a script by Travis Milloy.
