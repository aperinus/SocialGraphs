The film stars [[Chris Makepeace]], [[Adam Baldwin]] (in his first film role), [[Matt Dillon]], [[Martin Mull]], and [[Ruth Gordon]].\n\nThe film was the debut of both Baldwin and an uncredited [[Jennifer Beals]] and was [[Joan Cusack]]'s first major film.\n\n==Plot==\nClifford Peache lives in an upscale [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] luxury hotel with his father, the hotel manager, and his grandmother. He is a new student at [[Lake View High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Lake View High School]], where he arrives each day in a hotel limousine.\n\nClifford quickly becomes a target of abuse from a gang of bullies, led by Melvin Moody. They regularly [[extortion|extort]] money from students, allegedly to protect them from another student, Ricky Linderman. According to school legend, Linderman has killed several people, including his own little brother. Not believing the stories, Clifford consults a teacher who claims that the only violence she's aware of from Ricky's past occurred when his nine-year-old brother died accidentally while playing alone with a gun. Ricky was the first to find the body.\n\nDespite the rumors, Clifford approaches Ricky and asks him to be his bodyguard. He refuses, but the boys become friends after Ricky saves him from a beating by Moody and his gang. He has emotional issues over the death of his brother, and although he's slow to trust Clifford, Ricky shows him a cherished motorcycle that he has been rebuilding. The friendship between them is strengthened as Clifford successfully helps Ricky search junkyards for a hard-to-find cylinder for the motorcycle's engine.\n\nThrough Clifford's friendship, Ricky comes out of his shell, proving to a few classmates that he's not the killer the school rumors allege. As Clifford, Ricky, and a few other friends from school eat lunch in [[Lincoln Park (Chicago)|Lincoln Park]], Moody and his gang approach. Moody has enlisted older bodybuilder Mike to be ''his'' bodyguard. He intimidates and physically abuses Ricky, who refuses to fight. Mike vandalizes his motorcycle before Moody pushes it into the lagoon. Ricky runs away, ashamed and angry.\n\nRicky later appears at Clifford's hotel, asking for money before leaving again. Clifford follows him and they argue before Ricky finally reveals that it was ''he'' who accidentally shot his brother while playing with their father's gun, and lied about finding his brother after the fact. As a result, he is overwhelmed with guilt and remorse, leaving Clifford behind as he takes a subway train into the night.\n\nMoody and Mike return to the park to continue bullying the other children. Ricky is also there retrieving his motorcycle from the lagoon. Moody notices, demanding the motorcycle, which Ricky silently refuses. Moody summons Mike, the bodybuilder intimidates him, they engage in a long fistfight, which Ricky ultimately wins.\n\nMoody and Clifford have split off into their own fistfight, when Moody tried to unfairly intervene in the fight between Ricky and Mike. Ricky urges Clifford to fight him while coaching him. Clifford initially fights incompetently, taunted by the overconfident bully, but finally lands several solid punches, the last of which knocks Moody down, breaking his nose. Moody sits on the ground, bleeding and whining, showing to be a coward. Ricky retrieves his motorcycle, and jokingly asks Clifford to be ''his'' bodyguard as they leave with their friends.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago with Lake View High School providing the setting for the film's fictional Fleer H.S. The hotel that Clifford lives in and which is managed by his father is the real life [[Ambassador East]] (now known as the Ambassador Hotel) at 1301 North State Parkway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as Ricky Linderman\n* [[Chris Makepeace]] as Clifford Peache\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Melvin Moody\n* Paul Quandt as Carson\n* Richard Bradley as Dubrow\n* Tim Reyna as Koontz\n* Dean R.
