It is a [[Technicolor]] [[adventure film]] adaptation of the classic 1844 novel ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[D'Artagnan]], an inexperienced [[Gascony|Gascon]] youth, travels to Paris to join the elite [[Musketeers of the Guard|King's Musketeers]]. On his way, he encounters a mysterious lady at a roadside inn. When he picks a fight with one of her escorts, she becomes suspicious and has him knocked unconscious. His letter of introduction from his father to de Treville, the commander of the Musketeers, is burned. When he awakens, he continues on to the city.\n\nIn Paris, he nevertheless presents himself to de Treville, who recognizes d'Artagnan's description of one of his assailants and makes him a cadet. The young Gascon spots the very man and in his haste to confront him, annoys three of the most skillful Musketeers: Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Each challenges him to a [[duel]]. Upon learning they are all at the appointed place to duel the same man, the swordsmen are amused. Before they can begin, however, they are interrupted by [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]'s guards, who try to arrest the Musketeers. D'Artagnan joins them in dispatching their foes. As a result, he is welcomed into their ranks.\n\nLater, d'Artagnan rescues (and falls in love with) Constance Bonacieux, a confidante of Queen Anne. The queen was given a matched set of twelve diamond studs by her husband, King Louis XIII. Foolishly, she gives them to her lover, the Duke of Buckingham, who is also the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Knowing of the queen's indiscretion, Richelieu sees a way to persuade the King to go to war with Britain. Richelieu arranges a [[Ball (dance)|ball]] and suggests to Louis that he have the Queen wear the diamonds.\n\nD'Artagnan and his three friends volunteer to travel to Britain to retrieve the jewels, but along the way, they are ambushed by Richelieu's men. One by one, the Musketeers are forced to stay behind to hold off their pursuers. Finally, only d'Artagnan and his servant Planchet reach the Duke. However, Richelieu had already sent the beautiful [[Milady de Winter|Countess de Winter]] to steal two of the studs. The Duke's jeweler is able to make replacements quickly and d'Artagnan races back to France. He arrives just in time to save the Queen from disgrace.\n\nAdmiring d'Artagnan's resourcefulness, Richelieu has Constance abducted in an attempt to enlist him in his service. He also assigns de Winter to help persuade the young man. D'Artagnan tries to learn where Constance is being held from the countess, but begins to fall under her spell instead. When Athos discovers that de Winter is actually his treacherous wife, he tells d'Artagnan, but is not believed. Then d'Artagnan sees a [[Human branding|brand]] on her shoulder, the mark of a common criminal, just as Athos had told him.\n\nFighting breaks out between Britain and France. The Queen frees Constance and sends her to Buckingham for safety. When the war goes against him, Richelieu gives de Winter a [[Full Powers|carte blanche]] and sends her to Britain to assassinate his foe. The Musketeers learn of the plot and send Planchet to warn the Duke. Athos confronts Milady and recovers the carte blanche as proof of Richelieu's treachery. De Winter is imprisoned by the Duke and placed in Constance's custody, but de Winter kills first her, then Buckingham.\n\nD'Artagnan and Athos return to France to bring de Winter to justice. De Treville warns the Musketeers that she is under Richelieu's protection.\n\nAramis recalls a conversation between her and Richelieu concerning the granting of a title and an estate near Lille. Caught at the estate, Athos's ancestral home, she begs for mercy, but finds none, even though her husband still loves her. Seeing no escape, she walks with dignity to her execution. The Musketeers are captured by Richelieu's men and returned to the royal court for judgment.\n\nAs Richelieu is about to have them sentenced to death, d'Artagnan produces the carte blanche. Richelieu is compelled to recommend to King Louis that he grant Aramis's wish to enter a monastery; Porthos, an introduction to a rich widow; Athos, the restoration of his title and lands; and d'Artagnan, a commission as a Musketeer and a mission to England, for \"the English lead too dull a life.\" The four depart triumphantly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Milady, Countess de Winter\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as [[D'Artagnan#In fiction|d'Artagnan]]\n* [[June Allyson]] as Constance Bonacieux\n* [[Van Heflin]] as [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]]\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]]\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Richelieu.
