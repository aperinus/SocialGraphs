It stars [[Matt Damon]], [[Claire Danes]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Roy Scheider]], [[Virginia Madsen]], and [[Teresa Wright]] in her final film role.\n\n==Plot==\nUnlike most of his fellow graduates of the [[University of Memphis]] [[Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law|Law School]], Rudy Baylor has no high-paying job lined up and has to apply for part-time positions while serving drinks at a Memphis bar. Desperate for a job, he meets the bar's owner, J. Lyman \"Bruiser\" Stone, who is also a ruthless but successful [[ambulance chasing|ambulance chaser]], who hires Rudy as an associate.\n\nTo get paid by Bruiser, associates pay their way by finding cases and working them up for trial. Rudy responds saying he has cases, including an [[insurance bad faith]] matter he boasts could be worth several million in damages. Interested in the case, Bruiser introduces Rudy to office [[paralegal]] Deck Shifflet, a former insurance adjuster of questionable ethics.\n\nWhile showing Rudy around the office Deck tells him he failed the [[bar exam]] six times. However, Bruiser employs him because he is resourceful, finds cases, is adept at gathering information, and because his prior work experience in the insurance industry means he knows how to go after them.\n\nThough Rudy has passed the Tennessee bar exam, he still has not been properly licensed to stand as an attorney.  He tries to do so after Bruiser fails to show up before Judge Harvey Hale to argue the case, but Hale scolds Rudy and tells him to get his license and then come back.  Defense attorney Leo F. Drummond offers to stand for Rudy as Rudy is sworn in before the judge.  Afterwards, Rudy discovers that the FBI has raided Stone's office, and Stone is nowhere to be found.\n\nUsing $5,500 that Bruiser had given each of them shortly before fleeing, Rudy and Deck pool their money together and set up a practice themselves. They file suit for middle-aged couple Dot and Buddy Black, whose 22-year-old son, Donny Ray, is dying of [[leukemia]], but could have been saved with a [[bone marrow transplant]], denied by their insurance carrier Great Benefit.\n\nRudy, having never argued a case before a judge and jury, now faces a group of experienced lawyers led by Drummond, from the prestigious firm Tinley Britt.    In chambers, Hale tells Rudy and Drummond that he is set to dismiss the case because he sees it as a \"lottery\" case that slows down the judicial process. However, Hale dies of a heart attack before he grants the petition for dismissal.  The more sympathetic Tyrone Kipler, a former civil rights attorney, is appointed to replace Hale.  Kipler, known by Deck as not liking Tinley Britt, immediately denies Great Benefit's petition for dismissal.  He instead agrees to fast-track the case in order to record Donny Ray Black's testimony before he dies.\n\nWhile seeking new clients, Rudy meets Kelly Riker, a [[domestic abuse|battered wife]] whose husband Cliff has beaten her numerous times, repeatedly putting her in the hospital. Rudy strikes up a friendship with her and persuades her to file for divorce.  This leads to a bloody confrontation with Cliff, resulting in Rudy nearly beating him to death. To keep Rudy from being implicated, Kelly tells Rudy to leave. She then kills Cliff herself, then tells the police it was [[self-defense]]. The district attorney declines to prosecute.\n\nDonny Ray dies days after giving a video [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] at his home. The case goes to trial, where Drummond gets the vital testimony of Rudy's key witness, Jackie Lemanczyk, stricken from the record as it is based on a [[Fruit of the poisonous tree|stolen manual used as evidence]]. Nevertheless, thanks to Rudy's determination and some clandestine reference help from now Caribbean-based fugitive Bruiser (with whom Deck is connected by intermediaries), Jackie's testimony and the Great Benefit Employee Manual are finally admitted into evidence, to Drummond's dismay.\n\nRudy skillfully [[cross-examination|cross-examines]] Great Benefit's [[CEO]], Wilfred Keeley, leading to the jury finding for Donny Ray's family for both actual damages and enormous punitive damages that Great Benefit cannot pay. It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck, with Keeley being arrested by the FBI and investigation proceedings into Great Benefit launched in multiple jurisdictions. The insurance company declares [[bankruptcy]], allowing it to avoid paying [[punitive damages]]. There is no payout for the grieving parents and no fee for Rudy.\n\nAs this success will create unrealistic expectations for future clients, Rudy decides to abandon his new practice and teach law. He and Kelly leave town together, heading out for an uncertain, but bright, future together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Rudy Baylor\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Deck Shifflet\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Kelly Riker\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Leo F.
