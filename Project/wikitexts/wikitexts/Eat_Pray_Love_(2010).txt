[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] co-wrote and directed the film, which was released in the United States on August 13, 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a financial success, grossing $204.6 million worldwide against a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Elizabeth Gilbert]] had everything a modern woman is supposed to dream of having \u2013 a husband, a house, a successful career \u2013 yet like so many others, she found herself lost, confused, and searching for what she really wanted in life.\n\nInexplicably unhappy and restless after eight years, Elizabeth doesn't want to be married anymore. Stephen doesn't understand why and doesn't accept the divorce easily. In the meantime she has a brief affair with David, a young actor.\n\nSo, finally newly divorced and at a crossroads, Gilbert steps out of her comfort zone, risking everything to change her life, embarking on a three point trip: Italy, India and Bali, a journey around the world that becomes a quest for self-discovery. \n \nIn her travels, she discovers the true pleasure of nourishment by eating in [[Italy]], enjoying pastas and gelato for four months. A new Swedish friend introduces her to a private Italian tutor, and they celebrate Thanksgiving together right before she departs for her next stop.\n\nLiz heads to an ashram where she experiences the power of prayer in [[India]]. In addition to mass prayer sessions, honoring their guru, she's assigned the chore of scrubbing floors. 'Texas Richard' keeps her on her toes as well as supporting her. When he's ready to move on, she's reassigned to greeting and orienting new arrivals.\n\nFeeling more centered, Liz moves on to [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. A year after first meeting him, she reintroduces herself to Ketut there. He gives her various tasks. While Liz is cycling she is run off the road, so is sent to Wayan in the village to help cure a bad gash in her leg. There she meets Brazilian Armenia Felipe. He convinces her to come back to the village that night to the Beach Shack for dancing.\n\nThere, Felipe approaches Liz, apologizing for almost killing her with his jeep. Felipe than tries to set her up with young Ian, but she doesn't want another idle fling. Felipe offers to give her a lift. Hours later he returns with a hangover cure and his number.\n\nThey hook up, and two weeks later Liz makes an appeal to her friends to donate to Wayan's future house, coming up with over 18,000. When Felipe proposes they spend a few days together in a remote spot, Liz panics, breaking up with him.\n\nDeciding her time there is over, Liz gets prepared to leave and stops to say farewell to Ketut. He encourages her to embrace and, not run from love. She acknowledges his advice and runs to the dock after Felipe where she confesses her feelings to him. Finally and unexpectedly, the inner peace and balance of true love comes to her.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Main Cast only; please do not clutter this cast list with minor characters -->\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as [[Elizabeth Gilbert|Elizabeth \"Liz\" Gilbert]]\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Felipe, a Brazilian businessman Gilbert falls in love with on her journey\n* [[James Franco]] as David, the man Gilbert has an intense relationship with while she is finalizing her divorce\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Richard, a [[Texas|Texan]] Liz befriends at an Indian [[ashram]]\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Delia Shiraz, Gilbert's best friend\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Steven, Gilbert's ex-husband\n* [[Sophie Thompson]] as Corella, a woman at the Indian ashram\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Andy Shiraz, Delia's husband\n* [[Christine Hakim]] as Wayan, Gilbert's best friend in Indonesia\n* [[Arlene Tur]] as Armenia \n* Hadi Subiyanto as Ketut Liyer, Gilbert's advisor in Indonesia\n* Gita Reddy as The Guru \n* [[Tuva Novotny]] as Sofi, Gilbert's Swedish best friend in Rome\n* [[Luca Argentero]] as Giovanni, Gilbert's Italian tutor and Sofi's love interest\n* Rushita Singh as Tulsi, Gilbert's friend at the ashram\n* [[Laksmi De-Neefe Suardana]] and Dewi De-Neefe Suardana as the owners of Indus restaurant.\n\n==Production==\n''Eat Pray Love'' began [[principal photography]] in August 2009.
