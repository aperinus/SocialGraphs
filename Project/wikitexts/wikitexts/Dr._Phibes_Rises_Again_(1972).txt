Heyward]], directed by [[Robert Fuest]], that stars [[Vincent Price]] and [[Robert Quarry]]. The film is a sequel to ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971). After seeking vengeance on the doctors whom he blamed for his wife's death in the first film, Phibes returns to seek eternal life in Egypt, while he pursues a centuries-old man who holds the ancient secrets that Phibes needs.\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events the previous film, Dr. Anton Phibes emerges from suspended animation when the [[Moon]] enters into an alignment with the planets which last occurred 2,000 years ago. Phibes prepares to take Victoria's body to the River of Life in [[Egypt]], which promises eternal life for him and Victoria. However, his ancient [[papyrus]] map to the river has been taken by Darius Biederbeck, a man who has lived for centuries through the regular use of a special elixir. After translating the papyrus, Biederbeck seeks the River of Life for himself and his lover Diana. Phibes and his silent assistant Vulnavia enter Biederbeck's house, kill his manservant, and reclaim the papyrus; they leave for [[Southampton]] to take a ship to Egypt. Biederbeck travels on the same ship with Diana and his assistant Ambrose. When Ambrose discovers Victoria's body stored in the hold, Phibes kills him. His body is stuffed in a giant bottle and thrown overboard. Inspector Trout discovers the corpse when the bottle washes ashore near Southampton. He and Superintendent Waverley question shipping agent Lombardo; upon hearing the descriptions of Vulnavia, an organ, and a clockwork band all being loaded aboard, they realize that Dr. Phibes is responsible.\n\nTrout and Waverley pursue Phibes to Egypt, catching up to Biederbeck's archaeological party near the mountain housing the hidden temple. Phibes, having set up residence inside the temple, hides Victoria's body in a secret compartment of an empty sarcophagus. He also finds the silver key that opens the gates to the River of Life. Phibes begins killing Biederbeck's men one by one. Biederbeck's team breaks into the temple and takes the sarcophagus and the key. Phibes uses a giant [[screw press]] to crush the man guarding the sarcophagus and a giant fan to simulate a windstorm, muffling his screams. The sarcophagus is retrieved.\n\nBiederbeck is unmoved by the murders and insists on continuing. He sends Diana and Hackett, the last remaining team member, back to England. Hackett is lured from his truck by Phibes' clockwork men impersonating British troops. When he returns to the truck, Diana is gone and he is sand-blasted to death. His truck crashes into Biederbeck's tent.\n\nRealizing Phibes must have taken Diana, Biederbeck confronts him. Phibes demands the key in exchange for Diana's life, claiming that when the gate is opened the water will drain out of Diana's trap and flow through the gate. Unable to free her from Phibes' water trap, Biederbeck surrenders the key. Phibes unlocks the gate to the River of Life, boats Victoria's coffin through it, and summons Vulnavia to join them on the other side. Biederbeck returns to the gate as it closes, pleading through the bars for Phibes to take him along. Phibes ignores him. Diana attempts to comfort Biederbeck, but he rapidly ages and dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Dr. Anton Phibes\n* [[Robert Quarry]] as Darius Biederbeck\n* [[Valli Kemp]] as Vulnavia\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as Inspecter Trout\n* [[Fiona Lewis]] as Diana Trowbridge\n* [[Hugh Griffith]] as Harry Ambrose\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as Captain\n* [[Beryl Reid]] as Miss Ambrose\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Lombardo\n* [[John Cater]] as Superintendent Waverley\n* [[Gerald Sim]] as Hackett\n* [[Lewis Fiander]] as Baker\n* [[John Thaw]] as Shavers\n* [[Keith Buckley (actor)|Keith Buckley]] as Stewart\n* [[Milton Reid]] as Cheng\n* [[John Comer]] as Ship's Officer\n* [[Caroline Munro]] as Victoria Regina Phibes\n}}\n\n==Production==\nProducer Heyward brought in [[Robert Blees]] to co-write the film.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=May 2022}} He felt Blees' sense of humor would serve a ''Phibes'' script well.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=May 2022}} According to Heyward, Blees and co-writer [[Robert Fuest]], who also directed the movie, had frequent disagreements about the script, forcing Heyward to mediate.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=May 2022}} However, Heyward believed that the writers' conflicts resulted in \"a very good script\" from which other writers could learn.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=May 2022}}\n\n[[American International Pictures]] (AIP) was grooming [[Robert Quarry]] as [[Vincent Price]]'s replacement.<ref name=heyward>{{cite book|title=Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Heroes |last=Weaver|first=Tom|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2000|isbn=9780786407552|pages=182\u2013183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8PK4jszVDoC&pg=RA1-PA182}}</ref> It was rumoured that the two actors did not get on well,<ref name=comedy>{{cite book|title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck|first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009|isbn=9780786453788|page=[https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall/page/n104 96]\u201398}}</ref> but Heyward said he did not notice any rift between them on the set.<ref name=heyward/> Quarry subsequently said that the studio had told him privately that he would replace Price when Price's contract ran out. According to Quarry, AIP had become disenchanted with Price, whose salary continued to rise despite his films' disappointing box office performance. In addition, Price was not particularly interested in working with the studio. AIP's plans were revealed to Price at a publicity event in England, when a publicist asked him how he felt about being replaced by Quarry. Quarry went on to say that while there was tension between him and Price on the set, it did not affect the production of the film. On the contrary, Quarry characterized the experience as \"extremely pleasant. Our sense of humor was the one bond that made working with him a pleasure.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cinefantastiqueonline.com/wordpress/dr-phibes-rises-again-1972/|title=Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972) \u2013 A Retrospective \u2013 Cinefantastique|access-date=15 October 2021|archive-date=15 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015210025/http://blog.cinefantastiqueonline.com/wordpress/dr-phibes-rises-again-1972/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDirector Robert Fuest, production designer [[Brian Eatwell]] (creator of the film's noted [[art deco]] settings), and composer John Gale all remained from ''The Abominable Dr. Phibes'' team.<ref name=comedy/> Price, [[Peter Jeffrey]], and [[John Cater]] reprised their roles from ''The Abominable Dr. Phibes''.
