It follows the adventures of the 15-year-old title character, played by [[Frankie Muniz]], who has to finish his chores, avoid getting grounded, and save the world by going [[undercover]] for the [[CIA]] as a [[James Bond]]\u2013type superspy. [[Hilary Duff]], [[Angie Harmon]], [[Keith David]], [[Cynthia Stevenson]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Darrell Hammond]], [[Ian McShane]], and [[Arnold Vosloo]] co-star. The movie was filmed in [[British Columbia]] and was released in the United States on March 14, 2003.\n\nThis film was the first major motion picture project for Duff apart from the [[The Lizzie McGuire Movie|film spinoff]] of her ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' TV series, as well as for Harmon, who had just come off a three-year stint as Assistant D.A. [[Abbie Carmichael]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Law & Order]]''. A [[Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London|sequel]] was released the following year. The film's executive producers include [[Madonna]] (whose then-production company Maverick Films acquired the script) and [[Jason Alexander]] (he was originally attached to direct before being replaced by [[Vic Armstrong]], who was ultimately replaced by Zwart).<ref>''Agent Cody Banks: Original MGM Motion Picture Soundtrack'' liner notes, Daniel Schweiger - [[Intrada Records]]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCody Banks, a 15-year-old bullied high school junior in Seattle, applies for a junior field ops position at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] after completing a training [[summer camp]]. Answering to his [[Agent handling|handler]] Agent Ronica Miles, Cody is called upon a mission to find information about a scientist named Dr. Albert Connors. Connors is employed by a [[SPECTRE]]-type organization named [[Eris (mythology)|ERIS]], led by Dr. Brinkman and his henchman Fran\u00e7ois Molay. As every [[CIA officer]] is known to Brinkman's organization, the CIA uses the unknown Banks, who is placed into the [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] of Dr. Connors' daughter Natalie, the [[William Joseph Donovan|William Donovan]] Institute.\n\nCody soon finds he has no social skill with girls and has no time to do this while balancing his chores and homework. The CIA decides to help by doing his chores and homework, trying to build his status, and going into the school to set him up with Natalie. The CIA also assemble a varying team of \"experts\" to train Cody into how to talk to girls, and issue him with a variety of gadgets with various functions.\n\nEventually, Cody befriends and falls in love with Natalie after rescuing her from falling off a ladder while putting up a banner, and he is invited to her 16th birthday party, where he goes undercover to her father's lab. Cody finds that Dr. Brinkman is planning to use [[nanobots]] \u2014 which can destroy any carbon or silicon-based substance \u2014 to destroy the world's defense systems so he can threaten anyone who opposes him. Since the nanobots are inactive in the cold, he plans to use ice cubes to distribute them. After Connors, Dr. Brinkman, and Fran\u00e7ois leave the lab, Cody tries to take one of the ice cubes, only for it to melt his shoe when in his possession.\n\nShortly after this, Cody fights male bullies, at the party. The fight makes the school newspaper, and the CIA suspends Cody from the mission. Meanwhile, with Connors refusing to aid him in his plans, Dr. Brinkman sends Fran\u00e7ois and some men to catch Natalie and bring her into his base in the Cascade Mountains. Meanwhile, disobeying orders to leave her out of it, Cody and Natalie eat ice cream at a restaurant. Cody attempts to explain things to Natalie but Fran\u00e7ois and a group of henchmen come over to their table, beat Cody up, and take Natalie. Cody is fully removed from the mission and is grounded for being missing for hours from his house.\n\nCody gets his brother Alex to make sure his parents do not find out that he has disappeared by giving him the $5,000 the CIA gave him. Knowing Natalie's location via a tracking device in a necklace he gave her as a birthday present, Cody breaks into the CIA weapons hold and steals a rocket powered snowboard and other devices to rescue Natalie. Cody gets a ride to the top of the mountain and snowboards to the factory where Natalie is held. However, he gets caught in a grove of trees as Ronica finds him using a [[SoloTrek XFV]]. After convincing her that they need to rescue Natalie, the pair infiltrate the laboratory and Cody rescues Natalie, also explaining the truth about why he went out with her.\n\nHowever, the trio are captured by Brinkman's men, although Cody quickly escapes. Natalie is held hostage by Dr. Brinkman, who puts an ice cube with a nanobot inside on her forehead to make her father program the system. Cody sets off a series of explosive charges he and Ronica planted throughout the base, and in the ensuing battle, Ronica fights off several of Dr. Brinkman's men, and Natalie kills Dr. Brinkman by placing the ice cube with the nanobots into his mouth, causing it to melt, and the nanobots to devour him from the inside out. Cody later defeats Fran\u00e7ois and sends him to the CIA using the SoloTrek XFV, before fleeing the exploding facility in a helicopter with Ronica, Natalie and Dr. Connors. The CIA welcomes Cody back to the team and congratulates him for completing the mission, and Cody decides to have Natalie earn her drivers license as a reward in which she succeeds in. Then they stop by at a beach cutting Ronica off when she calls. They then kiss starting a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Agent Cody Banks, a 15-year-old teenager who applies for the junior ops division\n* [[Hilary Duff]] as Natalie Connors, Cody\u2019s girlfriend, a 16-year-old teenager\n* [[Angie Harmon]] as Veronica \"Ronica\" Miles, Cody\u2019s supervisor\n* [[Keith David]] as CIA Director\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Dr. Brinkman, leader of the ERIS who wants to take over the world\n* [[Arnold Vosloo]] as Fran\u00e7ois Molay, Dr. Brinkman's [[right hand man]].\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Dr. Albert Connors, Natalie's father\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Mr. Banks, Cody's father\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Mrs. Banks, Cody's mother\n* [[Connor Widdows]] as Alex Banks, Cody's 10-year-old younger brother\n* [[Darrell Hammond]] as Earl\n* [[Peter New]] as Rosychuk\n* [[Noel Fisher]] as Fenster\n* [[Jessica Harmon]] as Natalie's friend\n\n==Production==\nFor his participation in the film, Frankie Muniz was paid $2 million, the highest paid to a child actor at that point since [[Macaulay Culkin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/markets-festivals/mgm-banks-on-harmon-1117867706/|title = MGM 'Banks' on Harmon|date = 29 May 2002}}</ref> ''Agent Cody Banks'' was developed as part of a broader strategy by MGM to make less-expensive films that can appeal to younger and niche audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/banks-2-suffers-helmer-withdrawl-1117885055/|title = 'Banks 2' suffers helmer withdrawl|date = 24 April 2003}}</ref> Both Muniz and Angie Harmon did most of their own stunts for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/money-in-the-banks-1117882049/|title = Money in the 'Banks'|date = 11 March 2003}}</ref> The film used [[Media.net]]\u2019s Edit System Dailies to transfer pre-digitized Avid system files from the post production facility Rainmaker in Vancouver directly to the pic\u2019s editing rooms in Los Angeles without having to wait for tapes to be delivered, allowing producers and executives  to receive their viewing copies half a day sooner than through the traditional method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/digital/news/media-net-spies-lion-s-agent-1117868968/|title=Media.net spies Lion's 'Agent'|date=25 June 2002}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally mixed reviews.

After Muniz\u2019s character stumbles through several inane questions, Duff\u2019s character barks, \u201cAre you in special ed?\u201d and stomps off.\n\n{{blockquote\n|quote = Regarding the references to special ed in the movie, we in no way meant to be insensitive to kids with special educational needs.
