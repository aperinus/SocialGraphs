[[Drew Goddard]] adapted the screenplay from the 2011 novel ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' by [[Andy Weir]]. The film depicts an astronaut's lone struggle to survive on [[Mars]] after being left behind and the efforts of [[NASA]] to rescue him and bring him home to [[Earth]]. It also stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Aksel Hennie]], [[Mackenzie Davis]], [[Donald Glover]], and [[Benedict Wong]].\n\nProduced through [[20th Century Fox]], the film is a coproduction of the United Kingdom and the United States. Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] began developing the film after Fox [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the novel in March 2013, which [[Drew Goddard]] adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard as director, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Wadi Rum]] in [[Jordan]] was also used for exterior filming.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2015, while the London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]] and [[4DX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-korea-box-office-martian-832932|title=South Korea Box Office: 'Martian' Dominates for Second Consecutive Week|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 19, 2015|access-date=October 19, 2015|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108120041/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-korea-box-office-martian-832932|url-status=live}}</ref> It received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th-highest-grossing film of 2015]].

A severe [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|dust storm]] threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The mission is scrubbed, but as the crew evacuates, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris. The [[telemetry]] from his [[Mars suit|suit's]] bio-monitor is damaged and Watney is erroneously presumed dead. With the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) on the verge of toppling, the remaining crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the ''Hermes''.\n\nWatney awakens after the storm, injured and with a low-oxygen warning. He returns to the crew's [[Mars habitat|surface habitat]] (\"Hab\") and [[self-surgery|treats his wound]]. As Watney recovers, he begins a video diary. Unable to communicate with Earth, his only chance of rescue is the next Mars mission. In four years, the Ares IV will land {{convert|3200|km|sp=us}} away at the [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli crater]]. Watney's immediate concern is food; being a [[botany|botanist]], he creates a garden inside the Hab using [[Martian soil]] fertilized with the crew's bio-waste and manufactures water from leftover rocket fuel. He then cultivates potatoes using whole potatoes reserved for a special Thanksgiving  meal. He also begins modifying the [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] for the journey to the Ares IV MAV site.\n\nOn Earth, [[NASA]] satellite planner Mindy Park, reviewing satellite images, notices moved equipment and realizes Watney must be alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders releases the news to the public, but decides not to tell the Ares III crew so that they will remain focused on their mission, over [[Flight controller#Flight director|flight director]] Mitch Henderson's strong objection.\n\n[[File:The route of 'The Martian' - from Chryse Planitia over Arabia Terra in the Martian highlands to Ares 4.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Mark Watney's route on Mars]]\n\nWatney takes the rover on a one-month journey to retrieve the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using ''Pathfinder''{{'}}s camera and motor, he establishes visual contact with NASA. NASA transmits a [[patch (computing)|software patch]] to link the rover with ''Pathfinder'', enabling communication by text. Sanders finally allows Henderson to inform Watney's crewmates.\n\nMars missions director Vincent Kapoor and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare a [[space probe]] to deliver enough food for Watney to survive until Ares IV's arrival. However, the Hab's airlock blows out, exposing the Hab to the harsh Martian environment; the potato plants all die. Now, to save time, Sanders orders the routine safety inspections be bypassed. His gamble fails, and the [[Atlas V]] rocket explodes soon after lift-off.\n\nThe [[China National Space Administration]] has developed a secret [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] rocket, the ''Taiyang Shen'' (lit. the \"Sun God\"). The decision is made to use the rocket to resupply Watney. However, JPL [[astrodynamicist]] Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: have the ''Taiyang Shen'' rendezvous with and resupply the ''Hermes'', which will then [[gravity assist|use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\"]] back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the ''Hermes'' crew. Henderson surreptitiously sends Purnell's proposal to the crew; they unanimously vote to implement it without seeking NASA approval, disabling NASA's remote controls and making the course change. Sanders is forced to support them publicly, but demands Henderson resign after the Ares III mission is complete.\n\nWatney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned. He must use it to rendezvous with the ''Hermes'', but it needs to be lightened considerably. After takeoff, when the MAV runs out of fuel, its velocity relative to the ''Hermes'' is not fast enough for Watney to be picked up. [[Commander]] Lewis quickly improvises, using an explosive to breach a forward airlock, resulting in air escaping violently and slowing down the ''Hermes''. It is still not enough; using a tethered [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]], Lewis is unable to reach Watney. Watney pierces his pressure suit, using the escaping air to propel himself to Lewis, ending his 543 sols alone on Mars.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 123\n| width2    = 135\n| footer    = Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain\n| image1    = Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt1      = Matt Damon\n| image2    = Jessica Chastain TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt2      = Jessica Chastain\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Dr. Mark Watney, a [[Botany|botanist]] and mechanical engineer who is part of the Ares III team.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as [[Commander (United States)#Naval|Commander]] Melissa Lewis, USN Submarine Warfare officer, oceanographer, geologist and the Ares III mission commander.\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Annie Montrose, the director of media relations for NASA.\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Theodore \"Teddy\" Sanders, the Administrator of NASA.\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as [[Major (United States)#Air Force|Major]] Rick Martinez, USAF officer, engineer, pilot of the Ares III mission for MAV.\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Mitch Henderson, the ''Hermes'' flight director\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Beth Johanssen, the Ares III's system operator.\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Dr. Chris Beck, flight surgeon for the Ares III mission.\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as Dr. Alex Vogel, a German national who is the navigator and chemist of Ares III.\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Mindy Park, a satellite planner in Mission Control.\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as Bruce Ng, director of [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Rich Purnell, a JPL astrodynamicist.\n* [[Chen Shu (actress)|Chen Shu]] as Zhu Tao ({{zh|c=\u6731\u6d9b|s=|t=}}), deputy chief scientist at the [[China National Space Administration]].\n* [[Eddy Ko]] as Guo Ming ({{zh|c=\u90ed\u660e|s=|t=}}), chief scientist at the China National Space Administration.\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Vincent Kapoor, NASA's Director of Mars Missions.<ref name=McNaryDave>{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | author-link=Dave McNary | url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/the-martian-white-washing-asian-american-ridley-scott-1201614155/ | title='The Martian' Slammed Over 'White-Washing' Asian-American Roles | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 8, 2015 | access-date=October 9, 2015 | archive-date=October 10, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010011104/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/the-martian-white-washing-asian-american-ridley-scott-1201614155/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=MTV>{{cite news | last=Wickman | first=Kase | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2344611/the-martian-whitewashing-andy-weir/ | title=One Person Who Doesn't Think 'The Martian' Was Whitewashed?
