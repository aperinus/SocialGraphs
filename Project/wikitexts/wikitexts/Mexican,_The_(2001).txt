Its plot is a mixture of different genres.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], a traffic light changes to red and there are offscreen sounds of an automobile collision.\n\nFive years later, Jerry Welbach has been working off a debt to imprisoned [[mob boss]] Arnold Margolese. After Jerry fouls up what was meant to be his final errand, Margolese's second-in-command, Bernie Nayman sends Jerry on a new final errand: retrieving an [[antique]] [[pistol]] for Margolese in [[Mexico]] from a man named Beck. Jerry's additional job for Margolese proves to be the last straw for Jerry's girlfriend Sam, who leaves him to move to [[Las Vegas]].\n\nArriving in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol with Beck, who explains the history of the legendary gun known as \"the Mexican\". When Beck is killed by a [[stray bullet]] from [[celebratory gunfire]], Jerry calls his colleague Ted and learns that Beck was Margolese's grandson. Just then, Jerry's car is stolen, with Beck's body and the pistol inside. Jerry recovers the car and the gun, shooting one of the thieves in the foot and burying the body.\n\nEn route to Las Vegas, a well-dressed hitman tries to abduct Sam, but is shot by another hitman who captures her instead. The second hitman introduces himself as Leroy, explaining that he was hired to hold Sam hostage to ensure Jerry delivers the pistol.\n\nSam explains to Leroy that Jerry became indebted to Margolese five years ago, after crashing into Margolese's car, while running a red light. This was the accident heard at the beginning of the film. The police discovered someone tied up in Margolese's trunk that he intended to kill. Margolese was sent to prison for five years and Jerry was forced to run errands for Margolese for that same period.\n\nBonding with Leroy, Sam deduces that he is gay and encourages him to pick up Frank, a traveling postal worker. The three of them reach Las Vegas, and Leroy and Frank spend the night together.\n\nIn Mexico, Jerry is briefly arrested after a police officer notices Beck's blood in his car. Confiscating the pistol, the officer elaborates on its cursed history and takes it to a pawn shop. Ted arrives and reveals that the infamous Leroy has been sent after Sam. Jerry overhears a call with Nayman ordering Ted to kill him. They recover the pistol from the pawn shop, but Jerry confronts Ted and leaves with the gun. Realizing he grabbed Ted's passport instead of his own, he returns to find Ted has already fled.\n\nIn Las Vegas, the well-dressed hitman murders the innocent Frank and returns for Sam, but is killed by a vengeful Leroy. Sam and Leroy fly to Mexico to meet Jerry, who crashes the car in an argument with Sam. Leroy finds the pistol and prepares to kill Jerry, but Jerry kills him first. He explains to a distraught Sam that Leroy was an imposter \u2013 his driver\u2019s license reveals he is actually Winston Baldry \u2013 and that Jerry once met the real Leroy: the well-dressed hitman. Jerry realizes that Margolese hired the real Leroy, but Nayman sent Baldry to intercept Sam and the pistol, allowing him to sell it himself and frame Jerry.\n\nSam and Jerry prepare to go their separate ways, but Sam remembers Baldry's advice to never give up when you truly love someone, and reconciles with Jerry. Soon after, Jerry gets kidnapped by the thieves who stole his car. He is brought to Margolese, newly released from prison, who explains the true story of the pistol: it was crafted by a gunsmith for his daughter's marriage to a nobleman's cruel son, but the daughter and the [[gunsmith]]'s assistant were truly in love. When the gun refused to fire for the nobleman's son, he killed the assistant, leading the daughter to take her own life with the pistol.\n\nMargolese reveals that his cellmate was the gunsmith's great-grandson; he was killed protecting Margolese, who swore to return the pistol to his cellmate's father. Jerry agrees to give him the pistol, but Nayman kidnaps Sam. A [[Mexican standoff]] ensues, until Sam kills Nayman with the pistol; the shot dislodges a ring from the gunbarrel, which Jerry uses to propose to Sam. The Mexican pistol is restored to the gunsmith's family, as Jerry and Sam drive off together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Samantha Barzel\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Jerry Welbach\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Winston Baldry\n* [[J.

Roberts also suggested the casting of [[James Gandolfini]],<ref>Louis B.

The critical consensus states that \"Though ''The Mexican'' makes a good attempt at originality, its ponderous length makes it wear out its welcome. Also, those looking forward to seeing Roberts and Pitt paired up may end up disappointed, as they are kept apart for most of the movie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mexican/ |title=The Mexican |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2013-08-19}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Mexican Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-mexican |access-date=September 20, 2022 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-09-20 |website=CinemaScore |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n\"The scenes between Roberts and Gandolfini make the film special. ...
