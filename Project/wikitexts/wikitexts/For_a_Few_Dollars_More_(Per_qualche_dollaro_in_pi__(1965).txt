They separately learn that a ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber, \"El Indio\", has been broken out of prison by his gang and all but one of his jailers slaughtered. While Indio is murdering the family of the man who had captured him, he is shown to carry a musical [[pocket watch]] taken from a woman who had shot herself, as he was raping her after he had murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory.\n\nIndio plans to rob the Bank of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], which has a disguised safe containing \"almost a million dollars.\" Manco arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, who had arrived earlier. He sees Mortimer deliberately insult the hunchback Wild, who is reconnoitering the bank. Manco confronts Mortimer and, after the two have studied each other, each ascertaining that the other will not back down, they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades Manco to join Indio's gang and \"get him between two fires.\" Manco achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio from prison despite Indio's suspicions.\n\nIndio sends Manco and three others to rob the bank in nearby [[Santa Cruz, Texas|Santa Cruz]]. Manco guns down the three bandits and sends a false telegraphic alarm to rouse the El Paso sheriff and his posse, who ride to Santa Cruz. The gang blasts the wall at the rear of the El Paso bank and steals the safe, but is unable to open it. Groggy is angry when Manco is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but Indio accepts Manco's version of events thanks to Mortimer having given Manco a convincing wound. The gang ride to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer, who had anticipated their destination, is waiting. Wild recognizes Mortimer, forcing a showdown that results in the hunchback's death, whereafter Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe without using explosives. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says the loot will be divided after a month.\n\nManco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught immediately afterward and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Later that night, Indio instructs his lieutenant, Ni\u00f1o, to use a knife belonging to Cuchillo to kill the man guarding Manco and Mortimer. Once Ni\u00f1o has freed the prisoners, Indio reveals that he knew they were bounty hunters all along, executes Cuchillo for supposedly betraying the gang, and orders the rest of his men after Manco and Mortimer, hoping they will all kill each other and he and Ni\u00f1o can split the money just between themselves. However, Groggy realizes the scheme and, after killing Ni\u00f1o, forces Indio to open the strongbox, which is found to be empty.\n\nEventually, after he and Manco kill the bandits, Mortimer calls out Indio while revealing his full name. Mortimer shoots Groggy as he runs for cover, but is disarmed by Indio, who plays the pocket watch while challenging the bounty hunter to regain his weapon and kill him when the music ends. As the music ends, the same tune begins from an identical pocket watch that Manco had pilfered from Mortimer. Manco gives his gunbelt and pistol to Mortimer, saying, \"Now we start.\" When the music ends, Mortimer shoots first, killing Indio.\n\nMortimer retrieves the watch from Indio's hand and Manco remarks on Mortimer's resemblance to the woman in the vignette photo inside the watch cover. Mortimer reveals that he is her brother (father in the Spanish dubbing) and, with his revenge complete, declines his share of the bounty and leaves. Manco tosses the bodies of Indio and his men into a wagon, finally adding Groggy's body after killing him, and rides off to collect the bounties on them all, briefly pausing to recover the stolen money from its hiding place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Clint Eastwood]] as Manco (a.k.a. the [[Man with No Name]])\n*[[Lee Van Cleef]] as Colonel Douglas Mortimer\n*[[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] as El Indio\n*[[Mario Brega]] as Ni\u00f1o\n*Mara Krupp as the hotel manager's wife\n*[[Luigi Pistilli]] as Groggy\n*[[Aldo Sambrell]] as Cuchillo\n*[[Klaus Kinski]] as Wild\n*[[Benito Stefanelli]] as Hughie\n*[[Panos Papadopulos|Panos Papadopoulos]] as Sancho Perez\n*[[Robert Camardiel]] as Tucumcari station clerk\n*[[Josef Egger]] as Old Prophet\t\n*[[Anto\u00f1ito Ruiz]] as Fernando\n*[[Tom\u00e1s Blanco (actor)|Tomas Blanco]] as Tucumcari sheriff\n*[[Lorenzo Robledo]] as Tomaso, Indio's traitor\n*[[Dante Maggio]] as Carpenter in cell with El Indio\n*[[Werner Abrolat]] as Slim, member of Indio's gang\n*[[Frank Bra\u00f1a]] as Blackie, Member of Indio's Gang\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Canalejas (actor)|Jos\u00e9 Canalejas]] as Chico, a member of Indio's gang\n*[[Rosemary Dexter]] as Mortimer's sister\n*[[Fernando Di Leo]] as a cigar-smoking card player\n*[[Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n (actor)|Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n]] as carpetbagger on train\n*[[Peter Lee Lawrence]] as Mortimer's brother-in-law\n*[[Sergio Leone]] as a whistling bounty hunter\n*[[Antonio Molino Rojo]] as Frisco, member of Indio's gang\n*[[Ricardo Palacios]] as Tucumcari saloon keeper\n*[[Carlo Simi]] as El Paso bank manager\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n<!-- For references, see talk page -->\nAfter the box-office success of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' in Italy, director [[Sergio Leone]] and his new producer, [[Alberto Grimaldi]], wanted to begin production of a sequel. Since Clint Eastwood was not ready to commit to a second film before he had seen the first, the filmmakers rushed an Italian-language print of ''Per un pugno di dollari'' to him - as a version in English did not yet exist. When the star arranged for a debut screening at CBS Production Center, though the audience there may not have understood Italian, they found its style and action convincing. Eastwood, therefore, agreed to the proposal. [[Charles Bronson]] was again approached for a starring role but he thought the sequel's script was too like the first film.<ref>Munn, p. 53.</ref> Instead, Lee Van Cleef accepted the role.
