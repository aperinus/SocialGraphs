J. Buckley]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Frances McDormand]]. The film explores an [[alternate history]] where non-avian [[dinosaur]]s [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|never became extinct]], following a young, timid ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' named Arlo, who meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a dangerous and mysterious landscape in order to return home, after being washed downriver by a rainstorm.\n\n[[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] and Sohn began developing on the film in 2009 when Peterson came up with the idea of exploring what dinosaurs represent in the present day. During its production, the team encountered various problems, which led to multiple story revisions, as well as changing directors and voice cast. To create a realistic background for the film, the team traveled to various American landscapes, which were later incorporated into the film. Arlo is designed to look distinct and relatable, in order to connect with audiences. In addition, the film pays homage to [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre in its themes, character representation, and western North American landscapes. [[Mychael Danna|Mychael]] and [[Jeff Danna]] composed the film's musical score, becoming the Pixar's first film to be scored by two composers.\n\n''The Good Dinosaur'' premiered on November 10, 2015, in [[Paris]], and was released in the United States on November 25, 2015 in the [[Disney Digital 3D]] and [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3D]] formats. The film garnered generally positive reviews from critics for its animation and themes, though its storytelling was not considered to be up to Pixar's standards. It grossed $332.2 million on a $175\u2013200 million budget, making it Pixar's first [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Current wordcount 653. -->\nIn an alternate history, [[Chicxulub impactor|the asteroid]] that would have caused the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago]] passes safely over Earth. Millions of years later, ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' corn farmers Henry and Ida have three children: Libby, Buck, and Arlo. While his successful siblings are allowed to \"make their mark\" (a mud-print on the family's corn silo), Arlo's timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a [[feral child|feral]] [[caveman|caveboy]], but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a [[flash flood]] before being killed by debris.\n\nWithout his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and blaming him for his father's death, chases him into a river, where both are swept downstream. Arlo is knocked unconscious by a rock, and awakens to find himself miles from home. As he tries to return, his leg is caught by a boulder. The next day, Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed. The caveboy appears with food, and leads Arlo to a berry tree. The caveboy then fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo, and impressing Forrest Woodbush, a nearby eccentric ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, and Arlo wins when he calls the boy \"Spot\". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are both dead.\n\nLater, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of [[Pterosaur|pterodactyls]], who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to eat Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' named Nash and Ramsey, who drive off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out. The group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers. Arlo and Spot lure the four rustler ''[[Velociraptors]]'' into the open, allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven off, Arlo joins the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in driving the cattle south. Later, he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance. Spot is intrigued, but Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, the pterodactyls return, attack, and carry Spot away. Arlo falls off a cliff and becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot in the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When a [[landslide]] causes a [[megatsunami|giant wave]], Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot, and the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as they go over the falls, and carries him to shore.\n\nAs they near Arlo's home, the two are approached by the caveman and his entire family, who show great interest in Spot. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join this new adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye. Arlo finally arrives home to his mother and siblings, and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Raymond_and_Ryan_Ochoa.JPG|thumb|308x308px|[[Raymond Ochoa]] (left) is the voice of Arlo]]<!--Do not add voice actors without official sources.-->\n<!--The species names must be consistent with the sources.-->\n* [[Raymond Ochoa]] as Arlo, a young ''[[Apatosaurus]]''<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\">{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Tracy|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-new-the-good-dinosaur-voice-cast-announced-20150612-story.html|title=New 'The Good Dinosaur' voice cast announced|date=June 12, 2015|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412224808/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-new-the-good-dinosaur-voice-cast-announced-20150612-story.html|archive-date=April 12, 2021|url-status=live|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title='The Good Dinosaur' Preview: How John Ford and Hayao Miyazaki Helped Inspire Pixar|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/the-good-dinosaur-preview-how-john-ford-and-hayao-miyazaki-helped-inspire-pixar/|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=June 18, 2015|date=June 17, 2015|archive-date=June 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235916/http://www.slashfilm.com/the-good-dinosaur-preview-how-john-ford-and-hayao-miyazaki-helped-inspire-pixar/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Jack McGraw as Young Arlo<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* Jack Bright as Spot, a 7-year-old human [[Caveman|caveboy]] who befriends Arlo<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Butch, a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' who runs a \"ranch\" filled with prehistoric \"longhorns\"<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/>\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Ramsey, Butch's daughter<ref name=\"TGD-Recast\"/><ref name=SlashFordMiyazaki/>\n* [[A.

Ream noted \"Nature can overcome anything, including a massive dinosaur.\" In order to achieve the needed realism, the film's team traveled to the [[Northwestern United States|American Northwest]], spending time in [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], [[Juntura, Oregon]], and southern [[Montana]]. Production designer [[Harley Jessup]] stated that the film \"has a fantastic variety of landscapes,\" which ranged \"from the Jackson Valley and the [[Teton Range|Tetons]] to the amazing geysers and waterfalls in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]],\" as the filmmakers \"studied the grasslands of Montana and the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]]\" and used them to incorporate into the film. To use the landscapes that they had experienced, the filmmakers used data from the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], and satellite images from [[Google Earth]]. The geographical data provided a foundation that the team then built on. According to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi, this gave Sohn \"the freedom to shoot in any direction he wanted to make the world feel big and real.\" In addition, ''The Good Dinosaur'' features three-dimensional, volumetric clouds. In previous Pixar films, clouds have been \"painted\" onto the sets. Light and photography director Sharon Calahan described the storm clouds \"are almost like a villain in the film\", and appeared \"in almost every scene.\" Calahan also noted \"These particular clouds can be rendered and we can light them, which we've never been able to properly do before.\"<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\" /><ref name=\"Lesnick\" />\n\nAccording to the filmmakers, the environments and landscapes in the film are not photo-realistic, they are just detailed in a way that advanced technology and style decisions allow. In terms of animating Arlo, animators Rob Thompson and Kevin O'Hara went to a zoo and shot video of elephants in motion.<ref name=\"Zakrzewski\">{{cite web|last=Zakrzewski|first=Cat|title=Pixar Studios Doubles Effects In Upcoming Film 'The Good Dinosaur'|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|website=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=October 9, 2015|date=October 9, 2015|archive-date=October 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010142636/http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/09/pixar-studios-doubles-effects-in-upcoming-film-the-good-dinosaur/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Lesnick\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|title=The Good Dinosaur Story: Behind the Scenes at Pixar|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|website=[[ComingSoon.net]]|access-date=October 9, 2015|date=October 8, 2015|archive-date=October 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010221555/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/620701-the-good-dinosaur-story#/slide/1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Zacuto\"/> A system where Arlo's head goes up and his chest goes down when his hips goes up, was therefore created.

Herbivores like Arlo and his family become farmers, and carnivores like the ''T. rex'' become ranchers. Because they are meant to be reminiscent of cowboys, when the ''T. rex'' run, their lower bodies mimic a galloping horse, while their upper bodies have the feel of a riding cowboy. To help inspire Butch's physical look and performance, the filmmakers looked at classic film cowboys such as characters portrayed by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jack Palance]].<ref name=Zacuto>{{cite web|last1=Zacuto|first1=Ben|title=EXCLUSIVE: GOOD DINO HD Stills and Fun Facts|url=http://www.everythingpixar.com/blog/exclusive-good-dino-hd-stills-and-fun-facts|website=EverythingPixar.com|access-date=November 18, 2015|date=November 16, 2015|archive-date=November 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119045206/http://www.everythingpixar.com/blog/exclusive-good-dino-hd-stills-and-fun-facts|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|The Good Dinosaur (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's score was composed by [[Mychael Danna]] and his brother, [[Jeff Danna|Jeff]],<ref name=VarietyPixarMold/> replacing [[Thomas Newman]], who was originally attached to score the film when it was set to be directed by Peterson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/05/20/mychael-danna-scoring-pixars-the-good-dinosaur/|title=Mychael Danna Scoring Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur'|website=Film Music Reporter|access-date=September 2, 2018|archive-date=September 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045802/http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/05/20/mychael-danna-scoring-pixars-the-good-dinosaur/|url-status=live}}</ref> It marks the first Pixar film to be scored by two composers.<ref name=VarietyPixarMold>{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title='Good Dinosaur' Score Breaks Pixar Mold|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/features/good-dinosaur-score-breaks-pixar-mold-1201632690/|access-date=November 12, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 3, 2015|archive-date=November 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113030241/http://variety.com/2015/film/features/good-dinosaur-score-breaks-pixar-mold-1201632690/|url-status=live}}</ref> Danna was approached by Sohn and Ream due to his score for ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'', which won an Academy Award.<ref name=VarietyPixarMold/> Having a lot of work, he invited his brother as a co-writer.<ref name=VarietyPixarMold/> [[Walt Disney Records]] released the soundtrack on November 20, 2015.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Walt Disney Records Releases \"The Good Dinosaur\" Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Score Composed By Mychael And Jeff Danna|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-releases-the-good-dinosaur-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-score-composed-by-mychael-and-jeff-danna-300182744.html|access-date=December 7, 2015|work=[[PR Newswire]]|date=November 20, 2015|location=Burbank, California|archive-date=November 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123113709/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-releases-the-good-dinosaur-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-score-composed-by-mychael-and-jeff-danna-300182744.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nPrior to the film's release on November 19, 2015, ''The Good Dinosaur: Dino Crossing'', a mobile [[Arcade game|arcade]]-style game, was released.
