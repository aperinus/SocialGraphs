They are combined with new footage of Martin and other actors similarly shot in black-and-white, with the result that the original dialogue and acting of the classic films become part of a completely different story.\n\nAmong the actors who appear from classic films are [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Alan Ladd]], [[Veronica Lake]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Ray Milland]], [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and [[Lana Turner]].\n\nThis was the last film for both costume designer [[Edith Head]]<ref>[https://edithhead.biz/html/bios.html Bios - Edith Head]</ref> and composer [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]].<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/miklos-rozsa-film-music-vol-2-dead-men-dont-wear-plaid-mw0001882300  Miklos Rozsa: Film Music, Vol. 2 (Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid) - AllMusic]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJuliet Forrest, daughter of scientist and cheesemaker John Forrest, asks [[private investigator]] Rigby Reardon to investigate her father's death. Searching Dr. Forrest's lab, Rigby finds two lists, \"Friends of Carlotta\" (FOC) and \"Enemies of Carlotta\" (EOC), and an autographed photo of singer Kitty Collins, whose name appears on one of the lists. A man shoots Rigby in the arm and takes the lists.\n\nRigby finds his way to Juliet's house, where she sucks out the bullet. Juliet also reveals a note to her father from her brother-in-law, Sam Hastings, which reveals that Dr. Forrest gave Sam a dollar bill \"for safekeeping\". When Juliet mentions her cleaning woman, Rigby goes berserk due to his father running off with his cleaning woman and Rigby's mother dying of a broken heart.\n\nRigby tracks down Sam and gets Dr. Forrest's dollar, which has FOC names scrawled on it \u2014 including Kitty and her boyfriend Swede Anderson. Rigby tracks down Kitty, asking her whether she is one of Carlotta's friends, which causes her to leave. He trails her to a restaurant, where she ditches her brooch into her soup. Rigby retrieves the brooch, which contains an EOC list on which all names are crossed out except Swede Anderson's. Rigby visits Swede, but Swede is killed. Rigby is shot in the same arm as before, causing Juliet to suck out another bullet. Rigby calls his mentor [[Philip Marlowe]] for assistance. Juliet hands over a key from Dr. Forrest's desk and a key to train station locker 1936. Marlowe picks up the EOC list to check for unsolved murders.\n\nRigby goes to the train station locker, which contains more lists. He finds F.X. Huberman, whose name was on one of the lists, throwing a party. She flirts with Rigby, then drugs his drink and steals the locker key. Juliet finds Rigby and informs him that Sam fell from a window reaching for a bottle of whiskey. She has an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' about a cruise ship called ''Immer Essen''; Sam Hastings was a passenger. When Marlowe calls, Rigby questions him about Walter Neff, the ship's owner, and learns that Neff cruises supermarkets for blondes.\n\nRigby disguises himself as a blonde and meets Neff. Rigby drugs him and finds a passenger manifest for the ''Immer Essen'' identical to an EOC list and articles about the ship's imprisoned captain, Cody Jarrett, who refuses to talk to anyone but his mother. Rigby dresses up as Jarrett's mother to visit Jarrett. He tries winning Jarrett's confidence, explaining that the FOC are after him. When that fails, Rigby impersonates a prisoner. Jarrett turns out to be a FOC and shoots Rigby.\n\nAfter sucking out a third bullet, Juliet leaves for the drugstore. Marlowe informs Rigby that Carlotta is an island off [[Peru]]. At a cafe, Rigby finds Kitty. Carlos, a policeman, warns Rigby of the locals, including Kitty's new boyfriend, Rice. The next day, one of the locals approaches Rigby and tries to bribe him into leaving the island.\n\nKitty drops by Rigby's room. Carlos is telling him Rice is in town with a group of Germans when the telephone line is cut. Kitty drugs Rigby's drink, and he wakes up to find Rice choking him. After a chase, Rigby shoots Rice and frisks the corpse, leading him to a hideout where he finds Juliet, her father still alive, and her butler, Field Marshal Wilfried von Kluck.\n\nDr. Forrest divulged a secret cheese mold to [[Nazi]]s posing as a humanitarian organization. Once he discovered their intention to use the mold's corrosive properties to destroy America with strategically placed cheese bombs, he assembled a list of Nazi agents, the FOC. Before he could divulge the names to the [[FBI]], he was abducted and his death faked to prevent a police investigation. The ''Immer Essen'', a cruise ship passing by, witnessed the mold tests, making all passengers EOC. Rigby is captured but Juliet gets Wilfried to say \"cleaning woman\", causing Rigby to go berserk, break his chains and overpower the Nazis. While Juliet gets Rodriguez, Wilfried pulls one of the switches, destroying [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], before being killed by Rigby. Rodriguez rounds up the other Nazis while Rigby shares a kiss with Juliet.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Rigby Reardon\n* [[Rachel Ward]] as Juliet Forrest\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. John Hay Forrest\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Carlos Rodriguez\n* Adrian Ricard as Mildred\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as Field Marshal Wilfried von Kluck \n* [[Francis X.

Bergman died just a few months after the film's debut.\n\n== Production ==\nIn mid-1980, comedian Steve Martin was having lunch with director Carl Reiner and screenwriter George Gipe.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\">{{cite news | title = ''Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'' Production Notes | publisher = [[Universal Pictures]] | year = 1982 }}</ref> They were also discussing a screenplay Martin had written when he suggested that they use a clip from an old film. From this suggestion came the idea of using all sorts of clips from films throughout the entire feature. The three men left the lunch thinking about how they could incorporate all of these old clips into a story. Reiner planned to work Martin into the old footage via over-the-shoulder shots so that it looked like the comedian was talking to these vintage actors, a strategy used effectively several times in the film. In one scene, trick photography makes it appear that Martin is in the same shot (not over-the-shoulder) as Cary Grant in a clip from ''Suspicion''. Reiner and Gipe spent countless hours looking through classic films for specific shots and \"listening for a line that was ambiguous enough but had enough meat in it to contribute a line\".<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> They took lines of dialogue from clips they wanted to use and juxtaposed them while also trying to write a story based on them. Reiner and Gipe finally worked out a story and then met with Martin, who contributed some funny material of his own.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\nMartin purposely chose not to watch any classic films noir because he \"didn't want to act like Humphrey Bogart \u2026 I didn't want to be influenced\".<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> The filmmakers enlisted some of the people that helped define many of the classic films from the 1940s. Costume designer Edith Head created over 20 suits for Martin in similar fashion to those worn by Cary Grant and James Stewart. Production designer [[John DeCuir]], a veteran with 40 years of experience, designed 85 sets for the ten-week shooting schedule. Director of photography Michael Chapman studied the angles and lighting popular among '40s film noir, conducting six months of research with [[Technicolor]] to try to match the old film clips with his new footage.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 7, 1981, with the bulk of the shooting done on soundstages of [[Culver Studios|Laird International Studios]] in Culver City and three exterior locations shot in and around [[Los Angeles]]. Martin usually acted opposite actors dressed exactly like the classic movie stars he was interacting with so that he had someone he could talk to and who would respond to his lines.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\nEdith Head died two weeks after finishing her work on this film.<ref name=\"Head\">{{cite web | url=https://edithhead.biz/html/bios.html | title=Bios }}</ref> A dedication honoring her appears before the film's end credits.\n\n==Films used==\nThe following films were used in ''Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid''.
