It is the second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Susan Hill]]'s 1983 [[The Woman in Black|novel of the same name]], which was previously [[The Woman in Black (1989 film)|filmed in 1989]]. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Janet McTeer]], [[Sophie Stuckey]], and [[Liz White (actress)|Liz White]]. The plot, set in early 20th-century [[England]], follows a young recently widowed lawyer who travels to a remote village where he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorising the locals.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]], [[Alliance Films]], [[Cross Creek Pictures]] and the [[UK Film Council]]. A film adaptation of Hill's novel was announced in 2009, with Goldman and Watkins attached to the project. During July 2010, Radcliffe was cast in the lead role of Arthur Kipps. The film was meant to be shot in [[3D film|3D]] before those plans were scrapped. [[Principal photography]] took place from September to December 2010 across England. Post-production lasted until June 2011. It attracted controversy after receiving a [[British Board of Film Classification#Current certificates|12A certificate]] from the [[British Board of Film Classification]], despite several cuts being made.\n\n''The Woman in Black'' premiered at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in [[London]] before being theatrically released in North America on 3 February 2012 by [[CBS Films]] and Alliance Films and in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2012 by [[Momentum Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2011/07/release-date-moves-searchlights-the-descendants-cbs-films-the-woman-in-black/|title=Release Date Moves: Searchlight's 'The Descendants', CBS Films' 'The Woman In Black'|author=The Deadline Team|work=Deadline|date=28 July 2011 }}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews with critics praising Radcliffe's performance, cinematography, direction, atmosphere and homages to Hammer's [[gothic horror|gothic horror films]], calling it a \"solid ghost story\".<ref name=\"RTCC\">{{cite web |last1=Ryan |first1=Tim |title=Critics Consensus: The Woman in Black is a Solid Ghost Story |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/Critics-Consensus-The-Woman-in-Black-is-a-Solid-Ghost-Story/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref> It was also commercially successful, grossing $130 million worldwide.\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Woman in Black: Angel of Death]]'', was released on 2 January 2015, without the involvement of Radcliffe, Watkins or Goldman.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the English village of Crythin Gifford in 1889, three young girls playing in their nursery notice a presence in the room; appearing entranced, they all jump to their deaths from the window.\n\nIn 1906, in [[Edwardian]] [[London]], lawyer Arthur Kipps's son Joseph is born, but his wife, Stella, dies after [[childbirth]]. Four years later, Arthur is instructed to visit Crythin Gifford to retrieve any documents left by Alice Drablow, the deceased owner of Eel Marsh House, an isolated and desolate estate on the marshland, as a prelude to the sale of the house. Upon arrival, Arthur finds the villagers cold and unwelcoming, though he finds sympathy in wealthy local landowner Samuel Daily.\n\nArthur meets Mr. Jerome, who tries to hurry him away from the village. Undeterred, he travels to Eel Marsh House. There, he is distracted by odd noises, a bolted nursery, and a spectral entity in black funerary garb. He hears sounds on the marshes of a carriage and a screaming child but sees nobody on the [[causeway]]. He tries to alert the village constable, who dismisses his concerns. Two children enter the station with their sister Victoria, who has ingested [[lye]], but she collapses in Arthur\u2019s arms and succumbs to death. The townspeople blame Arthur.\n\nThat night, Sam reveals that he and his wife, Elisabeth, lost their young son to drowning. Upon Arthur\u2019s return to Jerome\u2019s office, he discovers Jerome\u2019s young daughter barricaded in the basement. She angrily rebuffs his attempt to help her, as she, too, believes him to be responsible for Victoria\u2019s death. Sam attempts to take Arthur to Eel Marsh, but a gang of local men try to block them. Victoria's father tearfully accuses Arthur of seeing \"that woman\" at Eel Marsh.\n\nAt the house, Arthur uncovers correspondence between Alice and her sister Jennet Humfrye. Jennet demands to see her son Nathaniel whom the Drablows have formally adopted and barred her from contacting due to her being mentally unfit to look after him, which she denies. A death certificate reveals Nathaniel drowned in a carriage accident on the marsh. Jennet blames Alice for saving only herself and leaving Nathaniel to drown. Another death certificate shows that Jennet [[Suicide by hanging|hanged herself]] in the nursery, vowing never to forgive Alice. Arthur hears noises from the nursery, now unlocked. From the window, he sees a boy crawling out of the ground and walking towards the house. He goes outside and sees dead children in the marshes, Victoria among them. Inside, he sees an [[Ghost|apparition]] of a woman hanging herself.\n\nSam picks Arthur up the next morning. In town, Jerome's house catches fire with his daughter still inside. When Arthur attempts to save her, he sees the Woman in Black goading the girl into [[Self-immolation|burning herself]]. The townspeople blame Arthur for this death as well. Elisabeth tells Arthur that the Woman in Black is Jennet, who claims the village children by having them take their own lives in penance for her own son being taken from her. Arthur realizes that his son Joseph, who is coming to Crythin Gifford that night, is Jennet's next victim.\n\nIn an effort to lift the curse, Arthur and Sam find Nathaniel's body in the marsh and place it in his nursery, where Arthur lures Jennet to him. They bury Nathaniel with Jennet, though her voice echoes through the house that she will never forgive the wrongs she suffered. Assuming that Jennet has been pacified, Arthur meets Joseph and his nanny at the railway station. While bidding farewell to Sam, Arthur sees the Woman in Black lure Joseph onto the tracks. Attempting to save him, both he and Joseph are apparently killed by the oncoming train. The horrified Sam sees the ghosts of all the village children who were killed standing with the Woman in Black.\n\nOn the tracks, Arthur and Joseph are met by resurrected Stella in a peaceful and bright train station. The family is happily reunited as the Woman in Black looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Samuel \"Sam\" Daily, local landowner\n* [[Janet McTeer]] as Elisabeth Daily, Sam's wife\n* [[Liz White (actress)|Liz White]] as Jennet Humfrye\n* [[Roger Allam]] as Mr. Bentley, a senior partner of Arthur's firm\n* [[Tim McMullan]] as Jerome, the local [[solicitor]]\n* [[Jessica Raine]] as Joseph's nanny\n* Daniel Cerqueira as Keckwick, the carriage driver\n* [[Shaun Dooley]] as Fisher, village innkeeper\n* [[Mary Stockley]] as Mrs Fisher\n* [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]] as PC Collins, village constable\n* [[Sophie Stuckey]] as Stella Kipps, Arthur's wife\n* Misha Handley as Joseph Kipps, Arthur's son\n* Aoife Doherty as Lucy Jerome, Jerome's daughter\n* [[Victor McGuire]] as Gerald Hardy, a villager\n* Alexia Osborne as Victoria Hardy, Hardy's daughter\n* Alisa Khazanova as Alice Drablow\n* Ashley Foster as Nathaniel Drablow, the Woman in Black's son\n* Sidney Johnston as Nicholas Daily, Sam and Elisabeth's deceased son\n}}\n\nLiz White's character is never referred to as \"The Woman in Black\" inside the film or during the credits, where she is listed as \"Jennet\".\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was announced in 2009,<ref name=\"announce\"/> with [[Jane Goldman]] as [[screenwriter]]<ref name=\"announce\"/> and later [[James Watkins (director)|James Watkins]] as [[Film director|director]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerfilms.com/news/article/newsid/211/hammer-options-rights-to-famous-horror-novel--the-woman-in-black|title=Hammer Options Rights to Famous Horror Novel \"The Woman in Black\"|date=1 February 2010|access-date=2 October 2010|publisher=HammerFilms.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124212914/http://hammerfilms.com/news/article/newsid/211/hammer-options-rights-to-famous-horror-novel--the-woman-in-black|archive-date=24 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Daniel Radcliffe was announced as the actor playing the part of Arthur Kipps on 19 July 2010.<ref name=\"danrad\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10684914|title=Daniel Radcliffe to star in The Woman in Black|work=BBC News|date=19 July 2010|access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref> Two months later, it was announced that ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]'' co-star [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] would join Radcliffe along with [[Janet McTeer]] as Mr and Mrs Daily respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmshaft.com/two-more-actors-set-to-join-the-woman-in-black/|title=Two More Actors Set To Join 'The Woman in Black'|author=Martyn Conterio|publisher=FilmShaft.com|date=8 September 2010|access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref> Before filming, Radcliffe saw a psychologist so he could better understand his character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a277882/daniel-radcliffe-prepares-for-black-role.html|title=Daniel Radcliffe 'prepares for Black role'|date=20 September 2010|access-date=27 September 2010|author=Kristy Kelly|publisher=Daily Spy}}</ref> The part of Joseph Kipps was played by Misha Handley, who is Radcliffe's real life godson.<ref>{{cite episode|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bmllv|series=Chris Evan's Breakfast Show|title=Daniel Radcliffe joins us for breakfast|airdate=10 February 2012|station=BBC Radio 2}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was planned to be shot in 3D,<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/34390/3d-version-the-woman-black-coming-hammer|title=3D Version of the Woman in Black Coming from Hammer|date=4 November 2009|access-date=27 September 2010|publisher=DreadCentral.com}}</ref> but the idea was later scrapped.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slashfilm.com/2010/09/27/first-look-daniel-radcliffe-in-woman-in-black/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929060207/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/09/27/first-look-daniel-radcliffe-in-woman-in-black/|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2010|title=First Look: Daniel Radcliffe in 'Woman in Black'|author=Russ Fischer|publisher=/Film|date=27 September 2010|access-date=27 September 2010}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] officially started on 26 September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/hammerfilms/status/23256365458|title=Hammer's official Twitter account|date=7 September 2010|access-date=27 September 2010|publisher=Twitter|quote=via @RoomofRadcliffe @hammerfilms Have heard that The Woman in Black starts filming on Sept.26!
