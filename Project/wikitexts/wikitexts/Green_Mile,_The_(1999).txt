It stars [[Tom Hanks]] as a [[death row]] [[Prison officer|prison guard]] during the [[Great Depression]] who witnesses [[supernatural]] events following the arrival of an enigmatic convict ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]) at his facility. [[David Morse]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Doug Hutchison]] and [[James Cromwell]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film premiered on December 10, 1999, in the United States to positive reviews from critics, who praised Darabont's direction and writing, emotional weight, and performances (particularly for Hanks and Duncan), although its length received criticism. It was a commercial success, grossing $286 million from its $60 million budget, and was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Michael Clarke Duncan|Duncan]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\n\nAt a [[Louisiana]] assisted-living home in 1999, elderly retiree Paul Edgecomb becomes emotional while viewing the film ''[[Top Hat]]''. His companion Elaine becomes concerned, and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of events that he witnessed when he was an officer at Cold Mountain Penitentiary's death row, nicknamed \"The Green Mile\".\n\nIn 1935, Paul supervised Corrections Officers Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and Percy Wetmore, reporting to chief warden Hal Moores. Percy, the nephew of the state governor's wife, demonstrates a sadistic streak but flaunts his family connections to avoid being held accountable. He is particularly abusive towards prisoner Eduard \"Del\" Delacroix, breaking his fingers and killing his pet mouse, Mr. Jingles.\n\nPaul is introduced to John Coffey, a physically imposing but mild-mannered African-American man sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two young white girls. He joins two other condemned convicts on the block: Del, and Arlen Bitterbuck, the latter of whom is the first to be executed. Meanwhile, the officers are forced to deal with psychotic new inmate William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton, who frequently causes trouble by assaulting the officers and racially abusing John, forcing them to restrain him in the block's [[solitary confinement|padded cell]] on more than one occasion.\n\nAfter John heals Paul's severe [[urinary tract infection|bladder infection]] by touching him and later resurrecting Mr. Jingles, Paul gradually realizes that John possesses a supernatural ability to heal others. Suspecting that John is endowed with the power to perform divine miracles, Paul doubts whether he is truly guilty of his crimes.\n\nIn exchange for resigning from the penitentiary and accepting a job at an [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]], Percy is allowed to oversee Del's execution. At the execution, Percy deliberately avoids soaking the sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head, leading to Del suffering a gruesome and agonizing death, with John forced to feel Del's pain as well. Paul and the other officers bind and gag Percy as punishment for his actions and force him to spend a night in the padded cell. While Percy is locked away, they secretly smuggle John out of the prison so that he can use his powers to heal Warden Moores' wife Melinda of a brain tumor, saving her life. After Percy is released from the padded room, the others threaten to report him for his various acts of misconduct if his behavior continues.\n\nJohn uses his powers to \"release\" Melinda's affliction into Percy's brain, causing Percy to shoot Wild Bill to death. Soon after, John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wild Bill was the true culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned, releasing his supernatural energy into Paul in the process. Having suffered a mental breakdown, Percy is committed to the same insane asylum where he had planned to work after resigning from the prison.\n\nFinally, realizing that John is innocent, Paul is distraught at the thought of executing him and offers to let him go free. John tells Paul that the execution would be an act of mercy, as he views the world as a cruel place and is in constant pain from the suffering that people inflict upon each other. Mentioning that he has never seen a movie before, John watches ''Top Hat'' with the other officers as his last request. When executed later that night, he asks not to have a hood placed over his head as he is afraid of the dark. The officers all watch in sadness, visibly holding back tears as Coffey is executed. Back in the present, Paul tells Elaine that John's execution was the last that he and Brutal witnessed, as they both subsequently resigned from the prison and took jobs in the juvenile system.\n\nConcluding his story, Paul reveals that Del's mouse Mr. Jingles is still alive, having been blessed with a supernaturally long life thanks to John's healing touch. He also reveals that he is now 108 years old, having been 44 at the time of John's execution. While Elaine sees Paul's long life as another of John's miracles, Paul speculates that it may be a divine punishment and that he has been condemned to linger on Earth and outlive all of his loved ones for executing John. Paul is later shown attending Elaine's funeral and muses on how much longer he has left to live.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing scroll credits --->\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul Edgecomb, Warden Supervisor\n** [[Dabbs Greer]] as older Paul Edgecomb\n* [[David Morse]] as Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Jan Edgecomb\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as John Coffey\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Hal Moores\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Eduard \"Del\" Delacroix\n* [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Arlen Bitterbuck\n* [[Doug Hutchison]] as Percy Wetmore\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Dean Stanton\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Harry Terwillinger\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Melinda Moores\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Toot-Toot\n* [[Eve Brent]] as Elaine Connelly\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Klaus Detterick\n* [[Paula Malcomson]] as Marjorie Detterick\n* Evanne and Bailey Drucker as Kathe and Cora Detterick\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Bill Dodge\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Jack Van Hay\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Burt Hammersmith\n* [[Bill Gratton]] as Earl the Plumber\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDarabont adapted Stephen King's novel, ''The Green Mile'', into a screenplay in under eight weeks.<ref name=\"greenmilewarnerbros\">{{cite web | url=http://thegreenmile.warnerbros.com/cmp/cast-fr.html | title=About the Film | access-date=November 1, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108025126/http://thegreenmile.warnerbros.com/cmp/cast-fr.html | archive-date=November 8, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot at [[Warner Hollywood Studios]], [[West Hollywood, California]], and on location in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee]], [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]]<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Darabont, Frank (Director) | date=December 10, 1999 | title=The Green Mile | medium=Motion picture | location=United States | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}</ref> and the old [[Tennessee State Prison]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fedschun |first1=Travis |title=Nashville tornado struck Old Tennessee State Prison, where 'The Green Mile,' 'Walk the Line' were filmed |url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/nashville-tornado-old-tennessee-state-prison-the-green-mile-walk-the-line-filmed-severe-weather |access-date=4 March 2020 |work=Fox News |date=March 4, 2020}}</ref> The interior sets were custom built by production designer [[Terence Marsh]]. \"We tried to give our set a sense of space.
