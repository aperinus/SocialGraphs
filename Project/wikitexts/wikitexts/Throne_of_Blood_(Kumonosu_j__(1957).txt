The film transposes the plot of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'' from Medieval Scotland to feudal Japan, with stylistic elements drawn from [[Noh]] drama. The film stars [[Toshiro Mifune]] and [[Isuzu Yamada]] in the lead roles, modelled on the characters [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] and [[Lady Macbeth]].\n\nAs with the play, the film tells the story of a warrior who assassinates his sovereign at the urging of his ambitious wife. Kurosawa was a fan of the play and intended to make his own adaptation for several years, delaying it after learning of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1948). Among his changes was the ending, which required archers to fire arrows around Mifune. The film was shot around [[Mount Fuji]] and [[Izu Peninsula]].\n\nDespite the change in setting and language and numerous creative liberties, ''Throne of Blood'' is often considered one of the better [[Macbeth on screen|film adaptations of the play]], and has received much critical praise. The film won two [[Mainichi Film Awards]], including [[Mainichi Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Toshiro Mifune.\n\n==Plot==\nGenerals Miki and Washizu are [[samurai]] commanders and friends under Tsuzuki, a local lord who reigns in the castle of the Spider's Web Forest. After defeating the lord's enemies in battle, they return to his castle. On their way through the thick forest, they meet an evil spirit, who foretells their future, telling them that Washizu will be named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki will become commander of the first fortress that day. The spirit then foretells that Washizu eventually will become Lord of Spider's Web Castle, and finally Miki's son will become lord. When the two return to Tsuzuki's estate, he rewards them with exactly what the spirit had predicted. As Washizu discusses this with his wife Asaji, she manipulates him into causing the second part of the prophecy to come true by murdering Tsuzuki when he visits.\n\nAsaji gives drugged [[sake]] to Tsuzuki's guards, causing them to fall asleep and allowing Washizu to enter Tsuzuki's bedchamber and kill him in his sleep. When Washizu returns in shock at his deed, Asaji grabs the bloody spear and puts it in the hands of one of an unconscious guard, then cries out that an intruder has entered the castle; Washizu slays the guard before he has a chance to plead his innocence. Kunimaru, Tsuzuki's vengeful son, and Noriyasu, one of Tsuzuki's advisors,  both suspect Washizu's treachery and try to warn Miki, who refuses to believe what they are saying about his friend. Under Asaji's influence, Washizu is unsure of Miki's loyalty, but chooses Miki's son as his heir because he and Asaji have no child of their own. Washizu plans to tell Miki and his son about his decision at a grand banquet. However, Asaji tells him that she is pregnant, which leaves him with a quandary concerning his heir; now Miki and his son have to be eliminated.\n\nDuring the banquet, Washizu is agitated because Miki and his son have not shown up, and drinks sake copiously. He loses his self-control when Miki's ghost suddenly appears. In a delusional panic, he reveals what has happened to Miki by exclaiming that he is willing to slay Miki a second time, unsheathing his sword and slashing at the empty air near Miki's seat. Attempting to cover for him, Asaji tells the guests that he is drunk and has everyone retire for the evening. One of Washizu's men arrives carrying a bundle containing the severed head of Miki, and tells Washizu and Asaji that Miki's son escaped. Washizu kills the assassin.\n\nLater, Washizu's men are beginning to doubt and fear him, and rumors circulate that Miki's son Yoshiteru, Kunimaru, and Noriyasu have joined forces with their onetime rival Inui. Washizu is distraught by the news that his heir has been [[stillborn|born dead]]. In order to ascertain the outcome of the impending battle with his foes, he returns to the forest in search of the evil spirit. The spirit tells him that he will not be defeated in battle until \"the trees of the Spider's Web Forest rise against the castle\". Washizu believes this is impossible and becomes confident of his victory. Washizu tells his troops of the prophecy, and they share his confidence. The next morning, Washizu is awakened by the screams of Asaji's attendants. In her quarters, he finds Asaji in a semi-catatonic state, trying to wash clean an imaginary stain and stench of blood from her hands. Distracted by the sound of his troops, Washizu leaves to investigate. Washizu is told by a panicked soldier that the trees of Spider's Web Forest \"have risen to attack us\".\n\nWashizu tries to muster his troops, but they ignore his commands and begin firing arrows at him. several go through his armor and one pierces his neck, severely wounding him, and when he tells them that to kill their lord is treason, they accuse Washizu of the murder of his predecessor. With his enemies approaching the castle gates, he falls to his arrow wounds, trying to draw his sword as he dies. It is then revealed that the attacking force had used trees, cut from the forest during the night, to shield their advance onto the castle.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

When he learned that [[Orson Welles]] had released his own version of ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'' in 1948, Kurosawa decided to postpone his adaptation project for several years.{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=115}}\n\nKurosawa believed that Scotland and Japan in the [[Middle Ages]] shared social problems and that these had lessons for the present day. Moreover, ''Macbeth'' could serve as a [[cautionary tale]] complementing his 1952 film ''[[Ikiru]]''.{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=115}}\n\nIn May 1956, Kurosawa announced that he would be producing three [[Samurai cinema|samurai films]] for [[Toho]], ''Throne of Blood'', ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', and ''[[Yojimbo|Revenge]]'', each to be filmed from September 1956 to early 1957 by other directors.{{sfn|Hamano|2009|p=684}} [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], best known for directing the 1954 ''[[kaiju]]'' film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', was slated to direct ''Throne of Blood'', but Kurosawa ended up direct all three films himself.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=130}}\n\nThe film combines Shakespeare's play with the [[Noh]] style of drama.{{sfn|Prince|1991|p=142\u2013147}} Kurosawa was an admirer of Noh, which he preferred over [[Kabuki]]. In particular, he wished to incorporate Noh-style body movements and set design.{{sfn|McDonald|1994|p=125}} Noh also makes use of masks, and the evil spirit is seen, in different parts of the film, wearing faces reminiscent of these masks, starting with ''yaseonna'' (old lady).{{sfn|McDonald|1994|p=129}} Noh often stresses the Buddhist doctrine of [[impermanence]]. This is connected to Washizu being denied salvation, with the chorus singing that his ghost is still in the world.{{sfn|McDonald|1994|p=130}} Furthermore, the film score's use of flute and drum are drawn from Noh.{{sfn|Jin|2009|p=90}}\n\n===Writing===\nAll three of Kurosawa's frequent script collaborators participated for the first time: [[Hideo Oguni]], [[Shinobu Hashimoto]], and [[Ry\u016bz\u014d Kikushima]], each working with the director for their fourth time. Initially, the screenwriters wrote the script with the intention that it would be directed by Ishir\u014d Honda, but Toho insisted Kurosawa take the directing position after reading the script and realizing a large budget was required for the film.{{sfn|Hamano|2009|p=684}}\n\n===Set design===\n[[File:Making of Throne of Blood Scan10020-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cast and crew members on the open set of ''Throne of Blood'', published in the early September 1956 issue of ''[[Kinema Junpo]]''.

The forest scenes were a combination of actual Fuji forest and studio shots in Tokyo. Washizu's mansion was shot in the [[Izu Peninsula]].{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=123}}{{sfn|Richie|1964|p=}}\n\nIn Kurosawa's own words, {{blockquote|It was a very hard film to make. We decided that the main castle set had to be built on the slope of Mount Fuji, not because I wanted to show this mountain but because it has precisely the stunted landscape that I wanted. And it is usually foggy. I had decided that I wanted lots of fog for this film... Making the set was very difficult because we didn't have enough people and the location was so far from Tokyo. Fortunately, there was a  [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] base nearby, and they helped a great deal; also a whole MP battalion helped us out. We all worked very hard indeed, clearing the ground, building the set. Our labor on this steep fog-bound slope, I remember, absolutely exhausted us; we almost got sick.{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=123}}{{sfn|Richie|1964|p=}}}}\n\nProduction designer [[Yoshir\u014d Muraki]] said the crew opted to employ the color black in the set walls, and a lot of armor, to complement the mist and fog effects. This design was based on ancient scrolls depicting Japanese castles.{{sfn|Richie|1998|p=122}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe scene in which trees from the Spider's Web Forest approach the castle, was created by Toho's special effects department and directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]]. Originally, this scene was longer, but Kurosawa cut several shots of trees from the film because he was unimpressed by them.{{sfn|Takase|2003|p=303}}\n\nWashizu's death scene, in which his own archers turn upon him and shoot him with arrows, was in fact performed with real arrows, shot by knowledgeable and skilled archers. During filming, Mifune waved his arms, which was how the actor indicated his intended bodily direction. This was for his own safety in order to prevent the archers from accidentally hitting him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/1957-akira-kurosawas-throne-blood-876215 |title=1957: When Akira Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood' Was Ahead of Its Time |last=Blair |first=Gavin J. |date=March 16, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2016 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220115191215/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/1957-akira-kurosawas-throne-blood-876215/ |archive-date=January 15, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in Japan on January 15, 1957 by [[Toho]],{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=129}} and grossed {{\u00a5|198 million}}, making it the second-highest-grossing Japanese film of 1957,{{sfn|''Kinema Junpo''|2012|p=128}} after [[Shintoho]]'s ''Emperor Meiji and the Great Russo-Japanese War'', which grossed \u00a5542.91 million.{{sfn|''Kinema Junpo''|2012|p=138}} In the United States, the film was distributed by Brandon Films with English subtitles at 105 minutes and opened on November 22, 1961.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2002|pp=683-684}}{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=129}}\n\n''Throne of Blood'' was the first film to be screened at the 1st [[BFI London Film Festival]] on October 16, 1957.{{sfn|Kurosawa|1957|p=60}}{{sfn|Hamano|2009|pp=287\u2013294}} After the screening, [[Akira Kurosawa]] attended a party at film critic [[Dilys Powell]]'s house, and had dinner with actor [[Laurence Olivier]], and actress [[Vivien Leigh]] who were planning on playing [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] and [[Lady Macbeth]] in a [[Macbeth (unfinished film)#Stratford-upon-Avon stage production|film adaptation]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' that never materialized.
