The story concerns experiments in genetic engineering being done by a young scientific couple, who attempt to introduce human [[DNA]] into their work of [[RNA splicing|splicing]] animal genes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17693|title=New Hi-Res Images From 'Splice'|date=14 October 2009}}</ref>  [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Don Murphy]], and [[Joel Silver]] are the executive producers of this film. Theatrically released on June 4, 2010, the film received generally positive reviews from critics but grossed just $27 million against a $30 million production budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Genetic engineering|Genetic engineers]] Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work has yielded Fred and Ginger, two large [[vermiform]] creatures intended as mates for each other. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a revolutionary human-animal hybrid. Their employers Joan Chorot and William Barlow forbid this and order them to focus on identifying and extracting proteins from Fred and Ginger for drug production. Clive and Elsa, however, follow their plans in secret and develop a [[Viability selection|viable]] [[prepubescent]] female creature. Although they planned to terminate before the hybrid reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. The hybrid physically ages much faster than humans and mentally develops like a human child. After it spells out NERD with toys, seeing the acronym on Elsa's shirt, Elsa names it \"Dren\".\n\nClive\u2019s brother Gavin discovers Dren, but flees after she jumps on him. Elsa notices Dren has a fever and tries to cool her in an industrial-sized sink of cold water. Clive holds Dren underwater. This forces Dren to use her gills, revealing she is [[wikt:amphibious|amphibious]]. Elsa forms a [[nurturant parent model|motherly bond]] with Dren. Meanwhile, she and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a publicized presentation, Fred and Ginger fight and kill each other. Ginger [[Sequential hermaphroditism|had spontaneously changed into a male]], but Elsa and Clive failed to notice, as they were focused on Dren.\n\nThe couple moves Dren to the isolated farm where Elsa grew up. Dren reveals she has [[carnivorous]] tendencies and retractable wings and enters adolescence. She grows bored of confinement, but Elsa and Clive fear she might be discovered outside. Clive realizes the human DNA used to create Dren is not that of an anonymous donor, as Elsa told him, but Elsa's. After Dren kills her pet cat with the stinger on her tail, Elsa restrains her roughly and amputates the stinger, then uses it to synthesize a protein for their work. While alone with each other, Dren uses her pheromones to seduce Clive and has sex with him, much to Elsa's horror. Clive accuses her of not wanting a \"normal\" child prior to that because of her fear of losing control. They return to the farm to terminate Dren, but find her seemingly dying.\n\nWilliam Barlow discovers human DNA in Dren's protein samples and arrives at the barn with Gavin, who revealed the location. Elsa says Dren is dead and buried behind the barn. Dren, having spontaneously metamorphosed into a male, rises from the grave and attacks them, killing Barlow and Gavin before raping Elsa. Clive attacks Dren to help Elsa but is overpowered by Dren. Elsa attacks Dren to help Clive but hesitates, which allows Dren to kill Clive. Elsa then kills Dren.\n\nIn an office tower, Joan tells Elsa that Dren's body contained numerous [[biochemistry|biochemical]] compounds, for which the company is filing [[patents]]. She offers a visibly pregnant Elsa a large sum of money to go through with the pregnancy, which Elsa accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Clive Nicoli\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Elsa Kast\n* [[Delphine Chan\u00e9ac]] as Dren\n** Abigail Chu as Child Dren\n* Brandon McGibbon as Gavin Nicoli\n* Simona Maicanescu as Joan Chorot\n* [[David Hewlett]] as William Barlow\n\n== Production ==\n''Splice'' was written by director Vincenzo Natali and screenwriters Antoinette Terry Bryant and [[Doug Taylor (screenwriter)|Doug Taylor]].<ref name=creature>{{cite news | author=Borys Kit | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i45d15bffe64a1be87201ecc8469723cd | title=A creature feature for Polley, Brody | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=2007-10-04 | access-date=2008-01-08 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011072223/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i45d15bffe64a1be87201ecc8469723cd <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-10-11}}</ref> The script was originally meant to follow up Natali's ''[[Cube (1997 film)|Cube]]'' (1997), but the budget and restricted technology hindered the project.
