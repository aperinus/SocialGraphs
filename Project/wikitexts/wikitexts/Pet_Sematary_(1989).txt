Directed by [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]] and written by King, it stars [[Dale Midkiff]], [[Denise Crosby]], [[Blaze Berdahl]], [[Fred Gwynne]], and [[Miko Hughes]] as [[Gage Creed]]. The title is a [[sensational spelling]] of \"[[pet cemetery]]\".\n\nThe film was released on April 21, 1989, and grossed $89.5 million at the box office on a budget of $11.5 million. A sequel, ''[[Pet Sematary Two]]'', was released in 1992 and a [[Pet Sematary (2019 film)|second film adaptation]] was released in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\nThe Creed family\u2014Louis, Rachel, their children Ellie and [[Gage Creed|Gage]], and their pet cat Church\u2014move from [[Chicago]] to rural [[Ludlow, Maine]], after Louis accepts a job as a physician with the [[University of Maine]]. They befriend their neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated [[pet cemetery]] (misspelled \"sematary\") in the forest behind the Creeds' new home.\n\nLouis encounters Victor Pascow, a [[jogger]] who is mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet sematary before dying, calling Louis by name though they have never met. That night, Pascow appears to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \"sour\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt.\n\nDuring [[Thanksgiving]] while the family is gone, Church is run down on the highway. Realizing Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the pet sematary and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house. He now stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious toward Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he revived his pet dog, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her pet.\n\nSometime later, Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Mi\ua78ckmaq ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. He tells him the story of a local named Bill Baterman who buried his son Timmy in the Mi\ua78ckmaq ground after he was killed in [[World War II]]. Timmy returned as a malevolent zombie, terrifying the townsfolk. A group of men including Jud tried destroying Timmy by lighting the Baterman house on fire, only for Bill to perish with his son. Jud insists that the burial ground is evil and Louis must not bury his son there.\n\nAfter the funeral, Rachel and Ellie leave for Chicago while Louis remains home, ostensibly to take care of loose ends. Despite Pascow and Jud's warnings, Louis [[Exhumation|exhumes]] his son's body and buries him at the ritual site. In Chicago, Pascow appears to Ellie in a dream and warns her that Louis is about to do something terrible. Rachel is unnerved by her daughter's dream but can only reach Jud when she calls, who tells her Louis is not home. She decides to return to Maine, much to Jud's alarm.\n\nThat night, a reanimated Gage returns home and steals a [[scalpel]] from his father's bag. He taunts Jud before slashing his [[Achilles tendon]] and his mouth, before biting his throat, killing him. Rachel returns home and is lured into Jud's house by the voice and specter of her dead sister Zelda, only to discover that she is actually seeing Gage, holding a scalpel. In shock and disbelief, Rachel reaches down to hug her son and he kills her.\n\nWaking up from his sleep, Louis notices Gage's muddy footprints in the house and discovers his scalpel is missing. Receiving a phone call from Gage that he has \"played\" with Jud and Mommy, he fills three syringes with [[morphine]] and heads to Jud's house. Encountering Church, he kills the cat with an injection before entering the house. Gage taunts him further and Louis is startled by Rachel's body hanging from the attic before Gage attacks him.\n\nAfter a brief battle, Louis overpowers Gage and injects him with the morphine syringe. He then lights Jud's house on fire, leaving it to burn as he carries Rachel's body from the fire. Pascow appears and warns Louis not to \"make it worse\", but despite his warnings, Louis, grief-stricken to the point of insanity, believes that he waited too long when he buried Gage, but burying Rachel \"will work this time\" because she had died just hours ago.\n\nThat night, Rachel returns to Louis and the couple embrace. Rachel takes a large knife from the counter, before Louis screams.\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dale Midkiff]] as Louis Creed\n* [[Fred Gwynne]] as Jud Crandall\n** Matthew August Ferrell as Jud (child)\n** Richard Collier as Young Jud\n* [[Denise Crosby]] as Rachel Goldman-Creed\n** Elizabeth Ureneck as Rachel (child)\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as [[Gage Creed]]\n* [[Blaze Berdahl]] as Ellen \"Ellie\" Creed\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Victor Pascow\n* [[Michael Lombard]] as Irwin Goldman\n* [[Susan Blommaert]] as Missy Dandridge\n* [[Kavi Raz]] as Steve Masterton\n* [[Mary Louise Wilson]] as Dory Goldman\n* [[Andrew Hubatsek]] as Zelda Goldman\n* [[Stephen King]] as Minister\n* [[Chuck Courtney (actor)|Chuck Courtney]] as Bill Baterman\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film rights were sold to [[George A.
