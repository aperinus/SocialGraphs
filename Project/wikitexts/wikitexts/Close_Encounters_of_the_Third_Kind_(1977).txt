It tells the story of Roy Neary, an [[Everyman|everyday]] [[blue-collar worker]] in [[Indiana]], whose life changes after an encounter with a [[UFO]].\n\n''Close Encounters'' was a long-cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] for a science-fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by [[Paul Schrader]], [[John Hill (screenwriter)|John Hill]], [[David Giler]], [[Hal Barwood]], [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]], and [[Jerry Belson]], all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from [[Ufology|Ufologist]] [[J. Allen Hynek]]'s classification of [[close encounter]]s with extraterrestrials, in which the third kind denotes human observations of extraterrestrials or \"animate beings\". [[Douglas Trumbull]] served as the [[visual effects supervisor]], while [[Carlo Rambaldi]] designed the extraterrestrials.\n\nMade on a production budget of $19.4 million, ''Close Encounters'' was released in a limited number of cities on November 16{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=204}} and 23, 1977,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Ray|title=Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Making of Steven Spielberg's Classic Film|date=2007|publisher=Applause Theatre & Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-710-3|page=298}}<!--|access-date=September 3, 2015--></ref> before expanding into wide release the following month. It was a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over $300 million worldwide. The film received numerous awards and nominations at the [[50th Academy Awards]], [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]], the [[35th Golden Globe Awards]] and the [[5th Saturn Awards]], and has been widely acclaimed by the [[American Film Institute]].\n\nIn December 2007, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc-nfl\">{{cite press release | title = Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007 | publisher = [[Library of Congress]] | date = December 27, 2007 | url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-254.html | access-date = December 29, 2017 | archive-date = July 22, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722103847/http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-254.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-06-02|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004011540/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref> A ''Special Edition'' of the film, featuring both shortened and newly added scenes, was released theatrically in 1980.

The planes are in perfect condition, but without any occupants. An elderly witness nearby claims \"the sun came out at night, and sang to him.\" The researchers are similarly baffled to find the {{ship|SS|Cotopaxi}} in the middle of the [[Gobi Desert]], intact and completely empty. Near [[Indianapolis]], [[air traffic control]]lers watch two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with an unidentified flying object ([[UFO]]).\n\nAt a rural home, three-year-old Barry Guiler wakes to find his toys operating on their own. He starts to follow something outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him. Large-scale power outages begin rolling through the area, forcing electrician Roy Neary to investigate. While he gets his bearings, Roy experiences a close encounter with a UFO, and when it flies over his truck, it lightly burns the side of his face with its lights. The UFO takes off with three others in the sky, as Roy and three police cars give chase. The spacecraft fly off into the night sky but the metaphysical experience leaves Roy mesmerized. He becomes fascinated by UFOs to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie, and begins obsessing over subliminal images of a mountain-like shape, often making models of it. Jillian meanwhile also becomes obsessed, sketching the unique mountain image. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. She fights off violent attempts by the UFO and unseen beings to enter the home, but in the chaos, Barry is abducted.\n\nLacombe and Laughlin\u2014along with a group of [[United Nations]] experts\u2014continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in [[Dharamsala]], [[Northern India]] report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in [[cartography]], recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to [[Devils Tower]] near [[Moorcroft, Wyoming]]. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, Roy becomes increasingly erratic and causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her. When a news program about the train wreck near Devils Tower airs on television, Roy and Jillian see the same broadcast, recognizing the same mountain they have been seeing. They, along with other travelers experiencing the same visions, set out for Devils Tower in spite of the public warnings about nerve gas.\n\nWhile most of the travelers are apprehended by the Army, Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site just as UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs, that gradually appear by the dozens, by use of light and sound on a large electrical billboard. Following this, an enormous mothership lands at the site, releasing the missing World War II pilots and ''Cotopaxi'' sailors, as well as over a dozen other abductees from long-missing adults to children (and even a few animals), all from different eras and all of whom have strangely not aged since their abductions. Barry also returns and reunites with a relieved Jillian. The government officials decide to include Roy in a group of people whom they had selected to be potential visitors to the mothership, hastily preparing him.\n\nAs the extraterrestrials finally emerge from the mothership, they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the extraterrestrials pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses [[Kod\u00e1ly method#Hand signs|Curwen hand signs]] that correspond to the five-note extraterrestrial tonal phrase. The extraterrestrial replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Roy Neary, an [[lineman (technician)|electrical lineman]] in [[Indiana]] who encounters and forms an obsession with [[unidentified flying object]]s. [[Steve McQueen]] was Spielberg's first choice. Although McQueen was impressed with the script, he felt that he was not right for the role as he was unable to cry on cue.

Spielberg claimed the film would cost $2.7&nbsp;million to make in his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, although he revealed to producer Julia Philips that he knew the budget would have to be much higher; the final budget came to $19.4&nbsp;million.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=270\u2013279}} Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, \"If we knew it was going to cost that much, we wouldn't have [[greenlight]]ed it because we didn't have the money.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=270\u2013279}} Spielberg hired [[Joe Alves]], his collaborator on ''Jaws'', as [[production designer]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=280\u2013289}} In addition the [[1976 Atlantic hurricane season]] brought tropical storms to Alabama.

''Indecent Exposure'', p. 162. New York: [[HarperCollins]].</ref>\n\n[[Cinematographer]] [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] said that, during the shooting for the film, Spielberg got more ideas by watching films every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=260\u2013269}} Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on ''Jaws''. In her 1991 book ''[[You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again]]'', producer [[Julia Phillips]] wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a [[cocaine addiction]]. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a [[Perfectionist (personality type)|perfectionist]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=270\u2013279}}\n\n===Visual effects===\n[[File:Mother Ship Model - Close Encounters of the Third Kind.jpg|thumb|Visual effects miniature model on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]\n[[Douglas Trumbull]] was the [[visual effects supervisor]], while [[Carlo Rambaldi]] designed the extraterrestrials. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3&nbsp;million, could have been used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in [[motion control photography]]. The mothership was designed by [[Ralph McQuarrie]] and built by [[Greg Jein]]. The look of the ship was inspired by an [[oil refinery]] Spielberg saw at night in India.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=260\u2013269}} Instead of the metallic hardware look used in ''Star Wars'', the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, [[Dennis Muren]] (who had just finished working on ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'') put a small [[R2-D2]] model onto the underside of the mothership.<ref name=making/> The model of the mothership is now on display in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at [[Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles Airport]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia]].<ref name=making/>\n\n''Close Encounters'' was filmed [[anamorphic format|anamorphically]] and the visual effects sequences were shot on [[70 mm film]], which has greater resolution than the [[35 mm movie film|35 mm film]] used for the rest of the production, so that when the miniature effects were combined with full-sized elements through an [[optical printer]], the effects footage would still appear clear and sharp despite having lost a generation's worth of visual data. A test reel using [[computer-generated imagery]] was created for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive and ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.<ref name=making/>\n\nThe small extraterrestrials in the final scenes were played by fifty local six-year-old girls in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. That decision was requested by Spielberg because he felt \"girls move more gracefully than boys\".<ref name=making/> [[Puppetry]] was attempted for the extraterrestrials, but the idea failed. However, Rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict two of the extraterrestrials, the first being a [[marionette]] (for the tall extraterrestrial that is the first to be seen emerging from the mothership in what was originally a test shot but eventually used in the final film) and an articulated puppet for the extraterrestrial that communicates via hand signals near the end of the film.<ref name=making/>\n\n===Post-production===\n''Close Encounters'' is the first collaboration between film editor [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] and Spielberg. Their working relationship has continued for the rest of Spielberg's films. Spielberg said that no film he has ever made since has been as hard to edit as the last 25 minutes of ''Close Encounters'' and that he and Kahn went through thousands of feet of footage to find the right shots for the end sequence. When Kahn and Spielberg completed the first cut of the film, Spielberg was dissatisfied, feeling \"there wasn't enough wow-ness\".<ref name=making/> [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|Pick-ups]] were commissioned but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond could not participate due to other commitments.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=270\u2013279}} [[John A.

While it is a computer which makes the final musical conversation with the extraterrestrial guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devils Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century.\"<ref name=Barry>{{cite book | author= Charlene Engel | title = The Films of Steven Spielberg | year = 2002 | publisher = Scarecrow Press | chapter = Close Encounters of the Third Kind | pages = 45\u201356 | isbn = 0-8108-4182-7}}</ref> The film also evokes typical [[science fiction]] [[archetype]]s and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.<ref name=Barry/>\n\nOther critics found a variety of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower parallels [[Mount Sinai]], the extraterrestrials as God and Roy Neary as [[Moses]]. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between [[Elijah]] and Roy; Elijah was taken into a \"chariot of fire\", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]'s wife who looked back at [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] and turned into a pillar of salt.<ref name=Barry/> Spielberg explained, \"I wanted to make ''Close Encounters'' a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience.\"<ref name=pro/>\n\nRoy's wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devils Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him.<ref name=Barry/> Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an extraterrestrial intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story \"[[Dulcie and Decorum]]\" (1955) by [[Damon Knight]].\n\n''Close Encounters'' also studies the form of \"youth spiritual yearning\". Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as \"toys\" (although that was unscripted, with the child being drawn to smile by being shown toys offstage), serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown.<ref name=Barry/> Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance. \"If we can talk to extraterrestrials in ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''\", he said, \"why not with the [[Communism|Reds]] in the [[Cold War]]?\"<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Richard Schickel]] (interviewer) | title = Spielberg on Spielberg | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies]] |date = July 9, 2007}}</ref> Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devils Tower. Roy, Jillian and a third invitee, Larry Butler, climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas. Larry stops to rest, is gassed, and falls into a deep sleep.<ref name=Barry/>\n\nIn his interview with Spielberg on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', [[James Lipton]] suggested ''Close Encounters'' has another, more personal theme for Spielberg: \"Your father was a computer engineer; your mother was a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer\", suggesting that Roy Neary's boarding the spaceship is Spielberg's wish to be reunited with his parents. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made ''Close Encounters'' when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Neary leave his family and board the mothership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0506281 |title=Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg on \"War of the Worlds\" |publisher=Cinema Confidential |date=June 28, 2005 |access-date=January 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206185633/http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0506281 |archive-date=February 6, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nCommunication and language issues constitute additional themes as noted by [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] in ''[[Time Out New York]]'': \"Throughout the film, there are many scenes that anticipate themes Spielberg would explore in subsequent projects, but his execution of these ideas here is usually more interesting and subtle. In ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', for example, he devotes much time to illustrating the language barrier separating Africans from both their captors and their potential saviors. It's an essential plot point, but it's so belabored that the story gets bogged down. In ''CE3K'', the language problem is illustrated concisely by a quick scene in which an interpreter translates Spanish into English for Laughlin so he can turn around and translate it into French for Lacombe. Since Spielberg doesn't ram the language problem down our throats, the extraterrestrials' solution\u2014using music to communicate with humanity\u2014seems more elegant and natural.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=May 14, 1998|title=Third time around|journal=Time Out New York|pages=149}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Reception and box office===\nThe film was to be released in summer 1977 but was pushed back to November because of the various problems during production.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p= 280\u201389}}\n\n''Close Encounters'' premiered at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on November 16, 1977,<ref>{{AFI film|id=67160|title=Close Encounters of the Third Kind}}</ref> and played there and at the [[Cinerama Dome]] in Los Angeles, grossing $1,077,000 prior to its national release on December 14, when it opened in 270 theatres grossing $10,115,000 in a week with a per-screen average of $37,460.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|last= Pollock|first=Dale|title=Per-Screen 'Alien' B.O.
