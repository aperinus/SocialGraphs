Originally titled ''More Grease'', the film was produced by [[Allan Carr]] and [[Robert Stigwood]], and directed and choreographed by [[Patricia Birch]], who choreographed the original stage production and prior film. The plot returns to Rydell High School two years after the original film's [[graduation]], with a largely new cast, led by [[Maxwell Caulfield]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in her first starring role.\n\nThe film was released in United States theaters on June 11, 1982, and grossed $15 million against a production budget of $11 million, a far cry from its predecessor's $132 million domestic box office. Despite breakout roles for Pfeiffer, [[Adrian Zmed]], and [[Christopher McDonald]], the film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Despite this, ''Grease 2'' maintains a devoted fan base decades after its release.<ref name=\"TODAY2021\">{{cite web | title=Why 'Grease 2' scores with fans nearly 4 decades later | website=TODAY.com | date=2021-07-20 | url=https://www.today.com/popculture/grease-2-stars-maxwell-caulfield-lorna-luft-fans-today-t222079 | access-date=2022-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1961, two years after the events of [[Grease (film)|the prior film]], and the first day of school has arrived (\"Alma Mater\" from [[Grease (musical)|the original stage musical]]).  Principal McGee and her secretary Blanche react as  the students, including the [[street gang|ruffian]] T-Birds and Pink Ladies, arrive at high school (\"Back to School Again\"). The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone, who feels she has \"outgrown\" her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Johnny Nogerelli, the arrogant, [[chauvinistic]], and rather immature leader of the [[motorcycle]] riding T-Birds.\n\nA new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut British student Michael Carrington (a cousin of Sandy Olsson from [[Grease (film)|the previous film]]). He is introduced to the school atmosphere by Frenchy, who agreed to help show Michael around. Frenchy has returned to Rydell to obtain her diploma so she can start her own cosmetics company. Michael eventually meets Stephanie and quickly becomes smitten with her.\n\nAt the local [[bowling alley]], a game (\"Score Tonight\") turns sour from the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael falls in love with Stephanie. He asks her out, but learns she has a very specific vision of her ideal man (\"Cool Rider\"). After realizing how he can win her affection, Michael gets to work on acquiring a motorcycle. Michael begins to covertly accept payments from the T-Birds to write their [[term paper]]s and uses the cash to buy a motorcycle. Substitute teacher Mr. Stuart leads a rousing biology lesson (\"Reproduction\").\n\nA rival gang called the Cycle Lords (including members of the defunct Scorpions) led by Leo Balmudo, surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before the fight starts, a lone mysterious biker appears (actually Michael in disguise), defeats the enemy gang, and disappears into the night (\"Who's That Guy?\"). Stephanie is fascinated with the stranger. Meanwhile, T-Bird Louis attempts to trick his sweetheart, Pink Lady Sharon, into losing her virginity to him by taking her to a [[fallout shelter]] and faking a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] (\"Let's Do It for Our Country\").\n\nThe next evening while working at a gas station/garage, Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride, which includes a kiss. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies. Before Michael departs, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the school [[talent show]]. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens to fight the Cool Rider if he sees him with her again. The Pink Ladies walk away haughtily, but this has little effect on the T-Birds' self-confidence (\"Prowlin'\").\n\nAt school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help. Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor. Although still enchanted by the mysterious Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become romantically interested in him as well. Michael ponders over the continuing charade he puts on for Stephanie (\"Charades\").\n\nAt the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet up but are abruptly ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael on their respective motorcycles, with Stephanie, Sharon, Paulette, and Rhonda following in a car. They chase him to a construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie heartbroken and inconsolable. Johnny and his T-Birds remove the competing Preptones \u2013 [[preppie]] boys \u2013 by tying them to a shower pole in the boys' locker room and drenching them. During the Pink Ladies' performance in the talent show (\"Girl for All Seasons\"), Stephanie enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker (\"(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time\"). She is named winner of the contest and crowned the queen of the upcoming graduation [[luau]], with Johnny hailed as king for his performance of \"Prowlin'\" with his fellow T-Birds.\n\nThe school year ends with the luau (\"Rock-a-Hula Luau (Summer Is Coming)\"), during which the Cycle Lords appear and begin to disrupt the celebration. The Cool Rider reappears, defeats the Cycle Lords again, and reveals himself to be Michael. Initially shocked, Johnny gives him a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the gang, and Stephanie is delighted that she can now be with him. Michael and Stephanie share a passionate kiss, and he whispers that he loves her. All the couples pair off happily as the graduating class sings (\"We'll Be Together\"). The credits start rolling in [[yearbook]]-style, as in the original film (\"Back to School Again\").\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Principal cast ===\n\n'''Leads'''\n* [[Maxwell Caulfield]] as Michael Carrington, an English [[exchange student]] and [[Grease (film)#Protagonists|Sandy Olsson]]'s cousin.\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Stephanie Zinone, the leader of the Pink Ladies.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''The T-Birds'''\n* [[Adrian Zmed]] as Johnny Nogerelli, the leader of The T-Birds\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Goose McKenzie\n* [[Peter Frechette]] as Louis DiMucci\n* [[Leif Green]] as Davey Jaworski\n{{col-4}}\n'''The Pink Ladies'''\n* [[Maureen Teefy]] as Sharon Cooper\n* [[Lorna Luft]] as Paulette Rebchuck\n* Alison Price as Rhonda Ritter\n* [[Pamela Adlon|Pamela Segall]] as Dolores Rebchuck\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Reprising roles from ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' ===\n* [[Didi Conn]] as Frenchy\n* [[Eve Arden]] as Principal McGee (Arden's final theatrical role)\n* [[Sid Caesar]] as Coach Vince Calhoun\n* [[Dody Goodman]] as Secretary Blanche Hodel\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Eugene Felsnick\n* [[Dennis Cleveland Stewart|Dennis C.
