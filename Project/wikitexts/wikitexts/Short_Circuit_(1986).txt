S. Wilson]] and [[Brent Maddock]]. The film's plot centers upon an experimental military robot that is struck by lightning and gains a human-like intelligence, prompting it to escape its facility to learn more about the world. The film stars [[Ally Sheedy]], [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Fisher Stevens]], [[Austin Pendleton]] and [[G. W. Bailey]], with [[Tim Blaney]] as the voice of the robot named \"Number 5\". A [[sequel]], ''[[Short Circuit 2]]'', was released in 1988, directed by [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]], but did not do as well at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are required to be between 400-700 words. -->\nNOVA Laboratory robotics experts Newton Crosby and Ben Jabituya have developed several prototype robots called S.A.I.N.T. (Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport) for the U.S. military to use in [[Cold War]] operations, though Crosby and Ben would rather seek peaceful applications of the robots. After a live demonstration for the military, one of the units, S.A.I.N.T. Number 5, is struck by lightning arcing through the lab's power grid. This scrambles its programming and makes it [[Sentience|sentient]], resulting in its escape from the NOVA facility.\n\nThe robot finds itself in [[Astoria, Oregon]], and is found by Stephanie Speck, an animal caregiver, who mistakes him for an alien. She takes the robot into her home, where she provides him with \"input\" in the form of visual and verbal stimuli, allowing the robot to improve its language skills, and eventually names itself \"Number 5\". Stephanie continues to help the curious Number 5 robot learn about the world. She eventually discovers that Number 5 was built by NOVA, and contacts them about the lost robot. Nova's CEO, Dr. Howard Marner, orders Crosby and Ben to recover him, so they can disassemble and rebuild him. While waiting for NOVA to arrive, Number 5 learns about death when he accidentally crushes a grasshopper and concludes that if NOVA disassembles him, he will die, and escapes in Stephanie's food truck. However, NOVA uses a tracking device on Number 5 to corner him and deactivate the robot for return to the facility. During transport, Number 5 reactivates himself and removes the tracking device, and flees back to Stephanie.\n\nBecause of these unusual actions, Crosby tries to convince Howard that something has changed with Number 5's programming and that they should take care not to damage it in their recovery efforts so that he can examine them later. Howard instead sends their security chief Captain Skroeder and three other S.A.I.N.T. prototypes to recapture Number 5 by force, ignoring Crosby's concerns. Number 5 outwits the other robots and reprograms their personalities to act like [[The Three Stooges]], allowing him to escape. Number 5 \u201ccaptures\u201d Crosby, takes him back to Stephanie, and convinces Crosby of his sentience. They find that Skroeder has called in the [[United States Army]] to capture Number 5, and on his orders, restrain Crosby and Stephanie so he can open fire. To protect his friends, Number 5 leads the Army away and appears to be destroyed by a helicopter missile. Stephanie is devastated as Skroeder's men scrounge the remains of Number 5 as trophies, prompting Crosby to resign from NOVA and drive away with Stephanie in the NOVA van. Howard is dismayed over the loss of his research and dismisses Skroeder for insubordination.\n\nCrosby and Stephanie are surprised to discover that Number 5 had hidden under the van, having assembled a decoy of himself from spare parts to mislead the military. Crosby decides to take Number 5 to a secluded ranch in Montana, where there will be much \"input\" for the robot, and Stephanie agrees to come with them. As they drive off, Number 5 asserts that his name should now be \"Johnny 5\" based on the El DeBarge song \"[[Who's Johnny]]\" which had been playing on the van's radio.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tim Blaney]] as Number 5 later nicknamed \"Johnny 5\" (voice)\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Stephanie Speck, who befriends Number 5\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Newton Crosby, Ph.D., the designer of the prototypes\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Ben Jabituya, Crosby's assistant\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Dr. Howard Marner, President of Nova Robotics\n* [[G.

Studying other films with a prominent robot cast (like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series) for inspiration, they decided to question human reactions to a 'living' robot, on the premise that no one would initially believe its sentience.\n\nAccording to the commentary in the DVD, Number 5 was the most expensive part of the film, requiring several different versions to be made for different sequences. Almost everything else in the film was relatively inexpensive, allowing them to allocate as much money as they needed for the robot character. Number 5 was designed by [[Syd Mead]], the \"visual futurist\" famous for his work on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Tron]]''.\n\nMead's design was greatly influenced by the sketches of Eric Allard, the Robotics Supervisor credited for \"realizing\" the robots. John Badham named Eric \"the most valuable player\" on the film.\n\nMost of the arm movements of Number 5 were controlled by a \"telemetry suit\", carried on the [[puppeteer]]'s upper torso. Each joint in the suit had a separate sensor, allowing the puppeteer's arm and hand movements to be transferred directly to the machine. He was also voiced in real-time by his puppeteer, the director believing that it provided for a more realistic interaction between the robot and the other actors than putting in his voice in post-production, although a few of his lines were re-dubbed later.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nDuring Stephanie's impromptu news interview, director John Badham makes a cameo appearance as the news cameraman.\n\nThe sequence in the film depicting Number 5 watching the movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (and imitating [[John Travolta]]'s dance moves) is an [[in-joke]]: ''Saturday Night Fever'' and ''Short Circuit'' were both directed by John Badham.\n\n[[Fisher Stevens]] said that when he was originally hired to play Ben Jabituya, the character was not intended to be Indian. Stevens was fired and replaced by [[Bronson Pinchot]] at one point, but then Pinchot left to do the sitcom ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'', and Stevens was rehired.<ref>{{cite news|last= Rabin|first= Nathan|author-link= Nathan Rabin|title= Fisher Stevens|work= A.V.

And also the two leading roles were cast with really talented, attractive people who were not right for the parts. [The] script was just 'heartbreakingly' beautiful to read. And now it's a nice little slightly bland kids' movie. Nothing exactly wrong with it. Those two people who are in the leads are good, very likable, easy-to-work-with people, and have done some good work; they just weren't those people that were written in the script. And I said to John when it was about to open, 'Why did you cast them?' And he said, 'That was what the studio insisted on'. And it sort of ended the discussion. I said, 'Okay'. The film kind of works, but again, it was going to have been quite a beautiful film\".{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to Pendleton, the role Steve Guttenberg ended up playing \"was a person who could not relate to other human beings, so he poured all that into the creation of the robot. Well, Steve, he's a lovely guy, and I think he's talented... He had a wonderful kind of charisma. Very easy, but utterly social. He's just so very engaging and open with people. He's wonderful to be on a movie with... [But] he does not bring onscreen with him the problem that the character in that movie has... The perfect person for the role, 20 years earlier, would have been [[Dustin Hoffman]]. That thing that Dustin brought to ''[[The Graduate (film)|The Graduate]]'' that a more affable actor would not have...
