Joe: The Movie''''' (also known as '''''Action Force: The Movie''''' in the UK) is a 1987 American [[direct-to-video]] animated [[military science fiction]] film produced as a sequel to the animated series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', based on the original [[Hasbro]] [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero|toyline]].<ref>{{cite news|title=G.I. Joe: The Movie (Blu-ray)|work=DVD Talk|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/42677/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero-the-movie/|access-date=August 14, 2010}}</ref> It was produced by [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]] and [[Marvel Productions]] and was animated in [[Japan]] by [[Toei Animation|Toei Animation Co., Ltd.]]\n\nCreated at the height of the [[G.I. Joe]] craze in the 1980s, ''G.I. Joe: The Movie'' was intended as a theatrical release to be closely followed by ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. However, the G.I. Joe film encountered unexpected production delays which allowed the ''Transformers'' feature to be released first. Due to the poor box office performances of ''The Transformers: The Movie'' and ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]'', ''G.I. Joe: The Movie'' was instead released direct-to-video as well as aired on television in syndication, first in feature-length format{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later split into a five-part miniseries format as part of the series' syndication package.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile [[Cobra Commander]] and [[Serpentor]] blame each other's stewardship of Cobra as the root cause of the organization's failures, Pythona, a woman from the secret civilization Cobra-La, infiltrates the Terror Drome.<ref>{{Citation|title=GI Joe Movie 1987: Serpentor Assassination Attempt|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFak_Yqw5Es |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/RFak_Yqw5Es |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2021-02-28}}{{cbignore}}</ref> While there, she reveals to Serpentor that Cobra-La was responsible for inspiring Doctor Mindbender to create Serpentor through dream manipulation. At her urging, Serpentor plans to capture G.I. Joe's latest weapon, the Broadcast Energy Transmitter (BET).\n\nCobra assaults the Joes as they test the BET in the Himalayas. The Joes use the BET to activate their automated weapons systems. Serpentor is captured and Cobra Commander orders a retreat. Cobra Commander leads his troops into Cobra-La.\n\nAs the Joes celebrate their victory, a new group of rookie Joes are brought onto the team, including the allegedly clumsy [[kunoichi]] [[Jinx (G.I. Joe)|Jinx]], military police officer [[Law & Order (G.I. Joe)|Law and his dog Order]], former basketball player [[List of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero characters (A-C)#Big Lob|Big Lob]], [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] specialist [[Tunnel Rat (G.I. Joe)|Tunnel Rat]], undercover officer [[Chuckles (G.I. Joe)|Chuckles]], and Duke's reckless half-brother, [[Falcon (G.I. Joe)|Lt. Falcon]], a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]].\n\nIn Cobra-La, the Joe forces are ambushed and detained within the Lovecraftian living environment. The Cobra soldiers are met by the civilization's leader Golobulus, who has Pythona and his other henchman, Nemesis Enforcer, arrest Cobra Commander. While there, Cobra learns about their history: 40,000 years ago, Cobra-La was an ancient civilization that ruled Earth. However, the Ice Age, the evolution of humans and their development of scientific technology resulted in Cobra-La's survivors being forced into caverns within the [[Himalayas]]. Cobra-La rebuilt their society in secret as centuries passed. Golobulus vowed to destroy humanity so that his people could reclaim the earth. He eventually discovered a nobleman who was working on biological weapons. The nobleman later became Cobra Commander, charged with conquering the world for Cobra-La. However, Cobra Commander's repeated failures caused Golobulus to use a Psychic Motivator on [[Doctor Mindbender]] to create Serpentor.\n\nMeanwhile, a disguised Zarana uses Falcon to infiltrate Serpentor's holding cell. For abandoning his training, Falcon is put on guard duty by his older half-brother Duke. After Falcon abandons his post to flirt with Jinx, the Dreadnoks and Nemesis Enforcer free Serpentor, injuring [[Alpine (G.I. Joe)|Alpine]], [[Bazooka (G.I. Joe)|Bazooka]] and [[Gung-Ho (G.I. Joe)|Gung-Ho]] in the process. [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]] scolds Falcon for abandoning his post and confines him to his quarters until [[court-martial]].\n\nIn Cobra-La, Cobra Commander is tried and Golobulus reveals his plans to launch spore pods, filled with mutative spores into space and use the BET to hatch them thus dooming humanity. He punishes Cobra Commander for his repeated failures following his trial by exposing him to the spores,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trial of Cobra Commander - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT_KSx3hRCc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/nT_KSx3hRCc |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|access-date=2021-02-21|website=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> which transforms Cobra Commander into a snake.<ref>{{Cite web|title=G.I.

Slaughter (G.I. Joe)|Sgt. Slaughter]] and his \"Renegades\" consisting of ex-[[Viper (G.I. Joe)|Viper]] [[Mercer (G.I. Joe)|Mercer]], former football player [[List of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero characters (M\u2013R)#Red Dog|Red Dog]], and former acrobat [[List of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero characters (S\u2013Z)#Taurus|Taurus]]. On a weaponless recon mission in the Terror Drome, the five learn of Cobra's plans and that the Baroness has discovered the location of the BET. As Falcon and the others destroy the Terror Drome, Cobra launches an assault on the Joes. The Joes launch a counterattack on Cobra, but the BET is stolen. Serpentor attempts to kill Falcon, but Duke intervenes and falls into a coma.\n\nFalcon, the Renegades and the new recruits head to the Himalayas to stop Cobra-La. The G.I. Joe team is led to Cobra-La's lair by Cobra Commander. The new recruits prove themselves valuable soldiers as the Joes rescue their captured teammates. Falcon, Jinx and Sgt. Slaughter confront Golobulus, Pythona and Serpentor. The ensuing fight culminates in Jinx and Slaughter sending Pythona and Nemesis Enforcer falling to their apparent demise. Finally, Falcon sends Serpentor out of Cobra-La and reconfigures the BET to incinerate the spore pods in space and destroying Cobra-La. Immediately following the battle, the strike team receives news that Duke has come out of his coma and is recovering.<ref>{{Citation|title=GI Joe The Movie 1987 clip 7|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgI0VD-7qy4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/FgI0VD-7qy4 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2021-02-28}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charlie Adler]] as [[Low-Light (G.I.

After this was written into the script, it inspired the death of the Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]] in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' while both films were in production.<ref name=\"dixon_interview\"/> However, Optimus Prime's death sparked a severe backlash among both fans and parents, and Hasbro reversed their decision on allowing Duke's death.
