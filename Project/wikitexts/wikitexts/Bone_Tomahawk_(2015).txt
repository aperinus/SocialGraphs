Craig Zahler]] as his directorial debut. It stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Matthew Fox]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Lili Simmons]], [[Evan Jonigkeit]], [[David Arquette]], and [[Sid Haig]] and was produced by Jack Heller and [[Dallas Sonnier]]. The film is about a small-town [[sheriff]] who leads a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] into a desolate region to rescue three people who were abducted by a [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] clan.\n\nDevelopment of the film started when Zahler's friend and manager [[Dallas Sonnier]] recommended to create a film adaptation of Zahler's Western novel ''Wraiths of a Broken Land''. Realizing that such a project cannot be adapted on a low budget, Zahler opted to write a rescue Western instead. Casting began in October 2014, with [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], and [[Jennifer Carpenter]] signed on to play before being replaced by Wilson, Fox, and Simmons respectively due to scheduling conflicts. Principal photography took place in California over a course of 21 days in October 2014.\n\nThe premiere of ''Bone Tomahawk'' took place at the [[Fantastic Fest]] on October 1, 2015 and was given a limited release on October 23, 2015 by [[RLJ Entertainment]], grossing over $480,000 in movie sales and $4.32 million in home media sales against a $1.8 million budget. The film received mainly positive reviews, with praise for Zahler's screenplay and direction and the performances of the ensemble cast, though its runtime was criticized.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1890s, [[Brigandage|brigands]] Purvis and Buddy encounter a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial site. They are ambushed and Buddy is killed while Purvis escapes. Purvis reaches the nearby town of Bright Hope and buries his loot. However, Deputy Chicory reports him to [[Sheriff (United States)|Sheriff]] Franklin Hunt, who shoots Purvis in the leg when he attempted to escape. Hunt sends the confident [[Gunfighter|gunslinger]] John Brooder to fetch the town's doctor, but ends up fetching Samantha O'Dwyer, the doctor's daughter and assistant, who is caring for her husband Arthur, a [[Ranch#Ranch occupations|ranch foreman]], after he broke his leg. Hunt leaves Samantha in the sheriff's office with his other deputy Nick to tend to Purvis' wounds in the jail cell. That night, a nearby stable boy is killed.\n\nHunt learns of the murder and goes to his office finding it empty, with an arrow left behind. The Professor, an educated Native American, links the arrow to a tribe that he refers to as \"[[Cave dweller|Troglodytes]]\" and locates the valley they inhabit on a map, warning Hunt that they are a group of [[inbreeding|inbred]] [[Cannibalism|cannibals]] shunned and avoided by other native tribes. Certain that Samantha, Nick, and Purvis have been captured by them, Hunt forms a rescue party with Chicory and Brooder, who are then later joined by Arthur, who insists on accompanying them to find his wife despite his injury.\n\nDays into their ride, two strangers stumble across the rescue party's camp and are killed by Brooder, fearing they are scouts for a raid. The rescue party then set up a camp at another spot, but are ambushed by a group of raiders who injures Brooder's horse and steals the rest. The following day, a fight breaks out between Brooder and Arthur, exacerbating Arthur's leg wound. Chicory leaves him to recover while he, Hunt, and Brooder continue on-foot. Reaching the valley, the rescue party are ambushed by the Troglodytes, killing three but with Brooder killed and Hunt and Chicory captured and imprisoned within their cave.\n\nHunt and Chicory find Samantha and Nick in a different cell and are informed by them that the Troglodytes have already killed and eaten Purvis. The group later witness Nick stripped, brutally [[Scalping|scalped]], [[Dismemberment|bisected alive]], and then consumed. Samantha estimates that there are twelve Troglodytes inhabiting the valley, decreased to nine after their encounter with the rescue party. Hunt tricks several Troglodytes into drinking liquor laced with [[Laudanum|opium tincture]], with one dying while another becomes unconscious. Arthur follows the men's trail and discovers the valley, he kills two Troglodytes and notices an object embedded in their windpipes. After cutting one out, he realizes that it is animal bone that acts as a whistle. He blows on it, luring another Troglodyte, then kills him.\n\nIn the cave, realizing two of their clan were poisoned, the Troglodyte leader grows angry. They cut open Hunt's abdomen, shove the heated opium [[Hip flask|flask]] into the wound, and shoot him. Arthur arrives and kills one of them while Hunt decapitates the leader. Arthur frees Samantha and Chicory, while a mortally wounded Hunt stays behind with a rifle. He promises to kill the surviving cannibals when they return, to prevent them from terrorizing Bright Hope. As the three leave the cave, they see two pregnant Troglodyte women, who are blinded and have had all their limbs amputated. After the party is at a distance from the valley, Arthur blows on the Troglodyte whistle, with no response. They then hear three gunshots, implying that Hunt has killed the remaining Troglodytes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Sheriff Franklin Hunt<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news |last=Collis |first=Clark |date=2015-09-25 |title='Bone Tomahawk' director explains how he got Kurt Russell back on a horse \u2014 exclusive poster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://ew.com/article/2015/09/25/bone-tomahawk-kurt-russell/ |access-date=2022-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120143818/https://ew.com/article/2015/09/25/bone-tomahawk-kurt-russell/ |archive-date=2022-01-20}}</ref>\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Arthur O'Dwyer<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web |title=Bone Tomahawk |url=https://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=212035.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102062700/https://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=212035.html |archive-date=2022-01-02 |access-date=2022-01-02 |website=AlloCin\u00e9}}</ref>\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as John Brooder<ref name=\":7\" />\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Deputy Chicory<ref name=\":7\" />\n* [[Lili Simmons]] as Samantha O'Dwyer<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web |title=Bone Tomahawk Cast & Crew |url=https://www.fandango.com/bone-tomahawk-186255/movie-overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102062700/https://www.fandango.com/bone-tomahawk-186255/movie-overview |archive-date=2022-01-02 |access-date=2022-01-02 |website=[[Fandango Media]]}}</ref>\n* [[Evan Jonigkeit]] as Deputy Nick<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[David Arquette]] as Purvis<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Kathryn Morris]] as Lorna Hunt<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Sid Haig]] as Buddy<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Sean Young]] as Mrs. Porter<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Fred Melamed]] as Clarence<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Maestro Harrell]] as Gizzard<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web |title=Bone Tomahawk - Full Cast & Crew |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/bone-tomahawk/cast/2000210150/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220102063026/https://www.tvguide.com/movies/bone-tomahawk/cast/2000210150/ |archive-date=2022-01-02 |access-date=2022-01-02 |website=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref>\n* [[Jamison Newlander]] as The Mayor<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Pianist<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Jeremy Tardy]] as Buford<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as Mr. Wallington<ref name=\":8\" />\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as The Professor<ref name=\":9\" />\n* Michael Emery as Redheaded Fellow<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Raw Leiba]] as Wolf Skull<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Geno Segers]] as Boar Tusks<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Eddie Spears]] as Serrated Tomahawk<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Alex Meraz]] as Eagle Skulls<ref name=\":9\" />\n* [[Jay Tavare]] as Sharp Teeth<ref name=\":9\" />\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:S.

Back in 2005, Zahler watched nineteen films in two weeks at a Westerns festival at the [[Film Forum]] and, upon seeing a film he didn't like, began to think about how to improve it in his own way; thereafter deciding to write novels and screenplays in the Western genre.<ref name=int/><ref name=\":0\" /> The concept of ''Bone Tomahawk'' arose when Zahler's manager, producer, and friend [[Dallas Sonnier]] proposed he make a film adaption of his novel ''Wraiths of the Broken Land'' directed by Zahler himself. However, Zahler believed the novel could not be adapted on a low budget and opted to write a rescue Western, ''Bone Tomahawk'', instead as a sibling piece to ''Wraiths of the Broken Land''.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |date=2015-12-29 |title=Interview: Bone Tomahawk Director S.

Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard's]] ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Zahler incorporated some details of his personal life into the script, remarking: \"Most characters I write have some attributes in common with me, and some attributes that are not. Certainly when Brooder says: \u2018Smart men don\u2019t get married\u2019, everyone who knows me is thinking of me. \u2018That\u2019s something Zahler would say.\u2019\" and \"I\u2019m not married and don\u2019t have any interest in it.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn regard to other Western films made in 2015, Zahler remarked that he thought ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' was the worst film that he had seen in five years while ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' is too theatrical, despite him enjoying watching the latter.<ref name=\":0\" /> Zahler includes humor in every work he writes, stating: \"It\u2019s one of these things where you\u2019re dealing with a serious situation, but if everyone is frowning and dour all the time, and you don\u2019t see life or love in these characters, I don\u2019t know why you care; that was my experience watching ''The Revenant'' wondering why anyone would care at all about anything happening to any person in that film.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Dallas Sonnier]] praised the script for ''Bone Tomahawk'', and pledged to be faithful to it, telling potential investors that arbitrary meddling in the script was not welcome. Despite Sonnier's assurances, investors still wanted the script to be changed due to conflicting interpretations of the film\u2019s genre, and the film being Zahler\u2019s directorial debut. Zahler refused to compromise, including by refusing to sacrifice full creative control and refusing to reduce the film length to ninety minutes.<ref name=\":0\" /> Zahler and Sonnier finally accumulated a $1.8 million budget, half provided by Sonnier and the other half provided by British company The Fyzz Facility, and had 21 days to film.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Due to budget constraints, a substantial amount of content in the script did not make it into the final film.<ref name=\":6\" /> When selling the movie to investors, Zahler used directors such as [[John Cassavetes]], [[Larry Clark]], [[Wong Kar-wai]], and [[Takeshi Kitano]] as stylistic reference points, despite none being filmmakers in the Western genre.<ref name=\":0\" /> Production of the film was made public on October 30, 2012 and was funded by Caliber Media Company, owned by Sonnier and Jack Heller, with French company [[Celluloid Dreams]] handling international sales.<ref name=\"Sneider\">{{Cite news |last=Sneider |first=Jeff |date=October 30, 2012 |title=S.

The music in ''Bone Tomahawk'' often accompanies long shots, rather than close-ups, primarily because Craig didn\u2019t want the music to underscore emotion. He wanted the emotional scenes to be as direct and impactful as possible, and he thought that these scenes might be felt more intensely and honestly without music.
