It is the third chapter of the ''Spanish Apartment trilogy'', after ''[[L'Auberge Espagnole]]'' (2002) and ''[[Russian Dolls (film)|Les Poup\u00e9es russes]] ''(''Russian Dolls'', 2005).\n\n==Plot==\n\nTen years have passed, and the once happy lovers, Xavier Rousseau ([[Romain Duris]]) and Wendy ([[Kelly Reilly]]), have split. When she moves with their two children to New York City, he also moves there to be near the children. Wendy now lives with John ([[Peter Hermann (actor)|Peter Hermann]]) in a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park. Xavier initially stays with Isabelle ([[C\u00e9cile de France]]) and Ju ([[Sandrine Holt]]), a lesbian couple whose child he fathered, but he soon finds his own apartment above a Chinese bakery where he works on a new novel assisted by brief visions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].\n\nHaving no work visa, Xavier is advised by his lawyer ([[Jason Kravits]]) to seek illegal employment and marry for a green card. After saving his taxicab driver from a vicious beating, the driver's grateful Chinese-American family agrees to have Xavier marry one of their relations, Nancy ([[Li Jun Li]]), who is amenable and complicit.\n\nHis former French girlfriend, Martine ([[Audrey Tautou]]), visits him while on a business trip and returns a second time with her own two children on spring break. Xavier and Martine briefly attempt to rekindle their relationship.\n\nThe film climaxes when the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] performs a surprise inspection of Xavier's apartment while Isabelle is using it to cheat on Ju with their babysitter ([[Flore Bonaventura]]). Later as Martine is departing for home with her kids, Xavier races on foot to catch her shuttle bus, confess his love, and ask her to stay and live with him. She agrees.\n\nThe film concludes with the cast of characters walking in a celebratory parade down a Chinatown street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Romain Duris]] as Xavier Rousseau\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Wendy\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Martine\n* [[C\u00e9cile de France]] as Isabelle\n* [[Sandrine Holt]] as Ju\n* [[Flore Bonaventura]] as Isabelle the babysitter \n* [[Jochen H\u00e4gele]] as Hegel \n* [[Beno\u00eet Jacquot]] as Xavier's father \n* [[Martine Demaret]] as Xavier's mother\n* [[Dominique Besnehard]] as the editor\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as Mr. Boubaker\n* [[Peter Hermann (actor)|Peter Hermann]] as John\n* [[Jason Kravits]] as Xavier's lawyer\n* [[Vanessa Guide]] as the nurse\n* [[Kyan Khojandi]] as Antoine Garceau \n* [[Li Jun Li]] as Nancy\n* [[Pablo Mugnier-Jacob]] as Tom\n* [[Margaux Mansart]] as Mia\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Le patron coursier\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as L'agent bureau immigration\n* [[Larry Fessenden]] as Le premier rocker\n\n== Reception and awards ==\nThe film garnered favourable reviews.
