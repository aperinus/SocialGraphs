It is based on Grandin's memoirs ''Emergence'' and ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]''. The film premiered on [[HBO]] on February 6, 2010, and won several awards including five [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie|Screen Actors Guild]] prizes for Danes.\n\n==Plot==\nTemple Grandin is an uncommunicative child who is prone to tantrums and is diagnosed with [[autism]]. The medical consensus at that time was that autism was a form of [[schizophrenia]] resulting from insufficient maternal affection. Despite recommendations to place her in an [[mental institution|institution]], Grandin's mother hires therapists and works to help her daughter adapt to [[social interaction]].\n\nAs a teenager, Temple travels to her aunt and uncle's ranch to work. She observes cows being placed into a [[squeeze chute]] to calm them, and, during an anxiety attack, she uses the chute to calm herself.  Inspired by her teacher, Dr. Carlock, to pursue science, she is admitted to [[Franklin Pierce College]] where she develops an early version of the [[squeeze machine]] to calm herself during stressful times. Her college misinterprets the use of the machine as a sexual act and forces her to remove it. In response, she develops a scientific protocol to test subjects' reactions to the machine, proving it to be a purely therapeutic device. Grandin graduates with a degree in [[psychology]] and pursues a master's degree in [[animal science]].\n\nTemple faces [[sexism]] while attempting to integrate into the world of cattle ranching but ultimately designs a new [[sheep dip|dip]] structure designed to allow cattle to voluntarily move through rather than being forced. Initially, the device works as intended, and garners favorable coverage in local press, but the ranch hands are dismissive of her design and alter it, resulting in the drowning of several cows. Angered, Grandin visits Carlock, and leaves the meeting encouraged to continue her efforts to improve the industry.\n\nTemple and her mother attend the 1981 National Autistic Convention. The speaker is unable to answer many of the questions from the audience, but Temple speaks out from the crowd explaining how she has adapted, and tells of her mother's contributions to her success. The audience calls her to the podium, marking Temple's transition into autism advocacy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Claire Danes]] as [[Temple Grandin]]\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Aunt Ann, Temple's aunt and sister in-law of Eustacia. As a teenager, Temple often visited her [[Arizona]] cattle ranch during the summer.\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Eustacia Cutler, Temple's mother. When Temple was younger, Eustacia was in denial over the doctor's diagnosis of Temple's autism. Eustacia was determined to have her daughter receive an education and lead a normal life.\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Dr. Carlock, Temple's boarding school science teacher and mentor. Carlock was aware of Temple's visual skills and was supportive in furthering her education.\n* [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]] as Billy, a worker at Aunt Ann's farm.\n* [[Barry Tubb]] as Randy\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe idea for a biopic of Grandin originated with its executive producer [[Emily Gerson Saines]], a successful [[talent agent]] and a co-founder of the nonprofit Autism Coalition for Research and Education (now part of [[Autism Speaks]]). In the mid-1990s, Gerson Saines was a vice-president at the [[William Morris Agency]] when her 2-year-old son was diagnosed with autism. She learned about Grandin soon afterward, when her mother told her about seeing Grandin's book ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]'' in a bookstore and, around the same time, her grandmother independently sent her an article about Grandin by [[Oliver Sacks]].<ref name=\"lascala\">LaScale, Marisa.

I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen.\" Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. \"She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt\u2014in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but all I could think of was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here.

Danes herself was coming off a string of more lightweight roles (whose \"primary job and experience [was] to become gaga over a man,\" she described) and eager to take on a more demanding part. Although she was only vaguely aware of Grandin at the time, Danes dove into research, including watching documentaries about Grandin and studying Grandin's books and recordings. \"It was really daunting, because she's alive and has a great eye for detail,\" Danes said. The two women spent about six hours together in Danes' apartment, ending with a hug from Grandin (\"For her, that's not easy,\" Danes observed), which Danes was glad to take as validation that Grandin approved of her for the role.<ref name=\"nyt\">Lyman, Rick.
