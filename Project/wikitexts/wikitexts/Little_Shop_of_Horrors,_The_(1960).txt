The musical enjoyed a 2003 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut.\n\n==Plot==\nPenny-pinching Gravis Mushnick owns a florist shop staffed by himself and two employees, the sweet Audrey Fulquard and the clumsy Seymour Krelboined. Located on [[skid row]], the rundown shop gets little business. When Seymour fouls up a floral arrangement for sadistic dentist Dr. Farb, Mushnick fires him. Hoping to change his mind, Seymour tells him about a special plant he has grown from seeds he got from a \"Japanese gardener over on Central Avenue.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/Little_ShopOf_Horrors.avi at 11.33 time stamp.</ref> Seymour admits that he named the plant \"Audrey Jr.\",<!-- the plant is only named \"Audrey II\" in the musical versions. --> which delights the real Audrey.\n\nSeymour fetches his sickly, odd-looking potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed. When it is suggested that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract people to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. The usual kinds of plant food do not nourish the plant, but when Seymour accidentally pricks his finger, he discovers that the plant craves blood. Fed on Seymour's blood, Audrey Jr. begins to grow, and the shop's revenues increase when curious customers are lured in to see the plant. Mushnick tells Seymour to refer to him as \"Dad\" and calls Seymour his son in front of a customer.\n\nThe plant develops the ability to speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now [[Anemia|anemic]], Seymour walks along the railroad track; when he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a drunken man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. He tries to get rid of the body by throwing it away and burying it in a yard but is nearly caught twice. Guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour decides to feed the mutilated body parts to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, Mushnick returns to the shop to get some cash and secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Mushnick considers telling the police but procrastinates when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop the next day.\n\nSeymour arrives the next morning suffering from a toothache; despite not going to the police, Mushnick still confronts Seymour about Audrey Jr.'s eating habits; while not explicitly revealing what he knows about the plant. Seymour grows increasingly distressed as he realizes that his boss is onto him. After finishing his rant, Mushnick sends Seymour to the dentist; soon after, Audrey runs up and declares that the shop needs many more flowers. When Seymour visits Dr. Farb, the doctor tries to get even for his ruined flowers and attempts to kill him. Seymour, defending himself, grabs a sharp tool and stabs and kills Farb. Although horrified, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances of the two men attract the attention of Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie.\n\nAudrey Jr. has grown several feet tall and is budding, as is the relationship between Seymour and Audrey. A representative of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop and announces that Seymour will receive a trophy and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour and Audrey go on a date, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. harms no one else.\n\nWhile tending to his shop, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of a robber who pretended to be a customer earlier that day and believes that the huge crowds he observed at the shop indicate the presence of a large amount of money. Mushnick tricks the deranged robber into thinking that the money is where the plant is, which crushes and eats him after Mushnick maneuvers him close enough to it. When Seymour is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, he confronts the plant and asserts that he will no longer do its bidding. The plant then hypnotizes Seymour and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets and (accidentally) knocks out a [[Street prostitution|streetwalker]], who he takes to feed Audrey Jr. Lacking clues about the mysterious disappearances of the two men, Fink and Stoolie attend a sunset celebration at the shop during which Seymour is to be presented with the trophy and Audrey Jr.'s buds are expected to open.\n\nAs the attendees watch, four buds open; inside each flower is the face of one of the plant's victims. Fink and Stoolie realize that Seymour is the murderer; he flees from the shop with the officers in pursuit. He manages to lose them and make his way back to the now-empty shop, where he blames Audrey Jr. for ruining his life, but the plant instead asks to be fed. Seymour grabs a kitchen knife and climbs into Audrey Jr.'s maw saying, \"I'll feed you like you've never been fed before!\", apparently attempting to kill the plant. Later that evening, it is discovered that Audrey Jr. has begun to wither and die. One last bud opens to reveal Seymour's face. He pitifully moans, \"I didn't mean it,\" and the flower droops.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = ''The Little Shop of Horrors'' introduces (''from top'') [[Jonathan Haze]] as Seymour Krelboined, [[Jackie Joseph]] as Audrey Fulquard, [[Mel Welles]] as Gravis Mushnick, [[Myrtle Vail]] as Winifred Krelboined and [[Jack Nicholson]] as Wilbur Force\n| image1 = Jonathan Haze as Seymour Krelboyne.png\n| image2 = Jackie Joseph as Audrey Fulquard.png\n| image3 = Mel Welles as Gravis Mushnick.png\n| image4 = Myrtle Vail as Winifred Krelboyne.png\n| image5 = Little Shop of Horrors Nicholson.JPG\n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jonathan Haze]] as Seymour Krelboined<ref>{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Charles B. |date=1959 |title=The Passionate People Eater (aka The Little Shop of Horrors) Screenplay |page=4 |quote=SEYMOUR KRELBOINED, a scrawny runt, with a nose like a door-stopper and the gait of an ostrich, enters from the back.}}</ref>\n* [[Jackie Joseph]] as Audrey Fulquard<ref>{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Charles B. |date=1959 |title=The Passionate People Eater (aka The Little Shop of Horrors) Screenplay |page=1 |quote=Inside the window, watering a few sad arrangements, is AUDREY FULQUARD, a cheerfully pleasant girl.

Corman decided to use the sets in a film made in the last two days before the sets were torn down.<ref name=\"Corman\"/><ref name=\"Gray\"/><ref name=\"Ray\"/><ref name=BucketFunFacts/><ref name=\"Peary\"/>\n\nCorman initially planned to develop a story involving a [[private investigator]]. In the story's initial version, the character that eventually became Audrey would have been referred to as \"Oriole Plove.\" Actress [[Nancy Kulp]] was a leading candidate for the part.<ref name=\"Ray\"/> The characters that eventually became Seymour and Winifred Krelborn were named \"Irish Eye\" and \"Iris Eye\".<ref name=\"Ray\"/> Actor [[Mel Welles]] was scheduled to play a character named \"Draco Cardala,\" [[Jonathan Haze]] was scheduled to play \"Archie Aroma,\" and [[Jack Nicholson]] would have played a character named \"Jocko\".<ref name=\"Ray\"/>\n\n[[Charles B. Griffith]] wanted to write a [[horror film|horror]]-themed [[comedy film]]. According to Mel Welles, Corman was not impressed by the box office performance of ''A Bucket of Blood'', and had to be persuaded to direct another comedy.<ref name=\"Gray\"/> However, Corman later claimed he was interested because of ''A Bucket of Blood'' and said the development process was similar to that of the earlier film, when he and Griffith were inspired by visiting various coffee houses:\n\n<blockquote>We tried a similar approach for ''The Little Shop of Horrors'', dropping in and out of various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where [[Sally Kellerman]] (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other's sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she sat down at the table with us, and the three of us worked out the rest of the story together.<ref name=\"roger\">[http://www.laweekly.com/2007-10-18/film-tv/wild-imagination/ Roger Corman, \"Wild Imagination: Charles B.

We couldn't do that though because of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|code]] at the time. So I said, 'How about a man-eating plant?', and Roger said, 'Okay.' By that time, we were both drunk.\"<ref name=\"Graham\"/>\n\n[[Jackie Joseph]] later recalled \"at first they told me it was a detective movie; then, while I was flying back [to make the movie], I think they wrote a whole new movie, more in the horror genre.

However, this claim has been denied by Mel Welles.<ref name=\"Weaver\"/> According to Joseph, Corman shot the film quickly in order to beat changing industry rules that would have prevented producers from \"buying out\" an actor's performance in perpetuity. On January 1, 1960, new rules were to go into effect requiring producers to pay all actors [[residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] for all future releases of their work. This meant that Corman's B-movie business model would be permanently changed and he would not be able to produce low-budget movies in the same way. Before these rules went into effect, Corman decided to shoot one last film and scheduled it for the last week in December 1959.<ref name=\"Joseph\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bmonster.com/horror15.html |title=Interview with Jackie Joseph |access-date=2007-10-24 |author=Weaver, Tom |publisher=The Astounding B Monster |archive-date=2007-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053103/http://www.bmonster.com/horror15.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Hallencom/>\n\nInteriors were shot with three cameras in wide, lingering master shots in single takes.<ref name=\"Corman\"/><ref name=\"Ray\"/> Welles states that Corman \"had two camera crews on the set\u2014that's why the picture, from a cinematic standpoint, is really not very well done. The two camera crews were pointed in opposite directions so that we got both angles, and then other shots were 'picked up' to use in between, to make it flow. It was a pretty fixed set and it was done sort of like a sitcom is done today, so it wasn't very difficult.\"<ref name=\"Weaver\"/>\n\nAt the time of shooting, [[Jack Nicholson]] had appeared in two films and worked with Roger Corman as the lead in ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]''. According to Nicholson, \"I went in to the shoot knowing I had to be very quirky because Roger originally hadn't wanted me. In other words, I couldn't play it straight. So I just did a lot of weird shit that I thought would make it funny.\"<ref name=\"Corman\"/> According to Dick Miller, all of the dialogue between his character and Mel Welles was [[ad-libbed]].<ref name=\"Weaver\"/> During a scene in which writer Charles B. Griffith played a robber, Griffith remembers that \"When [Welles] and I forgot my lines, I improvised a little, but then I was the writer.
