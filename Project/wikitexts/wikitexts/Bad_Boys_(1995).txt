The film stars [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Will Smith]] as two [[Miami]] [[narcotic]]s detectives, Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and was commercially successful and gained a strong cult following. It spawned two sequels, ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), and ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'' (2020).\n\n==Plot==\nLifelong friends Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are Miami police detectives investigating $100 million of seized Mafia heroin, which was stolen from a secure police vault. [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] suspects that it was an inside job and threatens to shut down the entire department unless they recover the drugs within 72 hours.\n\nMike asks one of his informants and ex-girlfriend Maxine \"Max\" Logan to look for people who are newly rich and therefore suspects. She gets herself and her best friend Julie Mott hired as escorts by Eddie Dominguez, a crooked former cop. The party is soon interrupted by Dominguez's French drug kingpin boss Fouchet and his henchmen Casper, Ferguson, and Noah. Dominguez and Max are killed, while Julie manages to escape. The [[prostitution|madam]] who hired Julie and Max is [[Murder|disposed of]] by Noah, who then knocks out Mike as he investigates Max's death.\n\nFrantically calling the police station, Julie insists on talking only to Mike, who is away. Knowing she never met Mike, captain Conrad Howard forces Marcus to impersonate Mike to talk to her. At her apartment, Marcus and Julie are attacked by some of Fouchet's henchmen, one of whom Marcus kills. When they rendezvous with Mike, Marcus and Mike have to impersonate each other, with Mike living at the Burnett residence while Marcus resides with Julie at Mike's apartment. The two struggle to keep it up in Julie's presence, and she quickly begins to suspect the truth.\n\nLooking through mugshots, Julie identifies Noah as one of the henchmen. The trio go to Club Hell, one of Noah's known hangouts. After being spotted, Marcus knocks Casper unconscious during a bathroom fight. Julie tries to kill Fouchet but Marcus stops her. In the ensuing car chase, Mike kills Noah. The three manage to get away, but are caught on camera by a news helicopter and the report is later seen by Marcus's family, who were told that Marcus was temporarily reassigned to Cleveland.\n\nMike and Marcus meet their old informant Jojo and learn about the location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. The three return to Mike's apartment, where Marcus' wife Theresa confronts them and confirms Julie's suspicion they have been impersonating each other. Fouchet's gang shows up and kidnaps Julie.\n\nMike and Marcus' department is shut down by Internal Affairs. Despite being reassigned, Howard delays the order, giving Mike and Marcus more time to solve the case. They access Dominguez's private police database profile and learn that the police secretary Francine is Dominguez's former girlfriend, who was being blackmailed by Fouchet and Dominguez after they took nude photos of her, threatening to post them at her kids' school.\n\nMike, Marcus, and two other detectives, Sanchez and Ruiz, head to the [[Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport]]. After a fierce shootout, they kill the remainder of Fouchet's henchmen, including Casper and Ferguson, and rescue Julie. They chase a fleeing Fouchet and force his car into a concrete barrier. As Fouchet tries to flee, Mike shoots Fouchet in the leg and arrests him at gunpoint. After a tense conversation with Marcus, Fouchet surreptitiously draws a gun but is shot to death by Mike before he can kill Marcus, avenging Max's death. An exhausted Marcus leaves Julie with Mike and heads home, eager to be reunited with his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Detective Sergeant Marcus Miles Burnett\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Sergeant Michael Eugene \"Mike\" Lowrey\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Julie Mott\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Antoine Fouchet\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Theresa Burnett\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Captain Conrad Howard\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Captain Alison Sinclair\n* [[Nestor Serrano]] as Detective Sanchez\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Detective Ruiz\n* [[Saverio Guerra]] as Chet\n* [[Anna Thomson|Anna Thompson]] as Francine\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Elliot\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as Joe \"Jo-Jo\"\n* Vic Manni as Ferguson\n* [[Frank John Hughes]] as Casper\n* Ralph Gonzales as Kuni\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Noah Trafficante\n* Emmanuel Xuereb as Eddie Dominguez\n* [[John Salley]] as Fletcher (credited as Hacker \"Fletcher\")\n* [[Karen Alexander (fashion model)|Karen Alexander]] as Max Logan\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as Store Clerk\n* [[Kim Coates]] as White Carjacker\n* [[Michael Taliferro|Michael 'Bear' Taliferro]] as Black Carjacker\n* [[Lisa Boyle]] as Girl Decoy\n* [[Ed Amatrudo]] as Ether Van Boss\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 27, 1994, at the Dade Tire company near [[Greater Downtown Miami|downtown Miami]], the city chosen to replace the original New York locale. Filming continued throughout the area, including South Beach's Tides Hotel, the Mediterranean [[Miami Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]], the [[Miami-Dade County Courthouse|Dade County Courthouse]] and a multimillion-dollar estate on a private island. The second floor of downtown Miami's [[Alfred I. DuPont Building|Alfred DuPont building]] was converted into a police station; a freighter on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] into a drug lab. ''Bad Boys''' climactic scenes were filmed at the [[Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport|Opa-Locka Airport]]. Filming was quick due to the TV schedules of the stars with production wrapping on August 31. The opening sequence was written and shot during [[post-production]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=5|title=The rationale of re-shoots|last=Young|first=Paul F.|date=July 10, 1995}}</ref> In the film's early stages of development, Simpson and Bruckheimer initially envisioned [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]] in the roles.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDD173EF932A05751C1A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=IN THE DRESSING ROOM WITH DANA CARVEY; Every Night Live? | first=Craig | last=Wolff | date=December 31, 1992 | access-date=April 26, 2010 | archive-date=December 25, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201225030605/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/31/garden/in-the-dressing-room-with-dana-carvey-every-night-live.html | url-status=live }}</ref>  When the film was written for Carvey and Lovitz, the original title for ''Bad Boys'' was ''Bulletproof Hearts''. [[Arsenio Hall]] turned down the role of Lowrey and cites{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} that choice as the worst mistake he has ever made. The role eventually went to Smith. Both Lawrence and Smith were starring in their own hit TV shows, ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' and ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', when filming ''Bad Boys''. ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' even references the film in an episode. In the season 6, episode 20, called \"I Stank Horse\", Nicholas \"Nicky\" Banks tells Will that his parents will not let him watch ''Bad Boys'', to which Will replies, \"''Bad Boys'', huh? What'cha gonna do?\"\n\n===Improvisation===\nDirector Bay did not like the script and often engaged Smith and Lawrence in discussions about how the dialogue and scenes could improve. He often allowed them to improvise while the cameras were rolling. He secretly told Smith to call Lawrence a bitch before the car scene. The whole \"two bitches in the sea\" was improvised, as was Lawrence's comment when Leoni called him gay. The scene in the convenience store, when the clerk puts a gun to Burnett and Lowrey's heads and yells, telling them to \"Freeze, mother bitches!\", is also improvised. They came up with: \"No, ''you'' freeze, bitch! Now back up, put the gun down and get me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubbalicious\". \"And some Skittles.\" According to Bay in the DVD commentary, at the end of the film when Mike and Marcus are recuperating, Mike says \"I love you, man.\" Bay claims that Smith refused to say the line, causing the director and actor to argue back and forth over the line. Bay wanted Smith to say the line as he felt it summed up the friendship between the cops. After their argument had lasted for half of the day's shoot and much of the crew was ready to pack up, a fed up Bay told Smith to do whatever he wanted, after which Smith changed his mind and agreed to say the line.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Bad Boys (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Bad Boys'' was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide \u2014 $65,807,024 in North America and $75,600,000 internationally.<ref>{{cite web |title = Bad Boys (1995) |url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date = August 12, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100730100826/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=badboys.htm| archive-date=July 30, 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]],  ''Bad Boys'' has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 64 critics, with an average rating of 5.10/10.
