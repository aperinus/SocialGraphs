Harris]], Harris-Kubrick Pictures.<ref name=\"motionpictureher204quig\"/><ref name=\"variety203-1956-08\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Variety|url=http://archive.org/details/variety205-1957-02|title=Variety (February 1957)|date=1957|publisher=New York, NY: Variety Publishing Company|others=Media History Digital Library}}</ref> In 1992, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a voiceover describing the [[trench warfare]] situation of [[World War I]] up to 1916. In a [[ch\u00e2teau]], General Georges Broulard, a member of the French General Staff, asks his subordinate, the ambitious General Mireau, to take a well-defended German position called the Anthill. Mireau initially refuses, citing the impossibility of success, but when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.\n\nMireau proceeds to walk through the trenches, asking several soldiers, \"Ready to kill more Germans?\" He throws a private out of the regiment for showing signs of [[shell shock]]. Mireau leaves the detailed planning of the attack to Colonel Dax of the 701st regiment, despite Dax's protests that the only result of the attack will be to weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit.\n\nPrior to the attack, a drunken lieutenant named Roget, leading a night-time scouting mission, sends one of his two men ahead. Overcome by fear while waiting for the man's return, Roget lobs a grenade and retreats. Corporal Paris, the other soldier on the mission, finds the body of the scout, who has been killed by the grenade, and confronts Roget. Roget denies any wrongdoing and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.\n\nThe next morning, the attack on the Anthill is a failure. Dax leads the first wave of soldiers over the top into [[no man's land]] under heavy fire. None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuses to leave their own trench after seeing the first wave sustain heavy casualties. Mireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire without written confirmation of the order. Meanwhile, Dax returns to the trenches and tries to rally B Company to join the battle, but as he climbs out of the trench, the body of a dead French soldier knocks him down.\n\nAt a meeting with Broulard and Dax, to deflect blame for the attack's failure, Mireau decides to [[court-martial]] 100 of the soldiers for cowardice. Broulard persuades him to reduce the number to three, one from each company. Corporal Paris is chosen because his commanding officer Roget wishes to keep him from testifying about Roget's actions in the scouting mission. Private Ferol is picked by his commanding officer because he is a \"social undesirable.\" The last man, Private Arnaud, is chosen randomly by lot, despite having been cited for bravery twice previously.\n\nDax, who was a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial. The trial however, is a farce. There is no formal written indictment, a [[Court reporter|court stenographer]] is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his closing statement, Dax denounces the proceedings: \"Gentlemen of the court, to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die.\" Nonetheless, the three are sentenced to death.\n\nThe night before the execution, Dax confronts Broulard at a ball, with sworn statements by witnesses attesting to Mireau's order to shell his own trenches, in an attempt to [[blackmail]] the General Staff into sparing the three men. Broulard takes the statements but brusquely dismisses Dax.\n\nThe next morning, the three men are taken out to be shot by [[firing squad]]. Dax, suspecting Roget for his nomination of Paris, forces Roget to lead the executions. While a sobbing Ferol is blindfolded, Paris refuses Roget's offer of a blindfold and reacts ambiguously to Roget's meek apology. Arnaud, meanwhile, is so badly injured after having started a fight in prison that he must be carried out in a stretcher and tied to the post. All three men are executed.\n\nFollowing the executions, Broulard breakfasts with the gloating Mireau. Broulard reveals he has invited Dax to attend and tells Mireau that he will be investigated for the order to fire on his own men. Mireau storms out, protesting that he has been made a scapegoat. Broulard then blithely offers Mireau's command to Dax, assuming that Dax's attempts to stop the executions were a ploy to gain Mireau's job. Discovering that Dax was in fact sincere, Broulard rebukes him for his idealism, while the disgusted Dax calls Broulard a \"degenerate, sadistic old man.\"\n\nAfter the execution, some of Dax's soldiers are carousing at an inn. They become more subdued as they listen to a captive German girl sing [[The Faithful Hussar|a sentimental folk song]]. Dax decides to leave without informing the men that they have been ordered to return to the front. His face hardens as he returns to his quarters.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Colonel Dax, commanding officer, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* [[Ralph Meeker]] as Corporal Philippe Paris, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* [[Adolphe Menjou]] as Major General Georges Broulard, corps commander\n* [[George Macready]] as Brigadier General Paul Mireau, divisional commander\n* [[Wayne Morris]] as Lieutenant Roget, company commander, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* [[Richard Anderson]] as Major Saint-Auban, Mireau's [[aide de camp]]\n* [[Joe Turkel]] as Private Pierre Arnaud, 701st Infantry Regiment (credited as Joseph Turkel)\n* [[Christiane Kubrick]] as German singer (credited as Susanne Christian)\n* [[Jerry Hausner]] as caf\u00e9 proprietor\n* [[Peter Capell]] as president of the court martial (and narrator)\n* [[Emile Meyer]] as Father Dupr\u00e9e\n* [[Bert Freed]] as Staff Sergeant Boulanger, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* Kem Dibbs as Private Lejeune, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as Private Maurice Ferol, 701st Infantry Regiment\n* Fred Bell as shell-shocked soldier\n* John Stein as Captain Rousseau, artillery battery commander\n* Harold Benedict as Captain Nichols, artillery liaison officer\n* [[James B.

The novel was adapted to the stage the same year by [[Sidney Howard]], World War I veteran and scriptwriter of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' .<ref name=mcardle/> The play was a flop on Broadway, because of its harsh anti-war scenes that alienated the audience. Nonetheless, Howard continued to believe in the relevance of the subject matter and thought it should be made into a film, writing, \"It seems to me that our motion picture industry must feel something of a sacred obligation to make the picture.\"<ref name=mcardle>Phil McArdle. [http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2007-12-18/article/28760 \"Sidney Howard: From Berkeley to Broadway and Hollywood\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220211351/http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2007-12-18/article/28760 |date=December 20, 2014 }}, ''The Berkeley Daily Planet'', December 18, 2007</ref> Fulfilling Howard's \"sacred obligation\", [[Stanley Kubrick]] decided to adapt it to the screen after he remembered reading the book when he was younger. Kubrick and his partners purchased the film rights from Cobb's widow for $10,000.<ref>{{cite web |title='Paths of Glory': Stanley Kubrick's First Step Towards Cinema Immortality |url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/paths-glory-stanley-kubricks-first-step-towards-cinema-immortality/ |website=cinephiliabeyond |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216035130/https://cinephiliabeyond.org/paths-glory-stanley-kubricks-first-step-towards-cinema-immortality/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nGray's stanza reflects Kubrick's feelings about war as well, and that becomes clear in the narrative of the film \u2013 a long battle for something with such an unimportant name as the \"Ant Hill\". Some of Kubrick's unrealized projects contained themes of war, as well. Kubrick once told a ''New York Times'' journalist:\n<blockquote>Man isn't a noble savage, he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved \u2013 that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html|title=Nice Boy From the Bronx?|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-17|archive-date=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825110333/https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKubrick's filmography shares many visual elements but thematically, the most frequent subject \u2013 even more than sexuality \u2013 is war. ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) presents war as a farce, its absurdity and pointlessness evoked through comedy. ''[[Fear and Desire]]'' (1953) demonstrates that the extreme stress and trauma of war can lead to the mental breakdown of soldiers to a point where they are insanely committing war crimes against a civilian population, thereby effectively abandoning the waged purpose of the war in the first place.'' [[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) enters the mind of a soldier and tells the audience that they may not like what they hear. ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) also shows the horrors of war, much like ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) with its many references to World War II and other conflicts.\n\n''Paths of Glory'' is based loosely on the true story of the [[Souain corporals affair]], when four French soldiers were executed in 1915, during [[World War I]] under General [[G\u00e9raud R\u00e9veilhac]], for failure to follow orders. The soldiers were exonerated posthumously, in 1934.<ref name=kufr>{{Cite web\n | first = Philippe \n | last = Huneman\n | title = Les Sentiers de la gloire\n | website = kubrick.fr\n | date = November 2003\n | url = http://www2.cndp.fr/TICE/teledoc/dossiers/dossier_sentiers.htm\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071203014203/http://www.kubrick.fr/sentiers5.htm\n | archive-date = 2007-12-03\n}}</ref> The novel is about the French execution of innocent men to strengthen others' resolve to fight.

This is similar to the Roman practice of [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimation]], which was rarely used by the French Army in [[World War I]]. ''Paths of Glory'' takes place in France, but Kubrick's feelings on the topic stem more from his American upbringing. When General Mireau says \u201cshow me a patriot, and I'll show you an honest man\u201d, Colonel Dax remarks that [[Samuel Johnson]] once said: \u201cPatriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefilmspectrum.com/?p=21740|title=Paths of Glory (1957) {{!}} The Film Spectrum|last=Fraley|first=Jason|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-17|archive-date=February 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021209/http://thefilmspectrum.com/?p=21740|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2014/7/screen-test|title=American Film|website=americanfilm.afi.com|access-date=2019-02-17|archive-date=February 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218021528/https://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2014/7/screen-test|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nKubrick once said of his decision to make a war film: \"One of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual or our contemporary society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and which can be used as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallise and come out into the open. Conflict is natural, when it would in a less critical situation have to be introduced almost as a contrivance, and would thus appear forced or, even worse, false.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Paul |year=2003 |title=Stanley Kubrick: The Complete Films |location=K\u00f6ln |publisher=Taschen GmbH |isbn=978-3836527750 |oclc=51839483 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XBQi4cCEYNIC |page=11 |access-date=December 20, 2014 |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826091619/https://books.google.com/books?id=XBQi4cCEYNIC |url-status=live }} Alternately titled ''Stanley Kubrick: Visual Poet, 1928\u20131999''.</ref>\n\nAlthough Kubrick's previous film ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' had failed at the box office, it had managed to land on several critical top-ten lists for the year. [[Dore Schary]], then head of production at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], liked the film and hired Kubrick and Harris to develop film stories from MGM's slush pile of scripts and purchased novels. Finding nothing they liked, Kubrick remembered reading Cobb's book at the age of 14 and the \"great impact\" it had upon him and suggested it as their next project.<ref name=\"auto\">Kelly, A.

The last scenes filmed were those that take place on the battlefield. For the construction of the battlefield, Kubrick hired 5,000 square yards (0.4 hectares) of land from a local farmer.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It took Kubrick a month to set up the filming of the assault, arranging props and tearing up the field to look like a war zone. For the filming of the battle sequence, the battlefield was divided into five regions where explosive charges were specifically placed. This made it easier for Kubrick to film the dying of extras as he split the extras into five groups, one for each of the regions, and each man would die in his own zone by an explosion that was near him.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nAn early critical test of Kubrick's obsession with control on the set came during the making of ''Paths of Glory''. As recalled by Kirk Douglas:\n{{blockquote|He made the veteran actor Adolphe Menjou do the same scene 17 times. \"That was my best reading.\" Menjou announced. \"I think we can break for lunch now.\" It was well past the usual lunch time but Kubrick said he wanted another take. Menjou went into an absolute fury. In front of Douglas and the entire crew he blasted off on what he claimed was Kubrick's dubious parentage and made several other unprintable references to Kubrick's relative greenness in the art of directing actors. Kubrick merely listened calmly and after Menjou had spluttered to an uncomplimentary conclusion said quietly: \"All right, let's try the scene once more.\" With utter docility, Menjou went back to work. \"Stanley instinctively knew what to do,\" Douglas says.<ref name=Alpert/>}}\n\nThe only female character in the film, the woman who sings \"[[The Faithful Hussar]]\", is portrayed by German actress [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane Harlan]] (credited in the film as Susanne Christian). An affecting scene towards the end of the film shows actress Harlan briefly appearing to sing a German song, timidly evoking emotion in both the audience and the soldiers. She and Kubrick later married; the couple remained together until his death in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/falling-in-love-with-a-story-christiane-kubrick-on-the-legacy-of-stanley-kubrick|title=Falling In Love With A Story: Christiane Kubrick on the Legacy of Stanley Kubrick|website=kcet|date=October 30, 2012|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215220210/https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/falling-in-love-with-a-story-christiane-kubrick-on-the-legacy-of-stanley-kubrick|url-status=live}}</ref> It was on set that they originally had met.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n====Kubrick's use of visual imagery and mise-en-scene====\n\n''Paths of Glory'' employs both camera-work and audio cues to create a sense of realism, thus making it easier for the audience to sympathise with the plight of the accused soldiers. In the beginning of the film a snare drum plays, and the music is reminiscent of war era newsreels. During the battle sequences, the camera keeps pace with the soldiers but in other ways, the shots look like old trench warfare footage from World War I. The film's choice of black and white further emphasises its similarity to the actual newsreels of the conflict.\n\nKubrick's vision of war was far bleaker than that of some other films of the era, which also influenced the director's choice to shoot the picture in black and white. The visuals also allow the audience to see the difference between \"life in the trenches\" and \"life in the command\". From the opulent mansion of the high-ranking officers, the audience notices wide shots from the exterior and the interior. The viewer misses nothing; every decadent piece of furniture, jewelry or bauble that the senior officers have, in sharp contrast to the trenches where the shots are much tighter. Close ups and point-of-view shots (e.g. from Colonel Dax's perspective) are cramped and tight, suffocating for the audience. Switching to a shot in front of Dax's person, e.g. a walking shot, the audience becomes much like the other soldiers accompanying him in the trenches, feeling stuck and trapped in the confined and dangerous space.<ref>{{Citation|last=Indie Film Hustle|title=Stanley Kubrick: Paths of Glory & Kirk Douglas Years (The Directors Series) \u2013 Indie Film Hustle|date=2018-01-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XohngVy9cho| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109023545/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XohngVy9cho| archive-date=2020-11-09 | url-status=dead|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Score and use of sounds===\nThe musical score by [[Gerald Fried]] makes extensive use of [[percussion]] instruments, specifically [[military drums]].<ref>Hischak, Thomas S.

Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, Pg. 242</ref>\n\nKubrick used sound, or the lack thereof, to build tension and suspense in the film, particularly towards the beginning when the three soldiers are given orders to check on the Anthill. This scene is in silence, with no use of diegetic/non-diegetic sound, working well to add depth and rawness. Much of what the viewer can hear throughout the film is explosions in the distance and the sound of a whistle being blown, further adding to the overall documentary style of the film. The lack of a big bold score gives no suggestion of heroism to the plot of the film, and the sounds of people dying are a common trope associated with Stanley Kubrick's films. The song towards the ending happens within the narrative.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xz99CAAAQBAJ&q=paths+&pg=PA242|title=The Encyclopedia of Film Composers|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|date=2015-04-16|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442245501|language=ar|access-date=October 5, 2020|archive-date=April 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415222244/https://books.google.com/books?id=Xz99CAAAQBAJ&q=paths+&pg=PA242|url-status=live}}</ref> In the tavern with the French soldiers of Dax's regiment, a young woman sings a traditional German folk song of that era, [[The Faithful Hussar|\"Der treue Husar\"]]. With Kubrick's use of mise-en-scene, the audience is able to see the German woman's performance bring the men to tears through various close-ups and angles. The troopers begin to hum and eventually sing along to the tune in an expression of their basic humanity. ''Paths of Glory'' later ends in the same way it began with the familiar snare/drum roll used in the opening, indicative of a lack of change throughout the film. Kubrick's use of sounds and song functions as a kind of narration for the audience, linking each sound to a later or earlier scene in the film.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haft|first=Nima|title=Similarities and differences on Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket|url=https://www.academia.edu/20223220|language=en|journal=|access-date=February 17, 2019|archive-date=July 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220719035629/https://www.academia.edu/20223220|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its \"world premiere\" in [[Munich]], Germany on November 1, 1957<ref name=\"MPDnov4\">[https://archive.org/details/motionpicturedai82unse_0/page/n206/mode/1up? \"'Paths' Opens Dec. 20\"], ''Motion Picture Daily'', November 4, 1957, p. 3.

In particular, Crowther draws attention to the story's execution scene, which he describes as \"one of the most craftily directed and emotionally lacerating that we have ever seen.\" He does, though, also identify two \"troubling flaws\" that he saw in the film, one being within the \"realm of technique\", the other within the \"realm of significance\":<ref name=\"NYT\"/>{{blockquote|We feel that Mr. Kubrick{{snd}}and Mr. Douglas{{snd}}have made a damaging mistake in playing it in [[wikt:Special:Search/conversational|colloquial]] English, with American accents and attitudes, while studiously making it look as much as possible like a document of the French Army in World War I.

In its March 18, 1958 edition, the ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' summarizes the release as \"a grim, forceful story, presented in blunt, unvarnished fashion, entirely lacking in the customary cliches, deftly directed.\"<ref>Tinee, Mae (1958). \"Film Indicts 2 Soldiers of World War I\", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', March 18, 1958, p. a5.

Schallert, a fellow critic of Philip Scheuer at the ''Los Angeles Times'', also attended the film's first screening in Los Angeles on December 20, 1957. The following day the newspaper published Schallert's evaluation, which begins by classifying ''Paths of Glory'' as \"A minor contribution but an interesting one to the war effort on the screen\".<ref name=\"Schallert57\">Schallert, Philip (1957). \"'Paths Of Glory Evidences Power In Its Court-Martial\", ''Los Angeles Times'', December 21, 1957, p. B3. Retrieved via ProQuest, July 26, 2022.</ref> Next he describes the drama's storyline in some detail before addressing specifically the film's final scene, which he found odd and disconnected in its presentation so soon after \"the grim gray execution\". \"Susanne Christian\", Schallert writes, \"is seen as the German girl forced to sing to a huge body of [French] troops right at the end of the picture{{snd}}a peculiar sort of payoff for the miscarriage of justice to which the whole gathering of men seems to be oblivious.\"<ref name=\"Schallert57\"/> He then concludes, \"'Paths of Glory' is a commendably sincere picture, very well told for the most part, though it does not fulfill itself in the best screen and entertainment terms. It is practically like a documentary.\"<ref name=\"Schallert57\"/>\n\nThe review in ''Harrison's Reports'' addressed the ending as well, maintaining that it was the \"picture's one weak spot\", was \"difficult to understand\", and \"leaves one with a feeling that it is inconclusive\".<ref name=\"HR57\"/> The journal then offered its own interpretation of the final scenes. From ''Harrison's'' perspective, as Colonel Dax is returning to his quarters after his confrontations with his superior officers, \"he notices his soldiers enjoying themselves in a cafe. It disgusts him to think that they had so quickly forgotten their executed comrades, but he compassionately realizes that life must go on.\"<ref name=\"HR57\"/> Whitney Williams in ''Variety'' also commented about the film's finale, noting that it \"ends so abruptly [the] audience is left with a feeling of incompletion.\"<ref name=\"Variety57a\"/>\n\nOther assorted critics in newspapers and trade publications viewed the film's ending and the production's significance cinematically far differently than the cited critics at the ''Los Angeles Times'' or the reviewers for ''Harrison's Reports'' and ''Variety''. Richard Gertner of the New York-based trade paper ''[[Motion Picture Daily]]'' was one of them.
