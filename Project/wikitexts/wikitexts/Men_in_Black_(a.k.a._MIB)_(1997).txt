Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] and written by [[Ed Solomon]]. Loosely based on the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] series [[The Men in Black (comics)|of a similar name]] created by [[Lowell Cunningham]] and [[Sandy Carruthers]], the film stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Will Smith]] as two agents of a secret organization called the [[Men in black|Men in Black]], who supervise [[extraterrestrial life]]forms who live on Earth and hide their existence from ordinary humans. The film featured the creature effects and makeup of [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] and visual effects by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on July 2, 1997, by [[Columbia Pictures]], and grossed over $589.3&nbsp;million worldwide against a $90&nbsp;million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film. It received positive reviews, with critics praising its script, set pieces, and the performances of Jones and Smith. The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]\u2014winning the lattermost award.\n\nThe film spawned the [[Men in Black (franchise)|''Men in Black'' franchise]], including two sequels, ''[[Men in Black II]]'' (2002) and ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012); a standalone sequel, ''[[Men in Black: International]]'' (2019); and an [[Men in Black: The Series|animated series that ran from 1997 to 2001]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THE PLOT SHORT. As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] summaries should be under 700 words. -->\n[[File:Brooklyn battery tunnel building.jpg|thumb|right|MIB headquarters in New York]]\nAt the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], two men in black suits, [[Agent K]] and Agent D, interrupt a border patrol sting. They take one of the men attempting to cross the border, who is an extraterrestrial in disguise. When it tries to attack one of the patrol officers, K is forced to shoot it and erase the memories of everyone in the group, creating a cover story of an explosion in an underground gas pipeline. Deciding that he is too old to continue working, D chooses to retire and has K erase his memory.\n\n[[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer [[Agent J|James Darrell Edwards III]] catches an unnaturally agile fleeing criminal and sees his eyes blink unusually before he leaps from the roof of the [[Guggenheim Museum]]. During his interrogation, K arrives and scouts James as a potential new partner, impressed by his ability to chase down an alien. K explains to James that their organization, the Men in Black, was founded after [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] was made with [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] in 1961; at this time Earth was established as a politically neutral zone for alien refugees.\n\nThe MIB is a secret organization that monitors and polices these aliens and uses [[neuralyzer]]s to erase the memories of anyone who witnesses alien activities. James agrees to join, taking a new identity as Agent J, and his civilian identity is erased from government records.\n\nMeanwhile, an alien crash-lands in upstate New York, kills a farmer named Edgar, and begins wearing his skin as a disguise. J and K investigate the crash site and discover this alien is a \"bug,\" an extremely dangerous, cockroach-like species. The bug kills two disguised aliens, who are sent to a police morgue overseen by coroner Laurel Weaver. J and K inspect the bodies, and J and Laurel accidentally open the head of one, revealing a small, injured alien in a control cockpit. The alien tells them \"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt.\" before dying.\n\nK neuralyzes Laurel and tells J that the other dead alien, Rosenberg, was a member of the Arquillian royal family. They question an informant, [[Frank the Pug]], who explains that Rosenberg was the guardian of a galaxy that is a precious source of sub-atomic energy; the bug killed Rosenberg to acquire it so the bugs may destroy the Arquillians. Frank also tells them that the galaxy is on Earth and is very small. An Arquillian warship enters Earth's orbit, issuing an ultimatum to MIB to give them the galaxy.\n\nJ deduces the galaxy is in a jewel on the collar of Rosenberg's cat, Orion, which is in Laurel's care. The bug reaches the same conclusion and arrives at the morgue first; it seizes and swallows the galaxy and flees with Laurel. The Arquillians, who are willing to destroy the galaxy rather than let the bugs have it, warn MIB that they will destroy Earth in one hour unless the galaxy is returned.\n\nWith all other transports locked down, J realizes the bug's only escape is the observation towers of the [[New York State Pavilion]] at [[Flushing Meadows]], which was built for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] to disguise two real flying saucers. The bug attempts to take off, but J and K shoot down the ship, and the bug sheds Edgar's skin to reveal its true form. It swallows J and K's guns, and K goads it to swallow him as well. The bug begins to board the second ship. J steps on cockroaches from a dumpster to antagonize it, stalling it until K finds his gun in its stomach and shoots it from inside. The remains of the bug attack the two, but Laurel destroys it with J's gun.\n\nAfter recovering the galaxy from the bug's remains, K admits to J that he is ready to retire from MIB and has been training J as a replacement rather than a partner. J neuralyzes K, creating a cover story that he was in a coma for 35 years. Laurel joins MIB as J's new partner, Agent L. The entire Milky Way galaxy proves to be contained within a marble that a giant alien is using to play a game.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Agent K|Kevin Brown / Agent K]]: J's grizzled and humorless mentor. [[Clint Eastwood]] turned down the part, while Jones only accepted the role after [[Steven Spielberg]] promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg's track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said \"stank\", feeling it did not capture the tone of the comic.<ref name=hughes/>\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Agent J|James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J]]: A former NYPD detective, newly recruited to the MIB. Smith was cast because [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s wife was a fan of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]''.<ref name=hughes/> The studio preferred [[Chris O'Donnell]] for the role, fresh off his portrayal of [[Dick Grayson]], whom he played in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', and Spielberg told Sonnenfeld to take him to dinner to convince him to do it. However, Sonnenfeld got him to not accept the role by saying that he was not a good director and that the script was one O'Donnell should skip.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/men-in-black-how-chris-o-donnell-was-dissuaded-from-taking-a-lead-role/ | title=Men in Black: How Chris O'Donnell Was Dissuaded from Taking a Lead Role | date=July 5, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Summer Movie Preview |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 16, 1997 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287928,00.html |access-date=September 17, 2007 |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014234550/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287928,00.html |url-status=live}}</ref> [[David Schwimmer]] also turned down the part.<ref name=hughes/><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/men-in-black-david-schwimmer-on-turning-down-the-lead-role/</ref> Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer.\n* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent L: A deputy medical examiner, and later J's partner.\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Edgar / The Bug: A farmer who is killed and eaten by a giant alien insect, which then wears his skin in order to search for the Galaxy and destroy the Arquillians.

Producers [[Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] optioned the rights to ''The Men in Black'' in 1992, and hired [[Ed Solomon]] to write a very faithful script. Parkes and MacDonald wanted [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' and its sequel ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. However, Sonnenfeld was attached to ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), so they instead approached [[Les Mayfield]] (best known for his remake of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]''). Mayfield was briefly attached before it fell through. [[John Landis]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] were asked to direct but each declined.<ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/men-in-black-behind-the-scenes-battles/%3famp {{dead link|date=July 2022}}</ref> As a result, ''Men in Black'' was delayed so as to allow Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after ''Get Shorty''.<ref name=hughes>{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Comic Book Movies | publisher = [[Virgin Books]] | year = 2003 | location = London | pages = 123\u2013129 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the initial script drafts were set underground, with locations ranging from [[Kansas]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Nevada]]. Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City, because the director felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised, terming the movie as \"''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' with aliens\". He also felt much of the city's structures resembled [[flying saucer]]s and [[Space vehicle|rocket ships]].<ref name=hughes/> One of the locations Sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the [[Brooklyn\u2013Battery Tunnel]], which became the outside of the MIB headquarters.<ref name=met/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in March 1996. Many last-minute changes ensued during production. First, the scene where James Edwards chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], but the [[New York Philharmonic]] decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings, prompting Sonnenfeld to film the scene at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] instead. Then, five months into the shoot, Sonnenfeld decided that the original ending, with a humorous [[Existentialism|existential]] debate between Agent J and the Bug, was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had.<ref name=met>\"Metamorphosis of 'Men in Black'\", ''Men in Black'' Blu-ray</ref> Five potential replacements were discussed. One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent.<ref name=hughes/> Eventually it boiled down to the Bug eating K and fighting J, replacing the [[animatronic]] Bug [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]'s crew had developed with a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] Bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach. The whole action sequence cost an extra $4.5&nbsp;million to the filmmakers.<ref name=met/>\n\nFurther changes were made during post-production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy. The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians, ending a long war. The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war. Through changing of subtitles, the images on M.I.B.'s main computer and Frank the Pug's dialogue, the Baltians were eliminated from the plot. Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy.<ref name=hughes/> These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film's post-production, but the film's novelization still contains the Baltians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55992|title=Things Get A Bit Heated Between The Infamous Billy The Kidd And Director Barry Sonnenfeld When They Talk MEN IN BLACK 3|author=Donnelly, Billy|website=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=May 25, 2012|access-date=May 25, 2012|archive-date=May 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527125445/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55992|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Design and visual effects===\nProduction designer [[Bo Welch]] designed the MIB headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization is formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect [[Eero Saarinen]], who designed a terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. As the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport.<ref name=hughes/>\n\n[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] was approached to provide the prosthetic and animatronic aliens, many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid. For example, the reveal of Gentle Rosenberg's Arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck's skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head. Baker would describe ''Men in Black'' as the most complex production in his career, \"requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together\".<ref name=met/> Baker had to have approval from both Sonnenfeld and Spielberg: \"It was like, 'Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one, so why don't you do a mix and match?' And I'd say, because it wouldn't make any sense.\" Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film's aesthetic during pre-production: \"I started out saying aliens shouldn't be what humans perceive them to be. Why do they need eyes? So Rick did these great designs, and I'd say, 'That's great \u2014 but how do we know where he's looking?' I ended up where everyone else did, only I took three months.\"<ref>{{cite magazine | author = Steve Daly | title = Men in Black: How'd they do that? | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-18 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288677,00.html | access-date = 2007-09-17 | archive-date = 2007-10-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014234555/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288677,00.html | url-status = live }}</ref> The maquettes built by Baker's team would later be digitized by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], who was responsible for the visual effects and computer-generated imagery, for more mobile digital versions of the aliens.<ref name=met/>\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Men in Black: The Album}}\nTwo different soundtracks for the film were released: a [[film score|score]] soundtrack featuring music composed by [[Danny Elfman]] and an [[Men in Black: The Album|album]] of songs used in and inspired by the film, featuring [[Will Smith]]'s original song \"[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]\" based on the film's plot.\n\nElfman's music was called \"rousing\" by the [[Los Angeles Times]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |date=July 1, 1997 |title=The Outer Limits of Fun |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-jul-01-ca-8496-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=September 24, 2019 |quote=...its charm is in its attitude and premise (and Danny Elfman's rousing score)... |archive-date=September 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926040332/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-jul-01-ca-8496-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] called the film a technical marvel, giving special credit to \"Elfman's always lively score.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=June 29, 1997 |title=Reviews: Men in Black |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/men-in-black-1117432622/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=September 25, 2019 |quote=Technically, the film is a marvel...
