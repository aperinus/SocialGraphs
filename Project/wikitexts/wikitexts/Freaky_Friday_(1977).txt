The film stars [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] and [[Jodie Foster]] in the lead roles. [[John Astin]], [[Patsy Kelly]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Sorrell Booke]] and [[Charlene Tilton]] are featured in supporting roles. In the film, a mother and her daughter switch their bodies, and they get a taste of each other's lives. The cause of the switch is left unexplained in this film, but occurs on Friday the 13th, when Ellen and Annabel, in different places, say about each other at the same time, \"I wish I could switch places with her for just one day.\" Rodgers added a [[water skiing]] subplot to her screenplay.\n\n''Freaky Friday'' was released theatrically in the United States on January 21, 1977, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. The film received positive reviews from critics with praise for Foster and Harris\u2019s performances and was a box office success, grossing $36 million on a $5 million budget. At the [[34th Golden Globe Awards]], it received three nominations: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Comedy or Musical]] (for both Foster and Harris), and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"I'd Like to Be You for a Day\").\n\n==Plot==\nEllen Andrews ([[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]]) and her daughter, Annabel ([[Jodie Foster]]) constantly quarrel. Following a disagreement on Thursday, before [[Friday the 13th]], Annabel leaves to join a friend at a local diner. In sync, Annabel and Ellen (who is in the family home's kitchen) both wish aloud, \"I wish I could switch places with her for just one day.\" Their wish comes true when their bodies are switched. After a brief scene where they are shocked at seeing their new appearances, both ladies proceed as each other normally would.\n\nAnnabel is now a housewife, tending to laundry, car repair, grocery deliveries, carpet cleaners, dry cleaners, her housemaid, and the family [[Basset hound]], Max. As though Annabel did not have her hands full, Bill Andrews ([[John Astin]]) coerces her to cook dinner for twenty-five people as his catered dinner party plans fell through. Annabel enlists Boris ([[Marc McClure]]), a neighbor on whom she has harbored a crush, to look after her younger brother and help make a [[chocolate mousse]] but all three manage to mess everything up, then later saving face by making everything into a [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]]. Annabel does have a bright spot with her brother, Ben, such as getting to have personal discussions with him, when she picks him up from school. He tells her which qualities he envies about Annabel, and is able to share her loathing over the housemaid, who is constantly complaining about Annabel's sloppiness, and then confesses when he tried to be messy to connect with Annabel, the housemaid said he didn't know better and cleaned up after him. Plus, between all the talks, they play [[baseball]] which improves their relationship. Annabel later remorses for misjudging Ben and getting a different outlook on him.\n\nMeanwhile Ellen, now a high school student, struggles with [[marching band]], destroys her entire typing class's [[electric typewriter]]s, exposes her photography class's developing [[Photographic film|film]], and loses a [[field hockey]] game. However, Ellen does have one bright point, in a U.S. history class where she accurately recounts the [[Korean War]], having lived through the 1950s as a little girl. In an effort to escape school, Ellen (as Annabel) runs to Bill's office. There, she encounters Bill's new attractive, young, and immodestly dressed secretary. Ellen attempts to intimidate the young woman by sharing how frightening \"her mother\" is. This effort appeared successful as the secretary adopts more modest clothing, glasses, and an unflattering hairstyle. Ellen (as Annabel) asks Bill for access to his [[credit card]] in order to make herself over as her braces were scheduled to be removed that afternoon. Bill approves and chalks up his secretary's awkward appearance to personal problems at home as her son is sick and her husband was wounded in the Vietnam War, causing Ellen to scold herself for not trusting her husband.\n\nThe day ends in a comical twist when the mother-daughter pair wishing a new request: to return to themselves. This does happen, although in a different manner than before. They are physically transferred, with Annabel suddenly sitting now behind the wheel of a car with Ben and Boris, with none of them knowing how to drive and attracting the attention of several squad cars. Ellen in turn finds herself [[water skiing]] as she (as Annabel) was scheduled to participate in an [[wikt:aquacade|aquacade]]. Bill, who has prospective clients at the aquacade, fears unemployment as he sees Ellen flailing helplessly on skis, but her antics amuse the clients so much that Bill wins the account.\n\nWith a new understanding of each other's lives, mother and daughter forgive each other. Following the events of Freaky Friday, Annabel begins dating Boris. Bill is playing [[card game|cards]] with Ellen, still trying to understand what happened. Ellen and Bill are fine with Boris taking Annabel to a [[pizza|pizzeria]] for a date, and Annabel surprises Ben by letting him tag along with them. Ben complains that he never gets to do fun stuff like his dad, who is getting ready for a business trip the following Saturday [[Types of motorcycles#Off-road|dirt biking]] with a Japanese [[motorcycle]] firm looking to enter the U.S. market, while Bill says Ben should be more appreciative of a worry-free childhood. Ben remarks he would love to spend one Saturday in his dad's shoes, while Bill says the same about Ben, causing Annabel and Ellen to get nervous and suggest that Bill and Ben do not want to switch places, but they simultaneously and indignantly say \"Oh, yes, I do!\", much to Ellen and Annabel's chagrin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Annabel Andrews/Ellen Andrews\n* [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Ellen Andrews/Annabel Andrews\n* [[John Astin]] as Mr. Bill Andrews\n* [[Patsy Kelly]] as Mrs. Schmauss\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as Harold Jennings\n* Vicki Schreck as Virginia\n* [[Sorrell Booke]] as Mr. Dilk, the Principal\n* [[Kaye Ballard]] as Coach Betsy\n* [[Sparky Marcus]] as Ben Andrews\n* [[Marc McClure]] as Boris Harris\n* [[Charlene Tilton]] as Bambi\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] as Mr. Joffert\n* [[Ruth Buzzi]] as Opposing Coach\n* [[Marie Windsor]] as Mrs. Murphy\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Carpet Cleaner\n* [[Al Molinaro]] as Drapery Man\n* [[Iris Adrian]] as Bus Passenger\n* [[Jack Sheldon]] as Lloyd\n* [[Laurie Main]] as Mr. Mills\n* [[Fritz Feld]] as Mr. Jackman\n* [[Dermott Downs]] as Harvey Manager\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\nNeither Barbara Harris nor Jodie Foster did any actual water skiing in the film.
