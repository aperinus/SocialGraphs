It stars [[Will Ferrell]] as the title character, a human raised by [[Christmas elf|Santa's elves]], who learns about his origins and heads to [[New York City]] to meet his biological father. [[James Caan]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]], and [[Bob Newhart]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n''Elf'' was released in the United States on November 7, 2003, and became a major critical and commercial success, grossing $220 million worldwide against a $33 million budget. Ferrell's performance as Buddy the Elf was praised by critics and audiences alike, with many calling it one of his best performances. The film inspired the 2010 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Elf (Broadway musical)|Elf: The Musical]]'' and [[NBC]]'s 2014 [[stop motion]] animated television special ''[[Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas]]''. It is often listed among the greatest Christmas films of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetoptens.com/top-christmas-movies/ |title=Top Ten Christmas Movies Of All Time |website=TheTopTens.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-christmas-movies/ |title=The 50 Best Christmas Movies of All Time |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-christmas-movies-of-all-time |title=The 50 Best Christmas Movies of All Time |author=Dan Jackson |date=December 22, 2017 |website=Thrillist |access-date=December 11, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP: FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], a baby at an [[orphanage]] crawls into [[Santa Claus]]' sack and is unknowingly taken back to the North Pole. After the child is discovered at the [[Santa's workshop|workshop]], the elves name him Buddy after his diaper's brand label and Papa Elf adopts him. Buddy is accepted by the elf community and grows up thinking that he is an elf, but soon learns he is really a human. Papa Elf explains that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and that Susan put him up for adoption prior to her death. Walter now works as a children's book publisher at the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]], unaware of Buddy's existence. Santa reveals that Walter is on the Naughty List due to his selfishness, but suggests Buddy could help redeem Walter.\n\nBuddy travels to New York and finds Walter at work, but Walter mistakes him for a [[Singing telegram|Christmas-gram]] messenger and has him ejected. Buddy heads to a local [[Gimbels]] department store and meets Jovie, an unenthusiastic employee with whom he is instantly smitten. Hearing that Santa will be at the store the following day, Buddy redecorates the store overnight. However, upon realizing that the Gimbels Santa is not the genuine article, Buddy unmasks him and causes a brawl in the store that the manager breaks up.\n\nWalter reluctantly bails Buddy out of the police station and takes him for a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]], confirming that Buddy is his biological son. Dr. Leonardo convinces Walter to take Buddy home to meet his [[stepmother]] Emily and half-brother Michael. Walter and Michael are unnerved by Buddy's strange behavior, but Emily insists that they care for him until he \"recovers\". Michael warms up to Buddy after they defeat a gang of bullies in a snowball fight and encourages Buddy to ask Jovie out on a date. During the date, the two fall in love.\n\nMeanwhile, Walter's publishing company is failing after their latest book flops. Walter's boss, Fulton Greenway, expects Walter to have a new book ready by Christmas Eve. Walter and his team secure a meeting with best-selling children's author Miles Finch, but Buddy interrupts the meeting and mistakes  Finch, who has [[dwarfism]], for an elf. Buddy unintentionally insults Finch before the latter attacks him and leaves the meeting, upon which Walter loses his temper and harshly disowns Buddy. Heartbroken, Buddy writes an apology note on an [[Etch A Sketch]] and leaves Walter's apartment.\n\nUpon finding Finch's notebook full of ideas, Walter and his team scramble to create a book to pitch. As Walter prepares to pitch the book to Greenway, Michael arrives and informs Walter of Buddy's departure. Realizing his mistake, Walter quits his job and walks out with Michael to find Buddy. Meanwhile, Buddy sees Santa's sleigh crash in [[Central Park]], attracting a large crowd. Santa explains that the sleigh's engine is lost and cannot fly without it due to a shortage of Christmas spirit.\n\nBuddy finds the engine and reunites with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy for how he treated him and accepts him as his son. After he takes them to meet Santa, Michael takes Santa's list and reads it in front of television news cameras gathered outside the park, proving that Santa is real. A group of Central Park Rangers, who are angry at Santa for placing them on the Naughty List, chase the sleigh as Buddy tries to reattach the engine. Jovie leads the crowd and those watching on television in singing \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\", raising enough Christmas spirit to fully power the sleigh without the engine.\n\nBy the following Christmas, Buddy writes a book about his life, which becomes a bestseller and allows Walter to establish his own publishing company. Buddy also marries Jovie and brings their newborn daughter Susie to visit Papa Elf.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Buddy Hobbs, aka \"Buddy the Elf\", an eccentric human who was raised by Santa's elves. \n* [[James Caan]] as Walter Hobbs, a children's book publisher and Buddy's biological father.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Jovie, an unenthusiastic worker at [[Gimbels]] and Buddy's love interest.\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Emily Hobbs, Walter's wife, Michael's mother and Buddy's stepmother.\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Papa Elf, Buddy's adoptive father and the narrator.\n* [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]] as [[Santa Claus]], a holiday figure who finds Buddy in his sack and gives him to Papa Elf to raise.\n* [[Daniel Tay]] as Michael Hobbs, Walter and Emily's son and Buddy's younger half-brother.\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Wanda, the manager of Gimbels and Jovie's boss.\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Miles Finch, a best-selling children's author who attacks Buddy for (mistakenly) calling him an elf.\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Deb, Walter Hobbs' secretary.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Fulton Greenway, Walter Hobbs' controlling and uncaring boss and the CEO of Greenway Press.\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Morris, a co-worker of Walter Hobbs.\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as Eugene Dupree, a co-worker of Walter Hobbs.\n* [[Artie Lange]] as the Fake Santa, a Mall Santa with whom Buddy gets into an altercation because he is not the real Santa Claus.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Dr. Ben Leonardo, the Hobbs family's [[pediatrician]].\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as Eye Witness.\n* [[Peter Billingsley]] as Ming Ming (uncredited), the head elf in Santa's workshop.\n* [[Mark Acheson]] as a mailroom worker.\n* [[David Paul Grove]] as Pom Pom, an elf on whom Buddy faints when he discovers he's a human.\n}}\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Leon Redbone]] as Leon the Snowman, a snowman who lives at the North Pole.\n* [[Ray Harryhausen]] as Polar Bear Cub\n* Jon Favreau as the Baby [[Walrus]] (uncredited), Mr. [[Narwhal]] (uncredited) and the Arctic [[Puffin]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n* [[Maurice LaMarche]] as Buddy's Burp (uncredited)<ref name=lamarche />\n* [[Dallas McKennon]] as the Jack-in-the-Box (uncredited, archive audio){{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[David Berenbaum]] initially wrote the script in 1993, with [[Chris Farley]] and [[Jim Carrey]] being early candidates to play Buddy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite episode|title=Elf|series=The Holiday Movies That Made Us|network=[[Netflix]]|date=1 December 2020|season=1|number=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Elf |url=https://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-elf/ |website=TheFW |access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mullins|first=Jenna|title=NEWS/ 56 Facts You May Not Know About Your Favorite Holiday Films|date=December 18, 2014|work=[[E!
