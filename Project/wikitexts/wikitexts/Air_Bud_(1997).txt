After school, Josh practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up behind an abandoned church, where he meets a runaway [[Golden Retriever]] with the uncanny ability to play basketball. Josh names him Buddy and decides to take him home. Jackie agrees to let Buddy stay with them until Christmas. Once the holidays arrive, Jackie allows Josh to keep Buddy as a Christmas present.\n\nAt school, Josh earns the disdain of star basketball player and team bully Larry Willingham, but befriends the kindhearted maintenance engineer, Arthur Chaney, and discovers he was a retired pro player. With Chaney's encouragement, Josh earns a place on the school basketball team, the Timberwolves, much to the reservation of the team's competitive coach, Joe Barker. At his first game, he befriends teammate Tom Stewart. Buddy escapes and shows up at school while the game is underway. The audience loves him after he scores a basket.\n\nBarker is later fired after being caught bullying Tom over his poor game performance, and is replaced by Arthur, at Josh's suggestion. As coach, Arthur uses unconventional practices which emphasize the need for players to work as a team instead of focusing on themselves. When Larry is subbed out at the team's next game due to his ball-hogging and unsportsmanlike conduct, his father forces him to leave the team and join their rival. Buddy becomes the mascot of the school's basketball team and appears in their halftime shows. After the Timberwolves lose one game, the team has subsequent success and qualifies for the State Finals.\n\nJust before the championship game, Buddy's former owner, a rude party clown and a very grumpy alcoholic named Norm Snively, appears after seeing Buddy on television. Hoping to profit off Buddy's newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy as he has papers proving that he is the dog's legal owner. Knowing they do not have a choice, Jackie makes Josh give Buddy back to Snively. After a period of feeling withdrawn and depressed, Josh sneaks into Snively's backyard and frees Buddy from his chain. Snively pursues them in his dilapidated pickup truck before crashing into a lake. Josh then decides to protect Buddy by setting him free in the forest to find a new life.\n\nWhen an injury leaves the Timberwolves with four players, the team suffers at the championships. Buddy shows up, and when it is discovered that there is no rule preventing a dog from playing basketball, he joins the roster to lead the team to victory.\n\nDespite losing his papers from the car wreck, Snively attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy, and Chaney suggests that Buddy choose his owner. As a fan of Chaney himself, Judge Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the lawn. Buddy attacks Snively and chooses Josh. Cranfield grants custody of Buddy to Josh as a ranting and raving Snively is carried away by the police and thrown in jail for contempt of court, while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Josh Framm\n* [[Air Buddy]] as Himself\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Norm Snively\n* [[Wendy Makkena]] as Jackie Framm\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Coach Arthur Chaney\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Judge Cranfield\n* [[Nicola Cavendish]] as Principal Pepper\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Larry Willingham\n* [[Norman Browning]] as Buck Willingham\n* [[Stephen E.
