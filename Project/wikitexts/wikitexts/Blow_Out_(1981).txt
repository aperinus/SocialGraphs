[[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes [[John Lithgow]] and [[Dennis Franz]]. The film's tagline in advertisements was, \"Murder has a sound all of its own\".\n\nDirectly based on [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'', the film replaces the medium of photography with the medium of audio recording. The concept of ''Blow Out'' came to De Palma while he was working on the thriller ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1980). The film was shot in the late autumn and winter of 1980 in various Philadelphia locations on a relatively substantial budget of $18 million.\n\n''Blow Out'' opened to minuscule audience interest at the time of release despite receiving a mostly positive critical reception. The lead performances by Travolta and Allen, the direction by De Palma and the visual style were cited as the strongest points of the film. Critics also recognised the stylistic and narrative connection to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], whom De Palma admires, and [[giallo]] films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/blow-out/41751/blow-out-and-why-cinema-needs-shock-endings |title=Blow Out, and why cinema needs shock endings |last=Lambie |first=Ryan |date=July 4, 2016 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |location=London |access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodygoodhorror.com/bgh/reviews/blow-out |title=Blow Out (Movie Review) |author=Andy |date=November 5, 2015 |website=Bloody Good Horror |access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref> Over the years since its initial theatrical release, it has developed status as a [[cult film]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com/2009/08/cult-movie-review-blow-out-1981.html|title=CULT MOVIE REVIEW: Blow Out (1981)|date=21 August 2009}}</ref> and received a home media release by [[the Criterion Collection]],<ref>[https://vimeo.com/32157811 Brian De Palma's Blow Out blu-ray menu animation on Vimeo]</ref> a company which specializes in \"important classic and contemporary film\", which re-ignited public interest in the film. [[Quentin Tarantino]] praises De Palma as the \"greatest director of his generation\" and cites ''Blow Out'' as  one of his three favorite films that he would take to a desert island.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile in [[post-production]] on the low-budget [[slasher film]] ''Co-ed Frenzy'', [[Philadelphia]] sound technician Jack Terry (Travolta) is told by his producer Sam to obtain a more realistic-sounding scream and better wind effects. While recording potential [[sound effect]]s at a local park, he sees a car careen off the road and plunge into a nearby creek. The male driver is killed, but Jack manages to rescue a young woman named Sally Bedina (Allen) and accompanies her to a hospital. There, a detective interviews Jack about the accident, and Jack asks Sally out for a drink. He learns that [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] George McRyan was driving the car and that Sally was his [[Call girl|escort]]. Associates of McRyan attempt to conceal Sally's involvement, and persuade Jack to smuggle her out of the hospital.\n\nJack listens to the audio tape he recorded of the accident, wherein he distinctly hears a gunshot just before the tire blow-out that caused the accident, suspecting that the accident was actually an [[assassination]]. He learns from a news report that, seemingly coincidentally, Manny Karp (Franz) was also in the park that night and filmed the accident with a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]]. When Karp sells stills from his film to a local [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], Jack splices them together into a crude movie, syncs them with his recorded audio and finds a visible flash and smoke from the fired gun. Though initially reluctant, Sally eventually agrees to cooperate with Jack to privately investigate the incident. When they go out for a drink, Jack reveals how he left his prior career as part of a government commission to root out police corruption after a wiretap operation he was involved in led to the death of an undercover cop named Freddie Corso.\n\nUnbeknownst to Jack, Sally and Karp were both frequent blackmail co-conspirators who were hired as part of a larger plot against presidential hopeful McRyan. A rival candidate had hired Burke (Lithgow) to hook McRyan with a prostitute, take unflattering pictures of the pair, and publish them so that McRyan would drop out of the race. However, Burke decided to alter the plan by blowing out the tire of McRyan's car with a gunshot, thereby causing the accident. When the authorities arrived to find McRyan with Sally, Karp would be there to film it all. After botching the [[cover-up]] of Sally by murdering a look-alike, Burke murders two more look-alike women with piano wire and attributes the deaths to a [[serial killer]], \"the [[Liberty Bell]] Strangler\", so that he can cover up the cover-up when Sally is successfully murdered.\n\nTo help Jack investigate McRyan's murder, Sally steals Karp's film, which, when synced to Jack's audio, clearly reveals the gunshot that precipitated the blow-out. Nevertheless, nobody believes Jack's story and a seemingly widespread conspiracy immediately silences his every move. Local talk-show host Frank Donahue (Curt May) asks to interview Jack on air and release his tapes, to which Jack eventually agrees. Burke follows the development through a tap on Jack's phone, calls Sally as Donahue, and asks her to meet him at a train station with the tapes. When Sally tells Jack about Donahue's call, he becomes suspicious. He copies the audio tapes, but is unable to copy the film before Sally's meeting.\n\nShadowing a wired Sally from a distance, Jack is alarmed to see that his supposed contact is actually Burke. Immediately realizing that she is in danger, Jack attempts to warn her, but Sally and Burke slip out of range and into a parade. Jack manically dashes across the city, attempting to head them off and rescue Sally, but crashes his [[Jeep]] and is knocked out. By the time he awakens, Burke has gotten the film from Sally and thrown it into a river. He then takes Sally to a rooftop and attacks her. Still listening in on his earpiece, Jack spots them. He startles Burke and manages to stab him to death with his own weapon, but it is too late: he has already strangled Sally. A devastated Jack takes her lifeless body in his arms.\n\nBurke's death, combined with the loss of the film, ties up the last loose end. Jack's audio tapes alone are insufficient to prove a gunshot and the cover-up is successful. Jack begins repeatedly listening to the recording of Sally's voice, becoming obsessed with it. In the last scene, he is back in the editing room and has used Sally's death scream in the slasher film. Ecstatic that Jack found the perfect scream, Sam plays it multiple times, forcing Jack to cover his ears.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Travolta]] as Jack Terry\n*[[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Sally Bedina\n*[[John Lithgow]] as Burke\n*[[Dennis Franz]] as Manny Karp\n*Peter Boyden as Sam\n*Curt May as Frank Donahue\n*John Aquino as Detective Mackey\n*[[John McMartin]] as Lawrence Henry\n*[[Robin Sherwood]] as Betty\n*[[Michael Tearson]] as Hawker\n\n==Production==\nAfter completing ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', De Palma was considering several projects, including ''[[Act of Vengeance (1986 film)|Act of Vengeance]]'' (later produced for [[HBO]] starring [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Ellen Burstyn]]), ''[[Flashdance]]'', and a script of his own titled ''Personal Effects''.<ref name=\"Bouzereau\">{{cite book |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |title=The De Palma Cut: The Films of America's Most Controversial Director |publisher=Dembner Books |year=1988 |location=New York |isbn=0-942637-04-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/depalmacutfilmso00bouz }}</ref> The story outline for the latter was similar to what would become ''Blow Out'', but set in Canada.<ref name=\"Bouzereau\" />\n\nDe Palma scripted and filmed ''Blow Out'' in his home town of [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"Bouzereau\" /> The film's $9 million budget was high for De Palma, and Filmways spent an additional $9 million to market the film.<ref name=\"Bouzereau\" /> De Palma considered [[Al Pacino]] for the role of Jack Terry, but ultimately chose John Travolta,<ref name=\"Bouzereau\" /> who himself lobbied De Palma to cast [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] for the role of Sally Bedina (the three had previously worked together on ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]''); De Palma initially hesitated\u2014he was married to Allen at the time, and did not want her to be known for only working in his pictures\u2014but ultimately agreed.<ref name=\"Bouzereau\" /> In addition to Travolta and Allen, De Palma filled the film's cast and crew with a number of his frequent collaborators: [[Dennis Franz]] (''Dressed to Kill'', ''The Fury'', ''Body Double''); [[John Lithgow]] (''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', ''[[Raising Cain]]'' in later years); [[cinematographer]] [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] (''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]''); [[film editing|editor]] [[Paul Hirsch (film editor)|Paul Hirsch]] (''[[Hi, Mom!]]'', ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]''); and composer [[Pino Donaggio]] (''Carrie'', ''[[Home Movies (film)|Home Movies]]'', ''Dressed to Kill'').\n\nSeventy percent of the film was shot at night. \"Basically I just shot ''Blow Out'' straight\", replied cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, \"...
