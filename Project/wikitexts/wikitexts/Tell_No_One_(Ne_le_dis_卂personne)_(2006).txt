Written by Canet and [[Philippe Lefebvre (actor)|Philippe Lefebvre]] and starring [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]], the film won four categories at the 2007 [[C\u00e9sar Awards]] in France: Best Director ([[Guillaume Canet]]), Best Actor ([[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]]), Best Editing and Best Music Written for a Film.\n\n==Plot==\nEight years since the apparent murder of his wife Margot by a [[serial killer]], Dr. Alexandre Beck has slowly been putting his life back together. However, Alex finds himself implicated in a double homicide{{spnd}}even though he knows nothing of the crimes. The same day, Alex receives an email that appears to be from Margot, which includes a link to surveillance footage that shows his late wife looking alive and well; the message warns Alex that they are both being watched. As Alex struggles to stay one step ahead of the law, henchmen intimidate Alex's acquaintances into telling them whatever they might know about him, eventually killing a friend named Charlotte. In the meantime, Alex's [[lesbianism|lesbian]] sister Anne persuades her well-off partner H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to hire a respected attorney, \u00c9lisabeth Feldman, to handle his case.\n\nMargot attempts to arrange a meeting with Alex by sending him an email that he must read in an [[internet caf\u00e9]] to avoid being spied on. Before this meeting can take place, a warrant is issued for Alex's arrest for the murder of Charlotte. Alex goes on the run whilst his friends and lawyers struggle to find out the truth about the murder and Margot's reappearance. As he is being pursued by police officers, Alex is rescued by Bruno, a gangster from a rough part of the city who feels he owes Alex a favor. The mysterious henchmen reappear to prevent Alex's meeting with his wife, but he is rescued once again by Bruno. Margot is seen almost escaping on a flight to [[Buenos Aires]]. \u00c9lizabeth proves that Alex has an [[alibi]] for Charlotte's murder thanks to eyewitness accounts at the internet caf\u00e9.\n\nAlex notes the numerous mysteries about his wife's death{{spnd}}mysterious photos of her covered in bruises and traces of [[heroin]] in her body. He soon discovers that Margot's father faked her death: Margot had discovered that Philippe Neuville, the young son of a local aristocrat, was a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] [[Rape|rapist]] whose activities were covered up with help from the police; when she confronted him, Philippe beat her, causing the bruises. Margot's father explains that he walked in on the beating and shot Philippe. The elder Neuville hired thugs to kill Margot; having tapped the phone call, Margot's father doubled the payout for one of the thugs to fake her murder instead, kill the other thug, and knock out Alex in the process. After shooting the second thug and burying both, Margot's father used the body of a dead heroin addict to stand in for Margot's.\n\nPolice, listening in on the father's confession, attempt to arrest him, but he shoots himself dead before they can do so. It is revealed that Margot's father knew Alex was wearing a wire, and that during a moment in which he had blocked the bug's transmission had told Alex one last thing: it was in fact Margot who shot Philippe after he beat her; her father was covering up her crime, not his. His actions have ensured that she will never be suspected. Philippe's father is arrested, and Alex and Margot reunite at the lake where they fell in love as children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]]: Alexandre Beck\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]]: Margot Beck\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]]: Jacques Laurentin\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Perkins\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]]: Eric Levkowitch\n* [[Nathalie Baye]]: Ma\u00eetre Elisabeth Feldman\n* [[Jean Rochefort]]: Gilbert Neuville\n* [[Marina Hands]]: Anne Beck\n* [[Gilles Lellouche]]: Bruno\n* [[Philippe Lefebvre (actor)|Philippe Lefebvre]]: Lieutenant Philippe Meynard\n* [[Florence Thomassin]]: Charlotte Bertaud\n* [[Olivier Marchal]]: Bernard Valenti\n* [[Guillaume Canet]]: Philippe Neuville\n* [[Brigitte Catillon]]: Captain Barthas\n* [[Samir Guesmi]]: Lieutenant Saraoui\n* [[Jean-Pierre Lorit]]: Lavelle\n* [[Jalil Lespert]]: Ya\u00ebl Gonzales\n* [[\u00c9ric Savin]]: The prosecutor\n* [[\u00c9ric Naggar]]: Pierre Ferrault\n* [[Philippe Canet]]: Fran\u00e7ois Beck\n* [[Dani\u00e8le Ajoret]]: Madame Beck\n* [[Laurent Lafitte]]: The Basque\n* [[Martine Chevallier]]: Martine Laurentin\n* [[Thierry Neuvic]]: Marc Bertaud\n* [[Mika'ela Fisher]]: Zak\n* [[Anne Marivin]]: Alex's secretary\n* [[Sara Martins]]: Bruno's friend\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bertin]]: Antoinette Levkowitch\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]]: Simone\n* [[Pierre-Benoist Varoclier]]: Nurse 1\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe script made several alterations to the book; a torture expert changed from an Asian male to a white female, and the identity of the killer was switched.
