The title is a reference to the 1772 [[hymn]] \"[[Amazing Grace]]\". The film also recounts the experiences of [[John Newton]] as a crewman on a slave ship and subsequent [[religious conversion]], which inspired his writing of the poem later used in the hymn. Newton is portrayed as a major influence on Wilberforce and the abolition movement.\n\nThe film premi\u00e8red on 16 September 2006 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], followed by showings at the [[Heartland Film Festival]], the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], and the [[European Film Market]], before opening in wide US release on 23 February 2007,<ref name=\"Mojo\" /> which coincided with the 200th anniversary of the date the British parliament voted to [[Slave Trade Act 1807|ban the slave trade]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1797, William Wilberforce is severely ill and taking a recuperative holiday in [[Bath, Somerset]], with his cousin, [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]]. It is here that Wilberforce is introduced to his future wife, [[Barbara Spooner Wilberforce|Barbara Spooner]]. Although he initially resists any romantic overtures, she convinces him to relate the story of his career.\n\nThe story flashes back 15 years to 1782, and Wilberforce recounts the events that led him to where he is now. Beginning as a young, ambitious, and popular Member of Parliament (MP), he experiences a [[Born again Christian|religious enlightenment]] and aligns himself with the [[Low Church|evangelical wing]] of the [[Church of England]]. Wilberforce contemplates leaving politics to study theology, but is persuaded by his friends [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Hannah More]], and [[Olaudah Equiano]] that he will be more effective doing the work of God by taking on the unpopular and dangerous issue of the abolition of the British [[slave trade]]. His conviction in the cause deepens following a meeting with his former mentor [[John Newton]] (introduced mopping a church floor dressed in [[sackcloth]]) who is said to live \"in the company of 20,000 ghosts\u2026 slaves\". As a former slave ship captain turned Christian, he deeply regrets his past life and the effects on his fellow man. Newton urges Wilberforce to take up the cause.\n\nPitt becomes Prime Minister and Wilberforce becomes a key supporter and confidant. Pitt gives Wilberforce the opportunity to present a bill before the house outlawing the slave trade. Wilberforce's passionate campaigning leads him to become highly unpopular in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He is opposed by a coalition of MPs representing vested interests of the slave trade in London, [[Bristol]], [[Glasgow]], and [[Liverpool]] led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] and the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]]. Despite popular support and the assistance of an unlikely ally in the form of [[Charles James Fox]], Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade goes down to defeat. Afterward, the film portrays [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] as one of his few friends and allies remaining in Parliament, however even their relationship becomes strained.  Pitt, now facing the stresses of leading a [[Minority government|shaky coalition]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], tells Wilberforce that his cause must now wait for a more stable political climate.\n\nWilberforce keeps up the fight but after years of failure he is left exhausted and frustrated that he was unable to change anything in the government. Believing his life's work has been in vain, he becomes physically ill, suffering from chronic [[colitis]] which causes him to become addicted to [[laudanum]] prescribed for the crippling pain, which brings the story back up to 1797. Having virtually given up hope, Wilberforce considers leaving politics forever. Barbara convinces him to keep fighting because there is no other person who is willing or able to do so. A few days afterward, William Wilberforce and Barbara marry. Several years pass with no further success. Wilberforce's wife and new children provide him with the support and strength needed to carry on the fight.\n\nFinally, with a renewed hope for success Wilberforce devises a backdoor method of [[Fabian strategy|slowly weakening the slave trade through seemingly innocuous legislation]]. Aided by Thornton, Clarkson, and new ally [[James Stephen (British politician)|James Stephen]] and cheered on by the now terminally ill Pitt, he reintroduces his bill to abolish the slave trade. In time, after the 20-year campaign and many attempts to bring legislation forward, he is eventually responsible for a [[Slave Trade Act 1807|bill being passed through Parliament]] in 1807, which abolishes the slave trade in the [[British Empire]] forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[William Wilberforce]]\n* [[Romola Garai]] as [[Barbara Spooner Wilberforce|Barbara Spooner]]\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Pitt the Younger]]\n* [[Albert Finney]] as [[John Newton]]\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Charles James Fox]]\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as [[Thomas Clarkson]]\n* [[Youssou N'Dour]] as [[Olaudah Equiano]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as [[Banastre Tarleton]]\n* [[Toby Jones]] as [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William, Duke of Clarence]]\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Henry Thornton (reformer)|Henry Thornton]]\n* [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]] as Marianne Thornton\n* [[Jeremy Swift]] as Richard the Butler\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as [[James Stephen (British politician)|James Stephen]]\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]]\n* [[Nicholas Day (actor)|Nicholas Day]] as [[Sir William Dolben, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Dolben]]\n* [[Georgie Glen]] as [[Hannah More]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot primarily in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], Yorkshire.
