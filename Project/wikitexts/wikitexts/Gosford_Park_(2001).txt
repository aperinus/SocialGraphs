It was influenced by [[Jean Renoir]]'s French classic ''La R\u00e8gle du jeu'' (''[[The Rules of the Game]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2763687/whats-the-big-deal-the-rules-of-the-game-1939/|title=What's The Big Deal?: The Rules of the Game (1939)|last=Snider|first=Eric|date=29 March 2010|publisher=[[MTV.com]]|access-date=1 January 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film stars an  [[ensemble cast]], which includes [[Eileen Atkins]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Alan Bates]], [[Charles Dance]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Jeremy Northam]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], and [[Emily Watson]]. The story follows a party of wealthy Britons plus an American producer, and their servants, who gather for a [[Driven grouse shooting|shooting weekend]] at Gosford Park, an [[English country house]]. A murder occurs after a dinner party, and the film goes on to present the subsequent investigation from the servants' and guests' perspectives.\n\nDevelopment on ''Gosford Park'' began in 1999, when [[Bob Balaban]] asked Altman if they could develop a film together. Balaban suggested an [[Agatha Christie]]-style whodunit and introduced Altman to Julian Fellowes, with whom Balaban had been working on a different project.  The film went into production in March 2001, and began filming at [[Shepperton Studios]] with a production budget of $19.8 million. ''Gosford Park'' premiered on 7 November 2001 at the [[London Film Festival]]. It received a limited release across cinemas in the United States in December 2001, before being widely released in January 2002 by [[Focus Features|USA Films]]. It was released in February 2002 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was successful at the [[box office]], grossing over $87 million in cinemas worldwide, making it Altman's second-most successful film after ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]''. Widely acclaimed by critics, ''Gosford Park'' was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both Mirren and Smith, and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]; it was also nominated for nine [[British Academy Film Awards]], winning two.\n\nThe TV series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' \u2013 written and created by Fellowes \u2013 was originally planned as a spin-off of ''Gosford Park'', but instead was developed as a standalone property inspired by the film, and set earlier in the 20th century (from 1912 to the mid-1920s).<ref>PBS, \"Downton Abbey Revisited\", TV documentary special to precede season 3</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summary should be 400 and 700 words -->\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summary should be 400 and 700 words -->\nIn November 1932, wealthy English industrialist Sir William McCordle, his wife Lady Sylvia, and their daughter Isobel host a weekend shooting party at their country estate, Gosford Park. The guests arrive: Sylvia's sisters Louisa and Lavinia, and their husbands Lord (Raymond) Stockbridge and Commander Anthony Meredith; her aunt Constance, Countess of Trentham; the Hon. Freddie and Mabel Nesbitt; actor [[Ivor Novello]] and American film producer Morris Weissman; and latecomers Lord Rupert Standish and Jeremy Blond. Mrs Wilson, the housekeeper, assigns the visiting [[Domestic worker|servants]] to their rooms and takes notice of Robert Parks, Lord Stockbridge's valet, who mentions being raised in an orphanage. Head housemaid Elsie guides the inexperienced Mary MacEachran, new maid to Lady Trentham, through the gathering.\n\nFollowing dinner, a silver carving knife is missing. Henry Denton, Weissman's valet, raises the staff's suspicions with intrusive questions, and has a late-night sexual encounter with Lady Sylvia. Isobel asks Elsie to speak to Sir William about hiring Freddie, who is blackmailing Isobel over their affair and her aborted pregnancy. Freddie mistreats Mabel, whom he married for her money when he overestimated her wealth, while Rupert courts Isobel. Lady Trentham confides to Mary that Sylvia and Louisa [[Cut (cards)#Other uses|cut cards]] to decide which of them would marry Sir William, whose fortune, earned in business and thus despised by these aristocrats, was nonetheless necessary to sustain their father, an earl, and themselves.  When the men go pheasant shooting the next morning, a stray shot grazes Sir William's ear. The ladies join them for lunch, and Sir William withdraws from Meredith's business scheme, leaving the commander financially ruined.\n\nLady Sylvia informs her aunt Constance that Sir William may halt her allowance, on which the grand lady is entirely dependent. During dinner, Lady Sylvia berates Sir William and Elsie comes to his defence, inadvertently exposing their affair; Elsie leaves the room disgraced while Sir William abruptly exits to the library. Mrs Wilson brings him coffee which he knocks away, demanding whisky, which she calmly serves him despite his typically surly manner. The guests gather in the drawing room as Novello plays the piano and sings, with the servants listening outside; Freddie, Anthony, Robert, and footman George each slip away. One of the men, seen only by his trousers, puts muddy big shoes\u2014apparently waiting there to be cleaned after the shooting\u2014over his own ones to pretend someone came from the outside, retrieves the missing knife and enters the library, where Sir William is slumped in his chair, and stabs him.\n\nThe body is soon discovered, and the bumbling Inspector Thompson and competent Constable Dexter arrive to investigate. Henry visits Lady Sylvia for another tryst, despite her husband having just been murdered (\"I suppose life must go on,\" she sighs as she removes her earrings) and is revealed to be an American actor posing as Weissman's Scottish valet as research for an upcoming role in a [[Charlie Chan]] movie set in England, which Weissman is researching via this visit. It is discovered that Sir William was poisoned before being stabbed, and Mrs Croft, the head cook, tells her staff about Sir William's history of raping his female factory workers; those who became pregnant were forced to give their babies up for adoption, or else lose their jobs. Isobel gives Freddie a cheque, which he angrily tears up when confronted by Mabel. Inspector Thompson releases the guests without interviewing most of the staff.\n\nMary confronts Robert, deducing that he became Lord Stockbridge's valet to gain proximity to Sir William. Robert reveals that he is the illegitimate son of Sir William, who gave him to an orphanage two days after his birth, and that his mother, one of his factory workers, died soon after.  He tells her he didn't poison Sir William, and she tells him he couldn't have killed him through stabbing him as he had already been poisoned to death. Robert, by this time, has already discovered that his murder attempt was actually merely stabbing a corpse. He grabs and kisses Mary, who leaves right after. As the guests and their servants depart, Freddie, his blackmail scheme of Isobel having failed, pursues a partnership with Anthony, whose business venture has ironically been saved by William's death. Isobel overhears Rupert callously dismissing his courtship of her when he hears the limits on her inheritance. The fired maid, Elsie, accepts a ride to [[London]] with Weissman, Novello, and Henry.\n\nLady Trentham and Lady Sylvia discuss Mrs Croft and Mrs Wilson's long-standing feud, leading Mary to realize Mrs Wilson is Robert's mother. She confronts Mrs Wilson, who reveals that she and Mrs Croft are sisters. They both had children fathered by Sir William while working at his factory; Mrs Croft kept her baby and lost her job, though the child died in infancy, while Mrs Wilson gave Robert up. Realizing he was her son and that he intended to kill his father, Mrs Wilson poisoned Sir William to ensure Robert's only crime would be stabbing a dead body. Mrs Croft comforts the heartbroken Mrs Wilson as Mary says goodbye to Robert, saying nothing about his mother or the murder, and the last guests go their separate ways.\n\n==Characters and cast==\n===Above stairs===\n* Sir William McCordle ([[Michael Gambon]]), a wealthy industrialist and baronet, who owned two factories in Isleworth and two in Twickenham; most of the employees were working class women.\n* Lady Sylvia McCordle ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]), Sir William's wife, daughter of the Earl of Carton, an old but impoverished family.\n* Isobel McCordle ([[Camilla Rutherford]]), daughter of Sir William and Lady Sylvia.\n* Constance, Dowager Countess of Trentham ([[Maggie Smith]]), Lady Sylvia's aunt.\n* Raymond, Lord Stockbridge ([[Charles Dance]]), Lady Sylvia's brother-in-law who is a baron and married to Louisa.\n* Louisa, Lady Stockbridge ([[Geraldine Somerville]]), Lady Sylvia's younger sister.\n* Lt.

[[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Robert Bathurst]] were both tied down by scheduling conflicts. [[Alan Rickman]], [[Joely Richardson]] and [[Judi Dench]] were also considered for roles in the film.

The cameras pointed toward no specific area, intended to cause the audience to move their eyes throughout the scene.

Grant commented that having two cameras moving at any one time meant that none of the actors knew when the cameras were focused on them.
