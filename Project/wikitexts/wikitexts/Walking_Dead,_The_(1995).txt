Whitmore II]] and starring [[Allen Payne]], [[Joe Morton]] and [[Eddie Griffin]]. The film depicts the lives of five Marines who are all assigned to rescue a group of [[Prisoner of war|POW]] during the [[Vietnam War]] in 1972. It opened to poor reviews and low box office receipts. Previews billed it as \"the black experience in Vietnam\".\n\nThe box-office gross was over $6,000,000.00.<ref>[https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=walkingdead.htm ''The Walking Dead'' \u2013 Box Office Mojo], checked on January 5th, 2011</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972 [[North Vietnam]], [[The Short-Timers#.22Short.22 vs. .22lifer.22 vs. .22poge.22|short-timer]] Marines are dispatched by helicopter to conduct their last mission: to evacuate the survivors from a POW camp abandoned by the [[Viet Cong]]. The [[landing zone]] - which they expect to be cold - is actually hot (under fire<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Glossary/Sixties_Term_Gloss_D_J.html#Letter%20'H' |title=Glossary of Military Terms & Slang from the Vietnam War D-J|year=1966 |author=Viet Nam Generation, Inc.|work= The 60's Project |accessdate=2011-11-16}}</ref>) and after a short fight, only four members of the rescue mission survive. SSgt. Barkley and Hoover have a brief fight after Hoover wants to radio for an evacuation and Barkley insists they finish the mission. During their fight a mortar lands nearby, knocking them both into a swamp. Barkley saves Branche from drowning. They are joined shortly by Brooks and Evans. The soldiers defer to the ranking Marine, Sgt. Barkley, who insists that they press on to a nearby cathedral. They reach the building and kill several [[Vietnam People's Army|NVA]] soldiers. At morning, they are planning their next move when they are ambushed by more NVA soldiers including tree snipers. After a firefight they manage to kill the soldiers with the help of Cpl. Pippins, who appears from the brush and also begins attacking them. After subduing Pippins they look for the rest of his platoon and discover them murdered and their radio missing. They decide to tie Pippins up and bring him along as they march toward the POW camp.\n\nThe group then recollect about each of their individual reasons for joining the Marines. Sgt Barkley was a preacher at a church until he came home to his bedroom seeing his wife in bed having sex with another man, Barkley shoots and kills the man and catches the train out of town. Hoover works for a meat packing place until he got fired for stealing meat. Cole tries to rent an apartment, but he is turned down by the real estate agent, because of his race. Brooks tells his girlfriend that he's joining the Marine Corps to be like his grandfather, Pippins was working for Ray until he is killed by gangsters and chased into the military enlistment line without getting caught. While Cole and Barkley go ahead to survey the area, Hoover and Brooks smoke cannabis and talk about Brooks' girlfriend, who just dumped him via the mail. During their break, Pippins escapes and takes Brooks' pistol. The four men regroup and head out without Pippins. When they reach the camp, they discover a deranged Pippins holding a Vietnamese woman hostage. After killing the woman in front of them, Pippis turns on them with a gun and is killed by Sgt. Barkley. After seeing the camp is empty, the men realize they are expendable decoys. They radio in and are informed that the Marines cleared the POW camp four hours earlier, and that they have 20 minutes to reach their pickup point before the entire area is bombed. As the men go to leave bombs begin dropping on them. They escape the bombardment and head through the jungle to the landing zone, but are ambushed by more NVA soldiers. Brooks is killed, and Cole and Barkley wounded. Hoover goes back and rescues Barkley and the three men are evacuated by helicopter. During an epilogue, we are told that Cole became a career Marine who retired after 20 years of service, Sgt. Barkley took a job counseling troubled teens in Georgia, and Hoover went back home, married his girlfriend and opened up his own business.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Allen Payne]] as Cole Evans\n*[[Eddie Griffin]] as Pvt.
