The film tells the story of Alex Rogan ([[Lance Guest]]), a teenager recruited by an alien defense force to fight in an interstellar war. It also features [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Catherine Mary Stewart]], [[Norman Snow]], and [[Kay E. Kuter]].\n\n''The Last Starfighter'', along with [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[Tron]]'', has the distinction of being one of cinema's earliest films to use extensive \"real-life\" [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) to depict its many starships, environments and battle scenes.\n\n''The Last Starfighter'' was Robert Preston's final role in a theatrical film. The character of Centauri, a \"lovable con-man\", was written with him in mind and was a nod to his most famous role as Professor Harold Hill in ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]''.<ref name=\"LS1\">''Crossing the Frontier: Making \"The Last Starfighter\"'' (behind-the-scenes retrospective), Universal Studios Home Video, 1999.</ref> There was a subsequent [[novelization]] of the film by [[Alan Dean Foster]], as well as [[Star Raiders II|a video game]] based on the production. In 2004, it was also adapted as an off-Broadway musical.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- IMPORTANT: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing this section. The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAlex Rogan is a teenager living in a trailer park with his mother and younger brother, Louis. After being rejected for a scholarship, Alex becomes angry at his go-nowhere existence. The only entertainment in the trailer park comes from an arcade game called \"Starfighter\", in which the player defends \"the Frontier\" against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada in a space battle. After Alex becomes the game's highest-scoring player, he is approached by the game's inventor, Centauri, who invites him to take a ride in his fancy car as a prize for winning the game. Centauri is actually an alien and his car a spacecraft; Alex is essentially abducted, and Beta, a doppelganger [[android (robot)|android]], is used to cover Alex's absence.\n\nAlex learns that the ''Starfighter'' arcade game represents a real-life conflict between the Rylan Star League and the Ko-Dan Empire; the latter is led by Xur, a native Rylan traitor and son of Ambassador Enduran, the Starfighter commander, to whom the Ko-Dan Emperor has promised control of Rylos. Starfighter is, in fact, an elaborate recruiting tool, designed as a test to find those \"with the gift\" (Centauri is actually criticized in one scene for placing the game on Earth, as humans were not considered capable of becoming Starfighters).  Alex, expected to be the gunner for a Starfighter spacecraft called the Gunstar, is partnered with a reptilian pilot named Grig. He also learns that the Frontier is a forcefield protecting Rylos and its surrounding planets from invasion; Xur has given the Ko-Dan the means to breach it.\n\nXur reveals he has discovered an infiltrator in his ranks and broadcasts the spy's execution to the Star League. He then proclaims that once Rylos' moon is in eclipse, the Ko-Dan Armada will begin their invasion. Unnerved by everything he has seen, Alex asks to be taken home. On Earth, Centauri tells Alex to contact him should he change his mind. Meanwhile, a saboteur eliminates the Starfighter base defenses, causing heavy damage, killing the Starfighters and destroying the Gunstars. Only Grig and an advanced prototype Gunstar survive.\n\nAlex discovers Beta and contacts Centauri to retrieve him. Centauri arrives just as Alex and Beta are attacked by an alien assassin, a Zando-Zan, in Xur's service; Centauri shoots off its right arm. He then explains that more Zando-Zan will be coming to Earth and the only way for Alex to protect his family (and Earth) is to embrace his ability as a Starfighter. Before Alex can reply, the assassin attempts to shoot Alex. Centauri jumps in the way, taking the hit and killing the alien. Alex and Centauri fly back to the Starfighter base where Centauri succumbs to his injuries. Alex finds Grig and they prepare the Gunstar to battle the Ko-Dan Armada.\n\nWhile Grig trains Alex, Beta finds it difficult to maintain his impersonation, particularly with Maggie Gordon, Alex's girlfriend. After discovering that a group of Zando-Zan have set up a communication center from their spaceship outside the trailer park, Beta reveals everything to Maggie. She does not believe him until the Zando-Zan discover the pair and Beta is shot, exposing damaged circuitry. They steal a friend's pickup truck and charge it at the Zando-Zan ship; Beta has Maggie jump out before sacrificing himself by crashing into the ship, destroying it.\n\nAlex and Grig attack the Ko-Dan mothership, crippling its communications. Once Alex's weapons are depleted he desperately activates a secret weapon on the Gunstar, the \"Death Blossom\", that destroys the remaining Ko-Dan fighters. With the fleet destroyed, Lord Kril orders Xur executed for his arrogance and failure to ensure victory, but Xur escapes the mothership just before Alex cripples its guidance controls, causing it to crash into Rylos' moon.\n\nAlex is proclaimed the savior of Rylos and invited to help rebuild the Star League by Enduran, as it is still vulnerable: the Frontier has collapsed and Xur escaped. An unknown alien approaches, revealing himself as Centauri and explaining he was in a healing stasis. Alex agrees to stay but he returns to Earth, landing his ship in the trailer park. Grig tells Alex's mother and the people of the trailer park of Alex's heroism; Alex asks Maggie to come with him and she agrees. Louis is inspired to join Alex and begins playing the ''Starfighter'' game.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Lance Guest]] as Alex Rogan / Beta Alex\n* [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] as Centauri\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Grig\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Maggie Gordon\n* [[Norman Snow]] as Xur\n* [[Kay E.

It was one of the earliest films to make extensive use of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer graphics]] for its [[special effect]]s. In place of physical models, [[3D rendering|3D rendered]] models were used to depict space ships and many other objects. The Gunstar and other spaceships were the design of artist [[Ron Cobb]], who also worked on ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''.\n\nThe computer graphics for the film were rendered by [[Digital Productions]] (DP) on a [[Cray X-MP]] supercomputer. The company created 27 minutes of effects for the film. This was considered an enormous amount of computer generated imagery at the time.<ref name = OHS>{{cite web |url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/lesson6.html#dp |title=ID 797 \u2013 History of Computer Graphics and Animation |publisher=design.osu.edu}}</ref> For the 300 scenes containing computer graphics in the film, each frame of the animation contained an average of 250,000 [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]], and had a resolution of 3000 \u00d7 5000 36-bit [[pixel]]s. Digital Productions estimated that using computer animation required only half the time and between a third to half of the cost of traditional special effects. The result was a cost of $14 million for a film that made about $29 million at the box office.<ref name = OHS />\n\nDP used [[Fortran]], CFT77 for programming:\n{{Blockquote|text=\nEverything was in FORTRAN, because it was the only language with vectorization when we started and remained the only language with good vectorization through the life of DP.\n|source=email from Larry Yaeger (lead software programmer in Digital Productions) (2020.03.30)}}\n\nNot all special effects in the film were done with computer animation. The depiction of the Beta unit before it had taken Alex's form was a [[practical effect]], created by makeup artist [[Lance Anderson]]. The Starcar, created by [[Gene Winfield]] and driven by Centauri, was a working vehicle based on Winfield's Spinner designs from ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/everything-you-never-knew-about-the-making-of-last-star-1602703884 |title=Everything You Never Knew About the Making of ''The Last Starfighter'' |author=Plummer, Ryan |publisher=[[Io9]] |date=2014-07-10 |access-date=2015-03-23}}</ref>\n\nBecause the test audiences responded positively to the Beta Alex character, director Nick Castle added more scenes of Beta Alex interacting with the trailer park community. Because Lance Guest had cut his hair short after initial filming had been completed and he contracted an illness during the re-shoots, his portrayal of Beta Alex in the added scenes has him wearing a wig and heavy makeup.
