It follows the story of two African-American high school students, [[William Gates (basketball)|William Gates]] and [[Arthur Agee]], in [[Chicago]] and their dream of becoming professional [[basketball]] players.\n\n''Hoop Dreams'' was originally intended to be a 30-minute [[short film]] produced for [[PBS]]; the filming of the special led to five years of filming and 250 hours of footage. ''Hoop Dreams'' premiered at the 1994 [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It won numerous other awards in the 1994 season, although it was not nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. Despite its length (171 minutes) and unlikely commercial genre, it received high critical and popular acclaim, and grossed over $11 million worldwide.\n\n''Hoop Dreams'' was ranked #1 on the [[Current TV]] special ''[[50 Documentaries to See Before You Die]]''. In 2005, ''Hoop Dreams'' was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]], being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1987, William Gates and Arthur Agee, two [[African-American]] teenagers, are recruited by a scout from [[St. Joseph High School (Westchester, Illinois)|St. Joseph High School]] in [[Westchester, Illinois]], a predominantly [[White American|white]] high school with an outstanding basketball program. The team is led by [[Gene Pingatore]], who coached [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) Hall of Fame player [[Isiah Thomas]] when Thomas played at St. Joseph. Agee and Gates are both from poor [[African-American neighborhoods in Chicago]], Illinois: Gates lives in the [[Cabrini\u2013Green]] projects, while Agee and his family reside in [[West Garfield Park, Chicago|West Garfield Park]]. Both boys face 90-minute commutes to the school each way.\n\nIn their freshman year, Gates starts on the varsity team at St. Joseph and helps them win the sectional title, earning a mention from ''[[The Sportswriters on TV]]'' as possibly \"the next Isiah Thomas\", although St. Joseph is eliminated in the super-sectionals in a narrow loss to [[St. Francis de Sales High School (Chicago, Illinois)|St. Francis de Sales High School]]. Meanwhile, Agee plays on the freshman team and struggles both on the court and in the classroom.\n\nAt the end of the year, Agee is kicked out of St. Joseph as his family is unable to pay his tuition; Gates's fees are covered by his sponsor, the president of [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], who also helps him find a [[White collar worker|white collar]] summer job. Agee's rejection from St. Joseph damages his self-confidence, and he plays poorly for his public-school team at [[Marshall Metropolitan High School|John Marshall High School]], coached by Luther Bedford. In his sophomore year, Gates again starts on the varsity team. St. Joseph is eliminated by [[Gordon Tech]] in the sectional finals, and Gates struggles with the weight of expectations from his brother, Curtis, who was a talented player in his own right but never made it to the pros and has now transferred his unfulfilled aspirations onto his younger brother.\n\nIn their junior year, both boys face challenges. Gates suffers a knee injury that requires surgery and months of rehabilitation, while Arthur's mother, Sheila, loses her job and the family goes on [[welfare]] as Arthur's father, Bo, has walked out and become addicted to drugs. Bo later gives up drugs and returns to the family, and Sheila earns a nursing degree. During this time, the Agee household takes in Arthur's close friend, Shannon, who is escaping an abusive household.\n\nOn the court, Agee and John Marshall improve on their poor sophomore year record, including winning an upset victory over [[Dunbar Vocational High School]]. St. Joseph makes it to the sectional finals, where they once again face Gordon Tech. Gates plays timidly because of his injury. At the end of the fourth quarter, with seconds on the clock and trailing by one, St. Joseph wins two [[free throw]]s. Gates\u2014normally a clutch free throw shooter\u2014steps up to take them, but he misses both and St. Joseph are knocked out of the play-offs.\n\nDespite his injury, Gates is courted by many college basketball programs, especially [[Marquette University]], and attends the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] All-America summer camp at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] before his senior year (where [[Dick Vitale]] and [[Spike Lee]] make appearances). After returning from camp, Gates signs a [[National Letter of Intent|letter of intent]] with Marquette, though he struggles to meet the minimum [[ACT (test)|ACT]] test score to be eligible for an athletic scholarship. Meanwhile, Arthur, still playing in the public-school league, attracts far less attention from college recruiters, although a couple of [[junior college]]s show interest in him.\n\nIn Gates's senior year, St. Joseph's season concludes early in a second-round play-off loss against [[Nazareth Academy (La Grange Park, Illinois)|Nazareth Academy]], ending his hopes of \"going [[Downstate Illinois|downstate]]\" for the state championship. Gates had been benched by Coach Pingatore at the start of the game for arriving late. John Marshall goes on an unlikely run through the city championship, largely thanks to Agee's excellent play. The team makes it to the state championship in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], finishing third in the state after a semi-final loss to [[Manual High School (Peoria, Illinois)|Manual High School]].\n\nAt the end of the film, Gates has entered Marquette, and Agee is attending [[Mineral Area College]] in [[Missouri]] and still hoping to play for the NBA.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe initial idea for \"a film about the culture of basketball in the black community\" came to director [[Steve James (film producer)|Steve James]], an amateur basketball player himself, in 1985 while watching basketball at the recreation center at [[Southern Illinois University]]. James reached out to his friend [[Frederick Marx]], then in [[China]] teaching English, who liked the idea. The two agreed that both of them would produce the film, James would direct, and Marx would edit. James thought of the title ''Hoop Dreams'' very early in the development process; they also briefly considered calling it ''Hoopin{{'}}''.<ref name=\"OralHistory\">{{cite news |last=Guerrasio |first=Jason |url=https://thedissolve.com/features/oral-history/360-an-oral-history-of-hoop-dreams-20-years-after-its-/?page=all |title=An oral history of Hoop Dreams, 20 years after its premi\u00e8re |newspaper=[[The Dissolve]] |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=April 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407131846/https://thedissolve.com/features/oral-history/360-an-oral-history-of-hoop-dreams-20-years-after-its-/?page=all|archive-date=April 7, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, James received a $2,000 fellowship grant from the [[Illinois Arts Council]] to work on the film. James and Marx then pitched their idea to [[Gordon Quinn]] of [[Kartemquin Films]]. Initially, they planned to focus on a single playground for a 30-minute documentary they hoped would be aired on [[PBS]]. Quinn liked the idea and agreed to take the project on. Unable to raise any money besides James's grant, the pair decided to shoot on video instead of film (an unusual choice for the time), and they hired [[Peter Gilbert (filmmaker)|Peter Gilbert]] to do [[cinematography]] as he had his own gear.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe filmmakers contacted coach [[Gene Pingatore]] of [[St. Joseph High School (Westchester, Illinois)|St. Joseph High School]] as he had coached Chicago native [[Isiah Thomas]] in high school. Pingatore introduced them to \"Big Earl\" Smith, a talent scout who was familiar with the inner-city playgrounds that the filmmakers wanted to shoot on. Smith brought them to several playgrounds, and at one of them he spotted a young [[Arthur Agee]] as a promising player. Agee agreed to be part of the film, and Smith helped arrange for him to attend Coach Pingatore's summer camp, where Thomas would be making an appearance.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\nWhen the filmmakers interviewed Pingatore about Agee, he said it was too early to tell about him, but mentioned that another kid, [[William Gates (basketball)|William Gates]], could be \"the next Isiah Thomas\". James, Marx, and Gilbert decided to include Gates in their film as well, and began to consider expanding the scope of their original vision.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\nFor two years, the three filmmakers continued to shoot intermittently and send demos out without raising any additional money. [[KCTA]], a public television channel in [[Minnesota]], heard about the film, and pledged $60,000, plus another $70,000 from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], to fund an hour-long film. While continuing to search for more funds, the filmmakers considered other ideas, including a segment on a female high school player and a comedy sketch starring [[Tim Meadows]].<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\nWith limited financial backing, James, Marx, and Gilbert could only manage 22 days of filming for the entire first two years, and each of the filmmakers worked on other projects at times during the filming of ''Hoop Dreams''. By continuing to include Agee even after he was dropped from St. Joseph, they won the trust of him and his family, and the filmmakers began to delve deeper into the personal lives of the boys. At one point, the electricity was turned off in the Agee home; the filmmakers continued filming and (off-camera) provided money for the lights to be turned back on.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\nThe filmmakers shot another 40 days during the boys' junior year. James was able to leverage a relationship with the vice president of the [[MacArthur Foundation]] into a $250,000 grant for the film, which allowed them to shoot 100 days from the end of junior year to the end of the film.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" /> By the end of filming, they had captured 250 hours of footage.<ref name=\"Caryn1994\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n''Hoop Dreams'' spent three years in editing, during which it was cut down from a first assemblage of more than 10 hours, to a six-hour version, to a rough cut that they showed the boys, their families, and coach Pingatore. Per their original agreement, Marx handled the editing, but after two years he asked James and William Haugse to step in to help him. James and Haugse spent another year and a half editing. By the spring of 1993, they had a cut ready and began to consider releasing it in theaters.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Hoop Dreams'' premiered at the 1994 [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary.<ref name=\"Sundance\" /> It ran on the closing night of the 1994 [[New York Film Festival]], the first time a documentary film had ever closed the festival.<ref name=\"Caryn1994\" /> The filmmakers had previously had to turn down an appearance at the 1993 edition of the festival as the film was not yet ready.<ref name=\"OralHistory\" /> Its appearance at Sundance helped it secure a distribution deal with [[Fine Line Features]],<ref name=\"OralHistory\" /> and the film opened nationwide on October 21, 1994.<ref name=\"Caryn1994\" /> It grossed $7.8 million domestically and $4 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $11.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title = Hoop Dreams |website = Box Office Mojo |url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0110057/ |access-date = April 10, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was universally acclaimed by critics.
