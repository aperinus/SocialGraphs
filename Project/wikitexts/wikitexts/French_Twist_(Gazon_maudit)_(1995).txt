It was written and directed by [[Josiane Balasko]]. The film was one of very few French films to have a dubbed version for English audiences. Its title in French is untranslatable but 'Cursed Lawn' is a close approximation. It also refers to the shaving (or not) of pubic hair, a subtle joke in French alluding to the subject matter of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gazon Maudit {{!}} WordReference Forums|url = http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/gazon-maudit.1162681/|website = forum.wordreference.com|access-date = 2015-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = About Gazon maudit . . .|url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/movies/reviews/01-11-96/GAZON_MAUDIT.html|website = www.bostonphoenix.com|access-date = 2015-05-26|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171613/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/movies/reviews/01-11-96/GAZON_MAUDIT.html|archive-date = 26 May 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> The film was selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[68th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref><ref name=\"68thSubmissions\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmfestivals.com/news/newsl1.htm |title=41 to Compete for Foreign Language Oscar Nominations |access-date=4 October 2015 |work=FilmFestivals.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407001102/http://www.filmfestivals.com/news/newsl1.htm |archive-date=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLaurent ([[Alain Chabat]]) and Loli ([[Victoria Abril]]) are a thirty-ish married couple living in southern France with their young children. He is an estate agent; she is a housewife. Laurent has extramarital affairs.\n\nLoli is unaware that her husband is unfaithful. Then one day, a campervan breaks down in front of their house. The driver is Marie-Jo ([[Josiane Balasko]]), a 40s-ish [[Butch and femme|butch]] [[lesbian]] who works as a DJ. She asks to use their phone. Loli has a blocked sink, so in exchange for using the phone, Marie-Jo gets Loli's drain back in working order. Loli and Marie-Jo begin an affair. Laurent is upset, but then his friend Antoine ([[Ticky Holgado]]) accidentally reveals Laurent's philandering to Loli. This seems to justify her romance. Marie-Jo moves into the house.\n\nAntoine then suggests that Laurent let Loli have her way, cease all hostility, and wait for the affair to burn out. Laurent agrees, and the household becomes a seemingly idyllic ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois''. But his strategy has its effect, especially after another lesbian couple, old friends of Marie-Jo, happen by. Laurent welcomes them, but Loli becomes annoyed and jealous.\n\nMarie-Jo decides that the situation is not really going to work. She knows that Laurent wants her to leave. While Loli is away on a trip, Marie-Jo makes a deal with Laurent. She will break up with Loli and leave immediately, if Laurent will give her something she has wanted for years: a baby. Laurent has sex with Marie-Jo to get her pregnant, and Marie-Jo departs before Loli returns. Laurent tells Loli nothing, as agreed with Marie-Jo.\n\nLaurent and Loli settle back down to their old life, but their relationship has been deeply affected. Then Loli hears from a mutual acquaintance that Marie-Jo is living in Paris and is several months pregnant. Loli is astonished and shocked. She insists that she and Laurent go to Paris and contact Marie-Jo. They find her working as a DJ in a lesbian dance club. Their intrusion provokes a quarrel with the club owner, who fires Marie-Jo. Loli and Laurent take her back to their home, where she has her baby.\n\nThe ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois'' is re-established, with the two mothers caring for their children. As Laurent goes to buy a bigger a house, he finds the seller, a handsome Spaniard (Miguel Bos\u00e9), in his swimming pool. The two then share a breakfast while gazing into each other's eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Victoria Abril]] as Loli\n*[[Josiane Balasko]] as Marie-Jo\n*[[Alain Chabat]] as Laurent\n*[[Ticky Holgado]] as Antoine\n*[[Catherine Hiegel]] as Dany\n*[[Mich\u00e8le Bernier]] as Solange\n*[[Catherine Samie]] as The Prostitute\n*[[Katrine Boorman]] as Emily Crumble\n*[[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] as Diego\n*[[Blanca Li]] as a Client\n\n==Development==\nJosiane Balasko called making a film involving lesbianism \"a difficult challenge, since all I had as references on the subject were movies made mostly by men about men; male homosexuality has been shown on the screen thoroughly, unlike lesbianism, which has been kept silent and taboo.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-11550/secrets-tournage/|title=Les secrets de tournage du film Gazon maudit}}</ref>\n\nThe film was presented to the [[Chicago International Film Festival]], in October 1995.\n\nWith her nomination to the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director]], Josiane Balasko is the sixth woman in history to be nominated in this category, after [[Ariane Mnouchkine]], [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], [[Coline Serreau]], [[Christine Pascal]] and [[Nicole Garcia]].\n\n==Awards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|-\n!
