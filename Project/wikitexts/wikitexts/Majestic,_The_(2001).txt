The film also features [[Bob Balaban]], [[Brent Briscoe]], [[Jeffrey DeMunn]], [[Amanda Detmer]], [[Allen Garfield]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Laurie Holden]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Ron Rifkin]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], and [[James Whitmore]]. The film depicts a 1950s Hollywood screenwriter suspected of being a communist. After suffering amnesia as the result of a road accident, he is taken in by the residents of a small town, who mistake him for a local resident who went [[Missing in action|MIA]] while serving in the military during [[World War II]].\n\nCarrey's performance was a significant departure from his previous work, which until then had mostly been [[comedy film]]s. The film premiered on December 11, 2001, and was released in the United States on December 21, 2001. It received lukewarm reviews from critics and grossed $37 million worldwide against a budget of $72 million, losing an estimated $49 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/biggest-box-office-bombs-all-time-1037837|title=The biggest box office bombs of all time|website=[[Newsweek]]|date=July 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, in the heyday [[McCarthyism]], Peter Appleton is an up-and-coming young [[screenwriter]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. He learns from studio lawyer Leo Kubelsky and his own attorney Kevin Bannerman that he has been accused of being a [[Communism|communist]], because he attended an [[Antiwar movement|antiwar]] meeting in his college years, a meeting he claims he only attended to impress a girl.\n\nIn an instant, Peter's new film, ''Ashes to Ashes'', is pushed back for a few months, the credit is given to someone else, his movie star girlfriend Sandra Sinclair leaves him, and his contract with the studio is dropped. Peter gets drunk and goes for a drive up the California coast, where he accidentally drives his car off a bridge to avoid an [[opossum]].\n\nHe regains consciousness on an ocean beach, experiencing [[amnesia]]. Peter is found by Stan Keller, who helps him to the nearby town of Lawson, California, and the local doctor, Doc Stanton, tends to his wounds. As the town welcomes him, Harry Trimble arrives and believes Peter to be his son Luke, who went missing in action (MIA) during World War II, nine years ago. Due to his amnesia, Peter accepts being treated as Luke by the town, led by Mayor Ernie Cole. Peter warms to the town, including getting to know Harry and Luke's girlfriend Adele, who is Doc's daughter.\n\nPeter adjusts to his new life and helps to renovate The Majestic, a movie theater that had become derelict due to hard times. Bob Leffert, a veteran of the war who knew Luke, does not believe Peter is Luke, and fears Peter may be setting the town up for heartbreak, given they had lost sixty other young men during the war. Despite this, Peter helps to restore the theater, invigorate the town, and encourages Mayor Cole to display a memorial, commissioned by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] after the war, that the town did not previously have the heart to display.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter's disappearance leads House Un-American Activities Committee member Elvin Clyde to believe Peter is a communist, and he sends two federal agents, Ellerby and Saunders, to California to search for him, where they follow a lead about his car showing up on a beach.\n\nWhen The Majestic shows his first movie ''Sand Pirates of the Sahara'', and his screenwriting credit appears, Peter is jolted out of his amnesia. Harry suffers from a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] before the reel change. After examining him, Doc reports that Harry's time is short. Peter cannot bring himself to acknowledge the truth, thus allowing Harry to die believing Peter is Luke.\n\nAfter the funeral, Peter admits the truth to Adele, who had already suspected it. She supports his decision to tell the rest of the town. Before he can do so, federal agents Ellery and Saunders, as well as Leo and some police officers, arrive. When Sheriff Coleman asks if they need any help with anything, the federal agents reveal Peter's true identity to the whole town and issue him a summons to appear before a congressional committee in Los Angeles. During their meeting, Leo advises Peter to agree to reveal a list of other named \"communists\" in order to clear his own name. Later that night, the Majestic's usher Emmett admits that he knew Peter wasn't Luke after hearing Peter play a roadhouse boogie at the town festival, since Luke was more inclined to classical music.\n\nThe next day, Peter has an argument with Adele over this decision; she gives him a letter she received from the real Luke, as Peter boards the train to Los Angeles. On the train, Peter reads the letter, where Luke states his awareness that he might die in the war for a real cause, as well as a pocket-sized version of the [[U.S. Constitution]] and Luke's Medal of Honor.\n\nPeter changes his mind at the hearing in Los Angeles, which is watched by all of Lawson on television. He confronts Congressman Doyle in front of the committee. Peter gives an impassioned speech about American ideals, which sways the crowd, especially when he holds up Luke's Medal of Honor, and this compels the lawmakers to let him go free. As Peter discusses the result with his attorney Kevin, he learns that the girl for whom he went to antiwar meeting in college was the very same person who had named him to the committee.\n\nPeter attempts to return to his Hollywood screenwriting career, but finds he cannot deal with the ridiculousness of the studio executives' ideas, and leaves Hollywood.\n\nAfter sending Adele a telegram, Peter returns to Lawson, fearing he will not be welcomed. Instead, he receives a hero's welcome from the town's citizens, who have come to respect him as an individual. Peter then resumes ownership and management of The Majestic, marries Adele, and they have a son together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Peter Appleton, a [[screenwriter]] who flees Hollywood after being accused of having communist sympathies; he loses his memory after a car accident and is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a soldier feared to be missing in action during WWII.\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Elvin Clyde, a member of Congress presiding over the Congressional hearing to interrogate Peter.\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Cecil Coleman, the [[sheriff]] of Lawson.\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Ernie Cole, the [[Mayor]] of Lawson who is also a [[Pharmacist|pharmacist]].\n* [[Amanda Detmer]] as Sandra Sinclair, Peter's movie star ex-girlfriend, who plays Emily in ''Sand Pirates of the Sahara''.\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Leo Kubelsky, Peter's agent.\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Congressman Doyle, a member of the Congressional hearing.\n* [[Laurie Holden]] as Adele Stanton, the girlfriend of Luke Trimble and the daughter of Doc Stanton.\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Harry Trimble, the father of Luke Trimble.\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Kevin Bannerman, Peter's studio attorney\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Doc Stanton, the resident [[Physician|doctor]] of Lawson and the father of Adele.\n* [[James Whitmore]] as Stan Keller, the elderly clock store owner who finds Peter on the beach following his car accident.\n* Gerry Black as Emmett Smith, the [[Usher (occupation)|usher]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|repairman]] of the Majestic.\n* [[Susan Willis]] as Irene Terwilliger, the candy server at the Majestic and a music tutor.\n* [[Catherine Dent]] as Mabel, a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] at a diner in Lawson.\n* Karl Bury as Bob Leffert, a one-handed veteran and diner chef who knew Luke Trimble.\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Carl Leffert, the cousin of Bob Leffert.\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Avery Wyatt, the owner of a hardware store in Lawson.\n* Matt G.
