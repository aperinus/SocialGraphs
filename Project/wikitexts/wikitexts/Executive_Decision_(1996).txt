The film stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[Halle Berry]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Oliver Platt]], [[Joe Morton]], [[David Suchet]], and [[B.D. Wong]]. It depicts the rescue of an airliner hijacked by terrorists, by a small team placed on the plane in mid-flight. The film was released in the United States on March 15, 1996, and grossed $122 million against a $55 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Austin Travis leads an unsuccessful [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] black ops raid on a [[Chechen mafia]] safe house in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], to recover a stolen [[Soviet]] [[nerve agent]], DZ-5. Three months later, [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight 343, a [[Boeing 747-200]], leaves [[Athens]] bound for [[Washington, D.C.]], with over 400 passengers aboard including Nagi Hassan, lieutenant of the imprisoned terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa. Hassan and his men hijack the flight, demanding Jaffa's release. Meanwhile, just moments before the hijacking, a suicide bomber working for Jaffa destroys a [[London]] [[Marriott hotel]] restaurant.\n\nDr. David Grant, the U.S. Army intelligence consultant behind the botched raid, is summoned to a meeting at the Pentagon to plan an operation to retake the plane. Grant doubts Hassan's demands, suspecting he engineered Jaffa's capture, and intends to use the 747 to detonate a bomb loaded with the DZ-5 in U.S. airspace. The Pentagon authorizes a mid-air insertion of Travis' [[special operations]] team onto the hijacked airliner using the experimental \"Remora [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F117x]]\" aircraft. Grant and [[DARPA]] engineer Dennis Cahill reluctantly join the mission.\n\nThe Remora intercepts and docks with the airliner. Grant, Cahill, and team members Cappy, Baker, Louie and Rat successfully board but Cappy is injured after a fall. Severe turbulence strains the docking tunnel. Travis sacrifices himself by closing the 747's hatch before it decompresses. The Remora is destroyed along with the team's communications equipment, leaving the Pentagon unaware of their survival. They conduct a covert search for the bomb, hoping to neutralize it and storm the cabin. Grant accidentally reveals who he is to flight attendant Jean, but successfully recruits her to assist their search, despite Hassan's suspicions.\n\nThe team locates the bomb and Cappy, despite his injuries, guides Cahill in disarming it until they discover its arming device has an additional, remote-controlled trigger. Jaffa, released by U.S officials in an attempt to resolve the situation, calls Hassan from a private jet to tell him he is on his way to Algeria, but Hassan abruptly ends the call. Grant and the others realize Hassan's men are unaware of the bomb and Hassan's true intentions, after he kills one of them for rebuking him. He also inadvertently reveals that one of the passengers is a sleeper agent and the trigger-man for the bomb.\n\nThe Pentagon dispatches U.S. Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]]s to shoot down the 747, prompting Hassan to execute U.S. Senator Mavros (a passenger) as a warning.  Baker uses [[Morse code]] via the 747's taillights to signal the fighters that the team made it aboard, requesting an extra ten minutes to neutralize the bomb and retake the 747, despite already crossing into U.S. airspace. Jean spots a man with an [[Psion Series 3|electronic device]] and informs Grant, who enters the passenger cabin to take the suspected individual by surprise, only to find he is merely a diamond thief. Grant spots the real sleeper, Demou, and fights him for the detonator. Hassan attempts to shoot Grant, but is himself shot by an on-board [[Federal Air Marshal Service|air marshal]].\n\nThe commandos storm the cabin as a firefight ensues. Grant struggles to wrestle the detonator from Demou's grip while Baker and Rat gun-down several terrorists. Louie assists Grant by fatally shooting Demou and eliminating the remaining terrorists. Demou, however, manages to arm the bomb before dying, and stray bullets from a terrorist's weapon pierce a window causing [[uncontrolled decompression|explosive decompression]]. The bomb is disarmed just in time by Cappy and Cahill as the 747 stabilizes. Hassan kills the pilots and damages the controls, before being shot and killed by Rat.\n\nDespite his limited flying experience and poor flying technique, Grant takes control of the 747 and attempts a landing but [[missed approach|misses the approach]] to [[Dulles International Airport]]. Grant recognizes the area surrounding his training airfield, [[Frederick Municipal Airport (Maryland)|Frederick Field]], and attempts to land the 747 there. With Jean's assistance, Grant successfully lands the airliner and the passengers are safely evacuated. Grant is saluted by Baker, Louie, Rat and Cappy for his leadership before being summoned to [[the Pentagon]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Dr. David Grant, a consultant for US Army Intelligence.\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis, US Army Special Forces.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 March 1996 |title=PLOT HOLES MAR THRILLING 'EXECUTIVE DECISION' |url=https://www.deseret.com/1996/3/15/19230689/plot-holes-mar-thrilling-executive-decision |work=Deseret News |quote=Steven Seagal, who is not billed in the opening credits }}</ref>\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Jean, Flight Attendant\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Captain Carlos \"Rat\" Lopez, US Army Special Forces. \n* [[David Suchet]] as Nagi Hassan / Al-Tar, Co-chief of the Extremist Organization\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Dennis Cahill, Aeronautic Engineer\n* [[Joe Morton]] as First Sergeant Campbell \"Cappy\" Matheny, US Army Special Forces. \n* [[BD Wong]] as Staff Sergeant Louie Jung, US Army Special Forces.\n* [[Len Cariou]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Charles White\n* [[Whip Hubley]] as Sergeant 1st Class Michael Baker, US Army Special Forces. \n* [[Andreas Katsulas]] as Abu El-Sayed Jaffa, Chief of the Extremist Organization\n* [[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Allison\n* [[Marla Maples]] as Nancy\n* [[J.
