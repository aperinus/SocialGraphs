The screenplay was written by [[J. J. Abrams|Jeffrey Abrams]] from an original story named ''\"The Rest of Daniel\"''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, Captain Daniel McCormick is a [[United States Army Air Corps]] test pilot. After a successful run and subsequent crash landing in a prototype [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bomber at Alexander Field in [[Northern California]], McCormick is greeted by his longtime friend, scientist Harry Finley. Finley confides that his latest experiment, \"Project B\", has succeeded in building a prototype chamber for [[cryonic]] freezing. The following day, just as McCormick is about to propose to his girlfriend, Helen, she goes into a coma following an automobile accident, with doctors doubting she will ever recover. McCormick insists he be put into [[suspended animation]] for one year, so he will not have to watch Helen die.\n\nFifty-three years later in 1992, ten-year-old airplane-enthusiast Nat Cooper and his friend Felix are playing inside the military storage warehouse housing the chamber, accidentally activating it and waking McCormick, leaving Nat\u2019s coat behind. McCormick awakens and escapes before realizing what year it is. He first approaches the military about his experiences, but they dismiss him as crazed; McCormick becomes more determined to learn what happened to him.\n\nMcCormick follows the address on the jacket back to Nat, befriending him. While hiding in Nat's treehouse, he rescues Nat\u2019s mother Claire from her abusive ex-boyfriend Fred, slightly injuring his hand in the process. Claire fixes up his wound and a bond develops between the two; she allows McCormick to stay, and he and Nat later build a simulated bomber-plane cockpit in Nat's treehouse so that McCormick can teach Nat how to fly. McCormick passes out and is hospitalised, where he discovers his body is failing as his age begins to catch up to him.\n\nMcCormick tracks down Finley\u2019s daughter Susan, who informs him her father died in a fire before she was born. She gives McCormick her father\u2019s journals, detailing the cryogenic process, and Finley's notes disclose that the rapid aging is irreversible. Susan also reveals that Helen is still alive, but they escape before the FBI, who is now after McCormick, catch up to them.\n\nClaire drives McCormick to an air show and commandeers a B-25 bomber to fly to Helen's seaside-lighthouse home, with Nat stowing away on board. Claire gives Harry\u2019s journals to the FBI, for their plans to replicate and modernize the experiment. McCormick suffers another ageing attack, forcing Nat (who is now slightly familiar with the plane's controls after his simulated-training session with McCormick) to land the plane in the field near Helen\u2019s house. The now-elderly McCormick reunites with the also-gray-and-wrinkled Helen and asks her to marry him; she happily accepts, proving that true love does indeed last forever. McCormick introduces Nat to Helen, and the film ends with the three joining hands and going for a seaside stroll together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Captain Daniel McCormick, [[USAAC]]<ref>Rainer, Peter.
