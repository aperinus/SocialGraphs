It is the first film adaptation of [[Charles Portis]]' 1968 novel [[True Grit (novel)|of the same name]]. The screenplay was written by [[Marguerite Roberts]]. Wayne won his only [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his performance in the film and reprised his role for the 1975 sequel [[Rooster Cogburn (film)|''Rooster Cogburn'']].\n\nHistorians{{who|date=August 2020}} believe Cogburn was based on Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Heck Thomas]], who brought in some of the toughest outlaws. The cast also features [[Robert Duvall]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Jeff Corey]] and [[Strother Martin]]. The title song, sung by Campbell, was also Oscar-nominated.\n\n''True Grit'' was [[True Grit (2010 film)|adapted again in 2010]], starring [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], and [[Josh Brolin]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1880, Frank Ross, of [[Yell County, Arkansas]], is murdered and robbed by his hired hand, Tom Chaney. Ross's young daughter, Mattie, travels to [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], where she hires aging U.S. Marshal [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Reuben \"Rooster\" J. Cogburn]] to apprehend Chaney. Mattie has heard that Cogburn has \"true grit\". Mattie earns the money to pay his fee by shrewdly horse trading. She gives Cogburn a payment to track and capture Chaney, who has taken up with outlaw \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper in [[Indian Territory]] (modern-day [[Oklahoma]]).\n\nA young [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], La Boeuf, is also pursuing Chaney and joins forces with Cogburn, despite Mattie's protest. The two try, unsuccessfully, to ditch Mattie.\n\nAfter several days, the three discover horse thieves Emmett Quincy and Moon, who are waiting for Pepper at a remote dugout cabin. Cogburn captures and interrogates the two men. Moon is shot in the leg during the capture, and Cogburn uses the injury as leverage for information about Pepper. Quincy slams the sharp end of a Bowie knife down on Moon's hand to shut him up, severing four of his fingers, then stabs Moon in the chest. Cogburn instantly shoots Quincy to death. Before Moon dies, he reveals Pepper and his gang are due at the cabin that night for fresh mounts.\n\nRooster and La Boeuf lay a trap. Upon arriving, Pepper is suspicious and draws La Boeuf's fire, who ruins their planned ambush by shooting and killing Pepper's horse. A firefight ensues, during which Cogburn and La Boeuf kill two of the gang, but Pepper and the rest of his men escape unharmed. Cogburn, La Boeuf, and Mattie make their way to [[J. J. McAlester|McAlester's store]] with the dead bodies. Cogburn tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Mattie to stay at McAlester's.\n\nThe two lawmen and Mattie resume their pursuit. Fetching water one morning, Mattie finds herself face-to-face with Chaney. She shoots Chaney with her father's [[Colt Dragoon|gun]], injuring him, and then calling out to her partners. Chaney lunges at Mattie who attempts to fire again, but her gun misfires and she is taken hostage by Chaney. Pepper and his gang arrive, Pepper takes charge of Mattie and threatens to kill her if Cogburn and La Boeuf don't ride away. Pepper leaves Mattie with Chaney, instructing him not to harm her. Mattie is convinced Rooster has abandoned her.\n\nCogburn and La Boeuf double back. La Boeuf finds and takes charge of Mattie, and they watch from a high bluff as Cogburn confronts Pepper and his gang of three. Cogburn gives Pepper a choice between being killed now, or surrendering and being hanged in Fort Smith. Calling this \"bold talk for a one-eyed fat man\" (Cogburn wears an eye patch), Pepper enrages Cogburn, who delivers one of cinema's classic lines: ''\"Fill your hand, you son-of-a-bitch!\"''\n\nCogburn charges the four outlaws, guns blazing. In the initial head-on charge, Cogburn hits Ned in the chest above the heart. Cogburn eventually kills the Parmalee brothers, with \"Dirty Bob\" fleeing. The severely wounded Ned has enough strength to shoot Rooster's horse, trapping Rooster's leg under him as Bo goes down. As a last act, the mortally wounded Pepper prepares to kill Rooster, but La Boeuf makes a long shot with his [[Sharps rifle]], killing Ned.\n\nAs La Boeuf and Mattie return to Pepper's camp, Chaney comes out from behind a tree and strikes La Boeuf in the head with a rock, knocking him unconscious. Mattie is able to shoot Chaney again, but the gun's [[recoil]] knocks her back into a snake pit. Her arm is broken in the fall and she is caught in a hole, drawing the attention of a rattlesnake. Cogburn appears and shoots Chaney, who falls backwards into the pit, dead. Cogburn lowers himself down into the pit on a rope to retrieve Mattie, who is bitten by the snake before Cogburn shoots and kills it. La Boeuf helps them out of the pit before dying.\n\nCogburn is forced to leave La Boeuf behind as he and Mattie race to get help on Mattie's pony, which drops from exhaustion, forcing Cogburn to commandeer a wagon to get Mattie to a doctor he knows in the territory. Sometime later, Mattie's [[Lawyer|attorney]], J. Noble Daggett, ([[John Fiedler]]) meets Cogburn in Fort Smith. On Mattie's behalf, Daggett pays Cogburn the remainder of his fee in Chaney's capture, plus a $200 bonus for saving her life. Cogburn offers to wager the money on a bet that Mattie will recover just fine, a bet Daggett declines.\n\nIn the epilogue, Mattie, her arm in a sling, is back at home recovering from her injuries. She promises Cogburn he will be buried next to her in the Ross family plot after his death. Cogburn accepts her offer and leaves, jumping over a fence on his new horse to disprove her good-natured jab that he was too old and fat to clear a four-rail fence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn]]\n* [[Glen Campbell]] as La Boeuf\n* [[Kim Darby]] as Mattie Ross\n* [[Jeremy Slate]] as Emmett Quincy\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Lucky Ned Pepper\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Moon\n* [[Alfred Ryder]] as Goudy\n* [[Strother Martin]] as Col.

[[Mount Morrison (California)|Mount Morrison]] and [[Laurel Mountain (California)|Laurel Mountain]] form the backdrop above the creek. This location was also used in ''[[North to Alaska]]''.{{sfn|Shepherd|Slatzer|Grayson|2002|p=274}} Filming was done from September to December 1968.{{sfn|McGhee|1990|p=361}}\n\n[[Mia Farrow]] was originally cast as Mattie and was keen on the role. However, prior to filming, she made a film in England with [[Robert Mitchum]], who advised her not to work with director [[Henry Hathaway]] because he was \"cantankerous\". Farrow asked producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] to replace Hathaway with [[Roman Polanski]], who had directed Farrow in ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', but Wallis refused. Farrow quit the film, which was then offered to [[Michele Carey]],  [[Sondra Locke]] and [[Tuesday Weld]], but all three were under contract for another film. John Wayne met [[Karen Carpenter]] at a talent show he was hosting and recommended her for the part, though the producers decided against it because she had no acting experience. Wayne had also lobbied for his daughter Aissa to win the part. After also considering [[Sally Field]], the role went to [[Kim Darby]].{{sfn|Davis|2002|p=286}}\n\n[[Elvis Presley]] was the original choice for LaBoeuf, but the producers turned him down when his agent demanded top billing over both Wayne and Darby. [[Glen Campbell]] was then cast instead. In multiple interviews, Campbell claimed that Wayne, along with his daughter,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Gt_103Y1w|title = Country music singer Glen Campbell talks about John Wayne|website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref> approached him backstage at his show, and asked him if he would like to be in a movie.\n\nWayne began lobbying for the part of [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]] after reading [[True Grit (novel)|the novel]] by [[Charles Portis]].\n\nWayne called [[Marguerite Roberts]]' script \"the best script he had ever read\", and was instrumental in getting her script approved and credited to her name after Roberts had been blacklisted for alleged leftist affiliations years before. This came in spite of Wayne's own conservative ideals.{{sfn|Sheperd|Slatzer|Grayson|2002|p=274}} He particularly liked the scene with Darby where Rooster tells Mattie about his life in [[Illinois]] (where he has a restaurant, his wife Nola leaves him because of his degenerate friends, and has a clumsy son named Horace), calling it \"about the best scene I ever did\".{{sfn|Ebert|2011|p=164}} [[Garry Wills]] notes in his book, ''John Wayne's America: The Politics of Celebrity'', that Wayne's performance as Rooster Cogburn bears close resemblance to the way [[Wallace Beery]] portrayed similar characters in the 1930s and 1940s, an inspired if surprising choice on Wayne's part. Wills comments that it is difficult for one actor to imitate another for the entire length of a movie and that the Beery mannerisms temporarily recede during the aforementioned scene in which Cogburn discusses his wife and child.{{sfn|Wills|1997|p=286}}\n\nVeteran John Wayne stunt-double Tom Gosnell does the stunt in the meadow, where \"Bo\" goes down, on his longtime horse Twinkle Toes.<ref name=SRWF>{{cite news |title=Stuntman Recalls Wayne Friendship |newspaper=[[Kingman Daily Miner]] |agency=Associated Press |date=June 15, 1979 |page=A5 }}</ref> In the last scene, Mattie gives Rooster her father's gun. She comments that he has gotten a tall horse, as she expected he would. He notes that his new horse can jump a four-rail fence. Then she admonishes him, \"You're too old and fat to be jumping horses.\" Rooster responds with a smile, saying, \"Well, come see a fat old man sometime,\" and jumps his new horse over a four-rail fence. Although many of Wayne's stunts over the years were done by Hayward and [[Chuck Roberson]], it is Wayne on Twinkle Toes going over the fence.<ref name=SRWF/> This stunt had been left to the last shot as Wayne wanted to do it himself and following his lung surgery in 1965, neither Hathaway nor Wayne was sure he could make the jump. Darby's stunts were done by Polly Burson.<ref>{{cite news |last=De Witt |first=Barbara |title=How the West was won: fearless women on horseback |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=March 11, 1995 }}</ref>\n\nThe horse shown during the final scene of ''True Grit'' (before he jumps the fence on Twinkle Toes) was Dollor, a two-year-old (in 1969) chestnut Quarter Horse gelding. Dollor ('Ol Dollor) was Wayne's favorite horse for 10 years. Wayne fell in love with the horse, which would carry him through several more Westerns, including his final movie, ''[[The Shootist]]''. Wayne had Dollor written into the script of ''The Shootist'' because of his love for the horse; it was a condition for him working on the project. Wayne would not let anyone else ride the horse, the lone exception being [[Robert Wagner]], who rode the horse in a segment of the ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' television show, after Wayne's death.<ref>{{cite news |last=Whiteside |first=John |date=January 19, 1985 |title=The Duke's Horse Keeps Special Bond |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:True-Grit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[John Wayne]] as [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]]]]\nAfter reading ''True Grit'' by Charles Portis, John Wayne was enthusiastic about playing the part of Rooster Cogburn, but as production got closer, Wayne got jumpy \u2014 he did not have a handle on how to play Rooster Cogburn. He was, of course, nervous because the part was out of his comfort zone and had not been specifically tailored to his screen character by one of his in-house screenwriters. Henry Hathaway, who directed the film, was able to calm Wayne's doubts, most notably concerning the eye patch which was made of gauze, allowing Wayne to see.{{sfn|Eyman|2014|p=442-3}} John Wayne thought the picture had been edited too tightly by Hathaway. Nevertheless, in May 1969, a few weeks before the picture was released, Wayne wrote to Marguerite Roberts thanking her for her \"magnificent\" screenplay, especially for the beautiful ending in the cemetery that she had devised in Portis's style.{{sfn|Eyman|2014|p=448}} Wayne and Kim Darby worked very well together, but Henry Hathaway disliked her, stating: \"My problem with her was simple, she's not particularly attractive, so her book of tricks consisted mostly [of] being a little cute. All through the film, I had to stop her from acting funny, doing bits of business and so forth.\"{{sfn|Eyman|2014|p=445}}\n\nBy the time the picture got back to the studio interiors, Kim Darby was telling Hal Wallis she would never work for Hathaway again. John Wayne was another matter. \"He was wonderful to work with, he really was\", said Darby. \"When you work with someone who's a big star as he is ... there's an unspoken thing that they sort of set the environment for the working conditions on the set and the feeling on the set. And he creates an environment that is very safe to work in. He's very supportive of the people around him and the people he works with, very supportive. He's really a reflection, an honest reflection, of what he really is. I mean that's what you see on the screen. He's simple and direct, and I love that in his work.\"{{sfn|Eyman|2014|p=447}} Surrounded by an angry director, a nervous actress, and the inexperienced Glen Campbell, Wayne took the reins between his teeth the same way Rooster Cogburn does in the climax of the film. \"He was there on the set before anyone else and knew every line perfectly\", said Kim Darby.{{sfn|Eyman|2014|p=445}} Both Wayne and Hathaway had difficulties with [[Robert Duvall]], with the director having constant shouting matches with his supporting actor, and Duvall and Wayne nearly coming to blows.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film premiered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] on June 12, 1969, and opened at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Chinese theatre]] in Los Angeles on June 13, 1969<ref name=AFI/> where it grossed $38,000 in its first week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=L.A.
