The first film in the [[Phantasm (franchise)|''Phantasm'' franchise]], it introduces the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]] ([[Angus Scrimm]]), a supernatural and malevolent [[undertaker]] who turns the dead of Earth into dwarf [[zombie]]s to be sent to his planet and used as slaves. He is opposed by a young boy, Mike ([[A. Michael Baldwin|Michael Baldwin]]), who tries to convince his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) and family friend Reggie ([[Reggie Bannister]]) of the threat.\n\n''Phantasm'' was a locally financed [[independent film]]; the cast and crew were mostly amateurs and aspiring professionals. Though initial reviews were mixed in regard to the dreamlike, surreal narrative and imagery, later reception was more positive and the film became a [[cult classic]]. It has appeared on several critics' lists of best horror films, and it has been cited as an influence on later horror series. It was followed by four sequels: ''[[Phantasm II]]'' (1988), ''[[Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead]]'' (1994), ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]'' (1998) and ''[[Phantasm: Ravager]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\nWhile having sex in Morningside Cemetery, Tommy is stabbed by a woman, who is actually the Tall Man, the Morningside mortician, in another form. At the funeral, Tommy's friends, Jody and Reggie, believe he committed suicide. Jody's 13-year-old brother Mike secretly observes the funeral and sees the Tall Man placing Tommy's heavy casket, seemingly with little or no effort, back into the hearse instead of completing the burial.  Mike then goes to a fortune teller and tells her what he saw.  She has him stick his hand in a box, and at first something seems to grab it, but then he removes it unharmed.\n\nLater, Jody is seduced by the Lady in Lavender and taken to the cemetery to have sex. However, they are interrupted by Mike, who has been following Jody and has been driven out of his hiding place by a short, hooded figure. Mike tries to tell Jody about the hooded figure, but Jody dismisses the story. At the mausoleum, Mike is accosted by a caretaker but escapes. Mike then flees the Tall Man. As Mike slams a door to get away, the Tall Man's fingers get caught and then cut off, but continue to move, dripping yellow ichor. Taking one of the fingers with him, Mike escapes the mausoleum.\n\nThe still-moving finger is enough to convince Jody about Mike's stories. Before Jody can bring the finger to the sheriff, it transforms into a flying insect. Reggie, who witnesses the finger-turned-insect attack them, joins the brothers in their suspicions. Jody goes to the cemetery alone but is chased away by dwarves and a seemingly driverless hearse. He is rescued by Mike in Jody's [[Plymouth Barracuda]]. Running the hearse off the road, they discover that it was driven by one of the hooded figures, a re-animated and shrunken Tommy, whom they hide in Reggie's ice cream truck.\n\nReggie and Jody resolve to defeat the Tall Man, while Mike is hidden at an antique store owned by Jody's friends Sally and Sue. There, Mike discovers an old photograph of the Tall Man and insists on being taken home. On the way, Mike, Sally and Sue come across the ice cream truck, overturned. They are attacked by a mob of hooded dwarves. Mike manages to escape, presuming the girls and Reggie dead.\n\nJody goes to the mausoleum to kill the Tall Man, first locking Mike in his bedroom for safety. Mike escapes, but runs into the Tall Man, who was waiting for him outside his front door. He kidnaps Mike in a hearse, but Mike escapes and causes the hearse to strike a pole and explode. Looking for Jody in the mausoleum, Mike is targeted by the silver sphere until Jody destroys it with a shotgun. Mike and Jody are reunited with Reggie, and together they enter a brightly lit room, which is filled with canisters containing more dwarves. Mike catches a brief glimpse through a portal, seeing a red, hot world where the dwarves are toiling as slaves.\n\nA sudden power outage separates the trio. Left alone in the room, Reggie activates the portal, creating a powerful vacuum from which he narrowly escapes. In the ensuing storm, Reggie is stabbed by the Lady in Lavender while Jody and Mike flee and the mausoleum vanishes. Jody devises a plan to trap the Tall Man in an abandoned mine shaft. The Tall Man attacks Mike at home and chases him outside, where he eventually falls into the mine shaft and is buried under an avalanche of rocks triggered by Jody.\n\nAfter this, Mike wakes up in his bed, still worried about the Tall Man. Reggie, still alive, tells Mike that he had a nightmare, that Jody died in a car wreck and proposes a road trip. When Mike enters his bedroom to pack, the Tall Man appears and hands crash through the bedroom mirror, pulling Mike inside.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angus Scrimm]] as [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]]:\n: After being intimidated by Scrimm on the set of a previous film, Coscarelli decided that Scrimm would make a great villain.<ref name=sphere>{{cite news|last=Savlov|first=Marc|title=Sphere of Influence|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-03-31/76665/|access-date=August 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=March 31, 2000}}</ref> Initially, Scrimm had little input into the character, but he made more of a contribution as Coscarelli began to trust his instincts.

Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' compares ''Phantasm'' to the works of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] in terms of strangeness.
