The plot follows a divorced mother who moves into a rundown apartment with her daughter, and experiences supernatural occurrences including a mysterious water leak from the floor above.\n\nAn [[Dark Water (2005 film)|American-produced remake of the film]], directed by [[Walter Salles]] and starring [[Jennifer Connelly]] and [[Tim Roth]], was released in 2005.\n\n== Plot ==\nYoshimi Matsubara, in the midst of a [[divorce]] mediation, rents a run-down apartment with her daughter, Ikuko. She enrolls Ikuko in a nearby [[kindergarten]] and gets a job as a [[proofreader]] in a small publishing company. The ceiling of their apartment has a leak that worsens on a daily basis. Matsubara complains to the [[building superintendent]] but he does nothing to fix it. When she tries to contact the apartment above, she gets no answer.\n\nStrange events recur: a red bag reappears no matter how often Yoshimi tries to dispose of it. Hair is found in tap water. Yoshimi gets glimpses of a mysterious long-haired girl around the complex. She becomes regularly late in picking up Ikuko from school and is stressed further when her ex-husband tries to take Ikuko. Several incidents remind her of the time she was abandoned as a child. When Ikuko sees the long-haired girl in a yellow raincoat, she becomes ill. Yoshimi discovers a flyer for a missing girl named Mitsuko Kawai, who had attended the same kindergarten as Ikuko but disappeared about a year ago. Mitsuko had worn a yellow raincoat and carried a red bag. Yoshimi discovers the apartment upstairs is Mitsuko's former apartment.\n\nOne day, Yoshimi finds Ikuko in the apartment upstairs, discovering that the faucets have been left running and have flooded the entire unit. Yoshimi decides to move out, but her lawyer convinces her that moving now would weaken her position in gaining custody of Ikuko. Her lawyer talks to the superintendent, who finally agrees to fix the issue. After the ceiling is patched, things seemingly return to normal. But Yoshimi finds that the red bag has reappeared. She heads to the building roof and notices that the [[water tank]] was last inspected \u2013 and thus opened \u2013 over a year ago: the same day Mitsuko was last reported seen. She comes to the horrific realization via a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] that Mitsuko had fallen into the tank while trying to retrieve her red bag and drowned. Meanwhile, her ghost attempts to drown Ikuko in the bathtub.\n\nYoshimi finds Ikuko unconscious. She grabs her and rushes into the elevator, fleeing from Mitsuko. But as the elevator door closes, she sees that the figure pursuing her is in fact her own daughter \u2013 she is actually carrying Mitsuko. Mitsuko claims Yoshimi as her mother in a torrent of water and Yoshimi realizes that she won't let her go. With Ikuko watching tearfully, Yoshimi sacrifices herself by staying in the elevator to appease Mitsuko's spirit. Ikuko rushes to the floor the elevator stops but when the doors open, a flood of brown water rushes out and nobody emerges.\n\nTen years later, Ikuko, now in high school, revisits the now-abandoned block and notices that her old apartment looks oddly clean and lived-in. She then sees her mother, looking exactly as she did that fateful night, and they have a conversation. Yoshimi affirms that as long as Ikuko is all right, she is happy. Ikuko pleads to live with her mother but she apologizes that they cannot be together. Mitsuko appears behind Ikuko. Ikuko turns but sees no one. When she turns back around, Yoshimi has also disappeared. Ikuko realizes that her mother's spirit has been watching over her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Hitomi Kuroki]] as Yoshimi Matsubara\n** Yukiko Ikari as Young Yoshimi\n* [[Rio Kanno]] as Ikuko Matsubara (6-year-old Ikuko)\n** [[Asami Mizukawa]] as Ikuko Hamada (16-year-old Ikuko)\n* Mirei Oguchi as Mitsuko Kawai\n* [[Fumiyo Kohinata]] as Kunio Hamada\n* [[Yu Tokui]] as Ohta (realtor)\n* Isao Yatsu as Kamiya (manager)\n* Shigemitsu Ogi as Kishida (Yoshimi's lawyer)\n* Maiko Asano as Young Yoshimi's Teacher\n* Shinji Nomura as Mediator (man)\n* Kiriko Shimizu as Mediator (woman)\n* Teruko Hanahara as Old Lady (twin, elder) / Old Woman A\n* Youko Yasuda as Kono\n* Tarou Suwa Old Lady (twin, younger) / Old Woman B\n* Shichirou Gou as Nishioka (Kunio's lawyer)\n* Sachiko Hara as Kayo (Yoshimi's aunt)\n* Tohru Shinagawa as Principal\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in Japan on January 19, 2002, where it was distributed by [[Toho]] and received a total domestic gross of $906,344.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=422}}<ref name=boxofficemojo /> In the Philippines, the film was released by [[Solar Films]] on July 30, 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opens Today!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=glU1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=fCUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1935%2C39987999|access-date=12 September 2022|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|publisher=The Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc.|date=July 30, 2003|page=A30|quote=If you like being afraid this one will 'drown' you dead!}}</ref> The film grossed a total over $1.4 million worldwide.<ref name=boxofficemojo />\n\nThe film was shown at the [[AFI Film Festival]] in the United States on November 9, 2002.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=422}}\n\n===Home media===\nAn American DVD release of ''Dark Water'' was dubbed in 2004 by [[ADV Films]], and later released on June 21, 2005, by [[Section23 Films|Section23]].

The English manga version, translated by Javier Lopez, was published as ''Dark Water'' by [[ADV Manga]] in 2004.\n\nAn [[Dark Water (2005 film)|American remake of the film]], directed by [[Walter Salles]] and starring [[Jennifer Connelly]], was released on 8 July 2005.\n\n===Differences between the Japanese original and the American Remake===\n*In the original Japanese film, Yoshimi mention that Kunio is never attentive to Ikuko and is often using cutthroat tactics to gain full custody. Whereas in the American remake, Kyle is protective of Cecilia, but Dahlia argues it's to the point of toxicity.\n*The Japanese film never mentions what happened to Mitsuko's parents except how they abandoned her. In the American remake, it was revealed that Natasha's parents (especially her mom) were abusive to her and later abandoned her.\n*The bag in the Japanese film is a red backpack, while in the American remake, it's a [[Hello Kitty]] backpack.\n*In the Japanese film, the building supervisor has ignored fixing the issues of water problems and it's never explained why. It was implied he was unaware of what happened to Mitsuko nor that her body was inside the water tank. In the American Remake, Veech was aware of Natasha's body in the water tank and thus had ignored fixing the issue which lead to his arrest. He also claimed that her parents paid him money to keep quiet about both their abuse and abandonment of her.\n*Unlike in the Japanese film, Dahlia realized how much this is affecting Kyle and agrees to move closer to make the custody a lot easier on them.\n*In the Japanese film, to appease Mitsuko's vengeful ghost and protect Ikuko, Yoshimi agrees to be her mother. In the American remake, Dahlia begged Natasha to spare Cecilia's life. She would only agree if Dahlia becomes her mother, and she reluctantly does.\n*In the original ending, Ikuko (now in her teens) visits her former home in the abandoned apartment block and is greeted by Yoshimi. In the American remake, Dahlia sees Cecilia one last time and braids her hair before opening the elevator.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan|Film|Speculative fiction/Horror}}\n*[[List of ghost films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0308379|Dark Water}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2002/dz000140.htm|title=\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u304b\u3089 (''Honogurai mizu no soko kara'')|access-date=2007-07-21|language=ja|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}\n*{{Allmovie title|262455|Dark Water}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|10002114-dark_water|title=Dark Water}}\n\n{{Hideo Nakata}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:2002 horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about curses]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hideo Nakata]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Kenji Kawai]]\n[[Category:Films set in apartment buildings]]\n[[Category:Films set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 2010s]]\n[[Category:Japan in fiction]]\n[[Category:Japanese ghost films]]\n[[Category:Japanese horror films]]\n[[Category:Japanese supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:Toho films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]\n\n[[ja:\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u304b\u3089#\u6620\u753b\u300e\u4ec4\u6697\u3044\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u304b\u3089\u300f(2002)]]<!--Do NOT remove.
