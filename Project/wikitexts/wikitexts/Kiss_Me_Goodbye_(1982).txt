Kay plans to remarry, to an archaeologist Rupert, and suggests that they live in the same house. Jolly returns to her life as a ghost. Seen only by her, Jolly meddles in Kay's affairs and causes her mother and others to question her state of mind. On a romantic weekend in the country together, Kay and Rupert are accompanied by Jolly, who is annoyed by Rupert's pretending to be able to see and hear him. The situation comes to a head back at the house, where a colleague of Rupert's attempts to stage an [[exorcism]]. Jolly, finally convinced that Kay will be okay without him, kisses her goodbye for good. The film ends with Kay and Rupert getting married at the wedding rehearsal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sally Field]] as Kay Villano\n* [[James Caan]] as Jolly Villano\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Rupert Baines\n* [[Claire Trevor]] as Charlotte\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Kendall\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Edgar\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Billy\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mrs. Reilly\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Rev.

It sails out of New York, turns left instead of right at the Ambrose Lightship and heads confidently toward sunny Iceland. ...Mr. Mulligan's direction perfectly matches Charlie Peters's screenplay in that both are humorless. The leads aren't great either. Miss Fields is neither Sonia Braga nor Irene Dunne and Mr. Caan, who appears to be imitating Gene Kelly, can't. Mr. Bridges behaves as if he were a family's faithful old dog, the sort of slobbering animal that will sell his soul for a pat on the head.\"<ref>Vincent Canby, \"Kiss Me Goodbye\" Dec. 22, 1982 https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE1D8123BF931A15751C1A964948260</ref>\n\nThe film opened Wednesday, December 22, 1982 on 783 theaters and grossed $1,846,222 in its first 5 days, finishing ninth for the weekend at the U.S. box office.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=December 28, 1982|last=Ginsberg|first=Steven|title=Columbia Pictures Is Prime Recipient Of Holiday Good News At Nation's B.O.}}</ref> In its second weekend, its weekend gross more than doubled, one of the best [[Second weekend in box office performance|second-weekend increases]] since 1982.

Caan called it one of the worst experiences of his life and professed that director Robert Mulligan was the most incompetent filmmaker he had ever worked with. \"A lot of mediocrity was produced\", he said.\n\n==See also==\n\n*{{Section link|Second weekend in box office performance|Second-weekend increase}}\n*[[Over Her Dead Body]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0084210|Kiss Me Goodbye}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|kiss_me_goodbye|Kiss Me Goodbye}}\n* {{Mojo title|kissmegoodbye}}\n\n{{Robert Mulligan}}\n\n[[Category:1982 films]]\n[[Category:1982 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Jorge Amado]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Mulligan]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Brazilian films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
