A co-production of United States and United Kingdom, it features an [[ensemble cast]], featuring only [[child actors]] playing adult roles, with [[Jodie Foster]], [[Scott Baio]] and [[John Cassisi]] in major roles. The film tells the story of the rise of \"Bugsy Malone\" and the battle for power between \"Fat Sam\" and \"Dandy Dan\".\n\nSet in New York City, it is a gangster movie spoof, substituting machine guns that fire gobs of whipped cream instead of bullets. The film is based loosely on events in New York and Chicago during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]], specifically the exploits of real-life gangsters such as [[Al Capone]] and [[Bugs Moran]]. Parker lightened the subject matter considerably for the children's market and the film received a G rating in the U.S. ''Bugsy Malone'' premiered at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on July 12, 1976 by [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]-[[The Rank Organisation|Rank Distributors]], and in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on September 15. Although a commercial success in the UK, it was not a financial success overseas. The film received critical acclaim, with praise drawn for Parker's screenplay and direction, its musical numbers, unique narrative and the performances of the cast .\n\nIn 2003, was voted #19 on a list of the 100 greatest musicals, as chosen by viewers of [[Channel 4]] in the UK.<ref name=\"musicals100\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/100musicals.html|title=100 Greatest Musicals \u2013 Broadcast Christmas 2003, Channel 4 (UK).

The film also received three nominations at the [[34th Golden Globe Awards]] including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition era]], a mobster named Roxy Robinson is \"splurged\" by members of a rival gang, using rapid-fire cream-shooting \"splurge guns\". Once splurged, a gangster is \"all washed up... finished\". Mob boss Fat Sam Staccetto introduces himself in the opening narration, as well as introducing Bugsy Malone, a penniless boxing promoter who is 'a little too popular with the broads... but a nice guy' (\"Bugsy Malone\").\n\nAt Fat Sam's Grand Slam [[Speakeasy]], there is much dancing and singing (\"Fat Sam's Grand Slam\"). Fat Sam rants about the loss of Roxy, who was one of his best men, laying the blame on up-and-coming rival mob boss Dandy Dan and worried that Dan is trying to take control of his criminal empire. Blousey Brown, an aspiring singer and actress, has come for an audition at the speakeasy, but Sam is too distracted to see her. Bugsy meets Blousey when he trips over her luggage; he is instantly smitten and attempts to flirt with her. Just then, Fat Sam's is raided by Dandy Dan's men, who shoot up the place. Over the next few weeks Dan's men continue to attack Fat Sam's empire, eventually taking over all of Sam's moneymaking rackets and splurging members of Fat Sam's gang until only the speakeasy remains. Sam sends all his available men except his personal enforcer Knuckles, to see if they can track down the guns but they are ambushed at a laundry and splurged by Dandy Dan's gang (\"Bad Guys\").\n\nBugsy returns to Fat Sam's to arrange a new audition for Blousey. Fat Sam's girlfriend, the chanteuse Tallulah, makes a pass at him and, although Bugsy rejects her flirtation, Tallulah plants a big kiss on Bugsy's forehead just as Blousey enters. Blousey is jealous but performs anyway, using her personal feelings to boost her performance (\"I'm Feelin' Fine\"). Fat Sam hires Blousey after her audition and she leaves quickly, refusing to speak to Bugsy.\n\nSince most of his gang have been splurged, Sam hires Bugsy as a driver to accompany him to a truce meeting with Dandy Dan. He also takes along \"Looney\" Bergonzi, a top Chicago mob enforcer. The meeting is a trap, but Bugsy helps Fat Sam escape and is paid $200 by a grateful Sam. Bugsy and Blousey reconcile and have a romantic outing on a lake where Bugsy promises to take her to Hollywood. When he returns Sam's car to the garage he is attacked and his money is stolen. Bugsy is saved by Leroy Smith, who assaults the attackers and drives them away. Bugsy realizes that Leroy has the potential to be a great boxer and introduces him to boxing coach Cagey Joe (\"So You Wanna Be a Boxer?\"). Fat Sam again seeks Bugsy's aid after Knuckles is accidentally splurged by a malfunctioning splurge gun [[knockoff]]. Bugsy resists but Fat Sam offers him $400, enough money to keep his promise to Blousey, although she is disappointed when she learns that Bugsy hasn't bought the tickets to California yet (\"Ordinary Fool\"). Bugsy and Leroy follow Dandy Dan's men to a warehouse where the guns are being stashed. They realize the two of them can't take the place alone, so Bugsy recruits a large group of down-and-out workers at a soup kitchen (\"Down and Out\"). They successfully assault the warehouse and take the crates of guns.\n\nTaking refuge at Fat Sam's Speakeasy, Bugsy and his army disguise themselves as waiters and patrons and await Dan's arrival. Chaos ensues as a massive splurge gun fight erupts and unarmed patrons throw cream pies, covering everyone (except Bugsy and Blousey). Razamataz the piano player is hit from behind and falls onto the keys, striking a single bass note. The tone silences the room, and the cream-covered crowd realize they can all be friends. They perform the final number (\"Bad Guys Reprise\" / \"You Give a Little Love\") as Bugsy and Blousey leave for Hollywood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Scott Baio]] as Bugsy Malone, an Italian-Irish ex-boxer/boxing scout\n* Florrie Dugger as Blousey Brown, a sassy young dame interested in Hollywood\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Tallulah, Fat Sam's [[gun moll]], the speakeasy's chanteuse and Bugsy's old flame\n* [[John Cassisi]] as Fat Sam Staccetto, crime boss.

Parker was trying to find a film project that was not \"parochial\" and decided upon an American gangster setting: \"I had four young children and we used to go to a cottage in Derbyshire at weekends. On the long, boring car journey up there, I started telling them the story of a gangster called Bugsy Malone. They\u2019d ask me questions and I\u2019d make up answers, based on my memories of watching old movie reruns as a kid.\" His eldest son suggested children should be cast as the \"heroes\".<ref name=\"ParkerBaio\">{{cite news| last1=Parker| first1=Alan| last2=Baio| first2=Scott| last3=Dickson| first3=Andrew| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/how-we-made-bugsy-malone-jodie-foster-scott-baio-alan-parker| title=How we made Bugsy Malone| work=The Guardian| date=13 October 2015| access-date=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe director chose to cast several unknown actors in the film. To find his Fat Sam, Parker visited a Brooklyn classroom, asking for \"the naughtiest boy in class\". The students were unanimous in selecting [[John Cassisi]], and Parker gave him the role. Florrie Dugger (Blousey) originally was cast in a smaller role; when the actress cast as Blousey suddenly grew taller than Baio, Dugger was promoted. She had been \"discovered\" at [[RAF Chicksands]], an air force base in Bedfordshire where her American father was stationed.<ref name=Clark>{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|title=Florrie Dugger: The downside of growing up with Bugsy Malone|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/florrie-dugger-the-downside-of-growing-up-with-bugsy-malone-10170232.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814150545/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/florrie-dugger-the-downside-of-growing-up-with-bugsy-malone-10170232.html|archive-date=14 August 2016}}</ref> At the time of filming, all of the cast were under 17 years old.<ref name=\"imdb trivia\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074256/trivia Bugsy Malone \u2013 Trivia] IMDB.

Well, the long and the short of it is that I wanted to play with my friends after school, but it happened to be raining that day, so I went to the city to meet with Alan Parker. I read it, but I just barely read it. I didn\u2019t even want to be there. He was English, but I didn\u2019t even know what that was. He was just this weird guy with long hair, and I didn\u2019t know what he was. [Laughs.] So I sort of read the script, threw it at him, and walked out the door. That was it: I\u2019d gotten the part before I got home.<ref name=\"av\">[http://www.avclub.com/article/scott-baio-talks-chachi-bob-loblaw-and-howard-cose-202967 Will Harris, \"Scott Baio talks Chachi, Bob Loblaw, and Howard Cosell\", ''AV Club'' 3 April 2014] accessed 7 April 2014</ref>}}\n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], Parker met a 12 year old [[Jodie Foster]], who at the time was about to start the filming of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. About casting Foster as Tallulah and working with her, Parker said:\n{{blockquote|I sat on my own, suitcase at my side, in the shabby screening room with its threadbare carpets replete with Darryl F. Zanuck\u2019s cigar burns in the mouldy leather armchairs that smelled of fish. The film was ''[[Echoes of a Summer]]'', and the young actress in question was Jodie Foster. I subsequently met with Jodie in my publicist's office. Affable and articulate, the twelve-year-old Jodie was wise beyond her years. Jodie was impeccable and extremely \u201cset savvy\u201d. I think she directed me as much as I directed her. She was extremely knowledgeable of the filmmaking process \u2014 she could have complicated technical conversations with the camera crew and script supervisor that were beyond her years. Even then, when she was twelve, I joked that if I got sick, she could take over.}}\n\n===Music===\nParker chose [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] to score the film in order to get a more \"palatable\" modern sound, and simply because he liked him.<ref>[http://www.paulwilliamscouk.plus.com/bugsydvd.html Bugsy Malone DVD Special Edition] ''PaulWilliamsCoUK.Plus.com'' David Chamberlayne. Retrieved 3 June 2010.</ref> Williams had scored [[Brian De Palma]]'s commercial failure ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', but had also written huge pop-radio hits (such as \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\" (lyrics), and \"[[An Old Fashioned Love Song|(Just An) Old Fashioned Love Song]]\"). In fact, Williams would soon win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his song \"[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen]]\" from the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1976).\n\nWilliams felt that \"... the challenge for me was to provide songs that reflected the period&nbsp;... and yet maintained an energy that would hold the young audiences attention.\" According to Parker, Williams was writing while on tour, recording songs in different cities, and sending the completed tapes to Hollywood. Arriving during the first pre-shoot rehearsals, the songs had to be accepted and used as they were, with voices by Williams, Archie Hahn, and others.\n\nNeither the director nor the songwriter were comfortable with the results. Williams later wrote \"I'm really proud of the work and the only thing I've ever doubted is the choice of using adult voices. Perhaps, I should have given the kids a chance to sing the songs.\" Parker also commented: \"Watching the film after all these years, this is one aspect that I find the most bizarre. Adult voices coming out of these kids' mouths? I had told Paul that I didn't want squeaky kids' voices and he interpreted this in his own way. Anyway, as the tapes arrived, scarcely weeks away from filming, we had no choice but to go along with it!\"<ref name=\"PW\">[http://www.paulwilliamscouk.plus.com/bugsydvd.html#dvdpaul Paul Williams \u2013 Bugsy Malone Soundtrack] ''PaulWilliamsCoUK.plus.com''; David Chamberlayne.

After initial experiments with cream-filled wax balls proved painful, Parker decided to abandon the idea of filming the firearms directly. Instead, the firearms fired ping-pong balls, and a [[Fast cutting|fast cut]] to a victim being pelted with \"splurge\" was used to convey the impression of the rapid-firing firearms.<ref name=\"imdb trivia\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Dickson|first=Andrew|date=2015-10-13|title=How we made Bugsy Malone|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/13/how-we-made-bugsy-malone-jodie-foster-scott-baio-alan-parker|access-date=2020-05-02|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nBaio later said making the film was \"awesome\":\n{{blockquote|A kid\u2019s fantasy: You get to dress up as gangster, you get to shoot guns that fire whipped cream, you get to drive cars with pedals that look like real cars, and you get to talk like a grown-up.
