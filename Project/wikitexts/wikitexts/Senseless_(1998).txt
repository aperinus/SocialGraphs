The film stars [[Marlon Wayans]], [[David Spade]], and [[Matthew Lillard]] as college students.\n\n==Plot==\nDarryl Witherspoon ([[Marlon Wayans]]) is an [[economics]] student at Stratford University, who does not have the advantages of his wealthy nemesis, Scott Thorpe ([[David Spade]]), or his best friend Tim LaFlour ([[Matthew Lillard]]), [[straight edge]] [[punk rock]]er who has a hockey [[scholarship]]. Darryl is so broke he donates four pints of blood in one day (playing a different character each time) and four vials of sperm in one day. Darryl's big break comes when he enters a competition, where the winner gets a high-paying [[Wall Street]] job. But when Scott enters the competition, it seems Darryl's break has gone down the drain.  He takes on a high-paying [[experiment]] to test a drug that enhances the five senses. Darryl uses it to his advantage and he impresses the competition's supervisor, Mr. Tyson ([[Rip Torn]]) and he even joins the hockey team as a goalie. But after taking an extra dose one night, he experiences [[adverse effect|side effect]]s. The experiment's supervisor, Dr. Thomas Wheedon ([[Brad Dourif]]), tells Darryl only four of his senses will work at a time until the drug leaves his body.\n\nAs Darryl struggles, Tim thinks that his friend is on [[heroin]] and gets worried about him. Darryl's luck then starts going down the drain as he loses the hockey game because his sense of sight is lost. He also mistakenly confesses love to his girlfriend's father who he thinks is his girlfriend as his sense of sight is lost. Her father turns out to be Mr. Tyson. He also acts very clumsily (because of the loss of the ability to feel) during the basketball game he is invited to see with a client who needs to be impressed in order for Darryl to score some points with the Smythe-Bates guys. Luckily, the client thinks Darryl is just funny and signs a contract with the company.\n\nAs the story progresses, Darryl asks his friend Tim to help him study for the next day's interview.  At that exact moment, Scott studies for the test with the aid of his rich father's employees. Scott is shown to answer a question correctly but he does not know the reason behind it, he ignores the question. The next day, the drug leaves Darryl's system and now all his five senses operate normally. During the interview, it comes down to Darryl and Scott, Scott is asked the same question he was asked last night, he answers it correctly, but when asked the reason, he does not know, Darryl steps in, gives the  correct reason and scores the position of junior analyst at Smythe-Bates. But in his speech, he confesses that he cheated by taking an experimental drug. A meeting is called to decide his fate and Mr. Tyson tells him that he himself started out in the mail room and Darryl should too, if he serves one year duty in the mail room, he will score the position of junior analyst. The story skips a year and Darryl is shown to ask his mom to move into a deluxe apartment. The movie ends with Darryl entering the Smythe-Bates building on his first day, with a familiar-looking doorman ([[Sherman Hemsley]]).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Darryl Witherspoon\n* [[David Spade]] as Scott Thorpe\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Tim LaFlour\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Dr. Thomas Wheedon\n* [[Tamara Taylor]] as Janice Tyson\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Randall Tyson\n* [[Esther Scott]] as Denise Witherspoon\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as Robert Bellwether\n* [[Kenya Moore]] as Lorraine\n* [[Vicellous Reon Shannon|Vicellous Shannon]] as Carter\n* [[Ernie Lively]] as Coach Brandau\n* [[Patrick Ewing]] as Himself\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Steve the commentator\n* [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as Fertility clinic attendant\n* [[Mark Christopher Lawrence]] as Wig shop owner\n* [[Sherman Hemsley]] as Smythe-Bates Doorman\n\n==Production==\n''Senseless'' was financed by [[Dimension Films]]/[[Miramax]], and was the second movie idea [[Princeton University]] comedy writers [[Craig Mazin]] and Greg Erb had successfully pitched, with their first being the 1997 [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]] comedy ''[[RocketMan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anita M.
