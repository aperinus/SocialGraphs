The film takes place in the gang ridden neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]]: late-1980s [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]], [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] and [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]]. The film centers on Bob Hodges (Duvall), an experienced [[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums|C.R.A.S.H.]] officer, and his [[rookie]] partner, Danny McGavin (Penn), who try to stop the gang violence between the [[Bloods]], the [[Crips]], and Hispanic street gangs. ''Colors'' relaunched Hopper as a director 19 years after ''[[Easy Rider]]'', and inspired discussion over its depiction of gang life and gang violence.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo policemen, Bob \"Uncle Bob\" Hodges, a respected [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officer and [[Vietnam veteran]], and rookie officer Danny McGavin have just been teamed together in the [[Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums|C.R.A.S.H.]] unit that patrols [[Northwest Los Angeles|Northwest L.A.]], [[East Los Angeles (region)|East L.A.]] and [[South Los Angeles|South Central L.A]].\n\nThe older cop is appreciated on the local streets. He is diplomatic on the surface, preaching \"rapport\" to gang members to encourage them to offer help when it is truly needed. Uncle Bob recognizes that every action cops take is scrutinized by the people they are trying to help. Hodges explains his view on policing to his young partner with a joke about bulls and cows.\n\nAlthough the pair bond quickly, life lessons are seemingly lost on the aggressive, cavalier McGavin, whose stunts soon bring him notoriety among the gang members and the people, such as attacking a graffiti artist by spraying his eyes with the paint can. McGavin wrecks their first unmarked car during a pursuit. Its replacement is vivid yellow, resulting in McGavin being nicknamed \"[[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]\" by officers and gang members alike.\n\nMcGavin has a short lived romance with a waitress named Louisa who, like the offended Hodges, feels the weight of the Pac-Man persona. Amidst the strain of these relationships, the murder of a [[Bloods]] gang member escalates tension between two other street gangs. A series of seemingly random incidents culminates with the two partners in the middle of the [[Crips]], Bloods and Hispanic [[barrio]] war.\n\nThe 21st Street Gang, led by a criminal named Frog, attempts to negotiate a peace similar to Hodges and steer clear of the melee. To protect his partner, Hodges unwittingly exposes Frog as his source on the Crips leader Rocket's scheme to kill McGavin. Each group attempts to right the wrongs against their respective crews as police strive to prevent the hit and stand their authority over the fall out.\n\nIn the end, the unit moves in on the would-be last crew standing\u2014the 21st Street Gang. While arresting Frog, Hodges is fatally wounded by a 21st Street Gang gunman, nicknamed \u201cBird\u201d, trying to do the hit on McGavin. With medics en route, McGavin comforts Hodges and breaks down with regret as the elder partner falls into delirium and dies.\n\nSometime later, a more reserved McGavin has a rookie partner, a black cop who grew up in the neighborhood where they patrol and sports an attitude like the \"Pac-Man\". McGavin tells him the same joke about the bulls that Hodges taught him, and the younger officer reciprocates in the same way as the young McGavin. The film ends with McGavin considering the cycle as the pair drive on and continue their patrol.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Police Officer Danny 'Pac-Man' McGavin, [[Los Angeles Police Department]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Police Officer Bob Hodges, Los Angeles Police Department\n* [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]] as Louisa Gomez\n* [[Randy Brooks (actor)|Randy Brooks]] as Ron Delaney\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as 'Rocket'\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Clarence 'High Top' Brown\n* [[Trinidad Silva]] as Leo 'Frog' Lopez\n* [[Grand L.

The original script by Richard Di Lello took place in [[Chicago]] and was more about drug dealing than gang members. [[Dennis Hopper]] ordered changes, so [[Michael Schiffer]] was hired and the setting was changed to Los Angeles and the focus of the story became more about the world of gang members.\n\nThe joke that Hodges tells McGavin regarding the two bulls was lifted from the [[Pat Conroy]] novel ''[[The Great Santini (novel)|The Great Santini]]'' (which was [[The Great Santini|made into a movie]] that also starred Duvall) and explains how the character Lt. Col. \"Bull\" Meechum got his nickname.<ref>P. Conroy,''The Great Santini'', 1989, pg. 394</ref>\n\nReal gang members were hired as \"on-location security\" as well as actors/extras by producer Robert H. Solo. Two of them were shot during filming.\n\nOn April 2, 1987, [[Sean Penn]] was arrested for punching an extra on the set of this film who was taking photos of him without permission. Penn was sentenced to 33 days in jail for this assault.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Colors (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack containing mainly [[hip hop music]] was released on April 15, 1988, by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It peaked at 31 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold on July 12, 1988.\n\nThe theme song, \"Colors\", was written and performed by American rapper Ice-T, and issued as the title track for the soundtrack to the film.\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie received both praise and criticism. The film has a 74% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 39 reviews, with the consensus; \"''Colors'' takes a hard-hitting yet nuanced look at urban gang violence, further elevated by strong performances from a pair of well-matched leads.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004485-colors/ |title=Colors |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=12 August 2022 }}</ref> {{MC film|66|15|ref=yes}}\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that it \"has a superb eye for the poisonous flowering of gang culture amid ghetto life, and an ear to match;
