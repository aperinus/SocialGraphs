Loosely based upon the true story of [[Philadelphia]] swim coach [[Jim Ellis (sports)|James \"Jim\" Ellis]], ''Pride'' stars [[Terrence Howard]], [[Bernie Mac]], and [[Kimberly Elise]]. The film was directed by Sunu Gonera.\n\nThe film centers on [[Jim Ellis (sports)|Jim Ellis]] ([[Terrence Howard]]) and grouchy but caring janitor Elston ([[Bernie Mac]]). The two have a short-lived rivalry before becoming good friends.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1974 and life is not easy for a Black man to find employment, even college-educated [[Jim Ellis (sports)|Jim Ellis]]. While struggling to find anything better, Jim, a former competitive swimmer, is working on the decrepit [[Marcus Foster]] Recreation Center in a poor neighborhood  of Philadelphia. His job is to prepare the foreclosure of the Center, causing friction with Elston, the janitor whose job may disappear. The Center includes a dilapidated swimming pool, which Ellis rehabilitates. One day, Jim invites a group of black teens in for a swim. Andre, Hakim, Reggie, Puddin\u2019 Head, and Walt prove to be fairly capable swimmers and with a few pointers, could become great swimmers. In parallel, Jim develops a romantic interest in Hakim's sister and guardian who wants him to attend school before pool.\n\nWith some help from Elston, Jim decides to try to save the swimming pool by starting the city's first all African-American swim team, the \"PDR team\" for both Pride, Determination, Resilience and Philadelphia Department of Recreation. Once they are joined by Willie, a female swimmer more talented than any of the boys, the prospects of competing against much more experienced white teams begin to improve.However, Black swimmers are not welcome everywhere and the team has to fight overtly racist opposition and treachery, which is what Jim already experienced when he was competing 10 years ago.Throughout their struggles in and out of the swimming pool, Jim and Elston encourage and mentor the kids, helping them not only to become successful at swimming but also in their struggles against prejudice, crime, and poverty.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Terrence Howard]] as Jim Ellis\n*[[Bernie Mac]] as Elston Johnson\n*[[Kimberly Elise]] as Sue Carter\n*[[Evan Ross]] as Reggie Jones\n*[[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Richard Binkowski \n*[[Alphonso McAuley]] as Walt Taylor\n*Regine Nehy as Willie Thompson\n*[[Scott Eastwood]] as Jake\n*[[Nate Parker]] as Hakim Carter\n*[[Kevin Phillips (actor)|Kevin Phillips]] as Andre Williamson \n*[[Gary Sturgis]] as Franklin\n*[[Brandon Fobbs]] as Puddin' Head\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Pride'' was met with mixed reviews from critics, with a 45% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 109 reviews, with an average score of 5.47/10.
