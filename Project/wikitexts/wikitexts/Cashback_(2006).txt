Originally exhibited as a [[Short film|short]] in 2004, it was expanded to [[feature length]] in 2006. Both versions were produced by Lene Bausager, starring [[Sean Biggerstaff]] and [[Emilia Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a painful breakup with his girlfriend Suzy, art student Ben Willis develops [[insomnia]]. To take his mind off Suzy and to occupy the extra waking hours he has recently gained, Ben begins working at a local [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, where he meets colourful co-workers. Among them is his colleague Sharon, with whom he soon develops a mutual crush. As his personal means to escape the boredom inherent in the night shift, Ben lets his imagination run wild. In particular, he imagines that he can stop time so that he can walk around in a world that is \"frozen\" like the pause of a film. He imagines female patrons of the supermarket stopped in time, allowing him to undress and draw them.  Finally the ability to stop time becomes real.\n\nA series of flashbacks occur with each progression of the plot, accompanied by Ben's narration and an examination of the effect the situation had had upon him. He explains how he always has been impressed by the beauty of the female body: how he, as a young boy, witnessed a Swedish boarder walk naked from the shower to her room. In another flashback, the young Ben and his best friend Sean share Sean's discovery of his parents' adult magazines, and Sean pays a neighborhood girl called Natalie [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|fifty pence]] to show him her [[vulva]]. Other neighborhood boys repeat this trade.\n\nBen's boss, Alan Jenkins, recruits the staff for a weekend [[soccer|football]] game and, after an embarrassing defeat, 26-Nil, Ben freezes time again. This time he discovers that he is not alone when he sees a mysterious stranger who is able to move inside the frozen world as he can. When Jenkins throws a party to honor his own birthday and as a consolation for their defeat, Sharon asks Ben to be her date, to which he eagerly but nervously agrees. While there, Ben encounters Natalie, who is now a stripper, as well as his ex-girlfriend Suzy, who implores him to try their relationship again. Ben refuses her advance but she kisses him, just as Sharon witnesses from afar. Sharon angrily leaves the party. Ben realizes Sharon has seen the kiss, and freezes time. After spending several days \"frozen\", Ben concludes that although he can stop time, he cannot reverse it to correct the mistake. He eventually seeks to explain himself to Sharon at her apartment, and a confrontation similar to the film-opening breakup occurs. Sharon henceforth does not show up to work at the supermarket.\n\nAs a [[practical joke]], colleagues Barry and Matt phone Ben; Matt poses as an art gallery owner who is interested in displaying Ben's drawings, and schedules an appointment for Ben to present more to him. When Ben arrives as agreed, the reaction of the owner quickly reveals that he has been pranked. However, the gallery owner is nonetheless interested in Ben's work and decides to exhibit Ben's drawings. Sharon receives an invitation to the exhibition and visits. She is moved as most of the pieces depict her and she happily greets Ben, congratulating him on his success. The finale occurs as Ben shares his ability to stop time with her and the two step outside into a time-frozen snowfall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Biggerstaff]] as Ben Willis\n* [[Emilia Fox]] as Sharon Pintey\n* [[Shaun Evans]] as Sean Higgins\n* [[Michelle Ryan]] as Suzy\n* Stuart Goodwin as Alan Jenkins\n* Michael Dixon as Barry Brickman\n* Michael Lambourne as Matt Stephens\n* Janine-May Tinsley as Adult Natalie (as Janine May Tinsley)\n* Nelly Lyster-Smith as Young Natalie \n* Gayle Dudley as Natalie's mother\n* [[Marc Pickering]] as Brian\n* [[Keeley Hazell]] as Frozen Girl in Sainsbury's\n* Jay Bowen as Steve Jenkins\n* [[Hayley-Marie Coppin]] as Swedish boarder\n* [[Jared Harris]] (''uncredited'') as [[Alexander Proud|Alex Proud]]\n\n==Production==\nOriginally exhibited as a [[short film]] in 2004, it was expanded to feature length in 2006. The feature film includes nearly all of the content of the short. Following a decision in December 2005 to proceed with the feature, Ellis completed the expanded script in seven days. After getting commitments from his cast in March he secured financing and the film went into production in May. This schedule was exceedingly condensed by modern film making standards.<ref>Interview with Sean Ellis appearing on DVD version of ''Cashback''</ref> As all of the key players were available to appear in the feature, it was possible to incorporate the original short virtually without change.\n\nThe feature film uses an original score composed by [[Guy Farley]] including one piece, \"Frozen\" which featured on the [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] album, ''The Quiet Room'' in July 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.co.uk/article.asp?id=251585|title=The Quiet Room 'Contemporary Classic Calm'|publisher=Classic FM|date=2006-07-31|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe feature had its North American premiere on September 10, 2006, at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was later screened at a number of other international festivals. The film got a limited theatrical release in the US on 17 July 2007 and in the UK May 2008. The DVD for the European region was released in September 2007. The UK DVD was released in September 2008.\n\n==Critical response==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Cashback'' holds a score of 48% based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The consensus reads, \"An unlikable protagonist, messy editing, and gratuitous nudity might make audiences ask for their cash back.\"<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cashback/ Cashback Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In contrast, Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as \"slickly charming, gently erotic and directed with supreme polish\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930618.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Cashback Movie Review | first=Justin | last=Chang | date=2006-05-23}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said the film is \"lightweight, as it should be\", adding that Ben and Sharon \"are delighted to be admired by such wonderful partners, and we are happy for them.
