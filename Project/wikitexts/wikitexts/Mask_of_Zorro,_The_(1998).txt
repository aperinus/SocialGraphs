It was directed by [[Martin Campbell]] and stars [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], and [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]]. The film features the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins),  escaping from prison to find his long-lost daughter (Zeta-Jones) and avenge the death of his wife at the hands of the corrupt governor Rafael Montero (Wilson). He is aided by his successor (Banderas), who is pursuing his own vendetta against the governor's right-hand man while falling in love with de la Vega's daughter.\n\nExecutive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] had initially developed the film for [[TriStar Pictures]] with directors [[Mikael Salomon]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], before Campbell signed on in 1996. Salomon cast [[Sean Connery]] as Don Diego de la Vega, while Rodriguez brought Banderas in the lead role. Connery dropped out and was replaced with Hopkins, and ''The Mask of Zorro'' began filming in January 1997 at [[Estudios Churubusco]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on July 17, 1998 to critical and commercial success, grossing $250 million on a $95 million budget. ''[[The Legend of Zorro]]'', a sequel also starring Banderas and Zeta-Jones and directed by Campbell, was released in 2005, but did not fare as well as its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051027/REVIEWS/510270309/1023|title=The Legend of Zorro|author=Roger Ebert|date=October 28, 2005|publisher=rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1821, Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish-born California [[Spanish nobility|nobleman]], fights against the Spanish in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] as [[Zorro]], a mysterious masked swordsman who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of [[Las Californias]]. Don Rafael Montero, the corrupt governor of the region, sets a trap for Zorro at a public execution of three innocent peasants. Zorro stops the execution, and Montero's soldiers are thwarted by two young brothers, Alejandro and [[Joaquin Murrieta]]. Zorro fights the remaining Spanish soldiers and thanks the Murrieta brothers by giving Joaquin a silver medallion. Don Montero suspects de la Vega of being Zorro and attempts to arrest him at his home. A swordfight begins, a fire breaks out, and de la Vega's wife Esperanza, whom Montero held unrequited love for, is shot and killed during the ensuing scuffle. While Diego's home burns, Montero takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own before sending de la Vega to prison and returning to [[Spain]].\n\nIn 1841, Alejandro and Joaquin are bandits, running a scam with Three-Fingered Jack to collect the bounty on their heads and steal a strongbox. Before they can escape with the money, they are caught by [[Harry Love (lawman)|Captain Harrison Love]], Montero's new American right-hand man. Jack and Joaquin are captured while Alejandro escapes, and Joaquin shoots himself rather than be executed by Captain Love. Love then beheads Joaquin's corpse and takes the head. Montero returns to California as a civilian, alongside Elena, who has grown into a beautiful woman and resembles her late mother. Montero's reappearance motivates de la Vega to escape from prison. He encounters Alejandro getting drunk and recognizes the silver medallion he gave his brother as a boy. De la Vega learns Murietta is on a similar quest for vengeance on Captain Love for his brother's death and agrees to make Alejandro his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, recruiting him to be the new Zorro. Alejandro agrees to undergo de la Vega's training regimen in Zorro's secret cave underneath the ruins of his family estate to be able to take revenge.\n\nWhile still being trained, Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling Zorro's steed [[Tornado (horse)|Tornado]] from the local garrison. De la Vega scolds Alejandro, claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief and adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garc\u00eda, with de la Vega as his servant \"Bernardo\", and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. At the party, he earns Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting where several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons and proclaim it as an independent [[California Republic|republic]] by buying it from General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], who needs money for the upcoming [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nMontero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to a secret gold mine known as \"[[El Dorado]]\", where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor. Montero plans to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna's own land. As the servant \"Bernardo\", de la Vega uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena and learns that Montero told Elena that her mother died in childbirth. While walking in a market, Elena meets the woman who was her nanny, who tells Elena her parents' real identity. De la Vega sends Alejandro, now officially wearing the mantle of Zorro, to steal Montero's map leading to the gold mine. Zorro duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When Zorro escapes, Elena attempts to retrieve Montero's map from the swordsman. A brief but [[erotic]] sword duel ensues, and Zorro gives her a passionate kiss before he flees.\n\nTerrified of Santa Anna's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold, Montero decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers at Love's urging. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that de la Vega can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. De la Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, but Montero captures him by threatening to shoot him in front of Elena. As he is taken away, de la Vega tells Elena the name of the flowers, ''[[romneya]]'', that she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases de la Vega from his cell. They proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and de la Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero, avenging Joaquin and Esperanza. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off and find the mortally wounded de la Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro and Elena and gives his blessings for Alejandro to continue as Zorro and to marry his daughter before dying.\n\nSometime later, Alejandro and Elena are married. Alejandro tells stories to their infant son, Joaquin, whom he named after his brother, of his grandfather's heroic deeds and legacy as Zorro.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Antonio Banderas.jpg|thumb|upright|Antonio Banderas portrayed Zorro.]]\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Zorro|Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro]]:<br />Banderas was paid $5 million for the role.
