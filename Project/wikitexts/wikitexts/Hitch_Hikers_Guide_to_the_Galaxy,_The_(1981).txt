For consistency this article always spells it this way. See [[Spelling of Hitchhiker's Guide]].</ref> is a BBC television adaptation of [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' which was broadcast in January and February 1981 on UK television station [[BBC Two]]. The adaptation follows the original [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio series]] in 1978 and 1980, the first novel and double [[LP record|LP]], in 1979, and the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage shows|stage shows]], in 1979 and 1980, making it the fifth iteration of the guide.\n\nThe series stars [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as [[Arthur Dent]], [[David Dixon]] as [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], [[Mark Wing-Davey]] as [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], [[Sandra Dickinson]] as [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] as the voice of [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]]. The voice of the guide is by [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]. Simon Jones, Peter Jones, Stephen Moore and Mark Wing-Davey had already provided the voices for their characters in the original radio series in 1978/80. In addition, the series features a number of notable cameo roles, including Adams himself on several occasions.\n\nAlthough initially thought by BBC executives to be unfilmable, the series was successfully produced and directed by [[Alan J. W. Bell]] and went on to win a [[Royal Television Society Award]] as Most Original Programme of 1981, as well as several [[British Academy Television Awards]] for its graphics and editing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/awards|title=\"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\" (1981) (mini) \u2013 Awards|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=4 May 2007|archive-date=6 February 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206090907/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/awards|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n== Development and production ==\nAfter the success of the first seven episodes of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio series]], all broadcast in 1978, and while the second radio series was being recorded, [[Douglas Adams]] was commissioned to deliver a pilot script for a television adaptation on 29 May 1979, to be delivered by 1 August.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Andrew Pixley|date=22 December 2004|title=One Step Beyond|journal=Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition: The Complete Fourth Doctor Volume Two|pages=30}}</ref> A fully animated version was briefly discussed in the autumn of 1978, but it was eventually decided to make most of the series feature \"live action\" and only animate ''The Guide'''s entries.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M.

While there was some resistance to a project considered \"unfilmable,\" [[Alan J. W. Bell]] was given the duties to produce and direct the TV adaptation. John Lloyd was signed as associate producer.\n\n[[File:Arthur Dent Livid.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as [[Arthur Dent]], watching his home being demolished in the first television episode.]]\nIn early 1980, production on the pilot episode began on several fronts.  Rod Lord of Pearce Animation Studios directed a 50-second pilot, hand-animated, giving a 'computer graphic' feel to the Babel Fish speech of the first episode. [[Douglas Adams]] and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the go-ahead to do all of the animation for episode one, and subsequently the complete TV series.<ref>Simpson, ''Hitchhiker''. Page 157.</ref> Narration for the first episode was recorded by [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to [[Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster]]s was done on 8 May 1980. Further filming of crowd reactions to the [[Vogon]]s, location filming of Arthur's house and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and 16 May 1980. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on 7 June 1980, in the BBC's [[BBC Television Centre#The building|TC1]] studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on 2 July 1980, and it was premiered for a test audience three days later (5 July 1980). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast was reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the autumn, with filming and recording occurring out of order. Recording and production of the final episode continued into January 1981.\n\nThe gap in production made for some continuity problems between the pilot episode and the remainder. Notably, Simon Jones's hair was cut short for another role and he wears a noticeable hairpiece in later episodes. Conversely, David Dixon's hair appears longer.\n\nOne major change first appeared in the stage show and LP adaptations, and made its way into the novels and TV adaptation. Nearly all of the sequences from episodes five and six in the first radio series that were originally co-written with John Lloyd were completely cut. Thus the [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desiato|Hotblack Desiato]] character and Disaster Area make appearances in TV episode five, and [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford]], [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]], [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod]] and [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] are all randomly teleported off of Disaster Area's stunt ship in TV episode six. Lloyd does receive a co-writer's credit on episode five, for the material on the statistics about the universe.\n\nThe complexities of adapting the material for television meant that some episodes became as long as 35 minutes; as a result, material that had appeared in the radio series (e.g.: the seance involving Zaphod's ancestors) had to be cut. The programme is particularly notable for its mock computer animation sequences, actually produced on film using traditional cel animation techniques.\n\nThere have been several different edits of the series: Some, but not all, American [[PBS]] stations recut the series into seven 30-minute episodes when they began transmitting the episodes nearly two years later, in December 1982. Other PBS stations re-edited the programme into TV movies, broadcasting more than one episode at a time without interruption. The UK videotape release was on two cassettes, each consisting of three episodes edited to run together and also adding some previously unseen material. The soundtrack was remixed into stereo. The [[North America]]n VHS tape released by [[CBS/Fox Video]] included this material on a single video cassette. The DVD edition claims to be the final and definitive version of the six TV episodes.\n\n[[File:Mark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Mark Wing-Davey]] as [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] with animatronic second head and third arm.]]\nAnother production problem was that, being a visual adaptation, a solution had to be found to display Zaphod's three arms and two heads, a joke originally written for radio. In a previous stage adaptation, a version of a [[pantomime horse]] was used, where two actors filled one costume, providing three arms and two heads between them. For this TV series, a radio-controlled [[animatronic]] head was designed and built, incorporating twelve servo motors and two receivers. However, the head was notoriously unreliable and in many scenes merely sits there, inanimate. For the third arm, most of the time it was seen tucked into Zaphod's jacket. But when called for, Mike Kelt, who had designed the extra head (with Joan Stribling; BBC Make-up, Hair, Prosthetics Designer) would hide behind [[Mark Wing-Davey]] and slip his arm into the appropriate sleeve.\n\nOther elements to the production were done by a variety of BBC designers. The Heart of Gold and B Ark models were built by [[Perry Brahan]]. The small, furry creature from [[Alpha Centauri]] in episode three was a puppet designed and controlled by Jim Francis, who also built the Magrathean bubble car (also seen in episode three), and was the stunt double for [[Richard Vernon]] in the scene in which the bubble car was seen to fly. Matte paintings throughout the series were created by [[Jean Peyre]]. Music and sound effects were by [[Paddy Kingsland]], with the exception of the theme music; the familiar ''[[One of These Nights|Journey of the Sorcerer]]'' theme by [[Bernie Leadon]] was used again, in the arrangement by [[Tim Souster]] that had previously been used for the ''Hitchhiker's'' LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by [[Dave Jervis]]. Other puppets, including insects seen in episode five, were designed by [[Susan Moore (designer)|Susan Moore]]. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by Stuart Murdoch, including operating parts of the Dish of the Day animal.\n\nTwo important cast changes were made for the TV version. [[David Dixon]] replaced [[Geoffrey McGivern]] as Ford, and [[Sandra Dickinson]] replaced [[Susan Sheridan]] as Trillian. The changes were made because McGivern did not suit the role visually, and Sheridan was unavailable at the time. Another new cast member was [[Michael Cule]], who appears as the Vogon Guard in episode two. Cule had first appeared in one of the ''Hitchhiker's'' stage adaptations, performing no fewer than twelve roles. He reprised the Vogon Guard part in the 1992 ''Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' TV documentary, voiced the Babel fish, appeared in the 1994 photo illustrated edition of the book (as [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Mr. Prosser|Prosser]]), and returned a third time as a Vogon Guard for the [[BBC Radio 4]] ''Quandary Phase.''\n\nBecause of the sheer number of models used in episodes two to six, a single day of filming just the model sequences was set aside at the [[BBC Television Centre]] on 28 October 1980. This has been described as \"a luxury few other shows could afford.\"\nTo provide proper timing of spoken lines on-set, [[Douglas Adams]] himself spoke the lines of Eddie the Computer and Deep Thought, until they were redubbed by [[David Tate (actor)|David Tate]] and [[Valentine Dyall]] respectively. Douglas Adams has several cameo appearances in the TV series:\n*Episode 1: One of the drinkers in the background of the pub.\n*Episode 2: The man who walks naked into the ocean, similar to [[Reginald Perrin]]. The original actor for the part called in sick.\n*Episode 2: The Guide entry on \"The Worst Poetry\" also used Adams's likeness as the basis for the illustration of [[Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings]].\n*Episode 2: In the future ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', Douglas makes a cameo appearance as one of the Sirius Cybernetic Marketing Division members.\n*Episode 3: An image in a guide entry on \"an important and popular fact\", along with animator Rod Lord, who provided a self-portrait.\n\nThe hand-animated \"computer graphics\" of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' itself won a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]], a Design and Art Direction Silver award, and a [[London Film Festival|London Film Fest]] award.\n\nThe spaceman, suspended from a wire, in the opening title sequence was Alan Harris.\n\nLocations for filming included a clay pit and the former Par\u2014Fowey railway tunnel in [[Cornwall]], the Edmonds Farm and Red Lion pub in [[Haywards Heath]], [[Sussex]], the Budgemoor Golf & Country Club near [[Henley-on-Thames]], and at Dovestones in the [[Peak District National Park]].\nEpisode three was originally scripted to have a \"pre-credits sequence\" where Trillian announces their arrival at \"the most improbable planet that ever existed\", Magrathea, to Zaphod. This was never filmed. The arrangement of ''Journey of the Sorcerer'' by [[Tim Souster]], used in the titles, was released as a single in the UK in January 1981. The B-side featured Douglas Adams playing rhythm guitar.\n\nMany of the costumes seen in episodes one to four can be seen again during sequences at Milliway's in episode five. In episode five the writing at the start showing 42 crossed out several times also includes the number 101010 which is the 42nd number in the binary number base.\n\n== Episode guide ==\n\n=== Episode 1 ===\n'''First broadcast:''' 5 January 1981\n\n'''Synopsis:''' Episode one begins with a pre-credits sequence, the only one of the TV episodes to have one. A countdown to the end of the world is displayed through animation, and the narrator begins telling the story of the Guide and Arthur Dent's connection to it as the sun rises over the English countryside for the final time. Arthur wakes, discovers the threat to his house from a yellow bulldozer by looking out the window, and the camera pulls back to the titles. This episode closely follows the plot and dialogue of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the First|first episode of the radio series]], cutting the speech by [[Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton]]. It ends at a slightly earlier point than the radio episode, after Ford's line \"he might want to read us some of his poetry first\", and on a cliffhanger that Arthur and Ford are about to be discovered in a Vogon storeroom, but before the [[Vogon#Poetry|Vogon poetry]] is actually read.\n\n'''Cast (in order of appearance):'''\n* The Book (narrator): [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]]\n* [[Arthur Dent]]: [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]]\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Mr Prosser|Mr Prosser]]: [[Joe Melia]]\n* [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]]: [[David Dixon]]\n* Workman One (uncredited): [[Terry Duran]]\n* Workman Two (uncredited): [[George Cornelius (actor)|George Cornelius]]\n* Alien (girl): [[Cleo Rocos]]\n* Alien (guy): [[Andrew Mussell]]\n* Man at end of bar (uncredited): [[Douglas Adams]]\n* Barman: [[Steve Conway (actor)|Steve Conway]]\n* Barfly (uncredited): [[Steve Trainer]]\n* [[Vogon#Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz|Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]] (Vogon Captain) and Vogon Guard (uncredited for the latter): [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]]\n* Sandwich-board man (uncredited): [[David Grahame]]\n* Irritated man hitting radio (uncredited): [[Bill Barnsley]]\n\n=== Episode 2 ===\n'''First broadcast:''' 12 January 1981\n\n[[Image:Vogon jelzt reading poetry.png|thumb|right|Martin Benson as Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz reading poetry to Ford and Arthur]]\n'''Synopsis:''' The episode opens with a recap of the story, with Ford and Arthur about to be captured.

Zaphod has been explaining to Ford that he has found the legendary planet of Magrathea, whilst Trillian tends to a pair of white mice. Zaphod orders the computer to land on the planet surface. Before long, they receive a transmission from the commercial council of Magrathea, informing them that the planet is closed for business and asking them to leave. They ignore this and later receive another message, noting that nuclear missiles have been sent at the ship. Attempts to evade the missiles fail, and Arthur uses the ship's infinite improbability drive, which ends up turning the missiles into a very surprised looking [[whale]] and a [[Agrajag|bowl of petunias]]. Trillian discovers that during the chaos, her mice escaped. The five characters go onto the surface, where they find it desolate. Zaphod suggests that the Magratheans lived beneath the surface of the planet. They split into two groups \u2013 Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, while Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface. Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's thread ends on a [[cliffhanger]], with them seeing something alarming at the end of the corridor. Meanwhile, Arthur and Marvin watch the sunset. Eventually, [[Slartibartfast]] arrives, and asks Arthur to come with him. He explains that the Magratheans were in hibernation for the last five million years. They get into his air-car, and descend deep into a tunnel. A guide narrative intervenes, explaining that while humanity had always assumed that it was the most intelligent species on [[Earth]], in fact the dolphins were more intelligent, and had left the planet some time before. However, both the dolphins and humans were less intelligent than the mice. Meanwhile, Slartibartfast shows Arthur the vast tract of hyperspace that acts as the Magrathean's factory floor, and that they have been brought out of hibernation for a special commission \u2014 \"the Earth Mk II, we're making a copy from our original blueprints\". The Earth was originally made by Magrathea for mice; and it was destroyed five minutes too early. The episode ends here.\n\n'''Cast (in order of appearance):'''\n* The Book: Peter Jones\n* Spaceman (uncredited): John Austen-Gregg\n* Spacewoman (uncredited): Zoe Hendry\n* Handmaiden One (uncredited): Nicola Critcher\n* Handmaiden Two (uncredited): Jacoba\n* Handmaiden Three (uncredited): Lorraine Paul\n* Handmaiden Four (uncredited): [[Susie Silvey]]\n* Rich Merchant (uncredited): [[John Dair]]\n* Ford Prefect: David Dixon\n* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey\n* Trillian: Sandra Dickinson\n* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones\n* Eddie the Computer: David Tate\n* Holographic Magrathean and [[Slartibartfast]]: [[Richard Vernon]]\n* Marvin the Paranoid Android: David Learner\n* Voices of the Whale and Marvin: Stephen Moore\n\n=== Episode 4 ===\n\n'''First broadcast:''' 26 January 1981\n\n'''Synopsis:''' Slartibartfast shows Arthur the archive tapes of Deep Thought being given the Search for the Ultimate Answer and of the result reported by the computer seven and a half million years later.

The mice dismiss Slartibartfast, then express their desire to determine the Ultimate Question by first extracting Arthur's brain. While the mice attempt to strike a deal, the galactic police arrive, and Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Zaphod flee the dining hall, only to be cornered by the police in a large bay. After a misunderstanding, the police open fire on a computer behind which the four are hiding, causing it to explode and ending the episode on a [[cliffhanger]].\n\n'''Cast (in order of appearance):'''\n* The Book: Peter Jones\n* Arthur Dent: Simon Jones\n* Slartibartfast: Richard Vernon\n* PA Voice (uncredited): David Tate\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lunkwill and Fook|Lunkwill/Loon-Quall]] (latter uncredited): [[Antony Carrick]]\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lunkwill and Fook|Fook/Phougg]] (latter uncredited): [[Timothy Davies (actor)|Timothy Davies]]\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]: [[Valentine Dyall]]\n* Guard (uncredited): [[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]]\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Majikthise and Vroomfondel|Majikthise]]: [[David Leland]]\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Majikthise and Vroomfondel|Vroomfondel]]: [[Charles McKeown]]\n* Alien Robot (uncredited): [[Eddie Sommer]]\n* G'Gugvunt Leader (uncredited): [[Eric French]]\n* Vl'Hurg Leader (uncredited): [[James Muir]]\n* Trillian: Sandra Dickinson\n* Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey\n* Ford Prefect: David Dixon\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Frankie and Benjy Mouse|Benjy Mouse]]: David Tate\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Frankie and Benjy Mouse|Frankie Mouse]]: Stephen Moore\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Shooty and Bang Bang|Bang Bang]]: Marc Smith\n* [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Shooty and Bang Bang|Shooty]]: [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]]\n\n<small>'''''Note:''''' The part of \"Loon-Quall,\" one of the two computer programmers who hears Deep Thought announce \"The Answer,\" is stated by the DVD production notes as being played by David Leland.

Davies had previously worked on the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage shows|stage show at the Rainbow Theatre]], and, while working for [[Pierce Animation Studios]] in 1980, had introduced [[Alan J. W. Bell|Alan Bell]] to [[Rod Lord]], leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], [[David Dixon]] and [[Michael Cule]], in character, were shot at the farm in [[Sussex]] used as [[Arthur Dent]]'s house, and incorporated into the documentary with some references to ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'', such as Arthur finding his home intact, and placing his (animated) Babel fish into a [[goldfish]] bowl. BBC video released the sixty-minute documentary on VHS in 1993. Footage not included in the original documentary was included in the 2002 DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has not (as of 2005) been transmitted on TV.<ref name=\"PocketTV\"/>\n\n== Availability ==\n[[Image:H2g2-vhs-uk-v1-front.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Front cover of the first part of the UK VHS release of the series.]]\n[[Neil Gaiman]] reveals in the first edition of his biography of [[Douglas Adams]], ''Don't Panic'', that the BBC was preparing a [[Laserdisc]] release of the ''Hitchhiker's'' TV series in the mid-1980s, but had to cancel the project due to a legal tangle with the movie rights, although master tapes for the Laserdiscs were prepared. The sound was specially remixed in stereo and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]/[[Asylum Records|Asylum]] records agreed to license the original [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] theme music. The series was eventually released on VHS format by BBC Video in 1992. This was a dual cassette edition featuring additional material that had originally been cut from the broadcast episodes. [[CBS/Fox Video]] made the six episodes available on a single VHS tape in [[North America]] starting in 1993. They were joined by ''The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', also on VHS, that same year, as well as a Laserdisc release. A double tape box set edition was also released featuring the collected complete series and Making Of releases. Restoration of the six episodes and the Making Of documentary commenced in 2001, with a Region 2 and 4 DVD release in the [[United Kingdom]] by BBC Video (Catalogue Number BBCDVD 1092) in January 2002. A Region 1 edition, released by [[Warner Home Video]], followed in April 2002. Both DVD editions are two-disc sets, with the six episodes on the first disc and accompanying bonus materials on the second. The North American DVD edition also has a copy of the ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' tribute to Douglas Adams from [[BBC Two]] that aired on 4 August 2001, which the UK DVD edition does not.\n\nA special edition box set of the series was released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on 1 October 2018. The set featured upscaled HD versions of the original episodes alongside optional stereo or [[5.1 surround sound]] mixes remastered by [[Mark Ayres]], formerly of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].\n\nIn North America, the complete series is viewable on [[Hulu]], [[Amazon Prime]] and [[BritBox]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy S1 - Comedy {{!}} BritBox|url=https://www.britbox.com/show/The_Hitchhikers_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_FS_p02zn08z|access-date=2021-09-09|website=www.britbox.com}}</ref> In the UK, the complete series is viewable on BritBox, with the Special Edition available on Amazon Prime Video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Hexagonal-Phase/dp/B07HR32WWP/|title=\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Special Edition\" on Amazon Prime UK|website=Amazon UK|access-date=30 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show has a 67% approval rating based on 6 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_hitchhiker_s_guide_to_the_galaxy/s01|title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Season 1|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=October 13, 2019|archive-date=2 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202163409/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_hitchhiker_s_guide_to_the_galaxy/s01|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Royal Television Society Awards]]:\n** Best Original Programme\n* [[British Academy Television Awards]]:\n** Best VTR Editor: Ian Williams\n** Best Sound Supervisor: Michael McCarthy\n** Best Graphics: Rod Lord\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1981 in British television]]\n* [[Towel Day]], an annual tribute to Douglas Adams\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' VHS, R1 and R2 DVD releases of the TV series.
