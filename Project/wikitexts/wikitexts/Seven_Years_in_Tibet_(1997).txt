It is based on Austrian mountaineer and [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) sergeant [[Heinrich Harrer]]'s 1952 memoir ''[[Seven Years in Tibet]]'', about his experiences in [[Tibet]] between 1944 and 1951. ''Seven Years in Tibet'' stars [[Brad Pitt]] and [[David Thewlis]], and has music composed by [[John Williams]] with a feature performance by cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]].\n\nIn the film, Harrer (Pitt) and fellow-Austrian [[Peter Aufschnaiter]] (Thewlis) are mountaineering in 1930s [[British Raj|British India]]. When World War II begins in 1939, their German citizenship results in their imprisonment in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] in [[Dehradun]] in the [[Himalayas]]. In 1944, Harrer and Aufschnaiter escape the prison and cross the border into Tibet, traversing the treacherous high plateau. There, after initially being ordered to return to India, they are welcomed at the holy city of [[Lhasa]] and become absorbed into an unfamiliar way of life. Harrer is introduced to the [[14th Dalai Lama]], who is still a boy, and becomes one of his tutors. During their time together, Heinrich becomes a close friend to the young spiritual leader. Harrer and Aufschnaiter stay in the country until the [[Battle of Chamdo]] in 1950.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, Austrian mountaineer [[Heinrich Harrer]] leaves behind his pregnant wife to join [[Peter Aufschnaiter]] in a team attempting to summit [[Nanga Parbat]] in [[British Raj|British-ruled India]] (now part of Pakistan). When [[World War II]] begins in 1939, they are arrested by the British authorities for being enemy aliens.  They are imprisoned in a prisoner-of-war camp in [[Dehradun]] in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills, in the present-day Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]]. Harrer's wife, Ingrid, who has given birth to a son he has not seen, sends him divorce papers from Austria, by then [[Anschluss|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nIn 1944, Harrer and Aufschnaiter escape the prison and cross into [[Tibet]]. After being initially rejected by the isolated nation, they manage to travel in disguise to the Tibetan capital city of [[Lhasa]]. There, they become the house guests of Tibetan diplomat [[Tsarong|Kungo Tsarong]]. The Tibetan senior official [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme|Ngawang Jigme]] also extends friendship to the two foreigners with gifts of custom-made Western suits. Aufschnaiter falls in love with the tailor, [[Seven Years in Tibet|Pema Lhaki]], and marries her. Harrer opts to remain single, both to focus on his new job of surveying the land and avoid experiencing another failed relationship.\n\nIn 1945, Harrer plans to return to Austria upon hearing of the war's end. But his son Rolf sends him a cold letter in which he says that Harrer is not his father. This stops Harrer from leaving Tibet. Soon afterwards, Harrer is invited to the [[Potala Palace]] and becomes the [[14th Dalai Lama]]'s tutor in world geography, science, and Western culture. Harrer and Dalai Lama end up befriending each other.\n\nMeanwhile, political relations with the new [[Chinese Communist Party|communist]] government of China sour as they make plans to invade Tibet. Ngawang Jigme leads the [[Tibetan Army|Tibetan army]] at the border town of [[Chamdo]] to halt the advancing [[People's Liberation Army]]. However, he ends up surrendering and blows up the Tibetan ammunition dump after the one-sided [[Battle of Chamdo]].\n\nDuring the treaty signing, Kungo Tsarong tells Harrer that if Jigme had not destroyed the weapons supply, the Tibetan guerrillas could have held the mountain passes for months or even years; long enough to appeal to other nations for help. He also states that, for Tibetans, [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] is like a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]]. As the [[Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China|Chinese occupy Tibet]], Harrer condemns Ngawang Jigme for betraying his country, declaring their friendship over. Out of anger, Harrer further humiliates the senior official by returning the jacket that Ngawang Jigme gave him as a present, a grave insult in Tibetan culture; as well as by throwing him onto the ground before storming off.\n\nHarrer tries to convince the Dalai Lama to flee, but he refuses; not wanting to abandon his people. The Dalai Lama encourages Harrer to return to Austria and be a father to his son. After the [[Coronation|enthronement ceremony]], in which the Dalai Lama is formally enthroned as the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, Harrer returns to Austria in 1951.\n\nHarrer's son, Rolf, refuses to meet him at first, but Harrer leaves a music box that the Dalai Lama gave him and this piques the boy's interest. Years later, Harrer and Rolf (now a teenager) are seen mountain-climbing together, suggesting that they have mended their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Heinrich Harrer]]\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Peter Aufschnaiter]]\n* [[BD Wong]] as [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme]]\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako]] as Kungo [[Tsarong]]\n* [[Danny Denzongpa]] as Regent\n* [[Victor Wong (actor, born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Chinese 'Amban'\n* [[Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117]] as Ingrid Harrer\n* [[Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk]] as Dalai Lama [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], 14 years old\n** Sonam Wangchuk as Dalai Lama, 8 years old\n** Dorjee Tsering as Dalai Lama, 4 years old\n* [[Lhakpa Tsamchoe]] as Pema Lhaki\n* [[Jetsun Pema (born 1940)|Jetsun Pema]] as The Great Mother\n* Ama Ashe Dongtse as Tashi\n* [[Ric Young]] as General Chang Jing Wu\n* Ven Ngawang Chojor as Lord Chamberlain\n* Duncan Fraser as British Officer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nMost of the shooting took place in Argentina in the city of [[La Plata]] (the railway station where Heinrich leaves for Unserberg is the main station of La Plata), and in the [[Mendoza Province]] in such places as the Andes mountains. After the film was released, the director confirmed that two crews secretly shot about 20 minutes of footage for the movie in Tibet.

At the beginning of the film, Harrer, who notably climbed the north face of the [[Eiger]] in 1938, is hailed as a \"German hero\", and replies: \"Thank you, but I'm Austrian.\" To have said that in 1939 would have been extremely bold, since Austria had been part of Greater Germany since the [[Anschluss]] of April 1938.<ref>[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', Chapter 13. Shirer says of the plebiscite \"it took a very brave Austrian to vote No\".</ref> In the book, Harrer says nothing about any such remark. Additionally, during the scene at the train station, Harrer appears hostile to the [[Nazi Party]], taking the Nazi flag with reluctance. The real-life Heinrich Harrer was in fact a Nazi [[Schutzstaffel]] [[non-commissioned officer|NCO]], and stated in his 1938 book that as a member of the German Alpine Association: \"We climbed up the North Face of Eiger over the summit and up to our f\u00fchrer.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/21/movies/dalai-lama-s-tutor-portrayed-brad-pitt-wasn-t-just-roving-through-himalayas.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | title=Dalai Lama's Tutor, Portrayed by Brad Pitt, Wasn't Just Roving Through the Himalayas | date=June 21, 1997 | access-date=February 18, 2017 | archive-date=March 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314090938/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/21/movies/dalai-lama-s-tutor-portrayed-brad-pitt-wasn-t-just-roving-through-himalayas.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/en/alpine-club-examines-historical-ties-to-nazis/a-16214770 |title=Alpine club examines historical ties to Nazis &#124; Germany&#124; News and in-depth reporting from Berlin and beyond &#124; DW &#124; 02.09.2012 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-date=August 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200805113809/https://www.dw.com/en/alpine-club-examines-historical-ties-to-nazis/a-16214770 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film makes Harrer's son a key theme, but in the book, Harrer does not mention his wife or son. He had in fact been married and divorced, as the film shows, but his ex-wife's new husband was killed during the war and Harrer's son was raised by his ex-wife's mother.<ref>''Beyond Seven Years in Tibet'', by Heinrich Harrer</ref> In his autobiography, Harrer gives details of his contact with his son, but nothing to support what the film shows. In the book, Harrer says there was little to tie him to his home as one of the reasons for staying in Tibet and not returning to Europe.<ref name=\"Seven Years in Tibet\">''Seven Years in Tibet''</ref>\n\nThe pre-invasion visit of Chinese Communist negotiators to Lhasa, arriving at an airfield constructed by Tibetans, and their departure for China after a brief conference with their Tibetan counterparts\u2014including the desecration of the sand mandala as well as the \"religion is poison\" remark as depicted in the film, do not occur in the book or in any of the numerous histories that have been written about the matter. [[Tibetan Buddhism#20th century|China's destruction of several thousand Tibetan temples and monasteries and Tibetan Buddhist texts]] occurred during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376)]].\n\nThere was no air link until [[Lhasa Gonggar Airport]] was constructed in 1956\u2014when the Dalai Lama visited [[Beijing]] in 1954, he used the still-incomplete road system.<ref>Dalai Lama, ''Freedom in Exile'', Hodder & Stoughton 1990</ref>\n\nThe whole sequence of negotiations and the installation of the Dalai Lama as ruler are out of sequence. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]] was enthroned as the temporal leader of Tibet on 17 November 1950. After the Chinese crossed the [[Jinsha River]] and defeated the Tibetan army in October 1950, a Tibetan delegation was sent to Beijing and agreed on the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]].<ref>Shakya, Tsering.
