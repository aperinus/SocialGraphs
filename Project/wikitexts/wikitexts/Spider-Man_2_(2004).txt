He finds himself suffering temporary but recurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations. Harry, who is now head of [[Oscorp]]'s genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a [[fusion power]] project by nuclear scientist [[Otto Octavius (film character)|Otto Octavius]], who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful [[robotic arm|robotic tentacle arms]] with [[artificial intelligence]].\n\nDuring a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. As Spider-Man, Peter manages to shut the experiment down. At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. Without the inhibitor chip, the arms have become sentient and defend themselves by killing the doctors. Afterwards, Octavius takes refuge at a harbor. Now corrupted by the arms' AI, he decides to re-try his experiment and robs a bank to fund it. The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' dubs the scientist \"Doctor Octopus\".\n\nMary Jane becomes engaged to [[astronaut]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the son of ''Bugle'' editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life and loses his powers completely due to the stress. He quits being Spider-Man, returns to his normal life, and unsuccessfully attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. He also finally confesses to Aunt May the truth about [[Uncle Ben]]'s death. Aunt May forgives him, but the rise in [[Crime in New York City|the city's crime]] rates worries Peter.\n\nRequiring the isotope [[tritium]] to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he still believes is responsible for his father's death. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells him to not harm Peter. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers returning, and he goes after Octavius.\n\nAs they battle, they fall onto a [[New York City Subway]] train. Octavius sabotages it and leaves Peter to save the derailing train, which he does at a great physical toll. Octavius captures a weakened Peter and delivers him to Harry. Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. They battle again as the nuclear reaction starts threatening the city. Peter reveals his identity and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius commands the tentacles to obey him and sacrifices himself to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Peter's true identity, which he says is why they cannot be together.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry is visited by a vision of his [[Norman Osborn (Sam Raimi film series)|father]] in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death, but Harry refuses to hurt Peter. Enraged, Harry shatters the mirror, inadvertently revealing a secret room containing his father's [[Green Goblin]] equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him to go help as Spider-Man.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]:<ref name=\"MaguireCast\" /><br />A superhero, [[Columbia University]] physics student, and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.

Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina so that they could give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius' muscle movement.<ref name=\"eight\"/> On set, Molina referred to his tentacles as \"Larry\", \"Harry\", \"Moe\" and \"Flo\",<ref name=\"wizard\">Mike Cotton. \"Spider-Man 3.\" ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Comics Magazine]]'' June 2007: p. 30\u201331.</ref> with \"Flo\" being the top-right tentacle as it was operated by a female [[Grip (job)|grip]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/books-of-magic-m-spider-man-2-3-may-17th-comic-reel-wrap/|title=Books of Magic, M, Spider-Man 2 & 3: May 17th Comic Reel Wrap|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 17, 2004|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-date=December 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201230091035/https://www.cbr.com/books-of-magic-m-spider-man-2-3-may-17th-comic-reel-wrap/|url-status=live}}</ref> and performed delicate operations like removing his glasses and lighting his cigar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/alfred-molina-brings-class-spider-man-2-wbna5309967|title=Alfred Molina brings class to 'Spider-Man 2'|website=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]|access-date=December 21, 2020|archive-date=December 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201230091043/https://www.today.com/popculture/alfred-molina-brings-class-spider-man-2-wbna5309967|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEdge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CG tentacles added in [[post-production]].<ref name=\"eight\">{{cite video|title=Eight Arms To Hold You|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony|year=2004}}</ref> The CGI versions were scanned straight from the real ones to allow them to appear more realistic.<ref name=\"amazing\"/> However, using the real versions was always preferred to save money,<ref name=\"eight\"/> and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX's creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. In some shots where CGI is used, Molina is replaced by a [[virtual actor]] possessing the CGI tentacles. Through the use of motion-capture and cyber-scanning, visual effects supervisor [[Scott Stokdyk]] and CGI character animation supervisor [[Anthony LaMolinara]] were able to create more detailed virtual actors to replace Maguire and Molina in some shots, as well as make them display natural human motion. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius' body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.<ref name=\"amazing\"/>\n\nAs with the previous film, [[John Dykstra]] served as visual effects designer. Dykstra and his crew sought to make the worst shot of the second movie look as good as the best shot of the first movie. Dykstra not only created the physical appearance of Octavius' tentacles, but also that of the nuclear reaction that Octavius attempts to carry out in the film. The reaction resembles the [[sun]], complete with [[solar flares]], and poses a threat to its immediate environment through its strong gravitational pull, which can draw surrounding objects directly into it and disintegrate them. As mentioned previously, the film's increased budget allowed the reaction to have a significant amount of artistry and reality.<ref name=\"amazing\"/>{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main article|Spider-Man 2 (soundtrack)}}\n\n[[Danny Elfman]] had a massive falling out with Director [[Sam Raimi]], saying that composing ''Spider-Man 2'' was a \"miserable experience\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/06/danny-elfman-makes-peace-with-sam-raimi-to-score-oz-the-great-and-powerful-117942/ | title=Danny Elfman Makes Peace with Sam Raimi to Score 'Oz the Great and Powerful' | date=June 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser trailer was shown at screenings of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/spider-man-2-trailer-coming-with-return-of-the-king-a911#gs.bf1ape|title=Spider-Man 2 Trailer Coming with Return of the King}}</ref> The next trailer then premiered on April 8, 2004 during ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and in theaters with the release of ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'' the day after.<ref>{{cite web|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=Spidey 2 Preview Tonight|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/08/spidey-2-preview-tonight|publisher=IGN|access-date=March 7, 2022|date=April 8, 2004}}</ref>\n\nPromotional partners included [[Burger King]], [[Dr Pepper]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Embassy Suites Hotels]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chiefmarketer.com/sony-pushes-mega-spider-man-2-promotions/|title = Sony Pushes Mega Spider-Man 2 Promotions}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was initially released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] on November 30, 2004 in United States, in the UK on November 26, and in Australia on November 17.
