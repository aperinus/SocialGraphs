The screenplay, written by [[Karen McCullah|Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]], is a modernization of [[William Shakespeare]]'s late-16th-century comedy ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', retold in a late-1990s American [[high school]] setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on [[dating]], attempts to get [[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat (Stiles). The film is named after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], with many scenes shot at [[Stadium High School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].\n\nReleased March 31, 1999, ''10 Things I Hate About You'' grossed $60 million and received generally positive reviews from critics. It served as [[breakthrough role|breakthrough roles]] for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-orientated awards. The film has since developed a [[cult following]] and is considered a classic in the [[teen film]] genre. \n\nTen years later, the film was adapted into a [[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|television series of the same title]], which ran for 20 episodes and featured [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] reprising his role as Walter Stratford.\n\n==Plot==\nCameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the [[Seattle]] area, [[Love at first sight|falls in love at first sight]] with beautiful and popular [[sophomore]] Bianca Stratford. [[Geek]]y Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish Kat, to date. Kat, a [[senior (education)|senior]], is accepted to [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] worried about [[teenage pregnancy]], will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's anti-social attitude makes this unlikely.\n\nWhen Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take Kat out, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by probing Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.\n\nAt the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a [[musical ensemble|band]]. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.\n\nJoey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the [[prom]] so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the [[marching band]], and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were [[freshman|freshmen]] and, succumbing to [[peer pressure]], had sex with him. Afterwards she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.\n\nAll is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.\n\nThe next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 141]], Kat reads aloud a poem titled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a midrange Fender Strat guitar ($1300) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0147800/trivia/?ref_=tt_ql_trv|title=10 Things I Hate About You (1999) \u2013 IMDb|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her.
