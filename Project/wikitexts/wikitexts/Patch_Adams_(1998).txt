Set in the late 1960s/early 1970s, it is based on the life story of [[Patch Adams|Dr. Hunter \"Patch\" Adams]] and the book ''Gesundheit: Good Health Is a Laughing Matter'' by Dr. Adams and Maureen Mylander. It received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, criticizing the sentimental tone, direction, and deviations from the real story while the music score and performances were praised. Despite the terrible reviews, the film was a box office success grossing $202.3 million against a $50\u201390 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969, Hunter \"Patch\" Adams, after developing suicidal thoughts, admits himself to a [[mental institution]]. Once there, he finds that using [[humor]], rather than doctor-centered [[psychotherapy]], better helps his fellow patients and provides him with a new purpose in life. Because of this, he wants to become a medical doctor, and swiftly leaves the facility. Two years later, he enrolls at the Medical College of Virginia (now known as [[VCU School of Medicine]]) as the oldest [[Freshman|first-year]] student. He questions the school's soulless approach to medical care, particularly why students don't work with patients until their third year, as well as the methods of the school's [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Walcott, who takes an instant disliking to Patch and believes that doctors must treat patients his way and not befriend them. Because of this and incidents such as setting up a giant model [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] pair of legs in stirrups during an obstetric conference, he is expelled from the medical school, although he is later reinstated when it becomes apparent to the school that his unorthodox methods often improve his patients' physical and mental health. Adams encourages medical students to work closely with nurses, learn interviewing skills early, and argues that death should be treated with dignity and sometimes even humor.\n\nPatch begins a friendship with fellow student Carin Fisher and, during their third year as medical students, develops his idea for a medical clinic built around his [[philosophy]] of treating patients using humor and [[compassion]]. With the help of Arthur Mendelson, a wealthy man who was a patient whom Patch met while in the mental hospital, he purchases {{Convert|105|acre|abbr=off}} in [[West Virginia]] to construct the future [[Patch Adams#Gesundheit! Institute|Gesundheit! Institute]]. Together with Carin, medical student Truman Schiff, and some old friends, he renovates an old cottage into a clinic. When they get the clinic running, they treat patients without [[health insurance|medical insurance]] and perform [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] for them.\n\nPatch's close friendship with Carin soon turns into romance. When Carin reveals to him that she had been [[Child Sexual Abuse|molested as a child]], Patch comforts her and reassures her that she can overcome her pain by helping others. Encouraged, Carin wants to help a disturbed patient, Lawrence \"Larry\" Silver. However, Larry [[murders]] Carin with a shotgun, then immediately commits [[suicide]]. Patch, guilt-ridden by Carin's death, begins to question the goodness in humanity. Standing on a cliff, he contemplates suicide again and asks [[God]] for an explanation. He then sees a [[butterfly]] that reminds him that Carin had always wished she was a [[caterpillar]] that could turn into a butterfly and fly away. The butterfly lands on his medical bag and shirt before flying away. With his spirits revived, Patch decides to dedicate his work to her memory.\n\nWalcott eventually discovers that Patch has been [[Violation of law|illegally]] running a clinic and [[Practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]] and attempts to expel him again because of this, as well as complaints that he has made his patients uncomfortable (which is obviously not true). Desperate to prove Walcott wrong, Patch files a grievance with the state medical board on the advice of his former medical school roommate, conservative Mitch Roman. Patch succeeds in convincing the board that he must treat the spirit as well as the body. The board, although they still find some of his methods very unorthodox, allows him to graduate and he receives a standing ovation from the packed hearing room.\n\nAt graduation, Patch receives his [[Doctor of Medicine]] and, bowing to the professors and audience, reveals himself to be naked underneath his cap and gown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Patch Adams|Dr. Hunter \"Patch\" Adams]], initially a mental patient, who wishes to change the way doctors think and treat their patients.                                        \n* [[Daniel London]] as Truman Schiff, Patch's best friend and most loyal follower, in medical school.\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Mitch Roman, Patch's uptight roommate, who initially clashes with Patch, but later joins his cause. \n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Dean Walcott, rigid dean of the Medical School, who locks horns with Patch right from the start.\n* [[Monica Potter]] as Carin Fisher, a serious medical student, who is later touched by Patch's passion.\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Judy, a nurse at the hospital\n* [[Irma P. Hall]] as Joletta, a nurse at the hospital\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Dr. Eaton, professor at the Medical School, who does appreciate Patch's efforts.\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Arthur Mendelson, wealthy mathematician who is in the mental hospital, and initially coins Patch's nickname.\n* Bruce Bohne as Trevor\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Dean Anderson, head of the Medical School; more tolerant of Patch than is Walcott. \n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Rudy, Patch's roommate at the mental hospital, who is sciurophobic (fear of squirrels).\n* [[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Emmet\n* [[Harry Groener]] as Dr. Prack, a humorless doctor at the mental hospital who is a colleague of Dean Walcott.\n* [[Richard Kiley]] as Dr. Titan, chair of the State Medical Board\n* [[Ryan Hurst]] as Neil\n* [[Ellen Albertini Dow]] as Aggie Kennedy, a sickly old lady in the hospital, whose childhood dream is to swim in a pool of noodles.\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Bill Davis, a dying, ill-tempered patient in the hospital who eventually bonds with Patch and accepts his fate with dignity.\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Everton\n* [[Dot-Marie Jones]] as Miss Meat (credited as Dot Jones)\n* Douglas Roberts as Lawrence \"Larry\" Silver, a mentally disturbed patient whom Carin tries to help, but he later murders her before taking his own life.\n* [[Norman Alden]] as Truck Driver\n* [[James Greene (American actor)|James Greene]] as Bile\n* [[Greg Sestero]] as Jaime (Carin\u2019s Brother) (Uncredited)\n* [[Ralph Peduto]] as Organizer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Paul Attanasio]] was brought in as a [[script doctor]] to work on the film prior to shooting.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Attanasio Bio |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001921/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm |publisher=iMDB}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in three locations: [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], [[California]] (near [[San Francisco]]), [[Asheville]] ([[North Carolina]]), and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. A diner was temporarily placed in [[Point Richmond]] (a neighborhood in [[Richmond, California]]) and served as the University Diner. Several interior classroom scenes were filmed on the campus of [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].\n\nThe film has several major departures from Adams' real history. One is that the character of Carin is fictional but is analogous to a real-life friend of Adams (a man) who was murdered under similar circumstances. Another difference is the then-47-year-old Robin Williams portrays Adams as enrolling in medical school very late in his life, his older age even being brought up in dialogue. In reality, Adams started medical school immediately and his educational progress was quite normal for a physician: he graduated high school at 18, college at 22, and medical school at 26.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released on December 25, 1998, in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and grossed $25.2 million in 2,712 theaters its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. Upon opening, it achieved the third-highest December opening weekend, behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Scream 2]]''.
