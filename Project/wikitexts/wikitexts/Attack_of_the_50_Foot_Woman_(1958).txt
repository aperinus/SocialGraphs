Juran]] (credited as Nathan Hertz) and starring [[Allison Hayes]], [[William Hudson (actor)|William Hudson]] and [[Yvette Vickers]]. It was produced by [[Bernard Woolner]]. The screenplay was written by [[Mark Hanna (screenwriter)|Mark Hanna]], and the original music score was composed by [[Ronald Stein]]. The film was distributed in the United States by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[War of the Satellites]]''.\n\nThe Allied Artists television version runs 75 minutes instead of 66, including a long printed crawl at the beginning and end, repeated sequences, and hold-frames designed to optically lengthen the film's running time.\n\nThe film's storyline concerns the plight of a wealthy heiress whose close encounter with an [[Extraterrestrial life|enormous alien]] in his round spacecraft causes her to grow into a [[giantess]], complicating her marriage which is already troubled by a philandering husband.<ref>[http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=3397418 eMoviePoster.com]</ref>\n\n''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'' is a variation on other 1950s science fiction films that featured size-changing humans: ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'' (1957), its sequel ''[[War of the Colossal Beast]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' (1957); in this case, a woman is the protagonist.<ref>''Keep Watching The Skies!

Facetiously, he calculates its path will take it to California. Nancy Archer ([[Allison Hayes]]), a wealthy but highly troubled woman with a history of emotional instability and immoderate drinking, is driving on a road that night in an American desert. A glowing sphere settles on the deserted highway in front of her, causing her to veer off the road. When she gets out to investigate the object, a huge creature exits and reaches for her.\n\nNancy escapes and runs back to town, but nobody believes her story due to her known drinking problem and a recent stay in a mental institution. Her philandering husband, Harry Archer ([[William Hudson (actor)|William Hudson]]), is more interested in his latest girlfriend, town [[floozy]] Honey Parker ([[Yvette Vickers]]). He pretends to be the good husband in the hope that Nancy will \"snap\" and return to the \"booby hatch,\" leaving him in control of her $50 million estate.\n\nNancy bargains with Harry, asking him to search the desert with her for the \"flying satellite,\" agreeing to a voluntary return to the sanatorium if they find nothing. As night falls, they find the spacecraft and the alien creature emerges, revealed as an enormous male human. Harry fires his pistol at the giant, but the gunfire has no effect. Harry flees, leaving Nancy behind.\n\nShe is later discovered on the roof of her pool house in a delirious state and must be sedated by her family physician, Dr. Cushing (Roy Gordon). The doctor comments on scratches he finds on Nancy's neck, and theorizes that she was exposed to radiation. Egged on by his mistress Honey, Harry plans to inject Nancy with a lethal dose of her sedative, but when he sneaks up to her room, he discovers that she has grown to giant size. In a scene paralleling Nancy's first alien encounter, only an enormous hand is seen as Harry reacts in horror.\n\nCushing and Dr. Von Loeb, a specialist brought in by Cushing, are at a loss on how to treat their giant patient. They keep her in a [[morphine]]-induced coma and restrain her with chains while waiting for the authorities to arrive. The sheriff and Jess ([[Ken Terrell]]), Nancy's faithful butler, track enormous footprints leading away from the estate to the alien sphere. Inside the sphere, they find Nancy's diamond necklace (containing the largest diamond in the world) and other large diamonds, each in a clear orb. They speculate that the jewels are being used as a power source for the alien ship. The huge human reappears, and the sheriff and Jess flee.\n\nMeanwhile, Nancy awakens and breaks free of her restraints. She tears off her mansion's roof and, clothed in a bikini-like arrangement of bed linens, heads to town to avenge herself on her unfaithful husband. Ripping the roof off the local bar, she spots Honey and drops a ceiling beam on her rival, killing her. Harry panics, grabs Deputy Charlie's pistol, and begins shooting, but she picks up Harry and walks away. The gunshots have no apparent effect on her. The sheriff fires a shotgun at her, which causes a nearby power line transformer to blow up, killing her. The doctors find Harry lying dead in her hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Allison Hayes]] as Nancy Fowler Archer\n* [[William Hudson (actor)|William Hudson]] as Harry Archer\n* [[Yvette Vickers]] as Honey Parker\n* Roy Gordon as Dr. Isaac Cushing\n* [[George Douglas (actor)|George Douglas]] as Sheriff Dubbitt\n* [[Ken Terrell]] as Jess Stout, Nancy's butler\n* [[Otto Waldis]] as Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb\n* Eileen Stevens as nurse\n* [[Frank Chase (screenwriter)|Frank Chase]] as Deputy Charlie\n* Michael Ross as Tony the bartender/the giant alien\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.17/10.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1001323_attack_of_the_50_foot_woman|title=Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango Meida]]|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Remakes and sequels==\nWith its low budget of around $88,000, ''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'' made enough money to prompt discussion of a sequel. According to executive producer and cinematographer Jacques Marquette, the sequel was to be produced at a higher budget and in color. A script was written, but the project never advanced beyond the discussion phase.<ref>Bill Warren, ''Keep Watching The Skies!

Woman (1993 film)|Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman]]''. It was directed by [[Christopher Guest]], with a script by ''[[Thirtysomething]]'' writer [[Joseph Dougherty]]. [[Daryl Hannah]] produced the film and starred in the title role.\n\nIn 1995, [[Fred Olen Ray]] produced a parody entitled ''[[Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold]]'', starring [[J.J. North]] and Tammy Parks. Beyond the basic premise, the plot has little in common with the original film, being concerned with the side effects of a beauty-enhancing formula on two ambitious female models. The film was farcical and made on an extremely low budget. The illusion of size difference was achieved using [[forced perspective]], unlike the earlier films which used [[Composite image|composite imaging]].\n\nIn late 2011, [[Roger Corman]] produced a [[3D film]] titled ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader]]'', released on August 25, 2012. It was written by Mike MacLean (who also wrote ''[[Sharktopus]]'' for Corman) and was directed by Kevin O'Neill. The film stars [[Jena Sims]] (a former Miss Georgia Teen USA) in the title role as Cassie Stratford and Olivia Alexander, who co-plays Sims's rival, Brittany Andrews.\n\n==Home media==\n''Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'' was released June 26, 2007 by [[Warner Bros. Home Video]] on region 1 DVD. It was also available in the Warner Bros. three-disc DVD box set ''Cult Camp Classics - Vol. 1: Sci-Fi Thrillers'', which also includes other two cult classic sci-fi thrillers from [[Allied Artists Pictures]], such as ''[[The Giant Behemoth]]'' (1959) and ''[[Queen of Outer Space]]'' (1958). An audio commentary track with co-star Yvette Vickers and Tom Weaver is also included. Although the DVDs are now officially out-of-print, on September 20, 2011, Warner Bros. added the film to its order-on-demand [[Warner Archive]] [[DVD-R]] collection; the content is the same as on the previous DVD releases. A Blu-ray will be released in December 2022 by Warner Archive Collection.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n'''Television'''\n\n*'''1978''' &ndash; Various animated television series have referenced the film, usually in episodes which involve a female character becoming giant-sized.
