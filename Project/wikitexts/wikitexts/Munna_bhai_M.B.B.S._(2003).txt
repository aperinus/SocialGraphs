({{translation|'''''Munna Brother M.B.B.S.'''''}}) is a 2003 Indian [[Hindi]]-language [[comedy drama]] film written and directed by [[Rajkumar Hirani]] (in his directorial debut) and produced by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]]. Released in [[India]] on 19 December 2003, it features [[Sunil Dutt]] in his final film role as the father to his real-life son, [[Sanjay Dutt]], who stars as the titular character. The cast also includes [[Gracy Singh]], [[Jimmy Sheirgill]], [[Arshad Warsi]], [[Rohini Hattangadi]], and [[Boman Irani]].\n\nBased in [[Mumbai]], the films follows Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), a goon who tries to please his father (Sunil Dutt) by pretending to be a doctor. When a doctor, Asthana (Irani), exposes Munna's lies and tarnishes his father's honor, Munna enrols in a medical college. Hijinks ensue when Munna, upon finding that Asthana is the college's dean, vows revenge, while also sparking a romance with a house doctor, Suman (Singh), unaware that she is Asthana's daughter.\n\n''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.'' was a major critical and commercial success, and was later followed by a second film ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'', thus becoming the first installment of the ''[[Munna Bhai (film series)|Munna Bhai film series]]''. Hirani revealed in an interview in September 2019 that production on the third Munna Bhai film starring Dutt in the title role will begin in towards the end of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/work-on-munnabhai-3-to-begin-next-year-vidhu-vinod-chopra/1/776723.html|title=Work on Munnabhai 3 to begin next year: Vidhu Vinod Chopra|website=India Today}}</ref> The film went on to win the 2004 [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment|National Film Award for Best Popular Film]], and several [[Filmfare awards]], including the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film|Best Film (Critics)]] and [[Filmfare Best Screenplay Award|Best Screenplay]]. At the box office, it achieved a silver jubilee status (25-week run) being one of only eight Hindi films to have achieved this status since the year 2000. In its 26th week of release, the film could still be found playing on 300 screens throughout India.<ref name=g>{{cite web|title=Top Earners 2003|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=209&catName=MjAwMw==|publisher=boxofficeindia.com|access-date=10 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525225820/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=209&catName=MjAwMw==|archive-date=25 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMurli Prasad Sharma, nicknamed \"Munna Bhai\", runs an [[extortion]] racket on the streets of [[Mumbai]]. He is supported by his loyal henchman, Circuit, who does most of his work for him. Once a year, Munna's gang converts his hide-out into a fully-functioning hospital, to fool Munna's visiting parents Hariprasad and Parvati, who believe Munna has become a real doctor. Munna's goons take turns playing doctors, staff and patients, to keep up the charade.\n\nThis works for many years, until one of Hari's annual visits with Parvati culminates in Hari bumping into Dr. Jagdish Asthana, who founded the first hospital in Munna's village years ago. Hari proposes to Asthana that they get Asthana's daughter \"Chinki\" and Munna married. Asthana agrees, even though Munna calls \"Chinki\" and asks her to reject him, lest his parents discover the truth. However, it is when his maid reacts shockingly to Munna's photo that Asthana realizes the truth, and exposes Munna to Hari and Parvati. Humiliated and embarrassed at their son's lack of a real [[vocation]], his parents leave the city and return home. Munna vows to set things right and exact vengeance from Asthana by getting a [[medical degree]], but unknowingly ends up enrolling in the same college whose [[Dean (education)|dean]] is Asthana. Certain that Munna has cheated his way through the entrance exam, but pending real evidence, Asthana is forced to allow Munna to study there.\n\nUpon becoming a student, Munna falls back to his ways by flouting all the rules of the hospital. He enforces his regime of \"common-sense treatment\", directly challenging Asthana's conventional opinions to get under his skin. He also calls upon Circuit to 'tweak' the system for him when needed. His behaviour is well-received by the hospital staff and patients, who are able to see the good-natured intent behind his anti-establishment actions. \n\nMeanwhile, Munna also develops a friendly relationship with Dr. Suman, who works at the hospital, unaware that she is \"Chinki\", an ignorance she hilariously exploits. Munna uses old-fashioned kindness and love to 'cure' many patients at the hospital, including Karan, a suicidal youngster he met on his first day of college, and home surgeon Dr. Rustom Pawri's father, who at one point fell ill and short of a desire to live. He even arranges to bring a stripper inside the patient ward to cheer up Zaheer, a man dying from [[cancer]] who he befriends in the process. \n\nWhen Asthana learns about the stripper episode, he sees this as a potential reason to expel Munna on disciplinary grounds, but is unable to do so after Munna injures himself in order to stay back. However, when he does recover, the hospital staff, patients and students stand in Asthana's way and refuse to let Munna leave. Munna is then made to take a test in front of the entire college the next day to keep his enrolment. Later that night, Zaheer dies; still in shock, Munna gives up at a point during the test and leaves; in the process, Anand Banerjee, a paraplegic patient who has been brain-dead for the last 12 years, comes back to life. Asthana, finally moved, is forced to change his opinion of Munna.\n\nMunna does not end up becoming a doctor, but news of his 'miraculous' treatments reaches his parents. They return to the city and forgive him. Munna ends up marrying Suman after learning of her true identity, and together, they open a real hospital in Munna's family village.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast is listed below (according to credits):-\n* [[Sunil Dutt]] as Shri Hariprasad Sharma, Munna's father\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as [[Munna Bhai|Murliprasad \"Munna Bhai\" Sharma]], a gangster and medical student in Mumbai\n* [[Gracy Singh]] as Dr. Suman \"Chinki\" Asthana, Dr. Asthana's daughter and a doctor who works alongside her father in the same hospital\n* [[Jimmy Shergill]] as Zaheer Ali, Suman's hospital patient & Munna's friend\n* [[Arshad Warsi]] as Sarkeshwar \"Circuit\" Mishra, Munna's sidekick\n* [[Rohini Hattangadi]] as Parvati Sharma, Munna's mother\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Dr. Jagdish \"J.\" (J dot) Asthana, Chinki's father and the college dean\n* [[Kurush Deboo]] as Dr. Rustam Pawri\n* [[Yatin Karyekar]] as Anand Banerjee, hospital patient\n* [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] as a pickpocket who tried to steal Hari's wallet (special appearance)\n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as the Tender Coconut Seller at Park\n* [[Neha Dubey]] as fake Chinki, Suman's friend\n* [[Mumaith Khan]] as Nandini 'Reena', the dancer in the song 'Dekh Le' (special appearance)\n* [[Priya Bapat]] as Meenal, 1st Year Medical Student\n* [[Pushkar Shrotri]] as a Professor in the college\n* [[Sundeep Suthar]] as Chaiwallah\n* [[Vishal Thakkar]] as Karan, the suicide patient\n* Anuradha Chandan as Vidya, Karan's mother\n* [[Khurshed Lawyer]] as Nagrajan Swamy, Munna's roommate and friend\n\n== Production ==\nIn an interview, Hirani discussed how the idea for the film emerged from his interaction with some friends who were medical students.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBLgcWf6h0o | title=My First Film Rajkumar Hirani Munna Bhai MBBS Anupama Chopra | website=[[YouTube]] | date=10 August 2016 | access-date=7 May 2018}}</ref> Later, he also had the opportunity to interact with a lot of medical professionals when some members of his family became sick.

[[Vivek Oberoi]] was considered for the role, but in the end Sanjay Dutt took the role as Munna, which ultimately gave him an image make over and helped change the public perception of the controversial superstar; his real-life father [[Sunil Dutt]] returned to the silver screen after 10 years to play Munna's father. This is the first and only film in which real-life father and son Sunil and Sanjay appear together, although they both appeared in ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971), ''Rocky'' (1981) and ''Kshatriya'' (1993) but not in any scenes together.\n\nThe original choice for Circuit's role was [[Makarand Deshpande]]. [[Arshad Warsi]] took over the role which proved to be a turning point for his career.\nThe scenes of the Medical College were shot at the Agriculture College of [[Pune]] and [[Grant Medical College]] [[Mumbai]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/wire-news/nitesh-rane-bails-out-marathi-filmmaker_797385.html | title=Nitesh Rane bails out Marathi filmmaker | publisher=Money Control | date=19 December 2012 | access-date=5 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film has a similar premise to the 1998 American film ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]]. The producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, however, denies there being a resemblance, and says that he had not watched the film before the release of ''Munna Bhai''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robin Williams: The man Bollywood thanks profusely for 'Mrs Doubtfire' and 'Patch Adams' that influenced two beloved Hindi films|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/robin-williams-the-man-bollywood-thanks-profusely-for-mrs-doubtfire-and-patch-adams-that-influenced-two-beloved-hindi-films-707414.html|work=[[News18]]|date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHirani did not have a big budget to shoot the film. As a result, he had to change the way certain scenes were shot. For example, the film ends with stills of Munna Bhai's wedding. Hirani was told that setting up a wedding stage and making a wedding outfit for Gracie Singh would cost him several thousand rupees. To save on some of that money, Hirani arranged to have the stills shot on an actual wedding stage set up for a real wedding near the sets. The production team reached an agreement with the wedding hall management and used their stage after a wedding ended.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Anu Malik]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 2003\n| recorded     = 2003\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length       = 33:39\n| label        = [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]\n| producer     = [[Anu Malik]]\n| prev_title   = [[LOC: Kargil]]\n| prev_year    = 2003\n| next_title   = [[Murder (2004 film)|Murder]]\n| next_year    = 2004\n}}\n\nThe music is composed by [[Anu Malik]].

He, along with his co-writer [[Abhijat Joshi]], started to write the script of their new film. They didn't wanted that script to include Munnabhai but after they wrote it, the script eventually turned out to be of ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]''. [[Sanjay Dutt]], [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Arshad Warsi]] and [[Boman Irani]] were to reprise their roles but after the death of Sunil in May 2005, Hirani decided that the film will only have Sanjay & Warsi to reprise their characters from ''Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.'' and other actors like [[Boman Irani]] and [[Jimmy Shergill]] were cast in new roles. ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' was released on 1 September 2006 and turned out to be a huge success.\nMunna Bhai part 3 is still in making.\n\n== Remakes ==\nThe film was remade in Tamil as ''[[Vasool Raja MBBS]]'' (2004), in Telugu as ''[[Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.]]'' (2004), in Kannada as  ''[[Uppi Dada M.B.B.S.]]'' (2007) and in Sinhala as ''[[Dr. Nawariyan]]'' (2017).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://munnabhaimbbs.indiatimes.com/ Official Website]\n* {{IMDb title|0374887}}\n* {{Mojo title|munnabhaimbbs}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|munna_bhai_mbbs}}\n*''[http://us.rediff.com/movies/munna06.html Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]'' at [[Rediff.com]]\n\n{{Rajkumar Hirani}}\n{{Vidhu Vinod Chopra}}\n{{Vinod Chopra Films}}\n{{The Munna Bhai series}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list1=\n{{National Film Award Wholesome Entertainment}}\n{{FilmfareCriticsAwardBestMovie}}\n}}\n{{Portalbar|Bollywood}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mumbai]]\n[[Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Indian crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Hindi films remade in other languages]]\n[[Category:2000s Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:Medical-themed films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Anu Malik]]\n[[Category:Indian gangster films]]\n[[Category:Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment National Film Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rajkumar Hirani]]\n[[Category:2003 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2003 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]"}]}}}}
