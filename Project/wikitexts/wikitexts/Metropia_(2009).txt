A gigantic [[rapid transit|underground]] network is created by joining all the undergrounds together beneath Europe. Roger (Vincent Gallo), from a suburb of [[Stockholm]], avoids the underground because he finds it disturbing. Sometimes when he is too near the underground he hears a strange voice in his head. One day Roger stumbles upon the truth that his life is controlled in every detail. Trexx, the company that runs the mammoth European rail network, has found a way to read and control minds using the dandruff shampoo \"Dangst\", with the goal of creating a  highly efficient advertising system. In order to break free, Roger joins forces with super-model Nina (Juliette Lewis), the former model and spokeswoman for Dangst.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Gallo]] as Roger\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Nina\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Ivan Bahn\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Ralph Parker\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Stefan\n* [[Sofia Helin]] as Anna\n* [[Shanti Roney]] as Karl\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Firaz\n* Joanna Zofia Bard Mikolajczyk as metro voice\n* Goran Marjanovic as asylum seeker\n* Magnus Skogberg Tear as Roger's boss\n* Lotta Brom\u00e9 as news anchor\n* Annelie Persson as Trexx Commercial\n* [[Indiana Neidell]] as Wayne Marshal\n\n==Production==\nThe story and supporting material were developed by Stockholm-based Atmo during a period of four years before the actual animation work had begun.<ref name=inviger>(2008-02-02) \"[http://www.filmivast.se/Film-i-Vast/Nyheter/Aktuella-nyheter/Metropia-inviger-ny-animationsstudio/ Metropia inviger ny animationsstudio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185604/http://www.filmivast.se/Film-i-Vast/Nyheter/Aktuella-nyheter/Metropia-inviger-ny-animationsstudio/ |date=2009-01-03 }}\" (in Swedish).
