The film follows two troubled teenage lovers, Amy Blue ([[Rose McGowan]]) and Jordan White ([[James Duval]]), who pick up a young handsome drifter named Xavier Red ([[Johnathon Schaech]]). After Xavier accidentally kills a store clerk, the trio embarks on a journey full of sex, violence, and people from Amy's past. Billed as \"A Heterosexual Movie by Gregg Araki\", ''The Doom Generation'' is the second film in the director's trilogy known as the ''Teenage Apocalypse'' film trilogy, the first being ''[[Totally Fucked Up]]'' (1993) and the last one ''[[Nowhere (film)|Nowhere]]'' (1997). The characters of Amy Blue and Jordan White are based on the Mark Beyer comic strip \"Amy and Jordan\".\n\n''The Doom Generation'' was Araki's major film debut. It was shot mostly at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of [[urban sprawl]] to give the film an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] feel. The budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26, 1995, before appearing at various other film festivals. It received mixed reviews from critics. During the press screening, many of the critics walked out. However, at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] (SFIFF), the film received critical acclaim, most proclaiming it as Araki's breakthrough film. Distributed by [[Trimark Pictures]], it was released in the United States on October 27, 1995. The film was not a financial success, earning only $284,785 at the box office. McGowan was nominated for the Best Debut Performance at the [[11th Independent Spirit Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nTeenage lovers Jordan White and Amy Blue pick up a handsome drifter named Xavier Red while driving home from a club. Jordan gives Xavier the nickname \"X\". A late-night stop at a convenience store leaves the three on the run when X accidentally kills the store's owner, forcing the trio to hide in a motel to avoid arrest. Jordan and Amy have sex in the bathtub, while X watches from an outside window. X then learns from the local television news program that the store owner's wife [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]] her children with a machete before committing suicide. This leads X to believe that the trio won't be considered suspects or be found by police.\n\nLater that evening, Amy has sex with X, despite their mutual dislike of each other. Eventually Jordan finds out, and things become tense as the two men develop a lingering sexual attraction for one another. As the trio journeys around the city of Los Angeles, they continue to get into violent (almost comedic; every item the trio buys always comes out to $6.66) situations due to people either claiming to be Amy's previous lovers or mistaking her for such. These incidents get the attention of the [[FBI]], and their goal is to find Amy and kill her (exactly the same sentiment is voiced by several other parties in the film). She is mistakenly identified by a fast food window clerk as \"Sunshine\" and later by a character played by [[Parker Posey]] as \"Kitten\".\n\nJordan, Amy and X spend the night in an abandoned warehouse, where they engage in a [[threesome]]. While Amy goes to urinate, Jordan and X are attacked by a trio of [[neo-Nazi]]s, one of whom had previously mistaken Amy for his ex-girlfriend \"Bambi\". The gang first severely beats up X, then holds Jordan down as the aforementioned neo-Nazi ties up and [[rape]]s Amy on top of an American flag. The group finally cuts off Jordan's penis with pruning shears and forces the severed penis into his mouth. After Amy breaks free, she kills the neo-Nazis with the shears and escapes with X, leaving Jordan for dead. The film ends with Amy and X driving in her car. X offers Amy a [[Dorito]], to no reply. Aimless on an empty road, the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Amy Blue\n* [[James Duval]] as Jordan White\n* [[Jonathon Schaech]] as Xavier \"X\" Red\n* [[Dustin Nguyen]] as Nguyen Coc Suc, the convenience store clerk\n* [[Margaret Cho]] as Nguyen's wife\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Brandi\n* [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]] as TV anchorpeople\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Bartholomew, Carnoburger cashier\n* [[Amanda Bearse]] as Barmaid\n* [[Cress Williams]] as Peanut\n* [[Skinny Puppy]] as Gang of goons\n* [[Perry Farrell]] as Stop 'n' Go clerk\n* [[Heidi Fleiss]] as Liquor store clerk\n* [[Zak Spears|Khristofor Rossianov]] as Don\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''The Doom Generation'' received mixed reviews, with critics often comparing the film both favorably and unfavorably to [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Natural Born Killers]]''.
