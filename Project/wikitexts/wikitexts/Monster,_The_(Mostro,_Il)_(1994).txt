This film was, at the time it came out, the highest-grossing film in Italy, bested later by another Benigni film, ''[[Life is Beautiful]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nLoris (Roberto Benigni) is a part-time mannequin handler for a department store. He hopes to learn [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in order to get an assistant manager position. He lives in a building where he hasn't paid the rent in months, and he also owes money to other people around town.\n\nAt a party, Loris is told about a [[nymphomania]]c who will sleep with anyone. Loris approaches the wrong woman, who runs away and tells the police. Because of his odd behavior, he becomes the chief suspect in a series of rape/murders. The chief of police, frustrated by the lack of solid evidence against Loris, resolves to provoke his passion and catch him \"red-handed.\" An attractive police officer, Jessica ([[Nicoletta Braschi]]) goes undercover as his roommate, and is directed by the chief and the police doctor, Paride ([[Michel Blanc]]), to dress provocatively in order to entrap Loris.\n\nAfter a few days living in his apartment, Jessica begins to doubt Loris really is the killer. Paride, however, is convinced that Loris is on the brink of committing his next crime. Paride visits Jessica's apartment on the pretext of fitting Loris for a suit. He performs all sorts of medical tests and Loris remains clueless, thinking he really is being fitted for a suit. Later, Loris goes to interview at the Chinese company. His teacher gives him a little Chinese good luck charm, and Jessica sees this. Loris bombs the interview, unable to answer the very first question: to tell his name.\n\nJessica is about to give up on the case when Paride brings her a Little Red Riding Hood costume and says the chief orders her to put it on. Paride is certain this will unleash Loris' \"erotic urges.\" Jessica does as instructed but Loris remains unmoved. Jessica is back at the police station when they get news that the killer has struck again. At the crime scene, Jessica finds the good luck charm and connects it to Loris' Chinese instructor. She goes to the instructor's house, where she finds both Loris and the teacher. She instructs a uniformed officer to release Loris, then she calmly directs the real killer to a squad car. The film concludes with Loris and Jessica kissing and then walking off into the sunset.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened with a record gross of $13.4 million in its opening week in Italy and was [[List of 1994 box office number-one films in Italy|number one]] for three weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=7 November 1994|title=Italian Openers|page=5}}</ref> It went on to gross $23 million in Italy, becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films in Italy|highest-grossing film of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Screen International]]|date=20 December 1996|page=33|title=International box office comment|first=Lee|last=Marshall}}</ref> TV and newspaper film critics in the United States were generally dismissive of this film.
