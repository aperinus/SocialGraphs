The film is an adaptation of the [[Blindness (novel)|1995 novel of the same name]] by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] author [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]. The film was written by [[Don McKellar]] and directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]], starring [[Julianne Moore]] as the doctor's wife and [[Mark Ruffalo]] as the doctor. Saramago originally refused to sell the rights for a film adaptation, but the producers were able to acquire it with the condition that the film would be set in an unnamed and unrecognizable city. ''Blindness'' premiered as the opening film at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 14, 2008, and was released in Canada as part of the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with a young professional suddenly going blind in his car while at an intersection, with his field of vision turning white. A seemingly kind passerby offers to drive him home. However, he then steals the blind man's car. When the blind man's wife returns home, she takes him to an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] who can identify nothing wrong and refers him for further evaluation.\n\nThe next day, the doctor goes blind, and recognizes that the blindness must be caused by a communicable disease. Around the city, more citizens are struck blind, causing widespread panic, and the government organizes a quarantine for the blind in a derelict asylum. When a [[hazmat suit|hazmat]] crew arrives to pick up the doctor, his wife lies that she has also gone blind in order to accompany him.\n\nIn the asylum, the doctor and his wife are first to arrive and agree they will keep her sight a secret. They are joined by several others, including the driver, the thief, and other patients of the doctor. At this point, the \"white sickness\" has become international, with hundreds of cases reported every day. The government is resorting to increasingly ruthless measures to try to deal with the epidemic, including refusing aid to the blind.\n\nAs more blinded people are crammed into what has become a concentration camp, overcrowding and lack of outside support cause hygiene and living conditions to quickly degrade. The doctor serves as the representative of his ward, and his sighted wife does what she can to assist her fellow inmates without revealing her ability. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines morale and introduces conflict between the prison's wards, as the soldiers who guard the camp become increasingly hostile.\n\nA man with a handgun appoints himself \"king\" of his ward, and takes control of the food deliveries, first demanding the other wards' valuables, and then for the women to have sex with their men. In an effort to obtain necessities, several women reluctantly submit to being raped. One of the women is killed by her assailant, and the doctor's wife retaliates, killing the \"king\" with a pair of scissors. Independently, other raped women sneak to the dead king's ward and set it on fire, which rapidly engulfs the building, with many inmates dying in the ensuing chaos. The survivors who escape the building discover that the guards have abandoned their posts, and they venture out into the city.\n\nSociety has collapsed, with the city's population reduced to an aimless, zombie-like struggle to survive. The doctor's wife leads her husband and a few others from their ward in search of food and shelter. She discovers a well-stocked basement storeroom beneath a grocery store, barely escaping with aid from her husband when the throng around her smell the fresh food she is carrying.\n\nThe doctor and his wife invite their new \"family\" to their apartment, where they establish a mutually supportive long-term home. Then, just as suddenly as his sight had been lost, the driver \u2013 the first man to lose their sight \u2013 recovers his sight, indicating that the body had fought off the disease, and that the blindness is ultimately temporary. They celebrate and their hope is restored.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as the Doctor's Wife, the only person immune to the epidemic of blindness.

In defiance of the doctor's [[democracy|democratic]] efforts and election as leader of Ward 1, the bartender declares himself \"King of Ward 3\" and gains immediate popularity from his \"subjects\" by prioritizing food over his ward's community responsibilities such as burying the dead. He somehow obtains a revolver and uses it to bully the other wards by controlling the food supply. Meirelles followed the advice of [[Brazil]]ian stage director Antunes Filho and changed the character from the novel by making him more ambiguous, explaining, \"In the book, he is really a mean guy, terribly evil from the beginning... but I thought it was more interesting to have him be not evil but more like a child with a gun.\"<ref name=\"foresight\" /> Bernal described the result of his character, \"I think the King is just very practical, very pragmatic.

She starts out quite tough, but she develops very strong maternal feelings.\" Meirelles explained that the character's glasses and cascading hair gave her a cold appearance, but through her scenes with the orphaned Boy with the Squint, she develops warmth.<ref name=\"notes\" />\n* [[Don McKellar]] as thief.<ref name=\"notes\" /> McKellar, who wrote the screenplay for the film, had also acted in the past and was cast as the character. The screenwriter described the Thief, \"I like the trick where you think the Thief is a bad guy. He's a pathetic character you first believe is the villain of the piece and then you realize that, no, he's not even close to that.

Meirelles chose to make a contemporary film so audiences could relate to the characters.<ref name=cannes/> The director also sought a different allegorical approach. He described the novel as \"very allegorical, like a fantasy outside of space, outside the world\", and he instead took a naturalistic direction in engaging audiences to make the film less \"cold.\"<ref name=ifc>{{cite news | first=Erica | last=Abeel | url=http://www.ifc.com/film/film-news/2008/05/cannes-08-fernando-meirelles-o.php | title=Cannes 08: Fernando Meirelles on \"Blindness\" | work=[[Independent Film Channel]] | publisher=[[Rainbow Media]] | date=2008-05-15 | accessdate=2008-07-25 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905030419/http://www.ifc.com/film/film-news/2008/05/cannes-08-fernando-meirelles-o.php | archive-date=2008-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nDon McKellar said about adapting the story, \"None of the characters even have names or a history, which is very untraditional for a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] story. The film, like the novel, directly addresses sight and point of view and asks you to see things from a different perspective.\" McKellar wrote the script so audiences would see the world through the eyes of the protagonist, the doctor's wife. He sought to have them question the humanity of how she observes but does not act in various situations, including a rape scene. He consulted Saramago about why the wife took so long to act. McKellar noted, \"He said she became aware of the responsibility that comes with seeing gradually, first to herself, then to her husband, then to her small family, then her ward, and finally to the world where she has to create a new civilization.\" The screenwriter wrote out the \"actions and circumstances\" that would allow the wife to find her responsibility.<ref name=\"notes\" /> While the completed script was mostly faithful to the novel, McKellar went through several drafts that were not. One such saw him veer away from the novel by creating names and backstories for all the characters. Another significantly changed the chronology. Only after these abortive attempts did McKellar decide to cut the backstories and focus primarily on the doctor and his wife. He attempted to reconnect with what originally drew him to the novel: what he called its \"[[Existentialism|existential]] simplicity\". The novel defines its characters by little more than their present actions; doing the same for the adaptation became \"an interesting exercise\" for McKellar.<ref name=\"creative\" />\n\nMcKellar attended a summer camp for the blind as part of his research. He wanted to observe how blind people interacted in groups. He discovered that excessive expositional dialogue, usually frowned upon by writers, was essential for the groups. McKellar cut one of the last lines in the novel from his screenplay: \"I don't think we did go blind, I think we are blind. Blind but seeing. Blind people who can see, but do not see.\" McKellar believed viewers would by that point have already grasped the symbolism and didn't want the script to seem heavy-handed. He also toned down the visual cues in his screenplay, such as the \"brilliant milky whiteness\" of blindness described in the novel. McKellar knew he wanted a stylistically adept director and didn't want to be too prescriptive, preferring only to hint at an approach.<ref name=\"creative\" />\n\n===Filming and casting===\n[[File:Yusuke Iseya, Yoshino Kimura, Danny Glover (atr\u00e1s do cara), ?, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo..jpg|thumb|Filming in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\nMeirelles chose [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] as the primary backdrop for ''Blindness'', though scenes were also filmed in [[Osasco|Osasco, S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil; [[Guelph|Guelph, Ontario]], Canada; and [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. With all the characters aside from Julianne Moore's character being blind, the cast was trained to simulate blindness. The director also stylized the film to reflect the lack of point of view that the characters would experience. Meirelles said several actors he talked to were intimidated by the concept of playing characters without names: \"I offered the film to some actors who said, 'I can't play a character with no name, with no history, with no past. With Gael (Garc\u00eda Bernal), he said, 'I never think about the past. I just think what my character wants.'\"<ref name=\"EW Fall Preview\">\"Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Blindness.\" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg.55.</ref>\n\nBy September 2006, Fernando Meirelles was attached to ''Blindness'', with the script being adapted by Don McKellar.

Actor Christian Duurvoort from Meirelles' ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' led a series of workshops to coach the cast members. Duurvoort had researched the mannerisms of blind people to understand how they perceive the world and how they make their way through space. Duurvoort not only taught the extras mannerisms, but also to convey the emotional and psychological states of blind people.<ref name=ills/> One technique was reacting to others as a blind person, whose reactions are usually different from those of a sighted person.

He explained, \"When you do a film, everything is related to point of view, to vision.

The director began with an omniscient vantage point, transited to the intact viewpoint of the doctor's wife, and changed again to the Man with the Black Eye Patch, who connects the quarantined to the outside world with stories. The director concluded the switching with the combination of the perspective of the Doctor's Wife and the narrative of the Man with the Black Eye Patch.<ref name=\"notes\"/>\n\nThe film also contains visual cues, such as the 1568 painting ''[[The Parable of the Blind]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. Allusions to other famous artworks are also made. Meirelles described the intent: \"It's about image, the film, and vision, so I thought it makes sense to create, not a history of painting, because it's not, but having different ways of seeing things, from Rembrandt to these very contemporary artists. But it's a very subtle thing.\"<ref name=ills/>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical run===\nPrior to public release, Meirelles screened ''Blindness'' to test audiences. A screening of his first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/why-the-director-of-blindness-likes-test-screenings/article672463/|title=Why the director of Blindness likes test screenings|last=Renzetti|first=Elizabeth|date=2008-04-16|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]]|location=Toronto|accessdate=2016-06-30}}</ref> Meirelles explained his goal, \"When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved until the end of the story.\"<ref name=\"foresight\" /> He also found that a [[New York City]] test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge;
