The film tells the story of a murderous neighbourhood gang, a poor village with unlikely heroes, and an aspiring gangster's fierce journey to find his true self. [[Eva Huang]], [[Yuen Wah]], [[Yuen Qiu]], [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] and [[Leung Siu-lung]] co-starred in prominent roles. The martial arts choreography is supervised by [[Yuen Woo-ping]].\n\n''Kung Fu Hustle'' was a co-production between [[Hong Kong]] and [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] companies, filmed in [[Shanghai]]. After the commercial success of ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'', its production company, Star Overseas, began to develop the films with [[Columbia Pictures]] Asia in 2002. It features a number of retired actors famous for 1970s [[Hong Kong action cinema]] and has been compared to contemporary and influential [[wuxia]] films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]''. The [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] special effects in the film accompanied by traditional [[Music of China|Chinese music]], is often cited as its most striking feature.\n\nThe film was released on 23 December 2004 in China and on 25 January 2005 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and grossed US$17 million in North America and US$84 million in other regions. It was tenth on the [[List of highest-grossing non-English films|list of highest-grossing foreign-language films]] in the United States as well as the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the country in 2005. ''Kung Fu Hustle'' won numerous awards, including six [[Hong Kong Film Award]]s and five [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Awards]]. The film was re-released in 3D in October 2014 across Asia and America, marking the tenth anniversary of the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1940s [[Shanghai]], petty crooks Sing and Bone aspire to join the notorious [[The Axe Gang|Axe Gang]] under the leadership of the cold-blooded killer Brother Sum. The pair visit a rundown slum known as Pig Sty Alley to extort the residents by pretending to be Axe Gang members. Sing throws a firecracker that he claims will signal the rest of the Axe Gang, but his bluff backfires when the firecracker explodes next to a real Axe Gang underboss. Sing blames the residents for throwing the firecracker and the boss attacks them, but he is struck and killed by an unseen assailant. Gang reinforcements arrive but they are all quickly dealt with by three of the slum's tenants: Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, who reveal they are actually [[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]] masters. However, fearing the Axe Gang's retaliation, the slum's Landlady evicts the trio.\n\nBrother Sum captures Sing and Bone, intending to kill them for posing as gang members. However, Sing uses his exceptional lock-picking skills to free himself and Bone before they are killed by thrown axes. The impressed Brother Sum allows them to join the gang on the condition that they kill someone. Sing laments being a failure in life. He recalls his childhood to Bone when he was tricked by a vagrant into buying a martial arts pamphlet with his meager saving because he was duped into thinking he was a natural-born kung fu master. After practising the pamphlet's Buddhist Palm technique many times, Sing attempted to save a mute girl named Fong from bullies but was instead beaten and humiliated. Sing becomes adamant that heroes never win and resolves to be a villain.\n\nSing and Bone return to Pig Sty Alley to kill the Landlady. However, their plan backfires as Sing is repeatedly stabbed by his and Bone's missed knife throws. He retreats to a traffic pulpit where his body rapidly heals from his deadly injuries. The pain causes him to strike the sides of the metal pulpit, covering the surface with hand-shaped impressions. Meanwhile Brother Sum hires two Harpists that use a magical [[guzheng]] to kill their victims with sound. The assassins arrive at Pig Sty Alley just as the trio of kung fu masters are leaving. The Harpists kill Coolie and defeat Donut and Tailor with their magical instrument; however, they are defeated afterwards by the Landlady and her husband the Landlord, who are revealed to be kung fu masters as well. The Landlady then warns Brother Sum, who watched the fight with his adviser, to stay away from Pig Sty Alley.\n\nA frustrated Sing attempts to rob an ice cream vendor but discovers that she is actually Fong. When she recognises him and offers him a lollipop, he smashes it and leaves in shame; he also rebuffs Bone. Brother Sum offers Sing immediate gang membership if he uses his lock-picking skills to free the Beast, a legendary kung fu assassin from a Shanghai mental asylum. Sing brings the Beast back to the Axe Gang's headquarters.\n\nBrother Sum is sceptical of the Beast's skills due to his flippant attitude and sloppy appearance. However, the Beast proves his kung fu prowess by stopping a bullet midair with his fingers. When the Beast detects the kung fu presence of the Landlady and Landlord, he destroys the casino next door to confront the couple. A fight breaks out between the three and culminates in all of them being immobilised in an inter-joint lock. Brother Sum orders Sing to attack the Landlady and Landlord to help the Beast, but Sing has a change of heart and attacks the Beast instead. Infuriated, the Beast smashes Sing's head into the ground, but he is saved by the Landlady and Landlord. The trio flee and Brother Sum berates the Beast for letting them escape; the Beast kills Brother Sum in response.\n\nBack at Pig Sty Alley, the Landlady and Landlord treat Sing and are surprised by his quick recovery from his fatal injuries. Sing then treats the couple's wounds in return before confronting the Axe Gang. The Landlady deduces that the Beast's beating of Sing has realigned Sing's ''[[qi]]'', metamorphosing him into a natural kung fu master. The new Sing effortlessly dispatches the Axe Gang before fighting the Beast, who initially appears to have the upper hand due to his \"toad style\". However, when Sing is sent flying into the sky by the Beast, he has a vision of Buddha in the clouds and completes his transformation. Sing uses the Buddhist Palm technique to defeat the Beast. Awestruck by Sing's power and prowess, the Beast tearfully bows to Sing and concedes defeat.\n\nSing and Bone open a candy store with Fong's lollipop as their logo. Fong visits Sing at his store, and the pair embrace. Meanwhile the same mysterious vagrant who sold Sing the martial arts pamphlet speaks to another child just outside the store, but this time he is selling multiple pamphlets teaching several different styles.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Stephen Chow]] as Sing, a loser in life who joins the Axe Gang but soon finds a higher calling.

However, this difference provides one of the reasons why Kung Fu Hustle was so well received.\n\n{{cquote|''Kung Fu Hustle'' responded to and amplified a global demand for the reawakening of martial arts cinema\u2014and one which was fulfilled by a multitude of reiterations of the genre, all of which can be said, without a doubt, fulfilled the criteria for 21st-century action cinema: high budget, stylish, and action-packed.<ref name=\"KungFuProductionforGlobalConsumption\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.43.1.65|title=Kung Fu Production for Global Consumption: The Depoliticization of Kung Fu in Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle|last=Dumas|first=Raechel|journal=Style|year=2009|volume=43|issue=1|pages=65\u201385|jstor=10.5325/style.43.1.65|access-date=12 June 2020|archive-date=17 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617022213/https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/style.43.1.65|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nDirectors and their contemporaries changed the martial arts cinema together to gain more universal appeal.<ref name=\"KungFuProductionforGlobalConsumption\"/> The work has built martial arts as a viable mode of behavioural expression in the movie, and also displayed how martial arts could be transformed in the cinema industry to reflect both \"contemporary local issues and the increasingly important reality of globalization.\"<ref name=\"KungFuProductionforGlobalConsumption\"/> Unlike Ang Lee's ''wuxia'' film, ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', Stephen Chow chose to use the perspective of a lowly gangster to break into Wuxia and Jianghu.
