The film was based on the historic [[Beefsteak Raid]] of September 1864 led by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Major General]] [[Wade Hampton III]].\n\n==Plot==\nCattleman Alvarez Kelly ([[William Holden]]) is contracted to deliver a herd to the [[Union Army]] in [[Virginia]]. As he nears the end of his long [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drive]], Kelly is captured by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] raiders led by Colonel Tom Rossiter ([[Richard Widmark]]). The Confederacy desperately needs the beef to feed its soldiers besieged in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nKelly is \"persuaded\" to help shanghai and deliver the stolen herd to Richmond. Despite the hatred between the two men, they manage to work together. Kelly first teaches Rossiter's men how to drive cattle. Then, they proceed to capture and drive the herd away, despite the efforts of Union officer Major Albert Stedman ([[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]]). As revenge, Kelly arranges passage for Rossiter's discontented fianc\u00e9e, Liz Pickering ([[Janice Rule]]), on a [[blockade runner]] leaving the besieged city.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Holden]] as Alvarez Kelly\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as Col.

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' remarked that it was \"a good picture\u2014nice and crisp and tough\", praised the script writer [[Franklin Coen]] for \"blueprinting a fresh idea, and salting it with some tingling, unstereotyped behavior and gristly dialogue\". He further praised the cinematography, the casting of Holden and Widmark, which he considered \"sardonic perfection\",  and added that the \"picture perks up beautifully in the ripely-detailed homestretch\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Crowther, Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02EFD81338E43BBC4F52DFB767838D679EDE|title=Alvarez Kelly|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 November 1966|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> ''Variety'' praised the action sequences with the cattle stampede but, unlike Crowther, thought there were some issues with the script which they believed \"overdevelops some characters and situations, and underdevelops others\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1965/film/reviews/alvarez-kelly-1200421156/|title=Alvarez Kelly|magazine=Variety|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAuthor John H. Lenihan compares the film to ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in that both films \"offer no consolation in their vivid deglamorization of war. The heroes, or antiheroes, of both films pursue selfish pecuniary ventures as a conscious alternative to becoming committed in a pointless destructive war\".<ref name=\"Lenihan1980\">{{cite book|last=Lenihan|first=John H.|title=Showdown: Confronting Modern America in the Western Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3TaxS2uWxQC&pg=PA53|year=1980|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-01254-9|page=53}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0060095}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|id=3969}}\n* {{AllMovie title|id=1736}}\n* {{AFI film|id=19575|title=Alvarez Kelly}}\n\n{{Edward Dmytryk}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1966 Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:American Civil War films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Edward Dmytryk]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Virginia]]\n[[Category:1960s historical films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Richmond, Virginia]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
