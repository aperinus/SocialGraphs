It was released September 14, 2012, in select theaters.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the day of their 10-year [[high school reunion]], Jake and his girlfriend Jess arrive at the home of his now-married high school friends Cully and Sam. Other friends begin to arrive including best friends Marty and AJ, famous musician Reeves, and the adventurous Scott with his wife, Suki. They depart for the reunion and reunite with their friend Garrity and meet his wife Olivia; and reconnect with Garrity's best friend Andre. Meanwhile, reclusive classmate Elise arrives at the reunion alone. She is ignored by the party planner, [[prom#In the United States|prom queen]] Anna.\n\nJake, Cully, Andre, and Reeves smoke a [[Cannabis (drug)#Recreational|joint]] in Jake's car when he reveals an envelope with an [[engagement ring]] inside, stating that he has intended to ask Jess to marry him for quite some time but hasn't found the right moment to propose. However, Jake is conflicted when he sees his [[high school sweetheart]] Mary and her new husband Paul. Jake, Jess, Mary, and Paul share awkward introductions, and Jake and Mary reconnect for the first time in eight years. Reeves approaches Elise and the pair reminisce when he spots an old picture of Elise wearing bright yellow shoes.\n\nAs the night continues, Olivia unexpectedly discovers that Garrity has an affinity for [[hip hop music|hip hop]], Cully drunkenly attempts and fails to appropriately apologize to some [[geek]]y classmates for being a [[bully]] in high school, and Marty and AJ attempt to flirt with Anna, causing tension between the duo. Jake and Mary discuss prom, which they were unable to attend due to Mary's father having a [[heart attack]] that night. As the reunion comes to a close, the group departs for a local [[karaoke bar]]. Reeves flirts with Elise but she turns him down.\n\nAnna leaves the party early, resulting in Marty and AJ deciding to [[toilet papering|toilet paper]] her house. At the bar, Jess takes notice of Jake's behavior around Mary and decides to return to the hotel under the guise of being tired. Paul does the same. Scott and Suki sing karaoke and Olivia is impressed by Garrity's [[breakdancing]] abilities. Reeves is pressured by his friends to sing his hit song \"Never Had\". Elise, never having heard the song, realizes it was inspired by her. The two share a kiss and spend the remainder of the night together. Anna catches Marty and AJ vandalizing her home and becomes upset, revealing that she is now an unhappy single mother with two children. Marty reveals that he is not a successful [[New York City|New Yorker]], but instead lives in a small apartment and is financially unstable, and AJ reveals that he is getting a divorce. The trio bond over their shared life issues.\n\nAs the night comes to a close, Cully becomes embarrassingly drunk and upsets Sam. Scott reveals to his friends that he intends on returning to [[Japan]] with Suki to continue their adventures together. Mary asks Jake for the dance they never had at prom, finally giving them an opportunity to properly end their relationship. Mary reveals that she's pregnant, the two agree that they are happy with where their lives have taken them. Jake returns to the hotel and finds Jess still awake. She reveals that she left to allow Jake to get his closure with Mary.\n\nJake and Jess soon join their friends at a local diner. Jake returns to his car and obtains the engagement ring from the envelope.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--In closing credits order-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Channing Tatum]]<ref name=About /> as Jake Stafford\n* [[Jenna Dewan|Jenna Dewan-Tatum]] as Jess\n* [[Justin Long]]  as Marty Burn\n* [[Max Minghella]] as AJ\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Reeves\n* [[Chris Pratt]]<ref>Rich, Katey (August 26, 2010).
