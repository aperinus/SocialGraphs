The film was followed by the sequel ''[[Captain America II: Death Too Soon]]'', also released in the same year.<ref>{{citation |title=Captain America and the struggle of the superhero |author=Cord Scott, Robert G. Weiner |page=221 |isbn=978-0-7864-3703-0 |year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Rogers ([[Reb Brown]]) is a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] whose father is a 1940s government agent. His father's patriotic attitude earns him the nickname \"Captain America\". His father is later murdered.\n\nRogers, now making a living as an artist and traveling the countryside in a [[conversion van]], is inspired by his father's story to sketch a superhero. He is critically injured from an attempt on his life that is set up to seem like an accident.\n\nHe is administered an experimental serum called the FLAG formula, an acronym for \"Full Latent Ability Gain\" \u2014 a kind of \"super-steroid\" \u2014 which Rogers' father had developed from his own glands. The formula not only saves his life, but enhances his strength and reflexes. These new abilities inspire Dr. Simon Mills ([[Len Birman]]), the research biochemist and intelligence official behind FLAG who was once a friend of Steve's father, to recruit Steve and give him a costume based on his drawing.\n\nAs Captain America, Steve's conversion van is re-configured so that it can launch a high-tech motorcycle. The bike features rocket thrust \u2014 a jet booster for rapid acceleration \u2014 and a stealth setting that reduces engine and road noise. In the sequel, ''[[Captain America II: Death Too Soon]]'' it also possesses a detachable wing resembling a hang glider that allows limited gravity-powered flight.\n\nIn the final act of the film, Rogers decides to become the same Captain America as his father had been, donning a uniform identical to the one his father had worn: the \"classic\" Captain America uniform.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Reb Brown]] as [[Captain America|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]\n* [[Len Birman]] as Dr. Simon Mills\n* [[Heather Menzies]] as Dr. Wendy Day\n* [[Robin Mattson]] as Tina Hayden\n* [[Joseph Ruskin]] as  Rudy Sandrini\n* [[Lance LeGault]] as Harley\n* [[Frank Marth]] as Agent Charles Barber\n* [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as Lou Brackett\n*Chip Johnson as Jerry\n*James Ingersoll as Lester Wiant\n*Jim B.
