The Dream Begins''''') is a 2005 [[sports drama]] film directed by [[Danny Cannon]] from a screenplay by [[Mike Jefferies]], [[Adrian Butchart]], [[Dick Clement]], and [[Ian La Frenais]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Dream-Begins-Kuno-Becker/dp/B000GJ0LLI/|title=Goal! The Dream Begins (2006) - DVD Amazon|website=www.amazon.com|date=12 September 2006}}</ref> It is the first installment in the [[Goal! (film series)|''Goal!'' trilogy]] and stars [[Kuno Becker]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Marcel Iure\u015f]], [[Stephen Dillane]], and [[Anna Friel]]. In the film, Santiago Mu\u00f1ez (Becker), an amateur player, earns an unlikely chance to play professional [[association football|football]].\n\n''Goal!'' was made with co-operation from [[FIFA]], which enabled the inclusion of [[FIFPro]] likenesses of real teams and players. [[Adidas]] contributed a reported $50 million towards the film's budget and marketing campaign, marking the then-biggest deal between a corporate brand and a film production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2722730-how-goal-went-from-a-wild-idea-to-a-cult-movie-franchise-for-football-fans.amp.html|title=How 'Goal!' Went from a Wild Idea to a Cult Movie Franchise for Football Fans| publisher=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''Goal!'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista International]] on 1 October 2005. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the sports sequences and Becker's performance but criticism for the screenplay, with many labelling it clich\u00e9. ''Goal!'' underperformed at the box office, grossing $27.6 million worldwide. Despite this, ''Goal!'' is considered to be a [[cult film]], with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], the team featured in the film, seeing a direct rise in popularity as a result. The sequel, ''[[Goal II: Living the Dream]]'', was released in the United Kingdom in February 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nSantiago Mu\u00f1ez, a Mexican undocumented immigrant living in [[Los Angeles]], is a skilled [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for his local team and works as a gardener with his father, Hernan, and as a busboy in a Chinese restaurant. During one of his matches, Santiago is approached by Glen Foy, a former player and scout for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], who helps arrange a trial with the club. To afford travel to England, Santiago saves his earnings, which is later used by Hernan to buy a truck for the business, being dismissive of Santiago's chances at becoming a professional. Santiago's grandmother, Mercedes, secretly hands him money and urges him to depart for England before Hernan can find out.\n\nArriving in Newcastle, Santiago stays with Glen and begins his trial. In muddy conditions, Santiago struggles under pressure from Hughie McGowan, a teammate, during a training match. Although unimpressed, Erik Dornhelm, the club's manager, acquiesces to Glen's request that Santiago's trial last for a month. During a medical, Santiago lies about his asthma to club nurse, Roz Harmison, fearing it will damage his chances of being signed; he is then given a one-month contract.\n\nDespite facing some bullying by Hughie, Santiago becomes friends with Jamie Drew, another player on trial. Santiago soon adapts to English conditions and a reserve match is scheduled at the end of his trial to determine his signing on a full-time basis. Before the match, Santiago tries to use his inhaler but Hughie destroys it, leading to an asthma flare-up. After another disappointing performance, Newcastle let Santiago go.\n\nOn his way to the airport, Santiago's taxi picks up Gavin Harris, an indisciplined, struggling yet talented player who recently joined Newcastle. Gavin, late for training, finds out about Santiago's asthma, and informs Erik. Erik lets Santiago stay, contingent on him seeking treatment for his asthma. Santiago then moves in with Gavin and they form a friendship. After impressive performances in the reserves, Santiago makes his debut for the first team, coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. Santiago earns a penalty, which helps them win the match, a moment proudly seen by Hernan.\n\nDespite the victory, Erik criticizes Santiago's selfishness on the pitch, urging him to pass the ball more. That night, he and Gavin go out partying and their drunken picture winds up in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', enraging Erik. Jamie suffers a career-ending injury as Santiago and Gavin's friendship starts to crumble. Hernan suffers a fatal heart attack and Santiago prepares to return home. At the airport, Santiago abandons his flight, instead training until the early hours at [[St James' Park]] after a conversation with Roz, with whom Santiago begins a relationship. Erik then informs Santiago he has been selected to start the season's final game against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].\n\nOn match day, Newcastle score early but Liverpool soon take the lead. In the final minutes of injury time, Santiago assists Gavin for the equalizer, however, a draw will not be enough to earn Newcastle a place in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Minutes before the end of the game, Newcastle earn a [[Direct free kick|free kick]], which Gavin hands to Santiago, who scores and Newcastle win 3\u20132. After the match, Glen relays a call to Santiago from Mercedes, informing Santiago his father watched his match against Fulham.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kuno Becker]] as Santiago Mu\u00f1ez\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Gavin Harris\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as Glen Foy\n* [[Marcel Iures]] as Erik Dornhelm\n* [[Anna Friel]] as Roz Harmison\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Hernan Mu\u00f1ez\n* [[Kieran O'Brien]] as Hughie McGowan\n* [[Kevin Knapman]] as Jamie Drew\n* [[Sean Pertwee]] as Barry Rankin\t\n* [[M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n]] as Mercedes Mu\u00f1ez\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2022}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Goal!: Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 3 October 2005\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = \n| length     = \n| label      = [[Big Brother Recordings|Big Brother]] (UK)\n| producer   =\n| chronology = \n| prev_title = \n| prev_year  = \n| next_title = \n| next_year  = \n}}\n\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''Goal!'' was composed by [[Graeme Revell]], who previously collaborated with director [[Danny Cannon]] on ''[[Phoenix (1998 film)|Phoenix]]'' (1998).\n\nA soundtrack album was released on [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]' [[Big Brother Recordings]] label in 2005 and contains three Oasis songs unavailable elsewhere, including the exclusive [[Noel Gallagher]] song \"Who Put the Weight of the World on My Shoulders?\" The soundtrack also contains a re-recorded version of Oasis' \"[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?|Cast No Shadow]]\" with Gallagher on vocals and produced by [[Unkle]].
