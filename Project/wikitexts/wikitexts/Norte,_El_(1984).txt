The screenplay was written by Gregory Nava and [[Anna Thomas]], based on Nava's story. The movie was first presented at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in 1983, and its wide release was in January 1984.<ref>{{BFI|id=4ce2b74dd57a1}}.</ref>\n\nThe drama features [[Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez]] and [[David Villalpando]], in their first film roles, as two [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] youths who flee [[Guatemala]] due to the ethnic and political persecution of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]].<ref>[https://www.avclub.com/the-50-most-important-american-independent-movies-1842597128/slides/22 America's 50 best independent movies|AV Club]</ref> They head north and travel through [[Mexico]] to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles, California, after an arduous journey.\n\nThe picture was partly funded by the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), a non-profit public broadcasting television service in the United States.\n\n''El Norte'' received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1985/D 1985|Oscars.org]</ref> in 1985, the first Latin American independent film to be so honored.<ref name=\"Gee\">Gee, Shannon.

Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains to his son, Enrique, his world view and how the ''indio'' fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, \"to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms\".<ref name=\"efilmcritic\">[http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=4474 Review: ''El Norte''], efilmcritic.com, February 17, 2003. Accessed: July 27, 2013.</ref> Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \"all the people, even the poor, own their own cars\".\n\nBecause of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them\u2014Arturo's severed head is seen hanging from a tree.<ref name=\"popmatters\">.[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/norte/ Rathke, Renee Scolaro]. ''Pop Matters'', film review, \"Same Old New World\", undated. Accessed: April 21, 2007.</ref> When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father's head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights and kills the attacker, then escapes with his sister Rosa and hides in a safe house until morning. Enrique and Rosa thus escape capture, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children's mother too \"disappears\": abducted by soldiers. So, using money given to them by their godmother, Enrique and Rosa decide to flee Guatemala, the land of their birth, and head north.\n\n=== ''Coyote'' ===\nDuring the second part of the film the two teenagers flee Guatemala, travel through Mexico, and meet a Mexican [[Coyotaje|coyote]] who guides them across the border. This section includes various comic scenes relating to mutual [[stereotype|stereotyping]] among different ethnic groups; the two attempt to pass themselves off as indigenous Mexicans, failing to convince one Mexican truck driver after naming the wrong destination, but later succeeding in convincing a U.S. Border Patrol officer by copiously peppering their responses with the Mexican word for \"fuck\", which a neighbor had suggested was how all Mexicans speak.<ref name=\"popmatters\" />\n\nThus Enrique and Rosa are only deported to a border town in Mexico and not to Guatemala, giving them a base for a second attempt to cross the border. After their first failed attempt to cross the ''\"frontera\"'', where a man posing as a coyote deceives and attempts to rob them, they have a horrific experience when they finally cross the [[U.S.-Mexican border]] through a sewer pipe laden with rats; critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted:\n\n{{blockquote|The scene is horrifying, not least because it's pretty clear these are real rats. Disease-free rats purchased from a laboratory, yes, but real rats all the same, and although Gutierrez was phobic about rats, she insisted on doing her own scenes, and her panic is real.<ref name=\"ebert2004\">[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-el-norte-1983 Ebert, Roger]. Great Movies: ''El Norte'', film review, August 1, 2004. Accessed: July 27, 2013.</ref>}}\n\n=== El Norte ===\nIn the final part of the film Rosa and Enrique discover the difficulties of living in the U.S. without official documentation. The brother and sister team find work and a place to live and initially feel good about their decision. However, Rosa nearly is caught up in an immigration raid and must find a new job. Working as a domestic, she is puzzled when her Anglo employer shows her a washing machine. Enrique becomes a busboy and, as his English classes begin to improve his command of the language, he is promoted to a position as a waiter's assistant. He is later approached by a businesswoman who has a better-paying job for him in Chicago as a foreman, which he initially declines; he too encounters problems when a jealous [[Chicano]] co-worker reports him to immigration, causing him to flee the restaurant and seek out the businesswoman.\n\nWhen Enrique finally decides to take the position, Rosa becomes gravely ill with [[typhus]] contracted from the rat bites she received during their border crossing. When this happens, Enrique must make the tough decision of missing the flight to Chicago to be by her side, and thus loses the position. As Enrique visits the hospital, Rosa laments that she will not live to enjoy the fruits of their harrowing journey to the U.S. Rosa sums up the film's major theme when she says to Enrique:\n\n{{blockquote|In our own land, we have no home. They want to kill us. ... In Mexico, there is only poverty. We can't make a home there either. And here in the north, we aren't accepted. When will we find a home, Enrique? Maybe when we die, we'll find a home.}}\n\nAfter Rosa dies, Enrique is shown once again waiting with the other day-labor hopefuls in a parking lot, offering his services to a man looking for \"strong arms\"; reviewer Renee Scolaro Rathke observes: \"It is a bitter realization that Arturo's words about the poor being nothing but arms for the rich holds true even in El Norte.\"<ref name=\"popmatters\" />\n\nAlthough Enrique is temporarily employed once again, he is distracted by haunting daydreams about his sister's lost desires for a better life. The final shot in the film again shows a severed head hanging from a rope, which may be the same image used in Part I of the film; one critic has commented that a hanging, severed head is \"a symbolic device used in some Latin films to signify that the character has committed suicide\".<ref name=\"spotlight\">[http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/pre2000/elnorte.html Brett Willis].

Nava came from a border family and has relatives on the other side in [[Tijuana, Baja California]]. As a youth, he crossed the border several times a week, often wondering who lived in all those cardboard shacks on the Mexican side.\n\nFor research the producers of ''El Norte'' learned about the plight of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] Guatemalans from years of research, much of it conducted among exiles living in Southern California. According to Nava, \"There are hundreds of thousands of [[refugee]]s from [[Central America]] in Los Angeles alone. Nobody knows the exact number, but a recent television inquiry estimated 300,000-400,000. In our own research, we came across a community of [[Maya peoples|Mayans]] from Guatemala\u20145,000 from one village\u2014now in Los Angeles. The original village, which is now dead, had 15,000.\"<ref name=\"Insdorf\">[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?v_id=65144 Insdorf,  Annette].

Accessed: July 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nAnnette Insdorf, writing for ''[[The New York Times]],'' said Nava discussed the singular nature of the US-Mexico border.  Nava said:\n\n<blockquote>The border is unique\u2014the only place in the world where an industrialized first-world nation shares the border with a third-world country. In California, it's just a fence: on one side are the Tijuana slums, on the other side\u2014San Diego. It's so graphic! This was the germ of the story.<ref name=\"Insdorf\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe motion picture has become a staple of high school Spanish language and Human Geography classes throughout the United States and [[multiculturalism]] studies in college.\n\n===Financing===\nNava and Anna Thomas spent two years raising money for ''El Norte'' but they consciously did not pursue film studios or television networks because, more than likely, studio executives would demand changes be made in either script, casting, or both.  Gregory Nava and Thomas believe that much of what makes ''El Norte'' special would have been jeopardized if a major studio had been involved in the filmmaking process.\n\nFinancing for the film was provided by [[PBS]]'s [[American Playhouse]] (50%) and the rest in pre-sales.  One such pre-sale was made to the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Channel 4]] (a [[public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public-service]] [[television]] broadcaster).<ref name=\"Insdorf\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Magical realism===\nParts of ''El Norte'' provide an example of how [[Latin America]]n [[magical realism]], primarily found in novels, has been depicted in a theatrical film.<ref name=\"ebert2004\"/><ref>Vasquez, Emilia.

An example is when Rosa Xuncax sings the [[eulogy]] at the funeral of her father and its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Maya religion|Maya religious]] theme.

Villalpando said:\n\n{{blockquote|Fifteen years ago, the indigenous people in Guatemala were living a cruel extermination that forced them to flee toward Mexico and the United States. This exodus lasted a decade and half a million Guatemalans made the journey to the United States seeking for asylum and refuge ... ''El Norte'' became a powerful fighting element, grew an audience, searched audiences, and left the theaters to tell its truth.<ref>Villalpando, David. ''Lear Media'', interview with David Villalpando.</ref>}}\n\n==Production==\nWhen Nava and his production crew were, more or less, kicked out of Mexico during the film shoot, he had to re-create a Mexican village in California.  Nava said: \"We were filming in Mexico during the end of the L\u00f3pez Portillo presidency, one of the last of the old-fashioned caciques to rule Mexico. One day, men with machine guns took over the set. I had guns pointed at my head. We were forced to shut down production, bribe our way out of the country, fight to get our costumes back, and start shooting again in California. Ironically, in the United States our extras were real Mayan refugees. They were the people the movie was about.\"<ref>Santiago, Soledad.

It is a ''Grapes of Wrath'' for our time.\"<ref name=\"ebert2004\"/>\n\nIn a scene where the characters cross into California by means of a rat-infested sewer tunnel and emerge to a view of San Diego, ''Commonweal'' critic Tom O'Brien wrote: \"...{{nbsp}}the scene sums up its rare strength\".<ref>O'Brien, Tom.

He added: \"Mr. Nava does not patronize his 'little people.' This has something to do with the straight, unactorly quality of the performances, especially by Zaide Silvia Gutierrez as Rosa and David Villalpando as Enrique, two splendid Mexican actors.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E7DD1E38F931A15752C0A962948260 Canby, Vincent].
