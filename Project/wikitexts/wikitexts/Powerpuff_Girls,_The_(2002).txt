It was co-written and directed by series' creator [[Craig McCracken]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]), co-written by [[Charlie Bean (filmmaker)|Charlie Bean]], [[Lauren Faust]], [[Paul Rudish]], and Don Shank, and stars the regular television cast of [[Cathy Cavadini]], [[Tara Strong]], [[E. G. Daily]], [[Roger L. Jackson]], [[Tom Kane]], [[Tom Kenny]], and [[Jennifer Hale]]. The film serves as a [[prequel]] to the series, and tells the [[origin story]] of how the [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#The Powerpuff Girls|Powerpuff Girls]] were created and came to be the defenders of Townsville and how [[Mojo Jojo]] became a [[supervillain]].\n\nProduced by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] as its first and only theatrical film, ''The Powerpuff Girls Movie'' premiered in [[Century City]] on June 22, 2002, and was released in theaters on July 3, 2002, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $16 million worldwide against its $11 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the crime and injustice-riddled city of Townsville, [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Professor Utonium|Professor Utonium]] mixes [[What Are Little Boys Made Of?|sugar, spice and everything nice]], hoping to produce the \"perfect little girls\" to improve Townsville. However, his laboratory assistant, the destructive [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Mojo Jojo|Jojo]], shoves him, causing him to accidentally break and spill a flask of Chemical X onto the concoction. The experiment succeeds, producing three little girls whom the Professor names [[Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup]]. He also discovers that the girls have gained [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] from the added Chemical X. Despite the girls' recklessness with their powers, they all immediately grow to love each other as a family.\n\nOn their first day of school, the girls learn about the game of [[Tag (game)|tag]] and begin to play it among themselves, which quickly grows destructive once they use their powers. The girls take their game downtown, where they accidentally cause damage the city until the Professor calms them down. The next day, the citizens of Townsville treat the girls as outcasts due to their destructive behavior and the Professor is arrested for creating the girls. Believing that using their powers again will only anger the townspeople more, the girls try to make their way home from school on foot, but they become lost in an alleyway, where the Gangreen Gang attacks them. Jojo, who has become [[superintelligence|superintelligent]] due to the Chemical X explosion mutating his brain, rescues the trio.\n\nPlanning control of the city and revenge on the Professor for replacing him with the girls, Jojo gains the girls' sympathy by convincing them that he is also hated for his powers and tricks them into helping him build a laboratory and machine powered by Chemical X, which he claims will earn them the public's affections. Afterwards, Jojo rewards them with a trip to the local zoo, where he secretly implants small transportation devices on all the primates there. That night, Jojo brings the primates to his lab and uses his new machine to inject them with Chemical X, which turns them into evil mutants like himself. The next morning, after the Professor is released from prison, the girls show him all the \"good\" they have done, only to discover that the primates are attacking the city. Jojo, renaming himself as Mojo Jojo, publicly announces the girls assisted him, which damages their reputation further and makes the distraught Professor lose faith in them. Dejected, the girls exile themselves to an [[asteroid]] in outer space.\n\nMojo Jojo announces his intention to rule the planet, but becomes frustrated when his minions disobey him and concoct their own plans to terrorize Townsville. Overhearing the turmoil from space, the girls return to Earth and rescue the citizens, realizing they can use their powers to fight the primates. After his army is defeated, Mojo Jojo injects himself with Chemical X and grows into a giant monster, overpowering the girls in an intense battle. Rejecting Mojo Jojo's offer of an alliance to take over the world, the girls push him off a decrepit skyscraper just as the Professor arrives with an antidote for Chemical X to help the girls. Mojo Jojo lands on the Antidote X, which shrinks him down to his original size, battered and defeated.\n\nThe girls consider using the Antidote X to erase their powers, thinking they would be accepted as normal girls, but the people of Townsville protest against this, apologize for misjudging them, and their heroism is praised. Townsville's [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#The Mayor of Townsville|Mayor]] requests that the Professor authorize the trio to use their powers to defend Townsville, to which he and the girls agree, becoming the city's beloved crime-fighting superhero team \"The Powerpuff Girls\".\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of The Powerpuff Girls characters}}\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Blossom|Blossom]]\n* [[Tara Strong]] as [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Bubbles|Bubbles]]\n* [[E.
