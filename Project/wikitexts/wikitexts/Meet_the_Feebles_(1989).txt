It features [[Jim Henson]]-esque puppets in a perverse comic satire.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/287584557 MEET THE FEEBLES (Peter Jackson, 1989) on Vimeo]</ref><ref>[https://www.flavorwire.com/498744/the-50-greatest-midnight-movies-of-all-time#:~:text=%20The%2050%20Greatest%20Midnight%20Movies%20of%20All,opened%20to%2025%20people%20back%20in...%20More%20 The 50 Greatest Midnight Movies of All Time - Flavorwire]</ref>\nLike Henson's [[The Muppets|Muppets]], the Feebles are animal-figured puppets (plus some suited performers) who are members of a stage troupe. However, whereas the Muppets characterize positivity, na\u00efve folly and innocence, the Feebles largely present negativity, vice and other [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] characteristics. It is the first Jackson film that was co-written by his future partner [[Fran Walsh]], who has gone on to act as co-writer for all his subsequent films.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[eponymous]] Feeble Variety Hour theatre troupe is rehearsing the title song with hopes of finding success through being picked up for a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television show. Heidi (a [[hippopotamus]]), the star, is insulted by [[pornographic]] director Trevor (a [[rat]]) and complains to her boss and lover, Bletch (a [[walrus]]), who is actually in an [[Adultery|adulterous relationship]] with Samantha (a [[Siamese cat]]). Meanwhile, Robert (a [[hedgehog]]), the newest member of the team, arrives at the theatre, where he is accosted by [[reporter]] F. W. Fly (a [[fly]]), who tries to corrupt Robert into informing on the cast, meets Arthur (a [[worm]]), the show's manager, and [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love]] with another newcomer, Lucille (a [[poodle]]). Trevor is approached by sniveling [[drug-addicted]] knife thrower Wynyard (a [[frog]]) looking for his fix, but the drugs have not yet been delivered. Guppy (a [[fish]]) auditions for The Feebles backstage, only to get eaten by Bletch. After Heidi finishes [[jogging]], Samantha confronts her, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch, resulting in a fight between the two, in which Heidi throws her in a [[cardboard box]]. With the help of Arthur, Robert is able to [[serenade]] Lucille, confessing his love to her, and the two become engaged. \n\nAfter his [[tribble]]-like creatures accidentally get crushed by a barrel, animal tamer, Sid (an [[elephant]]), and Arthur have a beer, when he receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend, [[showgirl]] Sandy (a [[chicken]]) with his alleged son Seymour the Elechicken (an improbable-looking elephant/chicken hybrid). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a [[Paternity lawsuit|paternity case]] against him. Bletch and Barry (a [[bulldog]]) consummate a [[drug deal]] with Cedric (a [[warthog]]), during which Bletch and Cedric deliberately sabotage eachother during a game of [[golf]], which ends with Bletch winning by throwing up the chewed remains of Guppy. \n\nBack at the theater, Dennis (a [[perverted]] [[aardvark]]) is shown peeping on the second most important star of the show, Harry (a [[hypersexual]] [[rabbit]]) in a threesome with two female rabbits. Trevor is shooting a porn film in the basement with the Masked Masochist (a [[weta]]) and Madam Bovine (a [[cow]]). They are interrupted by Robert, who mistakes the scene for torture and tries to save Bovine, who in turn accidentally crushes the Masked Masochist, suffocating him. Trevor later feeds him to a fish-like monster.\n\nThe director of the show, Sebastian (a [[red fox]]), lambasts Robert for failing his part as an extra on the stage. As punishment, he assigns Robert the task of replacing Wynyard's assistant, who has just been killed by Wynyard's knife throwing while going through [[drug withdrawal]]. At the toilet, Harry is suffering from a mystery illness and F. W. Fly harasses him. Wynyard tells Robert [[Tet Offensive#Saigon|his story of Vietnam]], and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest [[porno film]] starring Dennis (who Trevor chose for a substitute) and Madame Bovine, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille. Harry passes out down some stairs, much to the surprise of fellow cast member Dorothy (a [[sheep]]), who yells for help. Dr. Quack (a [[duck]]) gives Harry only twelve hours to live, and F. W. Fly spies on them. \n\nElsewhere, Abi, the show's contortionist, accidentally manages to roll himself into a ball during rehearsal. Hating how the show is turning out, Sebastian demands for his song to be included, only to be turned down and thrown out by Bletch.\n\nF. W. Fly continually harasses Harry, ultimately reporting his illness to the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]]. Trevor drugs Lucille and tries to [[rape]] her as an audition, but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene, Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and disowns her. After an awful rehearsal, Sebastian lambasts Heidi, causing her to rush to Bletch for emotional affirmation, but walks in on Samantha performing [[oral sex]] on him. That night, after testing the drugs provided by Cedric on Dennis, the drugs turn out to be [[borax]], infuriating Bletch. Cedric's agent Louie (a [[dog]]) is literally liquefied after being force-fed some of the borax by Bletch's henchmen. \n\nHeidi locks herself in her room, throws a tantrum, and refuses to perform, but relents after Bletch has make-up sex with her. Soon after, Bletch and his cronies venture to the docklands to fight Cedric and his [[crab]]-crewmen. Bletch's side prevails after killing Cedric and the crabs, as well as a giant [[spider]], which bites off Barry's head, and Cedric's boss, Mr. Big (a [[sperm whale]]), by driving through him and coming out the other end. Lucille tries to convince Robert of her love for him, but he tells her he never wants to see her again. After seeing the article of Harry's illness in the paper, Trevor lures F. W. Fly into the bathroom, where Bletch tears his wings off and flushes him down the toilet. Shortly afterwards, Heidi attempts to seduce Bletch in his office, but Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. This causes Heidi to mentally break down, and envisions the rest of the Feebles laughing at her.\n\nLater, things begin to go awry during the performance. An ailing Harry winds up [[vomiting]] all over the stage during his performance, Sid is accosted by Sandy in the midst of his act, which causes it to fall apart, Wynyard accidentally kills himself during his act when he loses his grip on one of his knives and it comes down on his head, and Sebastian decides to take matters into his own hands. After a failed attempt at hanging herself, Heidi then tries to commit suicide with an [[M60 machine gun]], but at that second, Samantha walks into the room and taunts Heidi upon seeing her about to end her life. Heidi snaps, turns the gun on Samantha, and shoots her dead. Heidi then goes on a shooting spree, killing many of the cast, including Harry (who was told by Dr. Quack that he was going to recover as he only has \"bunny pox\"), Abi (who finally managed to free his head only to be crushed by his bedded nails), Dorothy (who attempted to talk to Heidi), and others.\n\nSebastian, in a poor and desperate attempt to save the show, puts on a musical number about the act of \"Sodomy\", disgusting the silent and unamused live audience, much to the horror of Bletch who orders Trevor to kill him. At the end of the show, Heidi continues her shooting spree, and Sid braves the crazed Heidi's automatic fire to save his son, after Sandy gets her head shot off. Robert rescues Lucille from being shot and professes that he still loves her, and Lucille tells him the truth about Trevor's attempted [[raping]] of her. Sebastian hides in Harry\u2019s giant carrot-rocket, and is injured when Heidi causes it to go off and crash into a wall. Bletch attempts to talk Heidi into surrendering, but Heidi opens fire on him and he drops from the balcony. Lying injured on the stage, Bletch convinces Heidi to stop her rampage by proclaiming he still loves her, only for Trevor to shoot her in the shoulder from behind with a shotgun.\n\nBletch, having tricked Heidi into letting her guard down, orders Trevor to kill her, only for Robert to intervene by swinging on a rope from the rafters and colliding with Trevor, incapacitating Trevor briefly enough for Heidi to reclaim the machine gun and shoot him dead. Bletch lunges at Heidi in a last ditch effort, but is killed too. From backstage, Arthur tells Heidi that he regrettably had to tip off the police about Heidi's shooting rampage.  Heidi accepts this and makes one last request before her impending incarceration - to play her musical number, \"Garden of Love\", to which Arthur complies.\n\nThe [[epilogue]] reveals the fates of only seven survivors: Sid gets extensive repair on his kneecaps after being accidentally shot by Heidi in her rampage and works in an orchard as a struggling [[horticulturist]] with his son Seymour. Arthur received an [[OBE]] for his lifelong service at the theater and retires to the country. Sebastian recovers from his injuries and became a successful writer who achieved worldwide fame for his best seller, ''The Feeble Variety Massacre: One Man's Act of Heroism!'', and is currently negotiating [[film rights]]. Robert (now an award-winning [[fashion photographer]] for a women's magazine) and Lucille are married with two children. Finally, Heidi, whose killing spree resulted in her imprisonment in a women's penitentiary for ten years, has been rehabilitated into the community and now works under a new identity on the check-out counter of a large supermarket.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Hadlow]] as:\n** Robert the Hedgehog\n** Heidi the Hippo (voice)\n** Barry the Bulldog\n** Chorus Girl #3\n* [[Peter Vere-Jones]] as:\n** Bletch the Walrus\n** Arthur the Worm\n** The Baker\n** Newspaper Mouse (Paperboy)\n** The Announcer\n* Donna Akersten as:\n** Lucille the Pomeranian\n** Samantha the Cat\n** Dorothy the Sheep\n** Female Rabbit #1\n** Chorus Girl #2\n** Fitness Tape Voice\n* [[Stuart Devenie]] as:\n** Sebastian the Fox\n** Dr. Quack the Duck (doing a [[Paul Lynde]] impression)\n** Daisy the Cow (Madame Bovine)\n** Sandy the Chicken\n** Cedric the Warthog\n** Seymour the Elechicken (mixed elephant and chicken)\n** Female Rabbit #2\n** Chorus Girl #1\n* [[Brian Sergent]] as:\n** Wynyard the Frog (doing a [[Jim Ignatowski]] impression)\n** Trevor the Rat (doing a [[Peter Lorre]] impression)\n** F.

The dialogue was recorded before shooting began. Made on an extremely low budget considering the time-consuming process of working with puppets, the film went over budget and schedule. Some scenes, including the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] flashback, were funded by members of the film crew, and filmed secretly under the title ''Frogs of War''. The Vietnam flashback includes a game of [[Russian roulette]] as a parody of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''. An initial application for Film Commission money was rejected by executive director Jim Booth, who a short time later became Jackson's producer. The Commission eventually granted the production two-thirds of its $750,000 budget, though relationships between the funders and the production soured and the Film Commission removed its credit from the film.<ref name=\"nzonscreen\"/> It is often mistakenly stated that there are no human characters in the film; the character Abi is a human. However, there are no ''real-life'' human characters in the film. Director Jackson has a cameo as an audience member dressed as an alien from ''Bad Taste''. Every vehicle seen in the film is a variation on the [[Morris Minor]], including a specially constructed [[limousine]]. Morris Minors also appear in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'' and ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]''. By presumed coincidence, one of the characters, Harry the Hare, shares a name with the title character of James B. Hemesath's short story \"Harry the Hare\" (himself a [[Bugs Bunny]] pastiche), written for [[Harlan Ellison|Harlan Ellison's]] anthology ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]'' in 1972.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Meet the Feebles (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1991\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Electronic music|Electronic]] <br />[[Classical music|Classical]] <br />Stage & Screen\n| length     =\n| label      = Q.D.K.
