It follows a 10-year-old American boy (played by Slater) who travels to China and has to take a panda cub to the reserve so it can reunite with its mother. The film was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]] label on August 25, 1995, and was preceded by the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short ''[[Carrotblanca]]'' in theaters.\n\n== Plot ==\nRyan Tyler's father Michael sends him a plane ticket so that he can visit him in [[China]], where he works with pandas. Ryan is not sure he wants to go, but his mother says he can just come back if he doesn't like it.\n\nIn China, Michael and his two companions, Ling, a young girl and champion [[translator]], and Chu, Ling's grandfather who is very experienced with [[panda]]s track down a mother panda and place a [[radio collar]] on her. After they leave, she steps into a trap. Back at the reserve, Michael and the staff recognize from the radio signal that the panda is in danger. Just as Michael, Ling and Chu set out to visit the panda, Ryan arrives at the reserve. After some argument, Michael lets him come.\n\nThe poachers who set up the trap, Shong and Po, shoot Michael in the ankle, and flee with the panda's cub. Michael and the mother panda are returned to the reserve by helicopter, and Ling, Chu, and Ryan look for the poachers. They eventually discover their hideout, and free the panda cub before Chu lets Ryan and Ling travel on their own because he has to return to the reserve.\n\nThe poachers shoot the bridge that Ryan and Ling are crossing, and the two of them and the panda cub are washed downstream, but manage to make it to the surface. The second time they are washed downstream, the pair realize that they are covered in [[leeches]] upon resurfacing and are forced to remove all their clothing and wash themselves off in the lake. Ryan realizes that he can use the [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] in his watch to power the radio collar and enable his father to locate them.\n\nAttempting to make their way back to the reserve with the cub, they come upon a local village that grants them hospitality for protecting the cub. However, Shong and Po have also arrived. The villagers help the trio escape, but the poachers follow. Michael arrives and subdues the poachers, and he, Ryan, Ling, and the cub drive back to the reserve. The Chinese officials who were going to close the reserve see Ryan returning the cub and the cub reuniting with its mother and decide to let it remain open.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Dr. Michael Tyler\n* Ryan Slater as Ryan Tyler\n* [[Yi Ding (actress)|Yi Ding]] as Ling\n* Wang Fei as Grandfather Chu\n* Zhou Jian Zhong as Po\n* Yao Er Ga as Shong\n* [[Isabella Hofmann]] as Beth Tyler\n* Brian Wagner as Johnny\n* Lan Yu as Mr. Xu, committee member\n* Moon Shema as Little panda\n* Ying Ying - Wuhan Circus as Adult panda\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 27% based on 11 reviews, and an average rating of 4.5/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Amazing Panda Adventure'' (1995) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/amazing_panda_adventure |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=February 11, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Yi Ding (actress)|Yi Ding]] was nominated for Best Young Supporting Actress in the [[17th Youth in Film Awards]] for her performance as 'Ling' in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms17.htm|title=17th Annual Awards|work=Young Artist Awards|publisher=Young Artist Foundation|accessdate=2 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317154819/http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms17.htm|archivedate=17 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1995]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112342}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|amazing_panda_adventure|The Amazing Panda Adventure}}\n\n{{Christopher Cain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amazing Panda Adventure, The}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Chinese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in China]]\n[[Category:Films shot in China]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films about giant pandas]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Christopher Cain]]\n[[Category:Films scored by William Ross]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
