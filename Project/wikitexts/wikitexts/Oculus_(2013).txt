Marketwatch.com.</ref> It received generally positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"MC\" /> and was a box office success.<ref name=\"Oculus 2014\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in two different times: the present and 11 years earlier. The two plot lines are told in parallel through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].\n\nIn 2002, [[software engineer]] Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique [[mirror]] to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces [[hallucination]]s. Marie is haunted by visions of her own [[Decomposition|body decaying]], while Alan is seduced by a mysterious and ghostly woman named Marisol Chavez, who has mirrors in place of eyes.\n\nIn 2013, Tim is discharged from a [[psychiatric hospital]], having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an [[auction house]], she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a \"kill switch\" \u2014 an [[anchor]] weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.\n\nOver time back in 2002, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and [[Paranoia|paranoid]]. All of the plants in the house die, and their family dog Mason disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes [[Insanity|insane]] and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.\n\nOne night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him, causing a small crack in the corner of the mirror in the process. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away and put behind bars, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.\n\nBack in 2013, Tim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts the mirror's supernatural power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed Michael Dumont, her fianc\u00e9 who has come to check on her. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children.\n\nAt this point, they see their [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|doppelgangers]] inside the house standing in front of the mirror. Realizing that the [[9-1-1]] call is not going through, they go back inside the house. Kaylie and Tim begin hallucinating by seeing younger versions of each other. They get separated, and each of them relives the nightmare from their youth. Tim awakens alone in the room with the mirror, while simultaneously a younger Kaylie hallucinates her mother beckoning her from the mirror.\n\nTim activates the kill switch, realizing too late and unable to see that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is [[Hysteria|hysterical]], just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible. As he is taken away and put behind bars, Tim's adult incarnation sees Kaylie's ghost standing in the house with his parents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Kaylie Russell\n** [[Annalise Basso]] as 12-year-old Kaylie Russell\n* [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Tim Russell\n** Garrett Ryan Ewald as 10-year-old Tim Russell\n* [[Katee Sackhoff]] as Marie Russell\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as Alan Russell\n* [[James Lafferty]] as Michael Dumont\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Dr. Graham\n* [[Kate Siegel]] as Marisol Chavez\n* [[Justin Gordon]] as Mark (Supervisor)\n* Katie Parker as Phone Store Clerk\n* Bob Gebert as Neighbor\n* Courtney Bell as Auctioneer\n\n==Production==\n''Oculus'' was produced by [[Blumhouse Productions]], [[WWE Studios]], MICA Entertainment, Mist Entertainment, and [[Intrepid Pictures]]. During the scene in which the mirror is up for auction, the auctioneer mentions that the item was \"recovered from the Levesque estate\", a reference to [[WWE]] wrestler [[Triple H]], whose real name is Paul Michael Levesque.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/oculus-movie-wwe-triple-h-easter-egg-explained/|title=Oculus' WWE Triple H Easter Egg Explained|last=Kennedy|first=Michael|date=August 10, 2020|website=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe film is based on Flanagan's earlier 2005 short horror film, ''Oculus: Chapter 3 \u2013 The Man with the Plan''. The short contained only one setting, a single actor, and a mirror.<ref name=moviesonline.ca>{{cite web|title=Director Mike Flanagan Interview, Oculus|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/2014/04/director-mike-flanagan-interview-oculus/|website=moviesonline.ca|access-date=Aug 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907070220/http://www.moviesonline.ca/2014/04/director-mike-flanagan-interview-oculus/|archive-date=September 7, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The short became highly acclaimed, and interest quickly arose regarding the adaptation of the short into a feature.<ref name=moviesonline.ca/> Initially, studios were interested in making the film in accordance with the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] genre;<ref name=Denofgeek>{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Don|title=Interview: Oculus director Mike Flanagan|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/oculus/234666/interview-oculus-director-mike-flanagan|website=Den of Geek|date=April 14, 2014|access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> however, Flanagan was opposed to this and passed on such offers.<ref name=Denofgeek/> Eventually, Intrepid Pictures expressed interest in producing the film \"as long as you don't do it found footage\".\n\nExpanding the premise to a feature-length screenplay proved challenging, as Flanagan felt like he had \"pushed the limit\" of what could be done with the premise in the short. The solution Flanagan came across was to combine two storylines, past and present, intercut with one another. The idea was to \"create a sense of distortion and disorientation that would be similar for the viewer as it was for Tim and Kaylie in the room.\"<ref name=moviesonline.ca/> In early drafts, it was difficult to distinguish between the two timelines, until the team hit upon the idea of writing all of the scenes from the past in [[italics]].<ref name=moviesonline.ca/>\n\nInspired by the stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], Flanagan chose to not explain the mirror's origins, explaining that he liked how [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] literature often seemed to be an \"alien force that if you even were to try to comprehend it completely it would drive you mad.\"<ref name=Denofgeek/> He expanded: \"Evil in the world doesn't have an answer.\"<ref name=Denofgeek/>\n\n===Casting===\nOn July 12, 2012, it was announced that [[Karen Gillan]], known for her work in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Outcast (2010 film)|Outcast]]'', had been cast in the lead role of ''Oculus''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kroll |first1=Justin |title='Dr. Who' thesp Karen Gillan to star in 'Oculus' |url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/dr-who-thesp-karen-gillan-to-star-in-oculus-1118056509/ |access-date=April 24, 2021 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> On September 20, 2012, [[Katee Sackhoff]] joined the cast as Marie, the mother of Gillan's character Kaylie.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title='Longmire's Katee Sackhoff Joins 'Oculus' |url=https://deadline.com/2012/09/longmires-katee-sackhoff-joins-horror-movie-oculus-karen-gillan-doctor-who-battlestar-galactica-2-742327/ |access-date=April 24, 2021 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=September 20, 2012}}</ref> When writing the script for ''Oculus'', the character of Kaylie was based on Sackhoff's work on ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and Flanagan was drawn to Gillan based on her work on ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Briana |title=Horror Flick 'Oculus' Has Scary Good Performances |url=https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/horror-flick-oculus-scary-good-performances-11584/ |access-date=April 24, 2021 |work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |date=April 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Brenton Thwaites]] was the last of the main cast to sign on to ''Oculus'', joining the project on October 5, 2012, after shooting for the production had already begun.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNary |first1=Dave |title=Brenton Thwaites to star in 'Oculus' |url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/brenton-thwaites-to-star-in-oculus-1118060366/ |access-date=April 24, 2021 |work=Variety |date=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nOn October 27, 2012, filming wrapped in [[Fairhope, Alabama]], after three weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title={{-'}}Oculus', starring Katee Sackhoff & Karen Gillan, filming underway in Alabama |url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2012/10/24/oculus-starring-katee-sackhoff-karen-gillan-filming-underway-in-alabama/ |access-date=17 February 2014 |publisher=On Location Vacations |date=24 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was first released on September 5, 2013, at the Toronto International Film Festival<ref>{{cite web|author1=Matt Barone|title=TIFF Review: The Smart, Inventive \"Oculus\" Is the Best Horror Film of the Festival|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/09/oculus-movie-review|website=Complex|publisher=Complex Media, Inc|access-date=31 October 2014|date=10 September 2013}}</ref> and received a worldwide theatrical release on April 11, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=UPDATE: New 'Oculus' theatrical poster debuts|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/overtheropes/wwestudios/oculus-theatrical-poster-debuts-26176636|website=WWE|publisher=WWE Inc|access-date=31 October 2014|date=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[FilmDistrict]] acquired U.S. distribution rights to Oculus at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], but later left the project due to an agreement which said the company would have to give the film a wide release, causing the film's U.S. distribution rights to be put up for sale again.
