The film details the two activists' involvement in hoaxes targeting [[SimCopter]], the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 G. W. Bush presidential campaign]], [[McDonald's]], and, most prominently, the [[WTO]]. The film also includes brief interviews with [[Michael Moore]] and [[Greg Palast]].\n\nThe film premiered at the 28th Toronto International Film Festival in 2003.
