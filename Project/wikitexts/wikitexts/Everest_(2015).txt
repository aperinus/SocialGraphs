It began a [[wide release]] in the United States on September 25, 2015. The film was a commercial success\u2014it grossed $203 million worldwide over a $55 million budget and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[May 1996]], several commercial expeditions at the base camp of [[Mount Everest]] prepare to climb to the summit. [[Rob Hall]], who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads [[Adventure Consultants]]; [[Scott Fischer]] is the chief guide for its rival, [[Mountain Madness]]. Rob's clients include [[Beck Weathers]], an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran [[Yasuko Namba]], who hopes to complete her final [[Seven Summits]] ascent; and [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine journalist [[Jon Krakauer]]. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp. A month earlier in [[New Zealand]], Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife, Jan, and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp, Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their unborn baby is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.\n\nWorried about climbers overcrowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs from Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and begin descending by 2:00 PM., the latest safe time to ensure return before nightfall. The group is delayed by over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on the upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return to base camp if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend, and Rob warns him about overexertion.\n\nRob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling to ascend just above the [[Hillary Step]] and orders him to descend. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he will not get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past the safe return time. Doug is exhausted and suffering from [[altitude sickness]]. With them is Scott, exhausted and ill from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]]. As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes while Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. No extra bottles are stored on the route as Rob asked and he radios Helen to send more oxygen. Doug, left briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path, then silently topples to his death.\n\nScott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Descending climbers reach Beck, whose vision remains impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko. Guide [[Andy Harris (mountain guide)|Andy 'Harold' Harris]] reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but the cylinder aperture is frozen shut. They huddle together in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He then [[paradoxical undressing|strips off his outer clothing]] and slides to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his extremities are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping that Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but otherwise comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah, dying soon afterwards.\n\nReturning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes a rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, sees that Yasuko is dead, and stumbles down to camp alone, severely frostbitten and in need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri flies a high altitude mission to take Beck to hospital. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, [[Anatoli Boukreev|Anatoli]], finds his body, and moves it off the trail. Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he eventually lost both hands and nose to frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jason Clarke]] as [[Rob Hall]], a New Zealand expedition group leader.<ref name=\"four-cast\" />\n*[[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Scott Fischer]], an American expedition group leader.<ref name=\"four-cast\" />\n*[[Josh Brolin]] as [[Beck Weathers]], an American doctor and amateur mountain climber.<ref name=\"four-cast\" />\n*[[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Doug Hansen, a [[mailman]] and amateur mountain climber.<ref name=\"four-cast\" />\n*[[Robin Wright]] as Peach Weathers, Beck's wife.<ref name=\"Sam-Robin\" />\n*[[Emily Watson]] as Helen Wilton, the base camp manager.<ref name=\"four-cast-wrap\" />\n*[[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as [[Jon Krakauer]], a journalist and amateur mountain climber.<ref name=\"four-cast-wrap\" />\n*[[Keira Knightley]] as Jan Arnold, Hall's pregnant wife.\n*[[Sam Worthington]] as Guy Cotter, a professional guide.<ref name=\"Sam-Robin\" />\n*[[Martin Henderson]] as [[Andy Harris (mountain guide)|Andy \"Harold\" Harris]], a professional guide.<ref name=\"four-cast-wrap\" />\n*[[Elizabeth Debicki]] as Dr. Caroline Mackenzie, the base camp physician\n*[[Ingvar Eggert Sigur\u00f0sson]] as [[Anatoli Boukreev]], a professional with Scott's team.\n*[[Thomas M.
