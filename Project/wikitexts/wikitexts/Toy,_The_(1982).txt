The film stars [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Scott Schwartz]], [[Teresa Ganzel]], and [[Virginia Capers]]. It is an adaptation of the 1976 French comedy film ''[[The Toy (1976 film)|Le Jouet]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nJack Brown is a married, unemployed man in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], in danger of having his house repossessed. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get a job working for the local paper, the ''Bugle'', he becomes so desperate that he ends up taking a job as a janitor for the wealthy and ruthless businessman U.S. Bates, who owns the paper, a department store and many other businesses. Brown is humiliated as he clumsily attempts to serve food at a luncheon. He is fired from that gig by Bates, but \"Master\" Eric Bates, the spoiled son of the boss, sees Jack while looking through Bates' department store. Amused at seeing Jack goof around in the store's toy section, Eric informs his father's long-suffering right-hand man, Sydney Morehouse, that what he wants is Jack himself.\n\nMorehouse fails to convince Eric that human beings cannot be owned. In exchange for a generous financial settlement to stave off repossession, Jack agrees to be Eric's live-in friend during Eric's one-week spring break from military school.\n\nEmotionally estranged from his father, Eric takes a liking to Jack but still manages to humiliate him with numerous pranks. After a particularly humiliating incident in the mansion incited by Bates' ditzy trophy wife Fancy, who introduces him at a dinner party as Eric's new \"toy\", Jack grows tired of the situation and leaves. He agrees to return only when Bates (with Morehouse as his proxy) offers Jack enough money to pay off the full mortgage.\n\nJack returns, determined to teach Eric how a friend is supposed to be treated. They bond while participating in mini-cart racing, video games, and fishing. The pair decide to start a newspaper of their own. After witnessing multiple examples of Bates' cruelty to his employees, they dig up dirt on him, such as a story of how he won his butler, Barkley, in a game of [[billiards]]. They publish their paper and distribute it throughout the city. When Morehouse finds a copy and presents it to his boss, Bates is outraged, but keeps his anger in check and calls Jack and Eric for a private meeting at his office.\n\nTo prove to his son that money can buy loyalty, he offers Jack a reporting job with his newspaper in exchange for shutting their newspaper down, which is what Jack wanted all along. When he accepts, Eric is upset because he thinks Jack is selling out. Jack tells Eric that most men need jobs, just as his priority is to support himself and his wife.\n\nAn outdoor party is later held at the Bates estate, attended by prominent citizens who are supporters of a senator. They are unaware that members of the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] are also in attendance. Jack's wife, Angela, tries to bring attention to this with her anti-Klan group, but Jack convinces her to leave. He learns the true reason for the party is to get the KKK Grand Wizard and the senator together in a picture, which Bates would then use to blackmail the senator. Jack and Eric team up to disrupt the party, which is witnessed from afar by Angela and her group. Jack informs the senator of Bates' intentions and he leaves the party in outrage. Jack then proceeds to embarrass the Grand Wizard by causing him to fall into a bowl of chocolate fudge. The Grand Wizard throws a pie at Jack, but hits a policeman instead, leading to his arrest. Bates chases after Jack in a [[golf cart]] but ends up crashing into the pool. Jack saves him from drowning and Bates thanks him. Bates says Jack's \"toy\" job is over and he may go home.\n\nThe next day, while driving Eric to the airport to return to military school, Bates tries desperately to have a heart-to-heart talk. Eric runs off to Jack's house. Jack refuses to let Eric live with him and gently admonishes the boy to give his father a chance. Bates arrives and confesses to his son how much he truly does love him and Eric finally accepts it and the two embrace. As he and Eric depart for the airport, Bates says his offer for the newspaper job stands and promises Eric that next year he will have two weeks of spring vacation: one with Jack and one with himself, much to Eric's joy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Jack Brown\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as Ulysses \"U.S.\" Bates\n* [[Scott Schwartz]] as \"Master\" Eric Bates\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Sydney Morehouse\n* [[Teresa Ganzel]] as Fancy Bates\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Barkley\n* [[Annazette Chase]] as Angela Brown\n* [[Tony King (actor)|Tony King]] as Clifford\n* [[Virginia Capers]] as Ruby Simpson\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made by Rastar, the company of [[Ray Stark]], then under head of production Guy McElwaine.
