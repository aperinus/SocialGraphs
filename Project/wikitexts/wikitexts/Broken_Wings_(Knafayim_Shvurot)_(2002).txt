Widow Dafna takes to bed for three months and when she finally returns to her job at the maternity hospital, she has little time for her children. Eldest son, Yair drops out of school and adopts a fatalist attitude, shutting out his siblings and girlfriend. His twin sister Maya, a talented musician, feels the most guilt and is forced to act as a family caregiver at the expense of career opportunities. Bullied at school, younger son Ido responds by obsessively filming himself with a video camera and attempting dangerous feats. The baby sister, Bar, is woefully neglected. Preoccupied with their own misery, the family is barely a family anymore. When another tragedy strikes, will they be able to support one another?\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] called it \"a strongly emotional experience despite its tendency toward cryptic dramatics.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=12 February 2003 |last=Stratton |first=David |title=Broken Wings |url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/broken-wings-1200543489/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reference list}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Imdb title|id=0317842|title=Broken Wings}}\n\n{{Tokyo Sakura Grand Prix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broken Wings (Film)}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Hebrew-language films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Haifa]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Israeli drama films]]\n\n\n{{Israel-film-stub}}\n{{2000s-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
