It was first broadcast in 2017.\n\nThe series was created from several interviews of [[Vladimir Putin]] conducted by Stone between 2015 and 2017.\n\n==Summary==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2020}}\nStone's interview begins with a biography of Vladimir Putin. Putin explains that he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law]] in the Soviet Union straight out of high school. Next, he was required to take a job with the [[KGB]] in foreign intelligence due to the job assignment system in place for college graduates in the [[Soviet Union]]. However, he acknowledges that he hoped to get this particular job. Putin tries to explain many aspects of how things in the former USSR worked, and considerable criticism of the communist era in his country 1917\u20131991.\n\nPutin thinks the West should understand that today's Russia cannot function exactly as the West does. He explains his views on [[NATO]], and cannot see any reason to why this military alliance has grown after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism in Europe]]. When Stone asks about Putin's views on [[Edward Snowden]] and whether he is a traitor or not, Putin replies, \"No he is not, as he never has worked for any foreign country,\" and also claims that Russian intelligence does not know anything more than what Snowden already had leaked before he arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo Airport]]. Stone asks, \"What about if an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] employee had done something similar?\", and Putin replies \"To spy on one's own allies, really is very dirty.\" Putin had never seen [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1963 black comedy satire about the [[Cold War]], ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''; the two men watch the film together.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]]  the documentary series has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 12 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Putin Interviews: Season 1 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_putin_interviews/s01 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=1 June 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Putin Interviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-putin-interviews/critic-reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=1 June 2020 }}</ref>\n\nA common theme in the criticism is that in interviewing Vladimir Putin, Oliver Stone refused to challenge Putin with questions on multiple subjects, such as \"Russia's propaganda law aimed at gays or his [Putin's] treatment of political foes.\"<ref name=BLowry>{{cite news|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title='Putin Interviews' as much about Oliver Stone as Russian leader|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/09/entertainment/the-putin-interviews-review/|work=CNN|date=9 June 2017}}</ref> [[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that despite being \"revealing\" and offering a \"break from the usual news media vantages on Russia, either tough-talk centrism or the defenses of Putin enablers-come-lately in the conservative media,\" Stone's interviewing is \"embarrassingly generous.\"<ref name=JPoniewozik>{{cite news|last1=Poniewozik|first1=James|title=Oliver Stone\u2019s \u2018Putin Interviews\u2019: Flattery, but Little Skepticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/arts/television/review-the-putin-interviews-showtime-oliver-stone.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftelevision&_r=1|work=The New York Times|date=9 June 2017}}</ref> Poniewozik's charge that the interview is \"solicitous, even obsequious\" mirrors criticism leveled by Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who summarizes the series as consisting mostly of \"softball questions,\" and by Brian Lowry of [[CNN]] who writes that \"Stone's idle chitchat and solicitous tone will surely leave many journalists and Putin critics gnashing their teeth.\"<ref name=BLowry /><ref name=JPoniewozik /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hornaday|first1=Ann|title=Oliver Stone, \u2018The Putin Interviews\u2019 and when cinematic events are outrun by events themselves|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/oliver-stone-the-putin-interviews-and-when-cinematic-events-are-outrun-by-events-themselves/2017/06/09/273c9c20-4c73-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>  Marlow Stern of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' claimed that the interview series intentionally set out to \"humanize Putin and demonize America,\" and similarly concludes that \"Stone not only fails to challenge Putin, but essentially cedes him the floor.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=''The Putin Interviews'': Oliver Stone\u2019s Wildly Irresponsible Love Letter to Vladimir Putin|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-putin-interviews-oliver-stones-wildly-irresponsible-love-letter-to-vladimir-putin|work=The Daily Beast|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the series also evoked praise and more thoroughly positive responses from critics. Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'', who rates the series a B+, acknowledges points raised by critics in the preceding paragraph writing that \"not once does Stone push back, or harsh the mellow with phrases like 'the facts say otherwise'.\"<ref name=VGay>{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=Verne|title=\u2018The Putin Interviews\u2019 review: Oliver Stone humanizes Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-putin-interviews-review-oliver-stone-humanizes-russia-s-vladimir-putin-1.13730784|work=Newsday|date=12 June 2017}}</ref> Gay, however, says that \"[d]uring an extraordinary career, Stone has never pretended to be an unbiased journalist \u2013 or journalist, period \u2013 and he\u2019s not about to feign pretense now.\"<ref name=VGay /> Gay claims that Stone never intended to offer the interview series as \"balanced\" and journalism: {{blockquote|As journalism, this is scattershot at best, but as a conversation that covers a vast span of Russian history, culture, and politics as refracted through the mind of Russia's president \u2013 it\u2019s often remarkable. Putin has a lot to say. Stone lets him say it. While the many points he makes are impossible to summarize here, Putin's motives for this interview are not: He emerges as an intelligent, sane, reasonable leader caught in the vortex of an occasionally feckless, often contradictory superpower called the United States. Touch\u00e9.<ref name=VGay />}}\n[[Ken Tucker]] of [[Yahoo!|Yahoo TV]] describes Stone's non-combative interview approach as \"the flexible way,\" and counters many critics' desire for hard-hitting critical questions by pointing out that \"Putin would not respond well to aggression,\" and that \"one senses Putin would have shut down the interview if anything agitated him too much.\"<ref name=KTucker>{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Ken|title=Oliver Stone\u2019s 'Putin Interviews' Are Fascinating Ego Trips|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/putin-oliver-stone-showtime-review-162809170.html|website=Yahoo|date=13 June 2017}}</ref> Tucker in fact praises Stone's interview style as being effective for this particular subject: {{blockquote|Stone is quietly persistent and ready with a follow-up question he has scribbled down on an always-present yellow legal pad. Stone offers a scoffing expression if he feels Putin is being evasive \u2013 body language Putin picks up on. It's a method that works, to the extent that Stone is invited back, time after time, to continue the chats.<ref name=KTucker />}}\nSonia Saraiya of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also offers praise of the series, writing that \"''The Putin Interviews'' is a destabilizing documentary that challenges Americans' narratives about ourselves and asks the viewer to engage in a conversation with a slippery subject. It's riveting in how dangerous and intimate it feels, leveraging its multiple camera-angles and hand-held shots to make the viewer feel as if they, too, are in the room with Vladimir Putin.\"<ref name=SSaraiya>{{cite web|last1=Saraiya|first1=Sonia|title=TV Review: Oliver Stone\u2019s \u2018The Putin Interviews\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/putin-interviews-review-oliver-stone-1202453720/|work=Variety|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2020}}\nDuring a scene in Stone\u2019s interview series with Putin, the president took out his phone to show Stone a clip of how \"our aviation\" was firing at militants in Syria. \"That's how our forces are operating,\" Putin told the director. \"These militants are running with arms, not just machine guns.\"\n\nHowever, a Russian video published on 20 June 2017 pointed out strong similarities between the clip Putin played and footage from 2013 of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at militants in Afghanistan. The striking similarities led people on social media to call the clip \"fake\" and suggest that the Russian president didn't realize what he was showing was not his own forces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2017/06/20/putin-showed-oliver-stone-a-video-where-russia-s-air-force-supposedly-attacked-terrorists-in-syria-it-was-actually-footage-of-americans-fighting-the-taliban-in-afghanistan|title=Putin showed Oliver Stone a video where Russia's Air Force supposedly attacked terrorists in Syria.
