The film received mixed reviews but it became a financial success.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Petty officer, second class|Gunner's Mate Second Class]] Joe Brady and [[Seaman (rank)|Seaman First Class]] Clarence Doolittle are [[United States Navy|USN sailors]] who have a four-day leave in Hollywood. Joe has his heart set on spending time with his girl (the never seen) Lola. Clarence, the shy choir boy turned sailor, asks Joe to teach him how to get girls. Donald, a little boy who wants to join the navy, is found wandering around the boulevard by a cop, who takes him to the police station. Clarence and Joe end up being picked up by the cops to help convince Donald to go home. After the two sailors wait at home and entertain Donald, Donald's Aunt Susie arrives. Clarence is smitten with her from the beginning. Susan goes on to tell them that she has been trying to find work in music, and longs to perform with Jos\u00e9 Iturbi. Trying to make Susan impressed with Clarence, Joe tells her that Clarence is a personal friend of Iturbi, and that he has arranged an audition for Susan with him. That night, they go out to a cafe (on an MGM recreation of [[Olvera Street]]) where Clarence meets a girl from Brooklyn, and they hit it off. The next day, Joe visits Donald's school, and tells the kids the story of how he got his medal, and how he brought happiness to a lonesome king (played by [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] the Mouse in an animated sequence), and joy to the forest animals of the kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, Clarence has been trying to get into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios to find Iturbi with no luck. After many failed attempts to speak to Iturbi (including a rehearsal at the Hollywood Bowl), all  hope is lost for Joe and Clarence, who want to come clean with Susan and tell her there was no audition. On Clarence and Joe's last day of leave, Susan runs into Iturbi In the studio commissary who has no idea of the audition. Susan begins to call Joe, whom by now she has fallen in love with, to yell at him. Iturbi stops her and agrees to get her a screen test, which turns out to be very successful. The movie ends as Iturbi conducts the choir in singing \"Anchors Aweigh\", while Joe and Susan, and Clarence and the \"Girl from Brooklyn,\" kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Clarence \"Brooklyn\" Doolittle\n* [[Kathryn Grayson]] as Susan Abbott\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Brady\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Iturbi]] as Himself\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Donald Martin\n* [[Pamela Britton]] as Girl from Brooklyn\n* [[Rags Ragland|\"Rags\" Ragland]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Caf\u00e9 Manager\n* [[Henry O'Neill]] as Admiral Hammond\n* [[Carlos Ram\u00edrez (singer)|Carlos Ramirez]] as Carlos\n* [[Grady Sutton]] as Bertram Kraler\n* [[Leon Ames]] as Admiral's Aide (reads citation)\n* Sharon McManus as Little Girl Beggar\n* [[Tom and Jerry]] as themselves.

It was the first of three buddy pictures teaming the cocky dancing Kelly with the (against type) shy singing Sinatra, followed by ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game (film)|Take Me Out To The Ball Game]]'' and ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'', both in 1949. The production tried to mix some of the more successful story elements and set-pieces from earlier MGM musical hits, such as ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944).\n\n[[File:Anchors Aweigh promo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Promotional image used in advertising]]\n\nThe movie is remembered for the musical number in which Gene Kelly dances seamlessly with the animated [[Jerry Mouse]] (voiced by [[Sara Berner]]). [[Tom Cat]] appears briefly as a butler in the sequence supervised by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]]. The animation was entirely undertaken by [[Kenneth Muse]], [[Ray Patterson (animator)|Ray Patterson]] and [[Ed Barge]]. Originally, the producers wanted to use [[Mickey Mouse]] for this segment.  Some sources claim [[Walt Disney]] initially agreed to loan out Mickey, but [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] rejected the deal. According to [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]]'s book on Roy Disney, the studio was in debt after [[World War II]] and they were focusing on trying to release their own films out on time. According to Roy, they had no business making cartoons for other people.<ref>Bob Thomas. \"Building a Company: Roy O. Disney and the Creation of an Entertainment Empire.\" Eventually Disneys lent out their effects wizard [[Joshua Meador]] to spruce up MGM's 1956 ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''.</ref> After Disney turned the offer down, Kelly went to [[Fred Quimby]], the head of MGM's cartoon studio. Quimby was also not interested, but Kelly persisted, reportedly showing up at Hanna and Barbera's office to press the case. The dance sequence required meticulous storyboarding; after Kelly's dance was filmed, the animators used [[rotoscoping]] to painstakingly match the animated character's movement to Kelly's, even down to their shadows cast on the polished dance floor.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sennett |first1=Ted |title=The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity |date=1989 |publisher=Studio |isbn=978-0670829781 |url=https://archive.org/details/artofhannabarber00teds/page/42/mode/2up |access-date=2 June 2020 |pages=42\u201343}}</ref>\n\nThe film offers rare color glimpses of the wartime MGM studio, including the Thalberg Building, the frontgate, the backlot, the commissary, and one of the scoring stages, as well as an on-screen performance by real members of the MGM studio orchestra. During the soundstage scenes the operation of MGM\u2019s latest camera mounted on a heavy [[Crane shot|boom]] is extensively demonstrated, including a side-bolted cutout [[viewfinder]] for the cinematographer to line up the shots and the [[Camera operator|operators]] deftly swiveling the pan controls or [[Focus puller|pulling the focus]].\n\nThere is also a memorable exterior scene at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], where Sinatra sings \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", after Iturbi and a group of young pianists have performed an arrangement of [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2]]''. In the audition scene with Iturbi, Grayson sings a special arrangement by [[Earl Brent]] for [[coloratura soprano]] and orchestra of the waltz from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky)|Serenade for Strings]]''.  And Iturbi conducts the [[United States Navy Band]] for a patriotic rendition of the [[Anchors Aweigh|title tune]]. Some of the scenes in this film were later featured in the ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' (1974) tributes to MGM.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Another humdinger of a musical has been produced by Joe Pasternak for Metro ... for a popular entertainment, 'Anchors Aweigh' is hard to beat.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0DE3DC103BEE3BBC4851DFB166838E659EDE |title=Movie Review - Anchors Aweigh |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=July 20, 1945 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=March 10, 2016 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"solid musical fare for all situations.
