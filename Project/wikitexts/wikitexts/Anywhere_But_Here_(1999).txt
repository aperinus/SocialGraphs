It was directed by [[Wayne Wang]] from a screenplay by [[Alvin Sargent]], and stars [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Natalie Portman]], and [[Shawn Hatosy]].\n\nFilming began in late June 1998. The film debuted at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 17, 1999, before being released in the United States on November 12.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nAdele August and her reluctant teenage daughter, Ann, leave their small town in [[Bay City, Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] and move to [[Beverly Hills, Los Angeles|Beverly Hills]]. Adele hopes Ann will become a Hollywood actress despite Ann's interest in going to [[Brown University]]. They rent a run-down apartment and Adele becomes a teacher at the high school where Ann enrolls.\n\nWhile at the beach one afternoon, Adele meets a handsome [[orthodontist]], Josh; they date and have sex, leaving Adele to fall in love with him, but he later dumps her for a younger woman. Adele improvises from day to day, often unable to pay bills, and eventually quits her job. Adele and Ann spend their days hanging out together but over time, Ann grows tired of her mother's eccentric behaviour and dreams of running away.\n\nAnn's cousin Benny arrives in Los Angeles for a visit. Upon his return home, Adele is notified that Benny has tragically died in a car accident, leaving Ann distraught. They attend his funeral in Bay City, and Adele argues with her intoxicated brother-in-law. Back home, Ann begins dating her crush, Peter, interested in experiencing sex for the first time after she turns seventeen. Her friends also help her reach out to her estranged father but he isn't pleased to hear from her.\n\nMeanwhile, Adele gets a new job in a care home as a speech therapist, and gives makeup and style tips to its elderly residents. Ann works part-time in a supermarket and attends acting auditions, but continues to emphasise her desire to go to Brown. Adele rejects the idea, telling her they cannot afford the tuition. However soon after, Adele sells her expensive Mercedes and decides to help her, eventually accepting her dream.\n\nAdele and Ann part ways at the airport as Ann goes off to college. They express their love for one another and Ann admits that, even though her mother drives her crazy, she cannot imagine life without her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Adele August\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Ann August\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Benny\n* [[Hart Bochner]] as Josh Spritzer\n* [[Eileen Ryan]] as Lillian\n* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Ted\n* [[John Diehl (actor)|John Diehl]] as Jimmy\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as Carol\n* [[Faran Tahir]] as Hisham Badir\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Gail Letterfine\n* [[Corbin Allred]] as Peter\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Cop\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Jack Irwin\n* [[Steve Berra]] as Hal\n* [[Eva Amurri]] as student\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Mona Simpson]]'s novel ''[[Anywhere but Here (novel)|Anywhere but Here]]'' was first optioned by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] in the late 1980s and envisioned as a star vehicle for [[Meryl Streep]], but Streep chose to do ''[[Postcards from the Edge]]'' instead and the adaptation did not materialize.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Milvy |first=Erika |date=1999-11-12 |title=For All the Gory Details, Better Read the Novel |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-nov-12-ca-32541-story.html |access-date=2022-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=Anywhere But Here (1999) |url=https://bombreport.com/yearly-breakdowns/1999-2/anywhere-but-here/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=Bomb Report |language=en-US}}</ref> The project stalled for nearly a decade until [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] revived it and cast [[Susan Sarandon]] as the lead.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=1999-10-24 |title=Susan Sarandon's Got a Pretty Wonderful Life. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-24-tm-27693-story.html |access-date=2022-09-15}}</ref> [[Natalie Portman]] became attached to star as the co-lead and left her role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]'s ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' to commit to the film.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weinraub |first=Bernard |date=1998-05-08 |title=Beyond 'Anne Frank' |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/08/movies/at-the-movies.html |access-date=2022-09-15 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> However, Portman, who was then 17, said she would not do the film if it required her to do a love scene with nudity.

Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. Sarandon's role is trickier and more difficult, but Portman's will get the attention.
