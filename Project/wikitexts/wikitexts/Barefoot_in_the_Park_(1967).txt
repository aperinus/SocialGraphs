Paul, a conservative lawyer, marries the vivacious Corie, but their highly passionate relationship descends into comical discord in a five-flight New York City walk-up apartment. The supporting cast features [[Charles Boyer]], [[Mildred Natwick]], [[Herb Edelman|Herbert Edelman]], and [[Mabel Albertson]].\n\n''Barefoot in the Park'' was released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] on May 25, 1967, to critical and commercial success, with critics praising its adaptation, light-hearted tone, and cast performances. The film grossed $30 million worldwide on a $2 million budget. For their performances in the film, Natwick was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and Fonda was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Actress]]. Simon received a nomination for the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nCorie ([[Jane Fonda|Fonda]]), a free-spirited young woman, and Paul Bratter ([[Robert Redford|Redford]]), a conservative, uptight man, are a recently married couple who move into a fifth-floor apartment in [[Greenwich Village]]. One of the film's running jokes alludes to the fact that everyone has to climb so many stairs to get to their apartment. Corie decorates the small, leaky space, turning it into a picturesque little home for the two. Among their many eccentric neighbors is the quirky Victor Velasco ([[Charles Boyer|Boyer]]), who befriends Corie and even flirts with her. He lives in the building's attic, so he climbs through the Bratters' window to get to his apartment. He also helps Corie with her place, showing her how to work the seemingly broken heating and plumbing.\n\nCorie sets up a dinner date with Paul, Victor, and Corie's mother, Ethel Banks ([[Mildred Natwick|Natwick]]), in a scheme to make her mother fall for Victor. Corie feels that her mother is lonely and in need of love now that she lives alone. Victor takes them all to an [[Albanian cuisine|Albanian restaurant]] on [[Staten Island]], whose owner he knows. There the group drinks, and Corie and Victor dance with a belly dancer, while Paul and Ethel watch in embarrassment. Afterward, Corie and Victor return to their building in high spirits as Paul and Ethel drag themselves along in fatigue. As Victor escorts Ethel outside, Corie and Paul begin an argument over their different personalities. Corie feels that her adventurous spirit is impeded by Paul's cautious attitude, noting that he refused to go barefoot in the park with her one evening. His excuse was that it was freezing. Corie says she will kick Paul out and get a big dog to protect her from him. Paul quips that it will finally allow her to have someone who will go barefoot in the park with her. They eventually go to sleep, Corie in their tiny bedroom and Paul on the couch under a hole in the skylight on a snowy February night.\n\nThe next day, Paul comes down with a fever, but Corie still insists she wants a divorce. The two spend an awkward time together in their apartment until Corie kicks Paul out. She then receives a call from her aunt, who says that Ethel never came home. Corie panics, and eventually learns that her mother was at Victor's apartment. While Victor was escorting her to her home in New Jersey the previous night, Ethel slipped on icy stairs and fell. Victor and some neighbors took her back to Victor's apartment, where they spent the night. Strangely, Ethel was wearing nothing but her undergarments and Victor's Japanese kimono. It turned out that Victor had Ethel's dress dry-cleaned.\n\n[[File:Alexander Holley monument WSP jeh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Washington Square Park]]'s [[Alexander Lyman Holley]] monument, where Corie finds drunken Paul late in the film]]\n\nMeanwhile, a drunken Paul skips work and sits in Washington Square Park. Heeding her mother's advice, Corie goes out searching for Paul and finds him drunk and running barefoot through the park. The once cautious Paul is now a fun-loving drunk while Corie cautiously chases after him in order to get him to sober up. Eventually, Paul says it is his apartment and he is going back home. Corie follows. Back at the apartment, Paul, still drunk, climbs onto the roof of the apartment. Scared he might fall, Corie begs him to come down while speaking to him through the hole in the skylight. He says he will only come down if she repeats after him. He wants her to admit that her husband is a crazy drunk, when a few nights before she scolded him for being so cautious and practical even when he is drunk. Meanwhile, realizing where he is, Paul becomes scared, and almost falls off the building. Corie asks Paul to sing an [[Albanian folk music|Albanian folk]] song they had heard at the restaurant that Victor had taken them to calm himself down. While he sings, Corie climbs up to the roof to help him down. A crowd of onlookers starts to gather in the street, including Ethel and Victor. When Corie reaches Paul, they kiss and climb back down as the crowd cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Paul Bratter\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Corie Bratter\n* [[Charles Boyer]] as Victor Velasco\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Ethel Banks\n* [[Herb Edelman|Herbert Edelman]] as Harry Pepper\n* [[Mabel Albertson]] as Harriet\n* [[Fritz Feld]] as restaurant proprietor\n* James F.
