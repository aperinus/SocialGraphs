Since its premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film has received a positive critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian working in [[Iraq]], awakes to find himself buried in a wooden [[coffin]] with only a [[Zippo]] lighter, a pen, and a [[BlackBerry]] phone at hand. As he gradually begins to piece together what has happened to him, he recalls that he and several others were ambushed by terrorists, passing out after being hit by a rock. After calling [[9-1-1|911]] in [[Youngstown]], [[Ohio]], the [[FBI]] in Chicago and his employer (none of whom help him), he receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million or he will be left in the coffin to die. Along with the script Paul is to read, Paul also finds a malfunctioning flashlight, a glow stick, a flask with alcohol, and a pocket knife.\n\nPaul calls the [[Department of State|State Department]], which tells him that due to the [[Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995|government policy of not negotiating with terrorists]], it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the [[Hostage Working Group]], who tells Paul they are working to find him, to conserve the Blackberry's battery life, and implores him not to make the video that Jabir has demanded. Brenner informs Paul that a man named Mark White was rescued from a similar situation three weeks prior and is now home safe with his family. Paul calls his mother, who is in a nursing home, but she barely remembers him due to severe [[dementia]].\n\nJabir calls Paul again and demands he film a ransom video, sending a photo of his colleague, Pamela, gagged with a gun to her head. Paul insists that no one will pay $5 million, so Jabir drops the amount to $1 million. Paul finds a live snake in the coffin, which he is able to drive away through a hole in the wooden crate side with a fire from the alcohol. After switching the language on the Blackberry to English, he finds the Blackberry's number, which he relays to his wife in a voicemail. Paul records the video, however, the kidnappers execute Pamela anyway and send him video of the murder. He calls Brenner, who is upset with him for making the video, which is now being played on all major networks and has received numerous views on [[YouTube]].\n\nShortly afterward, distant explosions shake the area, which damage his coffin, causing it to slowly fill with sand. His employer's legal counsel calls him, asking him not to speak with anyone in order to keep the situation \"contained\". His employer then begins to record the call and informs him that he has been retroactively terminated from his job earlier that same day (conveniently before his capture) due to an alleged prohibited relationship with Pamela. Because of this, his company will not only not take any responsibility for his capture, but he and his family also will not be entitled to any benefits or pension earned with the company.\n\nBrenner calls saying that the explosions that damaged his coffin earlier were in fact [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] bombings and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Paul begins to lose hope and makes a last [[will and testament]] in video form, leaving his wife his personal savings and his son his clothes. Jabir calls demanding Paul video record himself cutting off a finger, threatening Paul\u2019s family back home by revealing their home address. Paul complies with this demand.\n\nShortly after filming the video, his cell phone rings, and Paul begins to hear digging and distorted voices. The voices become clearer, saying to open the coffin, and the coffin opens. It abruptly becomes obvious that he hallucinated the encounter.\n\nBrenner calls and tells Paul an insurgent has given details of where to find a man buried alive, and that they are driving out to rescue him. Paul then receives a tearful call from his wife Linda, and he assures her that he is going to be okay. As sand continues to fill the coffin to dangerous levels, giving Paul seconds left to live, Brenner calls and tells him that he and the rescue team have arrived at the burial site. Through the phone, digging is heard, but Paul cannot hear any digging around him. The team digs up a coffin and opens it, but it is revealed that the insurgent led them to the coffin of Mark White, the man Brenner claimed had been rescued. Knowing that he is not going to be saved, Paul tries to calm himself down and accepts his fate. The film ends with Brenner profusely apologizing to Paul as the sand finally fills the coffin and he suffocates as the light goes out, and the screen goes black.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a lighter illuminates the name \"Mark White\" on the lid of the coffin, written by Paul earlier.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Paul Conroy\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez]] (''voice'') as Jabir\n*Robert Paterson (''voice'') as Dan Brenner\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] (''voice'') as Alan Davenport\n* Cade Dundish (''voice'') as Shane Conroy\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] (''voice'') as Linda Conroy\n* Ivana Mi\u00f1o (''voice'') as Pamela Lutti\n* Warner Loughlin (''voice'') as Maryanne Conroy / Donna Mitchell / number lady\n* [[Erik Palladino]] (''voice'') as Special Agent Harris\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Barcelona]]-based Versus Entertainment, in association with [[Peter Safran|The Safran Company]] and Dark Trick Films.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> It was shot in [[Barcelona]] over 16 days.<ref name=\"semt\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/12/entertainment/la-ca-buried-20100912/2 |access-date=October 21, 2020 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=The Directors: Rodrigo Cort\u00e9s builds suspense in 'Buried' |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=September 12, 2010 |archive-date=March 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306125515/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/12/entertainment/la-ca-buried-20100912/2 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lead actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] stated that he suffered from claustrophobia while filming (much like the character he plays).
