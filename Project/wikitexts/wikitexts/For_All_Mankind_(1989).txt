It was directed by [[Al Reinert]], with music by [[Brian Eno]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-N9wioymts For All Mankind: Is the Moon Landing Cinema? | Brows Held High by KyleKallgrenBBH on YouTube]</ref> The film, consisting of footage from [[Apollo 7]] through [[Apollo 17]], was assembled to depict what seems like a single trip to the Moon, highlighting the beauty and otherworldliness of the images by only using audio from the interviews Reinert conducted with [[List of Apollo astronauts|Apollo crew members]].<ref>{{cite web|title=For All Mankind DVD review|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8353/for-all-mankind-dvd-review|website=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for this documentary film began in 1979 after Reinert researched a story about the Apollo program for ''Texas Monthly'' and learned that huge amounts of high-quality footage had been shot by the [[astronauts]], only to be archived by NASA without ever being seen by the public. Although he initially thought that making a documentary about the missions would be relatively straightforward, it would be ten years before the final film was released.\n\nReinert and editor Susan Korda sifted through six million feet of footage and 80 hours of NASA interviews to create the documentary. To copy the original film held at the [[Johnson Space Center]], Reinert had to take an optical printer and scan each frame from the original 16mm film and enlarge to 35mm. It took him 18 months to copy the 80 minutes of film used in the documentary. Most of the footage used is of the astronauts and [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|mission control]] during the [[Apollo program]], but Reinert also used some footage from [[Project Gemini]], such as [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]'s spacewalk from [[Gemini 4]] and a shot used to represent [[Trans Lunar Injection]] (TLI) that is in fact footage of a Gemini mission [[re-entry]].\n\nThirteen of the original Apollo astronauts were interviewed by Reinert. Among those providing narration are [[Jim Lovell]] ([[Apollo 8]] and [[Apollo 13]]), [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] ([[Apollo 11]]), [[Pete Conrad|Charles Conrad]] ([[Apollo 12]]), [[Jack Swigert]] ([[Apollo 13]]), and [[Ken Mattingly]] ([[Apollo 16]]).\n\n==Title==\nThe title of ''For All Mankind'' comes from the [[lunar plaque]] left by the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts:\n\n<blockquote>Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.</blockquote>\n\nThe excerpt of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[We choose to go to the Moon|Address to Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort]] on 12 September 1962 that is included in the film is slightly altered to better conform to this title. Kennedy said:\n\n<blockquote>The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join it or not, and it is one of the greatest adventures of all time ... We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used <strong>''for all people''</strong> ... We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard ....<ref name=\"NASA Rice Address\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/50th/50th_magazine/kennedyLetter.html|title=NASA: Address at Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort|website=[[NASA]]|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nReinert dubbed over \"people\" with \"mankind\", the audio of which was taken from a different Kennedy speech.\n\n==Specific views==\nSeveral unusual or memorable views are included:\n\n* The fires of the [[Bedouin]] tribes in the [[Sahara]] desert, seen as dots of light in the extreme darkness.\n* Sunrise over the edge of the Earth.\n* A space-walk floating in silence over the Earth, despite travelling at 25,000 miles per hour.\n* A floating tape recorder providing music to the astronauts during periods of weightlessness, in particular when playing the theme from the 1968 film, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n* The first picture of the Earth seen as a whole circle from space \"floating in a blackness beyond perception\".\n* Trying to prevent food from floating off during meals.\n* The first close-up pictures of the Moon.\n* Travelling around the far side of the Moon, including the \"Earthrise\" as our planet came back into view.\n* The [[Apollo Lunar Module]] calmly drifting down at a low angle to the surface of the Moon, then burning its engines for a more vertical landing.\n* Touchdown in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]: \"The Eagle has landed.\"\n* The first footstep onto the Moon by [[Neil Armstrong]].\n* [[David Scott]] dropping a feather and a hammer on the Moon to prove [[Galileo]]'s prediction that, if there is no atmosphere, any two objects dropped from the same height at the same time will hit the ground together.\n* Erecting the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] on the surface of the Moon.\n* Gathering rocks and soil samples from the surface of the Moon.\n* An astronaut tripping and speculating on his vulnerability should the suit be ruptured.\n* Astronauts singing and hopping around on the lunar surface.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's original score was written, produced, and performed by [[Brian Eno]], his brother [[Roger Eno|Roger]] and [[Daniel Lanois]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17429-apollo-special-brian-enos-moon-music/|title=Apollo special: Brian Eno's moon music|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> and released as an album entitled ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' in 1983 (at that time, the planned film project was named ''Apollo'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Prendergast|first=Mark|year=2000|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance \u2013 the Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing, New York|isbn=1-58234-134-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/125 125]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ambientcenturyfr00pren_0/page/125}}</ref> By the time of the film's release in 1989, some of the tracks included on the album had been replaced by other pieces by Eno and other artists.
