''[[The New King of Comedy]]'', a remake set in mainland China, was released in 2019.\n\nUnlike Chow's typical ''[[mo lei tau]]'' films, ''King of Comedy'' verges on comedy-drama, describing the trials and tribulation an aspiring actor experiences on his way to stardom. Some commentators{{who|date=April 2010}} say the story is based on Chow's early career, as he started off as a temporary actor, before becoming a successful and popular comedy actor over the course of a decade. The film features a short cameo by [[Jackie Chan]], who also got his start as an extra.\n\n==Plot==\n\nWan Tin-sau is the head of his village's [[community centre]], where he gives acting lessons and host community plays. On the side, he is an aspiring actor moonlighting as a [[Extra (actor)|movie extra]], often taking his work too seriously for the roles he receives.\n\nOne day, a group of [[Call girl#Non-sex work|club girls]] come to ask Wan to help them act like [[Uniform fetishism#Schoolgirl uniform|innocent schoolgirls]] so they can make more money. One of the girls, Lau Piu-piu, although skeptical of advice from an unsuccessful actor, becomes a better actress through Wan's instruction and falls in love with him.\n\nWhen both characters finally make love, Wan searches his home for enough money to pay Piu-piu for her \"services\", since he thinks she slept with him for money. After Piu-piu leaves him in anger, he goes back to the film studio and receives a part as [[leading actor]] next to a legendary actress, Sister Cuckoo. During this time, Wan reconciles with Piu-piu and he pledges to support her for the rest of his life.\n\nJust as Wan is about to settle in the life of a movie star, his part is given back to a highly sought after male lead. Luckily, he regains his confidence with the help of the [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] [[Catering|lunchman]] at the studio, who is secretly a [[Hong Kong Police Force#Crime and security|C.I.B.]] agent. Wan is used in an [[Police#Detectives|undercover]] operation, where he is disguised as a delivery boy and made to deliver a hidden gun and [[covert listening device|listening device]] inside take-out food. Although the [[deception|ruse]] is discovered and the C.I.B. undercover agent is shot, Wan takes up the gun and saves the day. The lunchman is rushed to the hospital and survives his wounds.\n\nAfter a somewhat successful sting, Wan finally becomes famous through a performance of the ''[[The Thunderstorm|Thunder Storm]]''. The actors include Piu-piu, Sister Cuckoo, and his wanna-be [[Triad society|Triad]] students. The end of the film involves a blatant [[Product placement|marketing plug]] for [[Pringles]] brand [[potato chips]]. The entire cast of the play stands backstage rehearsing their lines while literally stuffing their mouths full of Pringles, with the logos of all five cans clearly facing towards the camera. At one point, Wan and one of his triad students argue over who should play the role of [[Bruce Lee]]'s character, when another actor screams \"don't fight, eat chips!\" When the [[closing credits]] roll, a quick Pringles advertisement appears on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Stephen Chow]] as Wan Tin-sau\n* [[Karen Mok]] as Sister Cuckoo / Cuckoo To\n* [[Cecilia Cheung]] as Lau Piu-piu\n* [[Ng Man-Tat]] as Mao\n* [[Johnson Lee]] as Movie Director\n* [[Tin Kai-man]] as student #3 / Hung's man\n* [[Lee Siu-kei]] as Brothe Kei\n* [[Jackie Chan]] ''(uncredited)'' as stunt double on set (cameo)\n* Joe Cheng Cho as informer\n* [[Lam Tsz-sin]] as Hung\n* Cheng Man-Fai as Hung's man\n* Steven Fung Min-Hang as Pui's first boyfriend\n* Clarence Hui Yuen as nightclub mobster\n* Baat Leung-Gam as Pierre\n* Dai Lung as Master Lung\n* Terence Tsui Chi-Hung as delivery boy\n* Ben Yuen Foo-Wa as Ben\n* Roderick Lam Chung-Kei as Kee\n* Sunny Luk Kim-Ching as Johnny\n* Hau Woon-Ling as Hung's granny\n* Robert Sparks as Hollywood Producer\n* Vincent Chik Miu-Chan as C.I.B\n* Sherwin Ming Tak-Fung as hitman in the church\n* Kong Foo-Keung as hitman in the church\n* Choi Kwok-Ping as hitman in the church\t\n* Tsim Siu-Ling as hitman in the church \n* Chan Po-Chun as Peter\n* Sin Yan-Kau\n* Bruce Law Lai-Yin\n* Mok Wai-Man\n}}\n<ref>[http://www.hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=8476&display_set=eng \"King of Comedy (1999)\"].
