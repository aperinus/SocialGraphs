The sequel to ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995) and ''[[Before Sunset]]'' (2004), it is the third installment in the [[Before trilogy|''Before'' trilogy]]. The film follows Jesse (Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Delpy), now a couple, as they spend a summer vacation in [[Greece]] with their children.\n\nLinklater, Hawke, and Delpy began developing a third film in 2011, wishing to replicate the nine-year gap between the first two installments. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2012, and took place entirely on the [[Peloponnese]] coast in Southern Greece, including the [[Kardamyli]] home once owned by author [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]]. Like its predecessors, ''Before Midnight'' has a minimal plot, with considerable screentime devoted to extended conversations between the characters.\n\n''Before Midnight'' premiered at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2013. It began a domestic [[limited release]] on May 24, 2013, and went on general release on June 14, 2013. It grossed $23 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the trilogy. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its exploration of romance and age, its screenplay, Linklater's direction, and acting performances. The film garnered many accolades and was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Delpy.\n\n==Plot==\nNine years since rekindling their relationship,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Before Sunset]]'' (2004)}} Jesse and C\u00e9line have become parents to twin girls. Jesse reflects on his inability to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank. Hank flies home to Chicago after vacationing with the couple and their children on the Greek [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, and lives with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife.\n\nJesse is a successful novelist, while C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government. The couple discuss their concerns over Hank, as well as C\u00e9line's career, and reflect on love and life over dinner with friends. Their friends pay for a hotel room for the couple; while walking to the hotel, Jesse and C\u00e9line reminisce about their initial meetings, and wonder if they would become a couple if they met in their present state.\n\nAfter reaching the hotel, they begin to get intimate but are interrupted by a phone call from Hank, who seems to have bonded with C\u00e9line more than Jesse. They eventually have a fierce argument, expressing fears about the strength of their relationship. Jesse wants them to consider moving to Chicago so he can be closer to Hank, which C\u00e9line thinks will cost her any chance of a career outside her family. During the argument, C\u00e9line leaves and returns twice. Then she tells Jesse she thinks she no longer loves him.\n\nC\u00e9line leaves their room the third time and sits alone in the hotel's outdoor restaurant. Jesse joins her and jokes that he is a time traveler (referencing their first meeting),{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995)}} bringing her a letter from her 82-year-old self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. Unamused, C\u00e9line says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality. Jesse says while their love may be imperfect, it is real. After a moment, C\u00e9line joins in Jesse's joke, and the two reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jesse\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as C\u00e9line\n* [[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]] as Hank\n* Jennifer Prior as Ella\n* Charlotte Prior as Nina\n* [[Xenia Kalogeropoulou]] as Natalia\n* [[Walter Lassally]] as Patrick\n* [[Ariane Labed]] as Anna\n* Yiannis Papadopoulos as Achilleas\n* [[Athina Rachel Tsangari]] as Ariadni\n* Panos Koronis as Stefanos\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Richard Linklater]], [[Ethan Hawke]], and [[Julie Delpy]] had all discussed doing a sequel to ''Before Sunset'' (or the third in a trilogy).
