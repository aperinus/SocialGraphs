It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Mitch Cullin]]'s [[Tideland|novel of the same name]]. The film was shot in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], and the surrounding area in late 2004. The [[Film premiere|world premiere]] was at the 2005 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] where the film received a mixed response from both viewers and critics. After little interest from U.S. distributors, [[THINKFilm]] picked the film up for a U.S. release date in October 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n''Tideland'' centers on an abandoned child, Jeliza-Rose, and her solitary adventures during one summer in rural  [[Texas]] while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks, and focuses on the increasingly dark, imaginative [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life the girl creates with the aid of dismembered [[Barbie doll]] heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape.\n\nAfter her mother overdoses on Methadone, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Before they leave, however, Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a [[heroin]] overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.\n\nDuring Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a [[Mental retardation|mentally impaired]] young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via [[taxidermy]] (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the \"Monster Shark\" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. It is also revealed that Dell and Noah were once \"kissers\", as Jeliza-Rose finds pictures of the two in the room Dell shares with her own taxidermied mother.\n\nAt the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a [[train wreck]] is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse.  Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck. The film ends with the woman embracing Jeliza-Rose, who stares with stunned confusion at the wreckage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodelle Ferland]] as Jeliza-Rose\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Dickens\n* [[Janet McTeer]] as Dell\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Queen Gunhilda, Jeliza-Rose's mother\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Noah, Jeliza-Rose's father\n* [[Dylan Taylor (actor)|Dylan Taylor]] as Patrick\n* Wendy Anderson as Woman / Squirrel\n* Sally Crooks as Dell's mother<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0410764}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:TerryGilliamSanSebastian2005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jeremy Thomas (left) and Terry Gilliam at San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival 2005.
