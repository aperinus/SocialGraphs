[[Film adaptation|Adapted]] by [[Tom Stoppard]] from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s [[Anna Karenina|1877 novel of the same name]], the film depicts the tragedy of Russian aristocrat and socialite Anna Karenina, wife of senior statesman Alexei Karenin, and her affair with the affluent cavalry officer Count Vronsky. [[Keira Knightley]] stars in the leading role as Karenina. This is her third collaboration with director Joe Wright following ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005) and ''[[Atonement (2007 film)|Atonement]]'' (2007).  [[Jude Law]] and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] appear as Karenin and Vronsky, respectively. [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], and [[Alicia Vikander]] appear in key supporting roles.\n\nProduced by [[Working Title Films]] in association with [[StudioCanal]], the film premiered at the [[2012 Toronto Film Festival]]. It was released on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 9 November 2012 in the United States. ''Anna Karenina'' earned a worldwide gross of approximately $69 million, mostly from its international run. The film received positive reviews: critics praised the cast, but commented on and criticized the heavily stylized adaptation, and were less enthusiastic with Wright's preference for style over substance and his idea of setting most of the action on a theatre stage.\n\nIt earned four nominations at the [[85th Academy Awards]] and six nominations at the [[66th British Academy Film Awards]], winning [[Jacqueline Durran]] both prizes for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. In addition, ''Anna Karenina'' garnered six nominations at the [[Satellite Awards 2012|17th Satellite Awards]], including a [[Satellite Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Actress]] nod for Knightley and [[Satellite Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Stoppard.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Russian Empire]] in 1874, Princess Darya, nicknamed \"Dolly\", banishes her unfaithful husband Prince Stephan \"Stiva\" Oblonsky. Stiva's sister, Anna Karenina, a socialite living in [[Saint Petersburg]] with her older husband Count Alexei Karenin, and son Seryozha, travels to [[Moscow]] to persuade Dolly to forgive her brother.\n\nStiva meets old friend Konstantin \"Kostya\" Levin, a landowning [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] despised by Moscow's elite for preferring the countryside to city life. Levin says he loves Stiva's sister-in-law, Princess Kitty, and Stiva encourages him to propose. Kitty declines as she hopes to marry Count Alexei Vronsky, a wealthy officer. Levin meets his older brother Nikolai, who has renounced his inheritance and lives as man and wife with Masha, a prostitute. Nikolai suggests that Levin should marry a peasant. On the train, Anna meets Vronsky's mother, Countess Vronskaya, isolated by her own infidelities. Anna meets Vronsky and they are instantly attracted to each other. Anna eventually convinces Dolly to take Stiva back. At a ball, Kitty dances once with Vronsky, but throughout the evening he prefers Anna, upsetting Kitty. Vronsky tells Anna he must be wherever she goes.\n\nBack in Saint Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna soon begin to stir gossip. Despite the fact that he has a promotion awaiting him in [[Tashkent]], he refuses it and Anna agrees that she does not want him to leave. They later meet and make love.\n\nStiva informs Levin that Kitty and Vronsky will not be married. Levin focuses on country life and contemplates marrying a peasant's daughter.\n\nAnna and Seryozha go to the Karenin estate outside Saint Petersburg. Anna visits Vronsky and reveals her pregnancy, and he wants her to leave Karenin. Anna suggests that Karenin come to the horse races but betrays her feelings when Vronsky's horse falls. Afterwards, Anna admits to her husband she is Vronsky's mistress and Karenin says she must renounce him. Levin realises he still loves Kitty. Months later, Anna receives Vronsky. He tells her that his military duties have delayed his visit. Karenin discovers Vronsky visited and steals his letters in order to give himself grounds for a divorce.\n\nKarenin visits Stiva and Dolly to say he is divorcing Anna. They beg him to forgive her, but he refuses. Levin and Kitty, having reunited, announce their love and marry. Anna goes into premature labour and sends for Vronsky, although she later says he could never be the man Karenin is. Karenin returns, believing Anna is dying and forgives her. Anna survives and decides to stay with her husband.\n\nVronsky persuades Anna to change her mind and they leave for Italy with their daughter, Anya.\n\nLevin and Kitty return to his estate, where a sickly Nikolai lives with Masha in a storeroom. Levin tells Kitty he will send Masha away so Kitty does not have to meet her, but Kitty ignores societal norms to help Masha nurse Nikolai. Levin's love for Kitty grows.\n\nAnna returns to Saint Petersburg for Seryozha's birthday, but Karenin dismisses her. Anna begins to suspect Vronsky of infidelity. She attends the opera with Princess Myagkaya, an outspoken socialite, but the rest of the audience shun her. Humiliated, Anna retains her poise, only to break down at her hotel. She uses morphine to sleep.\n\nDolly tells her that Kitty is in Moscow to give birth. Dolly says Stiva's behaviour is unchanged, but she has come to accept and love him.\n\nVronsky informs Anna he must meet his mother for business. Anna becomes upset when Princess Sorokina brings Vronsky back to his home, as she believes Countess Vronskaya wants Vronsky to marry her. Anna returns to Vronsky's estate. On the train, she imagines Vronsky and Princess Sorokina making love and laughing at her. Arriving at Moscow, Anna says to herself, \"Oh God. Forgive me,\" and jumps under a train. The scene flashes to a shocked Vronsky.\n\nLevin returns home from work to find Kitty bathing their child. Stiva and his family eat with Levin and Kitty. Karenin, retired, is seen at his estate, with Seryozha and Anya playing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Anna Arkadievna Karenina<ref name=\"GuardianConfirmed\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a senior statesman and Anna's husband<ref name=\"TheWrapStar\" />\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, lover of Anna, a cavalry officer<ref name=\"TheWrapStar\" />\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Prince Stepan \"Stiva\" Arkadyevich Oblonsky, Anna's brother, a civil servant<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Princess Darya \"Dolly\" Alexandrovna Oblonskaya, Stiva's wife<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Princess Ekaterina \"Kitty\" Alexandrovna Shcherbatskaya, Dolly's younger sister<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Konstantin \"Kostya\" Dmitrievich Levin, a landowner and friend of Stiva<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Countess Vronskaya, Vronsky's mother<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Ruth Wilson]] as Princess Elizaveta \"Betsy\" Tverskaya, Vronsky's cousin<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Countess Lidia Ivanovna, leader of a high society circle that includes Karenin<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Princess Myagkaya, a friend of Anna<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz]] as Count Alexander \"Sasha\" Kirillovich Vronsky, Alexei's brother<ref name=\"Slashfilm\" />\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]] as Nikolai Dmitrievich Levin, Konstantin's brother\n* [[Emerald Fennell]] as Princess Merkalova\n* [[Tannishtha Chatterjee]] as Maria \"Masha\" Nikolaevna, Nikolai's wife, a former prostitute\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Pip Torrens]] and [[Susanne Lothar]] play Prince Shcherbatsky and Princess Shcherbatskaya, parents to Dolly and Kitty.
