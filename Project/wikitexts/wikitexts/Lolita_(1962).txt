The film follows Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged literature lecturer who becomes sexually infatuated with Dolores Haze (nicknamed \"Lolita\"), a young adolescent girl. It stars [[James Mason]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Peter Sellers]] and, as the titular character, [[Sue Lyon]].\n\nOwing to restrictions imposed by the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], the film toned down the most provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon, was 14 at the time of filming.\n\n''Lolita'' polarized contemporary critics for its controversial depictions of child sexual abuse. Years after its release, Kubrick expressed doubt that he would have attempted to make the film had he fully understood how severe the censorship limitations on it would be. Regardless, the film has since received critical acclaim, and was later nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a remote mansion, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1]] on the piano before being shot to death by Humbert \"Hum\" Humbert, a middle-aged British professor of French literature.\n\nFour years earlier, Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her 12-year-old daughter, Dolores, affectionately nicknamed \"Lolita\", with whom he becomes infatuated.\n\nTo be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. However, Charlotte wants all of Humbert's time for herself and tells him that she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte.\n\nThings turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and Charlotte grows increasingly unfulfilled and upset. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and describing Charlotte as \"obnoxious\" and \"brainless\". In an outburst, she runs outside, but is hit by a car and dies.\n\nHumbert arrives to pick up Lolita from camp; she does not yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, a pushy, abrasive stranger, insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his \"beautiful little daughter\", who is asleep upstairs. The stranger implies that he too is a policeman and repeats, too often, that he thinks Humbert is \"normal\". Humbert escapes the man's advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita play a \"game\" she learned at camp, and it is implied that they have a sexual encounter. The next day, Humbert confesses to Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert. The two then commence a trip cross country, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter.\n\nIn the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between the father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be the psychologist from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of \"the facts of life\". He convinces Humbert to allow Lolita to participate in the school play, for which she had been selected to play the leading role.\n\nWhile attending a performance of the play, Humbert learns that Lolita has been lying about how she was spending her Saturday afternoons when she claimed to be at piano practice. They get into a row and Humbert decides to leave Beardsley College and take Lolita on the road again. Lolita objects at first but then suddenly changes her mind and seems very enthusiastic. Once on the road, Humbert realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts.\n\nSome years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, the pushy stranger who kept crossing their path. Lolita admits she was infatuated by Quilty and also carried on an affair with him at Beardsley, then left the hospital with him when he promised her a Hollywood contract. However, he then demanded she join his bohemian lifestyle, including acting in his \"art\" films, which she refused.\n\nHumbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him. She declines, reminding him that she has a baby due in three months, but apologizes for cheating. Humbert gives Lolita $13,000, explaining it is her money from the sale of her mother's house, and leaves to go shoot Quilty in his mansion. [[Intertitle]]s explain that Humbert died of [[coronary thrombosis]] awaiting trial for Quilty's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of recurring cast members in Stanley Kubrick films}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Mason]] as Humbert \"Hum\" Humbert\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Charlotte Haze-Humbert\n* [[Sue Lyon]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Clare Quilty / Dr. Zempf\n* Gary Cockrell as Richard \"Dick\" Schiller\n* Jerry Stovin as John Farlow, a Ramsdale lawyer\n* [[Diana Decker]] as Jean Farlow\n* [[Lois Maxwell]] as Nurse Mary Lore\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Keegee\n* [[Susanne Gibbs]] as Mona\n* Bill Greene as George Swine, the hotel night manager in Bryceton\n* [[Shirley Douglas]] as Mrs. Starch, the piano teacher in Ramsdale\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as Vivian Darkbloom, Quilty's companion\n* Marion Mathie as Miss Lebone\n* [[James Dyrenforth]] as Frederick Beale, Sr.\n* Maxine Holden as Miss Fromkiss, the hospital receptionist\n* John Harrison as Tom\n* [[Colin Maitland]] as Charlie Sedgewick\n* [[C.

Kubrick determined that while this sacrificed a great ending, it helped maintain interest, as he believed that interest in the novel sagged halfway through once Humbert \u201cseduced\u201d Lolita.<ref name=\"kubrick\">\"[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)]\" by Joseph Gelmis.

Some of the minor parts were played by Canadian and American actors, such as [[Cec Linder]], [[Lois Maxwell]], Jerry Stovin and Diana Decker, who were based in England at the time. Kubrick had to film in England, as much of the money to finance the movie was not only raised there but also had to be spent there.<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> In addition, Kubrick was living in England at the time, and suffered from a deathly fear of flying.<ref>Rose, Lloyd.

Early on in the film, Quilty appears as himself: a conceited, [[avant-garde]] playwright with a superior manner. Later he is an inquisitive policeman on the porch of the hotel, where Humbert and Lolita are staying. Next he is the intrusive Beardsley High School psychologist, Doctor Zempf, who lurks in Humbert's front room, to persuade him to give Lolita more freedom in her after-school activities.<ref name=\"land\">[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0106.html Kubrick in Nabokovland] by Thomas Allen Nelson.

The censorship of the time inhibited Kubrick's direction; Kubrick later commented that, \"because of all the pressure over the Production Code and the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]] at the time, I believe I didn't sufficiently dramatize the erotic aspect of Humbert's relationship with Lolita. If I could do the film over again, I would have stressed the erotic component of their relationship with the same weight Nabokov did.\"<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> Kubrick hinted at the nature of their relationship indirectly, through [[double entendre]] and visual cues such as Humbert painting Lolita's toes. In a 1972 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview (after the ratings system had been introduced in late 1968), Kubrick said that he \"probably wouldn't have made the film\" had he realized in advance how difficult the censorship problems would be.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| title='Lolita': Complex, often tricky and 'a hard sell'| website=[[CNN]]| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103092340/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| archive-date=January 3, 2005| access-date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film is deliberately vague over Lolita's age.

I know it is madness to keep this journal, but it gives me a strange thrill to do so. And only a loving wife could decipher my microscopic script.\"\n\n===Screenplay adaptation===\n{{see also|Lolita}}\nThe screenplay is credited to Nabokov, although very little of what he provided (later published in a shortened version) was used in the film itself.<ref>''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]] 2013 Edition'' (edited by [[Leonard Maltin]], a Signet Books paperback published by [[New American Library]], a division of [[Penguin Group]]), p. 834: \"Screenplay for this genuinely strange film is credited to Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote the novel of the same name, but bears little relation to his actual script, later published\"</ref> Nabokov, following the success of the novel, moved out to Hollywood and penned a script for a film adaptation between March and September 1960. The first draft was extremely long\u2014over 400 pages. As producer Harris remarked, \"You couldn't make it. You couldn't ''lift'' it\".<ref>{{cite book|title=On Kubrick|first=James|last=Naremore|year=2019|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1838717469}}</ref> Nabokov remained polite about the film in public but in a 1962 interview before seeing the film, commented that it may turn out to be \"the swerves of a scenic drive as perceived by the horizontal passenger of an ambulance\".<ref>Nabokov, ''Strong Opinions'', Vintage International Edition, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Kubrick and Harris rewrote the script themselves, writing carefully to satisfy the needs of the censor.\n\nThere are many differences between the Kubrick-Harris film adaptation and Nabokov's novel, including some events that were entirely omitted. Most of the sexually explicit [[innuendo]]s, references and episodes in the book were taken out of the film because of the strict censorship of the 1960s; the sexual relationship between Lolita and Humbert is implied and never depicted graphically on the screen. In addition, some events in the film differ from the novel, and there are also changes in Lolita's character. Some of the differences are listed below:\n\n====Lolita's age, name, feelings and fate====\nLolita's age was raised from 12 to early teens in the film to meet [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] standards. Kubrick had been warned that censors felt strongly about using a more physically developed actress, who would be seen to be at least 14. As such, Sue Lyon was chosen for the title role, partly due to her more mature appearance.\n\nThe name \"Lolita\" is used only by Humbert as a private pet nickname in the novel, whereas in the film several of the characters refer to her by that name. In the book, she is referred to simply as \"Lo\" or \"Lola\" or \"Dolly\" by the other characters. Various critics, such as Susan Sweeney, have observed that since she never calls herself \"Lolita\", Humbert's pet name denies her subjectivity.<ref>[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/sweeney1.htm] See footnote 6.</ref> Generally, the novel gives little information about her feelings.\n\nThe film is not especially focused on Lolita's feelings. In the medium of film, her character is inevitably fleshed out somewhat from the cipher that she remains in the novel. Nonetheless, Kubrick actually omits the few vignettes in the novel in which Humbert's solipsistic bubble is burst and one catches glimpses of Lolita's personal misery. [[Susan Bordo]] writes, \"Kubrick chose not to include any of the vignettes from the novel which bring Lolita's misery to the forefront, nudging Humbert's obsession temporarily off center-stage. ...Nabokov's wife, Vera, insisted\u2014rightly\u2014on 'the pathos of Lolita's utter loneliness.'... In Kubrick's film, one good sobfest and dead mommy is forgotten. Humbert, to calm her down, has promised her a brand-new hi-fi and all the latest records. The same scene in the novel ends with Lolita sobbing, ''despite'' Humbert having plied her with gifts all day.\"<ref>''The male body: a new look at men in public and in private'' by Susan Bordo p. 305</ref> Bordo goes on to say \"Emphasizing Lolita's sadness and loss would not have jibed, of course, with the film's dedication to inflecting the 'dark' with the comic; it would have altered the overwhelmingly ironic, anti-sentimental character of the movie.\" When the novel briefly gives us evidence of Lolita's sadness and misery, Humbert glosses over it but the film omits nearly all of these episodes.\n\n====Professor Humbert====\nCritic Greg Jenkins believes that Humbert is imbued with a fundamental likability in this film that he does not necessarily have in the novel.<ref>Jenkins pp. 34\u201364</ref> He has a debonair quality in the film, while in the novel he can be perceived as much more repulsive. Humbert's two mental breakdowns leading to sanatorium stays before meeting Lolita are entirely omitted in the film, as are his earlier unsuccessful relationships with women his own age whom he refers to in the novel as \"terrestrial women\" through which he tried to stabilize himself. His lifelong complexes around young girls are largely concealed in the film, and Lolita appears older than her novelistic counterpart, both leading Jenkins to comment \"A story originally told from the edge of a moral abyss is fast moving toward safer ground.\"<ref>Jenkins, p. 40</ref> In short, the novel early flags Humbert as both mentally unsound and obsessively infatuated with young girls in a way the film never does.\n\nJenkins notes that Humbert even seems a bit more dignified and restrained than other residents of Ramsdale, particularly Lolita's aggressive mother, in a way that invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert. Humbert is portrayed as someone urbane and sophisticated trapped in a provincial small town populated by slightly lecherous people, a refugee from Old World Europe in an especially crass part of the New World. For example, Lolita's piano teacher comes across in the film as aggressive and predatory compared to which Humbert seems fairly restrained.<ref name=\"auto\">Jenkins p. 58</ref> The film character of John Farlow talks suggestively of \"swapping partners\" at a dance in a way that repels Humbert. Jenkins believes that in the film it is Quilty, not Humbert, who acts as the embodiment of evil.<ref>Jenkins p. 42</ref> The expansion of Quilty's character and the way Quilty torments Humbert also invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert.\n\nBecause Humbert narrates the novel, his increased mental deterioration due to anxiety in the entire second half of the story is more obvious from the increasingly desperate tone of his narrative. While the film shows Humbert's increasingly severe attempts to control Lolita, the novel shows more of Humbert's loss of self-control and stability.\n\nJenkins also notes that some of Humbert's more brutal actions are omitted or changed from the film. For example, in the novel he threatens to send Lolita to a reformatory, while in the film he promises to never send her there.<ref>Jenkins, p. 54</ref> He also notes that Humbert's narrative style in the novel, although elegant, is wordy, rambling, and roundabout, whereas in the film it is \"subdued and measured\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====Humbert's infatuation with \"nymphets\" in the novel====\nThe film entirely omits the critical episode in Humbert's life in which at age 14 he was interrupted making love to young Annabel Leigh who shortly thereafter died, and consequently omits all indications that Humbert had a preoccupation with prepubescent girls prior to meeting Dolores Haze. In the novel, Humbert gives his youthful amorous relationship with Annabel Leigh, thwarted by both adult intervention and her death, as the key to his obsession with nymphets. The film's only mention of \"nymphets\" is an entry in Humbert's diary specifically revolving around Lolita.\n\nHumbert explains that the smell and taste of youth filled his desires throughout adulthood: \"that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted [him] ever since\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\">''Annotated Lolita'' p. 15</ref> He thus claims that \"Lolita began with Annabel\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 14</ref> and that Annabel's spell was broken by \"incarnating her in another\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\"/>\n\nThe idea that anything connected with young girls motivated Humbert to accept the job as professor of French Literature at Beardsley College and move to Ramsdale at all is entirely omitted from the film. In the novel he first finds accommodations with the McCoo family because the McCoos have a twelve-year-old daughter, a potential \"enigmatic nymphet whom [he] would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish.\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 35</ref> However, the McCoo house happens to burn down in the few days prior to his arrival, and this is when Mrs. Haze offers to accommodate Humbert.\n\n====Humbert's attitudes to Charlotte====\nSusan Bordo has noticed that in order to show the callous and cruel side of Humbert's personality early in the film, Nabokov and Kubrick have shown additional ways in which Humbert behaves monstrously towards her mother, Charlotte Haze. He mocks her declaration of love towards him, and takes a pleasant bath after her accidental death. This effectively replaces the voice-overs in which he discusses his plans to seduce and molest Lolita as a means of establishing Humbert as manipulative, scheming, and selfish.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=303 }}</ref> However, Greg Jenkins has noted that Humbert's response to Charlotte's love note in the film is still much kinder than that in the novel, and that the film goes to significant lengths to make Charlotte unlikable.\n\n====Expansion of Clare Quilty====\nQuilty's role is greatly magnified in the film and brought into the foreground of the narrative. In the novel Humbert catches only brief uncomprehending glimpses of his nemesis before their final confrontation at Quilty's home, and the reader finds out about Quilty late in the narrative along with Humbert. Quilty's role in the story is made fully explicit from the beginning of the film, rather than being a concealed surprise twist near the end of the tale. In a 1962 interview with [[Terry Southern]], Kubrick describes his decision to expand Quilty's role, saying \"just beneath the surface of the story was this strong secondary narrative thread possible\u2014because after Humbert seduces her in the motel, or rather after she seduces him, the big question has been answered\u2014so it was good to have this narrative of mystery continuing after the seduction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|title=Terry Southern's Interview with Kubrick, 1962|work=terrysouthern.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108215717/http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|archive-date=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This magnifies the book's theme of Quilty as a dark double of Humbert, mirroring all of Humbert's worst qualities, a theme which preoccupied Kubrick.<ref>Michel Ciment ''Kubrick': The Definitive Edition'' p. 92</ref>\n\nThe film opens with a scene near the end of the story, Humbert's murder of Quilty. This means that the film shows Humbert as a murderer ''before'' showing us Humbert as a seducer of minors, and the film sets up the viewer to frame the following [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as an explanation for the murder. The film then goes back to Humbert's first meeting with Charlotte Haze and continues [[chronological]]ly until the final murder scene is presented once again. The book, narrated by Humbert, presents events in chronological order from the very beginning, opening with Humbert's life as a child. While Humbert hints throughout the novel that he has committed murder, its actual circumstances are not described until near the very end. NPR's Bret Anthony Johnston notes that the novel is sort of an inverted murder mystery: the reader knows someone has been killed, but the reader has to wait to find out who the victim is.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5536855|title=Why 'Lolita' Remains Shocking, And A Favorite|date=July 7, 2006|work=NPR.org}}</ref> \nSimilarly, the online Doubleday publisher's reading guide to ''Lolita'' notes \"the mystery of Quilty's identity turns this novel into a kind of detective story (in which the protagonist is both detective and criminal).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reading-group-center.knopfdoubleday.com/2010/01/07/lolita-reading-group-guide/|title=Lolita - Knopf Doubleday|work=Knopf Doubleday}}</ref> This effect is, of course, lost in the Kubrick film.\n\nIn the novel, Miss Pratt, the school principal at Beardsley, discusses with Humbert Dolores's behavioral issues and among other things persuades Humbert to allow her to participate in the dramatics group, especially one upcoming play. In the film, this role is replaced by Quilty disguised as a school psychologist named \"Dr. Zempf\". This disguise does not appear in the novel at all. In both versions, a claim is made that Lolita appears to be \"sexually repressed\", as she mysteriously has no interest in boys. Both Dr. Zempf and Miss Pratt express the opinion that this aspect of her youth should be developed and stimulated by dating and participating in the school's social activities. While Pratt mostly wants Humbert to let Dolores generally into the dramatic group, Quilty (as Zempf) is specifically focused on the high school play (written by Quilty and produced with some supervision from him) which Lolita has secretly rehearsed for (in both the film and novel). In the novel Miss Pratt na\u00efvely believes this talk about Dolores' \"sexual repression\", while Quilty in his disguise knows the truth. Although Peter Sellers is playing only one character in this film, Quilty's disguise as Dr. Zempf allows him to employ a mock German accent that is quintessentially in the style of Sellers's acting.<ref>An interesting discussion of this scene is in ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nWith regard to this scene, playwright [[Edward Albee]]'s 1981 stage adaptation of the novel follows Kubrick's film rather than the novel.\n\nThe movie retains the novel's theme of Quilty (anonymously) goading Humbert's conscience on many occasions, though the details of how this theme is played out are quite different in the film. He has been described as \"an emanation of Humbert's guilty conscience\",<ref>Justin Wintle in ''The concise new makers of modern culture'' p. 556</ref> and Humbert describes Quilty in the novel as his \"shadow\".<ref>Annotated Lolita p. lxi</ref>\n\nThe first and last word of the novel is \"Lolita\".<ref>This is discussed in a footnote in ''Annotated Lolita'' p. 328</ref> As film critic Greg Jenkins has noted, in contrast to the novel, the first and last word of the screenplay is \"Quilty\".<ref>''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins p. 67</ref>\n\n====Contemplating murder of Charlotte Haze====\nIn the novel, Humbert and Charlotte go swimming in Hourglass Lake, where Charlotte announces she will ship Lo off to a good boarding school; that part takes place in bed in the film. Humbert's contemplation of possibly killing Charlotte similarly takes place at Hourglass Lake in the book, but at home in the film. This difference affects Humbert's contemplated method of killing Charlotte. In the book he is tempted to drown her in the lake, whereas in the film he considers the possibility of shooting her with a pistol while in the house, in both scenarios concluding that he could never bring himself to do it. In his biography of Kubrick, Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick tried to recreate Hourglass Lake in a studio, but became uncomfortable shooting such a pivotally important exterior scene in the studio, so he refashioned the scene to take place at home.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-80906-0 |page= 208 }}</ref> Susan Bordo notes that after Charlotte's actual death in the film, two neighbors see Humbert's gun and falsely conclude Humbert is contemplating suicide, while in fact he had been contemplating killing Charlotte with it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=304 }}</ref>\n\nThe same attempted killing of Charlotte appears in the \"Deleted Scenes\" section of the DVD of the [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997 film]] (now put back at Hourglass Lake). In the novel Humbert really considers killing Charlotte and later Lolita accuses Humbert of having deliberately killed her. Only the first scene is in the 1962 film and only the latter scene appears in the 1997 film.\n\n====Lolita's friends at school====\nLolita's friend, Mona Dahl, is a friend in Ramsdale (the first half of the story) in the film and disappears quite early in the story. In the film, Mona is simply the host of a party which Lolita abandons early in the story. Mona is a friend of Lolita's in Beardsley (the second half of the story) in the novel. In the novel Mona is active in the school play, Lolita tells Humbert stories about Mona's love life, and Humbert notes Mona had \"long since ceased\" to be (if ever she was) a \"nymphet\". Mona has already had an affair with a Marine and appears to be flirting with Humbert. She keeps Lolita's secrets and helps Lolita lie to Humbert when Humbert discovers that Lolita has been missing her piano lessons. In the film, Mona in the second half seems to have been replaced by a \"Michele\" who is also in the play and having an affair with a Marine and backs up Lolita's fibs to Humbert. Film critic Greg Jenkins claims that Mona has simply been entirely eliminated from the film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick and the art of adaptation: three novels, three films |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-0281-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 151] |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 }}</ref>\n\nHumbert is suspicious that Lolita is developing an interest in boys at various times throughout the story. He suspects no one in particular in the novel. In the film, he is twice suspicious of a pair of boys, Rex and Roy, who hang out with Lolita and her friend Michele. In the novel, Mona has a friend named Roy.\n\n====Other differences====\nIn the novel, the first mutual attraction between Humbert and Lolita begins because Humbert resembles a celebrity she likes. In the film, it occurs at a drive-in horror film when she grabs his hand. The scene is from Christopher Lee's ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' when the monster removes his mask. Christine Lee Gengaro proposes that this suggests that Humbert is a monster in a mask,<ref>{{cite book |last= Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |year=2012 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0571211081 |page=52 }}</ref> and the same theory is developed at greater length by Jason Lee.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lee |first=Jason |title=Celebrity, Pedophilia, and Ideology in American Culture |year= 2009 |publisher= Cambria Press |isbn=978-1604975994 |pages=109\u2013111}}</ref> As in the novel, Lolita shows affection for Humbert before she departs for summer camp.\n\nIn the novel, both the hotel at which Humbert and Dolores first have relations and the stage-play by Quilty for which Dolores prepares to perform in at her high school is called ''The Enchanted Hunter''. However, in the novel school headmistress Pratt erroneously refers to the play as ''The Hunted Enchanter''. In Kubrick's film, the hotel bears the same name as in the novel, but now the play really is called ''The Hunted Enchanter''. Both names are established only through signage \u2013 the banner for the police convention at the hotel and the marquee for the play \u2013 the names are never mentioned in dialogue.\n \nThe relationships between Humbert and other women before and after Lolita are omitted from the film. Greg Jenkins sees this as part of Kubrick's general tendency to simplify his narratives, also noting that the novel therefore gives us a more \"seasoned\" view of Humbert's taste in women.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 156] }}</ref>\n\nOnly the film has a police convention at the hotel where Humbert\u2019s moral crisis comes to a head: whether to allow Lolita to seduce him, or to instead reject her advances and choose to behave as best he can as her stepfather. Kubrick scholar Michel Ciment sees this as typical of Kubrick's general tendency to assail authority figures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ciment |first=Michel |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition |year=2003 |publisher= Macmillan |isbn=0571211089 |page=92 }}</ref>\n\nLolita completes the school play (written by Clare Quilty) in the film, but drops out prior to finishing it in the novel. In the film, we see that Quilty's play has suggestive symbolism, and Humbert's confrontation with Lolita over her missing her piano lessons occurs after her triumphal debut in the play's premiere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 57] }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[Film score|music for the film]] was composed by [[Nelson Riddle]] (the main theme was by [[J. Robert Harris|Bob Harris]]). The recurring dance number first heard on the radio when Humbert meets Lolita in the garden later became a hit single under the name \"Lolita Ya Ya\" with Sue Lyon credited with the singing on the single version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endlessgroove.com/issue1/kubrick.htm |title=SOUNDTRACKS TO THE FILMS OF STANLEY KUBRICK |author=Tony Maygarden |publisher=The Endless Groove |access-date=December 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109194133/http://www.endlessgroove.com/issue1/kubrick.htm |archive-date=January 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The flip side was a 60s-style light rock song called \"Turn off the Moon\" also sung by Sue Lyon. \"Lolita Ya Ya\" was later recorded by other bands; it was also a hit single for [[The Ventures]], reaching 61 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://billboard.elpee.jp/single/Lolita%20Ya-Ya/The%20Ventures/|website=Billboard Database|title=Lolita Ya-Ya|accessdate=February 26, 2022}}</ref> A review in ''Billboard'' stated, \"There've been a number of versions of the title tune from the hit film ''Lolita'' but this figures the strongest to date.

In the UK/Australian print, the shot continues as Humbert mumbles that he's not familiar with the game. She then bends down again to whisper more details. Kubrick then cuts to a closer shot of Lolita's face as she says \"Well, alrighty then\" and then fades as she begins to descend onto Humbert on the cot.
