It is a remake of the 1942 [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] film [[Cat People (1942 film)|of the same name]]. [[Giorgio Moroder]] composed the film's score (the second Schrader film to be scored by Moroder, after ''[[American Gigolo]]''), including the [[Cat People (Putting Out Fire)|theme song]], which features lyrics and vocals by [[David Bowie]]. [[Wilbur Stark]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] served as [[executive producer]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nA prologue set in an undisclosed, primitive human settlement shows a sacrificial maiden being tied to a tree. A [[black panther]] approaches and rests its paws on her, and the scene fades to black. Another girl with feline features approaches a similar [[big cat]] in a cave, without incurring its attack.\n\nA close-up of her face segues to that of similarly featured Irena Gallier, who travels to present-day [[New Orleans]] from [[Canada]] to reconnect with her brother Paul. Irena was raised in foster care after they were orphaned. Paul, who spent his childhood in psych wards, is now involved in a church and lives with his [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] housekeeper Female.\n\nThat night, a prostitute named Ruthie walks into a fleabag motel to meet a [[John (prostitution)|john]], but instead finds a black panther that mauls her foot. The police and zoologists Oliver, Alice and Joe capture the black panther. Meanwhile, Irena wakes to find Paul missing. Female guesses he went to the mission and urges Irena to enjoy New Orleans on her own.\n\nIrena visits the zoo, is drawn to the newly captured black panther and stays after closing hours. She is discovered by Oliver, the zoo's curator, who takes her to dinner and offers her a job in the gift shop. Irena reveals she is a [[virginity|virgin]] in conversation with Alice, who shares a romantic history (and is still in love) with Oliver and sees her as a rival. One day the black panther tears Joe's arm off during a routine cage cleaning. Joe bleeds to death and Oliver resolves to euthanize the cat, only to find it missing. In its cage lies a puddle of melted flesh like the one found by the motel prostitute.\n\nPaul turns up and makes a sexual advance towards Irena. She flees, flags down a police car and has second thoughts about turning Paul in, but a police dog catches a strong scent from the house and a detective is called in. In Paul's basement, police find shackles, bones, and remains of dozens of corpses. They figure Paul is a serial killer who fed corpses to a captive black panther, and call in Oliver and Alice to inspect.\n\nOn the run from Paul, Irena takes refuge in a frustrated romance with Oliver, fearing the consequences of physical intimacy. Paul visits Irena again and explains their shared [[werecat]] heritage, thus revealing himself as the escaped murderous leopard. Mating with a human transforms a werecat into a black panther, and only by killing a human can it regain human form. He tells her their parents were siblings because werecats are ancestrally incestuous and only mates between werecats prevents the transformation. He resumes his sexual advances, hoping Irena will accept their predicament, but she does not. Paul then transforms, attacks Oliver and is shot by Alice. Oliver starts a necropsy on Paul. A green gas emanates from the surgical cut and a human arm and hand reach up from within Paul's corpse. Before he can document this, Paul's corpse melts into a pool of green slime.\n\nIrena's feline instincts start to emerge, and she stalks and nearly attacks Alice twice. She later mates with Oliver and transforms into a black panther but she flees, sparing his life, and is later trapped on a bridge by police. Oliver arrives in time to see her jump off the bridge. Realizing where she is headed, he confronts Irena at a secluded lake house. She has regained human form by killing the house's caretaker. Irena tells Oliver she did not kill him because she loves him, and begs him to kill her. When he refuses, she begs him, then, to make love to her again so she can transform and \"be with [her] own kind\". Oliver ties Irena naked to the bedposts by her arms and legs to restrain her, and mates with her.\n\nSome time later, Oliver is again in a one-sided relationship with Alice. He stops at the cage holding the \"recaptured panther\" - Irena, now permanently trapped in her black panther form. Oliver reaches through the bars, casually hand-feeds and strokes the now-docile Irena's neck.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Irena Gallier\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Paul Gallier\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Oliver Yates\n* [[Annette O'Toole]] as Alice Perrin\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Female\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Joe Creigh\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as Bill Searle\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Detective Brandt (dubbed by [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]])\n* [[Lynn Lowry]] as Ruthie\n* [[John Larroquette]] as Bronte Judson\n*  Tessa Richarde as Billie\n* [[Meshach Taylor]] as Powell\n* [[Berry Berenson]] as Sandra\n* [[Pui Fan Lee]] as Olga\n* [[Ray Wise]] as Soap Opera Man\n* [[Stocker Fontelieu]] as Priest\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nDirector Schrader has said, in relation to the erotic and horror aspects of ''Cat People'', that the film \"contains more skin than blood\". He has described the film as being more about the mythical than the realistic. He has likened the relation between Oliver and Irena to [[Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], putting the female on a pedestal.<ref name=\"dvdverdict\">[https://dvdverdict.com/reviews/catpeoplehddvd.php DVD Verdict Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902011309/https://dvdverdict.com/reviews/catpeoplehddvd.php|date=2010-09-02}}, ''Cat People'' (HD DVD).</ref>\n\n==Production==\nBritish based American producer [[Milton Subotsky]] bought the rights to ''Cat People'' from RKO and began developing a remake.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=70}} Subotsky eventually passed the property to Universal.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=70}}<ref name=\"SchraderAFI\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/68109-CAT-PEOPLE?sid=14df3907-14d5-4efb-afad-96913e3b1000&sr=10.170605&cp=1&pos=1|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Cat People (1982)|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref> Initially, [[Roger Vadim]] was set to be the director of the remake. [[Alan Ormsby]], the screenwriter of the remake, stated that the film went through three earlier scripts, two of which were written by [[Bob Clark]]. According to Ormsby, Vadim was very concerned that the film would appear sexist, as the woman who was sexually intense had to be destroyed. Ormsby changed this in the remake to have a male character who has the same problem.{{sfn|Warren|1982|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Universal Pictures]] hired director [[Paul Schrader]] to direct the remake.{{sfn|Newman|2009|p=70}}<ref name=\"SchraderAFI\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/68109-CAT-PEOPLE?sid=14df3907-14d5-4efb-afad-96913e3b1000&sr=10.170605&cp=1&pos=1|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Cat People (1982)|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref> The remake was announced and began shooting in 1981.<ref name=\"SchraderAFI\" /> According to cinematographer [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]], Schrader paid homage to the stalking scene in the original with a scene featuring [[Annette O'Toole]]'s character jogging through a park as she appears to be stalked.{{sfn|Bailey|2016|loc=00:12:43}} Bailey and Schrader also remade the swimming pool scene. Bailey recalled that the two carefully studied the original scene, taking note of how the shadows reflected against the pool.{{sfn|Bailey|2016|loc=00:14:10}} Bailey stated that the pool sequence was the most similar of the homages, remarking that the primary reason for this was that \"we didn't think we could do it any better\".\n\nThe Blu-ray features interviews with Kinski, McDowell, Heard and O'Toole as well as director Schrader and composer Moroder. McDowell indicated that he was somewhat reluctant to make the film at first because he recalled the original film as \"not being very good\" but was convinced by Schrader's take on the material with its focus on the erotic horror elements. McDowell also revealed that the scene where he leaps on the bed in a cat-like fashion was shot with him jumping off the bed. They then ran the film backward. Heard discussed how he almost turned down the role because he believed it was a porno movie. He also recalled that he felt very awkward, particularly during the nude scenes. O'Toole discussed the fact that they used [[cougar]]s that were dyed black because [[leopard]]s are impossible to train.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] on April 2, 1982.
