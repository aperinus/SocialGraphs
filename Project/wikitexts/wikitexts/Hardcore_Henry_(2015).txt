The film was released theatrically in the United States by [[STXfilms]] on April 8, 2016. It garnered mixed reviews in the US but was more positively received in Russia. Despite grossing $16.8 million worldwide against a $2 million budget, it was considered a [[box-office bomb]] in the US, due to STX spending $10 million to acquire global rights to the film.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sure, 'Hardcore Henry' Bombed, but You Would Love It at Midnight {{!}} The Village Voice|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/04/13/sure-hardcore-henry-bombed-but-you-would-love-it-at-midnight/|access-date=2020-09-08|website=www.villagevoice.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n\nA man wakes inside a laboratory on an airship. A scientist, Estelle, tells him his name is Henry, she is his wife, and he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. She replaces his missing limbs with cybernetic [[prostheses]], but [[mercenaries]] led by the [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] Akan raid the ship before she can replace Henry's voice. Akan claims all of Estelle's research is his corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. The mercenaries follow and abduct Estelle.\n\nHenry is rescued by a stranger named Jimmy, who informs him that his cybernetic limbs are running out of power, which will kill him if he cannot recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt police paid by Akan, but Henry escapes. He is joined by another Jimmy, now an alcoholic bum, who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a charging pump which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked, and again Jimmy is killed. Henry escapes, and hunts Dimitry through Moscow before capturing him. Just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel.\n\nHenry meets two more distinct versions of Jimmy; one a nervous nerd, the other a drug-fuelled sex manic, who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Akan taunts Henry about Estelle, who is being transported by an armored convoy, before ejecting Henry from the brothel. Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy, a stoner, who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry attacks the convoy and locates Estelle and Akan, who beats him with a baseball bat and buries him in the woods.\n\nJimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew and fending off a helicopter, Henry finds another Jimmy, who leads him to an abandoned hotel and a hidden laboratory. Here, the original Jimmy\u2014a quadriplegic scientist\u2014reveals that he is seeking revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. The other Jimmys are clones based on aspects of Jimmy's personality that he can control via a headset. The clones sing and dance with Henry to the song \"[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]\".\n\nJimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in, and the clones attack Henry. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones fight their way out, killing Akan's forces by collapsing the laboratory on them.\n\nJimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being a friend, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan and an army of cyborg super-soldiers with Henry's memories. The soldiers chase Henry to the roof.\n\nHenry wipes out the entire army to the Queen song \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", before Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Estelle arrives and reveals that she is actually Akan's wife. Everything that happened was an elaborate ruse to field-test their ability to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to \"rescue\" their \"wives\", including committing terrorist acts.\n\nAkan and Estelle prepare to board a helicopter, leaving Henry for dead. Henry blacks out, but a memory of his father revives him and motivates him to crush Akan's hands and wrap his robotic eyestalk around Akan's jaw, decapitating him. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her with Akan's head. She shoots Henry, but a bullet ricochets and hits her, causing her to stumble out of the helicopter. Henry slams the door on her hands, sending her plumetting to her death.\n\n==Cast==\n* Sergey Valyaev, Andrei Dementiev, [[Ilya Naishuller]] and others as Henry\n* [[Sharlto Copley]] as Jimmy\n* [[Danila Kozlovsky]] as Akan\n* [[Haley Bennett]] as Estelle\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Henry's Father\n* Andrei Dementiev as Dmitry \"Slick Dmitry\"\n* Oleg Poddubnyy as Yuri\n* [[Cyrus Arnold]] as Nat (credited as \"Young Bully #2\")\n* Ilya Naishuller as Timothy / Higher-Self Merc\n* Will Stewart as Robbie\n* Martin Cooke as Marty\n* Dasha Charusha as Katya, The Dominatrix\n* [[Svetlana Ustinova]] as Olga, The Dominatrix\n* [[Aleksandr Pal]] as Mr. Fahrenheit\n\nHenry was originally played by Russian stuntman/camera operator<ref>{{cite web|url=http://specials.furfur.me/insight/posts/parcour|title=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0432: \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0435\u0440, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0443\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c|publisher=FurFur|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> Sergey Valyaev,<ref name=\"fxguide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/how-hardcore-henrys-pov-shots-were-made/|title=How Hardcore Henry's POV shots were made|publisher=fxguide|access-date=April 21, 2016}}</ref> but the camera rig used in production eventually caused him severe neck pain.
