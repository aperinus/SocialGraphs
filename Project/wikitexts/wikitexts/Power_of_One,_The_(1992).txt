Set in [[South Africa]] during [[World War II]], the film centers on the life of Peter Philip Kenneth Keith, an [[British diaspora in Africa|English South African]] boy raised under [[apartheid]], and his conflicted relationships with a German [[pianist]], a [[Coloureds|Coloured]] boxing coach and an [[Afrikaner]] romantic interest. Directed and edited by [[John G. Avildsen]], the film stars [[Stephen Dorff]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]], and [[Daniel Craig]] in his feature film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nBorn in 1930 to a recently widowed Englishwoman on a homestead in South Africa, little Peter Philip Kennith Keith (nicknamed 'PK') is schooled in the ways of England by his mother and the ways of Africa by a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nanny, whose son Tonderai is also his best friend. However, their peaceful life is soon shattered when the farm's cattle are claimed by ''[[rinderpest]]''. PK's mother succumbs to a nervous breakdown, and he is sent away to a conservative [[Afrikaans]] boarding school while she recovers.\n\nBeing the only English student at the boarding school, PK earns universal contempt from his [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] fellows\u2014particularly from Jaapie Botha, the oldest student. The extreme bullying strikes PK with a severe case of [[nocturnal enuresis|bed wetting]], a habit which he eventually overcomes with local [[Traditional healers of Southern Africa|sangoma]] Dabula Manzi. In conquering his nightmares, PK is given a chicken, whom he names Mother Courage, and which becomes his closest companion.\n\nWhen war suddenly [[Second World War|breaks out in Europe]], the Afrikaner students kidnap PK and Mother Courage and has them tried before a mock Nazi court where Botha elaborates on the depth of his hatred for the British&mdash;a people he holds responsible for atrocities committed during the [[Second Boer War]]. The Afrikaner boys hang Mother Courage and kill her with a rock. When PK physically retaliates against Botha, they attempt to execute him in a similar manner, but are interrupted by a teacher who later oversees Botha's expulsion.\n\nWith his mother dying, PK finds himself living with his grandfather in [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]]. He eventually finds a mentor in Karl \"Doc\" von Vollensteen, a lonely [[Germans|German]] musician whose family was executed by the Nazis. Doc warms to PK and under his guidance PK soon becomes an excellent pianist. He is soon interned as an enemy alien for the rest of the war, but PK continues to visit him regularly in prison. Doc introduces the boy to Geel Piet, a [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] inmate who trains him to be an excellent boxer. Piet also impresses on PK his [[mantra]]: \"first with the head, then with the heart\".\n\nA maturing PK begins to express sympathy towards black prisoners, who are detained under appalling conditions and frequently beaten by the Afrikaner guards. He works with Doc to distribute contraband among the Africans, writes their letters to home, and shares their many sufferings. The war does not end happily for PK, as Doc is repatriated and Piet is killed by a guard. PK goes to study at the prestigious Prince of Wales School in [[Johannesburg]]. While attending a boxing championship, he is enamoured by Maria Marais, the Afrikaans daughter of a leading [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] official. Since her strict father will not permit them to see each other, they begin dating in secret. On one such outing they are introduced to Gideon Duma, a prominent boxer in [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]], a black township. Duma's passion for resisting [[apartheid]] inspires PK, and he opens an English school for Africans.\n\nMaria's father, incensed by the couple's ongoing relationship and PK's ties to a multiracial gym, leads him to request a formal investigation by one of his [[South African Police]] contacts, Colonel Breyten. Breyten and his sergeant, an embittered Jaapie Botha, place PK under surveillance for subversion. His clashes with the police (which result in detainment of numerous people he knows) come to a head when Duma is severely injured and Maria is killed during a raid on their school in a church along with numerous other innocent people. Maddened by grief, PK considers going to study at Oxford in England, but is consoled by a recovering Duma who shows him that all his teachings have finally shown progress and reminds him of all the good he can still do in Africa.\n\nBotha leads a violent raid on Alexandra the following night which results in Breyten's death at the hands of an enraged villager. Botha threatens to shoot Elias Mlungisi, the local boxing promoter, only to be confronted by PK. They fight, and PK finally defeats his childhood enemy. Despite the loss, a bloodied and vindictive Botha is still bent on killing him with a hidden pistol, but an arriving Gideon Duma brutally kills Botha with a cricket bat to the head before he can fire. Now wanted fugitives from the apartheid government, PK and Duma vow to continue a campaign against racial injustice with the aid of the other survivors. PK's closing narration identifies meaningful voices during his life from his nanny to Doc, Geel Piet, Dabula Manzi, and finally Maria.\n\n==Cast==\n* Guy Witcher as PK at age 7\n*[[Simon Fenton]] as PK at age 12\n*[[Stephen Dorff]] as PK at age 18\n*[[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Doc\n*Jeremiah Mnisi as Dabula Manzi\n*[[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]] as Hoppie Gruenewald\n*[[John Gielgud]] as St. John, the Headmaster\n*[[Fay Masterson]] as Maria Marais\n*[[Morgan Freeman]] as Geel Piet\n*[[Daniel Craig]] as Sergeant Jaapie Botha\n*Robbie Bulloch as the teenage Botha\n*Dominic Walker as Morrie Gilbert\n*Faith Edwards as Miriam Sisulu\n*[[Alois Moyo]] as Gideon Duma\n*[[Brian O'Shaughnessy (actor)|Brian O'Shaughnessy]] as Colonel Breyten\n*[[Marius Weyers]] as Professor Daniel Marais\n*[[Clive Russell]] as Sergeant Bormann\n*[[Winston Ntshona]] as Mlungisi\n*Nomadlozi Kubheka as Nanny\n*Mark Clements as school boy\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews.
