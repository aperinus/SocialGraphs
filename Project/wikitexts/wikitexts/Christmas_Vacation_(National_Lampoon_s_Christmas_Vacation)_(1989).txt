He drives his wife Ellen, daughter Audrey, and son Rusty out to the country to find a tree. After walking through the snow for hours, Clark picks out the largest tree he can find. Realizing too late that they did not bring any tools to cut the tree down, they are forced to uproot it instead, before driving home with the tree strapped to the roof of their car.\n\nSoon after, both Clark's and Ellen's parents arrive for Christmas, but their bickering quickly begins to annoy the family. Clark, however, maintains a positive attitude, determined to have a \"fun old-fashioned family Christmas\". He covers the house's entire exterior with 25,000 [[twinkle lights]], which fail to work at first, as he has accidentally wired them through his garage's light switch. When they finally come on, they temporarily cause a citywide [[Brownout (electricity)|power shortage]] and create chaos for Clark's [[yuppie]] neighbors, Todd and Margo Chester. While standing on the front lawn admiring the lights, Clark is shocked to see Ellen's country-based cousin Catherine and her husband Eddie, as they arrive unannounced with their children, Rocky and Ruby Sue, and their pet [[Rottweiler]] Snots. Eddie later admits that they are living in the [[recreational vehicle|RV]] they arrived in as he is broke and has been forced to sell his home and acreage. In addition, the older half of his children are too busy to join Eddie in the visit. Clark offers to buy gifts for Eddie's kids so they can still enjoy Christmas. Soon afterward, Clark's [[senile]] Aunt Bethany and grumpy Uncle Lewis arrive as well.\n\nClark begins to wonder why his boss, Frank Shirley, has not given him his yearly [[Bonus payment|bonus]], which he desperately needs to replace an advance payment he has made to install a swimming pool for the coming summer. After a disastrous Christmas Eve dinner, along with Bethany's cat getting [[electrocuted]] and Uncle Lewis accidentally burning down the Christmas tree while lighting his [[cigar]], he finally receives an envelope from a company messenger, who had failed to deliver it the day before. Instead of the presumed bonus, the envelope contains a free year's membership for the \"Jelly of the Month Club\". This prompts Clark to snap and go into a tirade about Frank and, out of anger, request that he be delivered to the house, wrapped in a bow, so Clark can insult him to his face.\n\nTaking Clark's request literally, Eddie drives to Frank's mansion, and kidnaps him. Frank admits to having canceled the Christmas bonuses, and Clark chastises him for doing so. Meanwhile, Frank's wife, Helen, calls the police, and a [[SWAT]] team storms the Griswold house and holds everyone at gunpoint. Frank decides not to press charges and explains the situation to his wife and the SWAT leader, both of whom scold him for his decision to scrap the bonuses. Frank ultimately decides to reinstate the bonuses (with Clark getting a bonus equal to last year's amount, plus 20% as compensation).\n\nThe family heads outside when Rocky and Ruby Sue believe they see [[Santa Claus]] in the distance. Clark tells them it is actually the [[Star of Bethlehem|Christmas Star]] and that he finally realizes what the holiday means to him. Uncle Lewis says the light is coming from the [[sewage treatment plant]], reminding Clark that Eddie had been dumping his RV sewage into the nearby storm drain. Before Clark can stop him, Uncle Lewis tosses a match used to light his cigar into the drain, triggering an explosion. The explosion sends a Santa's sleigh decoration flying into the sky. Aunt Bethany starts singing \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" and everyone joins in as the flaming decoration flies into the distance.\n\nThe entire family, Frank and Helen, and the SWAT team members then celebrate inside the house, while Clark and Ellen happily share a Christmas kiss, and Clark stands outside satisfied that he provided a great Christmas for his family. As the credits roll, he manages to give Snots the petting he wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Clark W. \"Sparky\" Griswold Jr., the patriarch of the Griswold family.
