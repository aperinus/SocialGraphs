The film became somewhat famous for its connections to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]]; amongst other things, it was the last major production to film inside the former [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. The film plot, written years before the attacks, involved a variety of Serbo-Balkan extremists (including a man from [[Afghanistan]]) planning a huge attack in [[New York City]]. The film's release date was moved out of its late 2001 spot and into a summer 2002 release, similar to several other films with [[terrorism]] or violent crime-related stories, including ''[[Collateral Damage (2002 film)|Collateral Damage]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen a mission to retrieve a stolen suitcase [[bomb]] goes awry, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agent Kevin Pope is killed. Pope was working undercover as an antiquities dealer under the name Michael Turner. The CIA, which is desperate to complete the mission, discovers that Agent Pope had a [[Twin|twin brother]], Jake Hayes, from whom he was separated at birth; their mother died giving birth and Hayes suffered from a severe lung infection that prompted the doctors to separate them because they felt that Hayes was unlikely to live for very long. Hayes hustles chess games, scalps tickets and works at small clubs in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] to make ends meet. Meanwhile, Hayes's girlfriend, Julie grows tired of waiting for him to grow up and decides to move to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].\n\nAfter the CIA successfully persuades Hayes to participate and begins to train Hayes for a mission that is to take place in [[Prague]],  [[Czech Republic]], they are initially dismayed by his lack of refinement. Agent Oakes confronts Hayes, telling him he doesn't trust him. When Hayes begins paying attention, the CIA sets him up in his brother's old apartment in [[Manhattan]] to test him and try to bait the men who killed his brother. Hayes is attacked, but escapes unharmed. Looking for a way out, Hayes goes to his foster mother only to be found by Oakes, who persuades him to finish the mission.\n\nAfter arriving in Prague, Hayes - posing as his dead brother - meets with the men selling the suitcase bomb. The seller, Adrik Vas is an ex-Russian Army Colonel with ties to the [[Russian Mafia]]. When they return to their hotel, Hayes is greeted by his brother's ex-girlfriend Nicole. Believing Hayes is his brother, she dines with him and returns to his hotel, where the couple is ambushed by rival buyers. Nicole figures out that Hayes isn't his brother and returns to her assignment covering the Balkans for [[CNN]].\n\nHayes and Oakes meet with Vas and are able to steal the arming codes. Just as they close the deal, Vas' men double cross them with the rival buyer. When the rival dealers, who are part of a multi-national terrorist organization, learn they can't detonate the bomb because of the missing codes, they kidnap Julie. Hayes gives himself up trying to save his girlfriend, and the terrorists get the codes back and arm the bomb.\n\nAfter interrogating one of the captured terrorists, they track the bomb to [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]]. With the clock ticking, they locate the bomb and the terrorist leader Dragan A\u0111ani\u0107, who has started the countdown. Oakes rescues Hayes by killing two terrorists. As Hayes starts to enter the codes to disarm the bomb, A\u0111ani\u0107 holds Julie hostage. In order to distract A\u0111ani\u0107, Hayes pretends to shoot Oakes, and they kill A\u0111ani\u0107 by shooting him repeatedly. Hayes is able to disarm the bomb just prior to detonation. \n\nHayes visits his brother's grave. Later, Oakes approaches Hayes and warns him that a dangerous criminal has escaped from prison and is seeking revenge on Kevin Pope, but since Kevin is dead and Hayes was impersonating him, the criminal thinks Hayes is Kevin. Hayes begins to panic and demands that Oakes protect him, but Oakes laughs as he reveals that it was just a joke and he really just came for the wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as CIA Agent Oakes\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Jake Hayes / CIA Agent Kevin Pope / Michael Turner\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Adrik Vas\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as CIA Agent Seale\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Julie Benson\n* [[Adoni Maropis]] as Jarma / Dragan Henchman #1\n* [[Garcelle Beauvais]] as Nicole\n* [[Matthew Marsh (actor)|Matthew Marsh]] as Dragan A\u0111ani\u0107\n* [[Dragan Mi\u0107anovi\u0107]] as Michelle \"The Hammer\" Petrov\n* [[John Slattery]] as CIA Deputy Director Roland Yates\n* [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as CIA Agent Swanson\n* [[Daniel Sunjata]] as CIA Agent Carew\n* DeVone Lawson Jr. as CIA Agent Parish\n* Wills Robbins as CIA Agent McCain\n* [[Marek Va\u0161ut]] as Andre\n* [[Irma P.
