It is the sixth film to be directed by Brooks, from a screenplay co-written with [[Monica Johnson]]. Stone portrays the titular muse who is tasked with reviving the career of a once-celebrated Hollywood screenwriter, played by Brooks. The film also features numerous [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] from well-known filmmakers, including [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[James Cameron]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews and did not meet with large box office success, grossing only about $11 million domestically. Sharon Stone earned a nomination for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter winning a lifetime achievement award, esteemed [[screenwriter]] Steven Phillips (Brooks) has a rude awakening. Believing the award has no real meaning, he finds out it means his career is over. His studio reneged on renewing his contract, telling him he's \"lost his edge.\" Junior exec Josh Martin ([[Mark Feuerstein]]) tells him his new script is dull and to be off the lot by 5.\n\nDesperate to revive his career, he seeks advice from very successful screenwriter Jack (Bridges), who arranges an introduction to Sarah (Stone), a modern-day [[muse]] who can inspire anyone. She has lavish demands (expensive hotel rooms, gifts from [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]]), much to his wife Laura's chagrin (MacDowell).\n\nSteven isn't sure if she is authentic or a charlatan. She takes him to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], where they bump into writer-director [[Rob Reiner]], who Sarah clearly knows. There, Steven gets an idea for a movie set in an aquarium, with [[Jim Carrey]] as the lead.\n\nAs Sarah's demands increase, Steven's apprehensive wife begins to be won over. Through the muse's encouragement Laura decides to pursue her dream of baking and selling cookies, to great success.\n\nTo save money, Sarah is invited to move into their house. Steven, however, is frustrated because she spends more time helping others\u2014Hollywood writers and directors like [[James Cameron]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who come to Steven's house to see her. He even surrenders his own bedroom to her, sleeping in the guest house.\n\nWhen he pleads for a good ending for his aquarium screenplay, Sarah points Steven in the right direction, inspiring him with a great idea. Steven's agent Hal is thrilled and urges him to finish the script as quickly as possible, which he does.\n\nThe following morning, though, two visitors come to Steven's, doctors from a mental clinic. They tell him Sarah is an escaped psychiatric patient from their asylum with [[multiple personality disorder]]. They find the whole \"muse\" idea hilarious. When they try to find Sarah to take her back, they discover that she has escaped and decide not to look for her, as she can come and go anytime she wants.\n\nThe junior exec, Josh, loves Steven's script, but breaks the news it is already in production at another studio\u2014by Rob Reiner. A broken-hearted Steven goes to work in his wife's new cookie business.\n\nThings look up when the agent calls to tell Steven that the Reiner project fell through and the studio wants to purchase his version, contingent upon a few changes. An excited Steven goes to the studio, where a secretary reveals that Josh was fired for stealing and they have a new boss in charge, Christine. Steven is shocked to see Christine is Sarah in a black wig. She takes Steven's arm and insists that they discuss the changes over a nice, expensive lunch, which she expects him to pay for. Steven frantically tries to comprehend what is happening.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Actor\n!Role\n|-\n|[[Albert Brooks]]\n|Steven Phillips\n|-\n|[[Sharon Stone]]\n|Sarah Little\n|-\n|[[Andie MacDowell]]\n|Laura Phillips\n|-\n|[[Jeff Bridges]]\n|Jack Warrick\n|-\n|[[Mark Feuerstein]]\n|Josh Martin\n|-\n|[[Bradley Whitford]]\n|Hal\n|-\n|[[Steven Wright]]\n|Stan Spielberg\n|-\n|[[Jennifer Tilly]]\n|herself\n|-\n|[[Rob Reiner]]\n|himself\n|-\n|[[Wolfgang Puck]]\n|himself\n|-\n|[[James Cameron]]\n|himself\n|-\n|[[Martin Scorsese]]\n|himself\n|-\n|[[Lorenzo Lamas]]\n|himself\n|}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|The Muse (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pop rock]] musician [[Elton John]] composed the soundtrack for ''The Muse''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Muse'' was a slight box office flop, grossing about $11 million domestically on an estimated budget of $15 million.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Muse|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0164108/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> It did relatively poorly at the box office compared to some of Brooks' other films, such as ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' (1991), which made $16 million,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Defending Your Life|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0101698/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> and ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'' (1996), which made $19 million.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mother|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2959443457/weekend/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> Most complained that the problem was Brooks' lacking energy in his direction of the film.
