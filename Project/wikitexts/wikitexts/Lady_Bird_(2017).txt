She gives herself the name \"Lady Bird\" and longs to attend a prestigious college in \"a city with culture\" somewhere on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], despite her family's financial struggles. Her mother, Marion, often tells her that she is ungrateful for what she has; Marion's criticism even, at one point, impels Christine to jump from a moving car, breaking her own arm. Christine and her best friend, Julianne \"Julie\" Steffans, join their school theater program, where Christine develops a crush on Daniel \"Danny\" O'Neill, who attends Xavier, the boys' school. This grows into a romantic relationship, and Christine disappoints Marion by spending her last Thanksgiving before graduation with Danny's wealthy family instead of her own. After the opening night of their school production of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', Christine and Danny break up when she catches him kissing a boy in a bathroom stall.\n\nAt Marion's behest, Christine takes a job at a coffee shop; there, she meets Kyle Scheible, a cool student at the boys' school, and they become involved. Christine abandons Julie and ditches tryouts for the new play to bond with Jenna Walton, a popular girl, and they vandalize a nun's car. She finds out the cool place to hang out, \"the Deuce\", is actually a parking lot. As she grows closer to Kyle and Jenna, Christine gradually deserts Julie and drops out of the theater program altogether. She consoles Danny one day when he tearfully expresses his fear to [[Coming out|come out]], and they become friends again.\n\nAt a house party, Christine and Kyle kiss, and he claims to be a virgin. She later loses her virginity to Kyle, but he reveals that in fact he had intercourse before. This upsets Christine and prompts her to seek comfort from her mother. After Christine is suspended from school for speaking up scornfully at an [[anti-abortion]] assembly, Jenna tries to visit her at home, only to discover that Christine had claimed Danny's grandmother's house as hers in order to impress her. Christine admits to the lie and Jenna agrees to forgive her because of their mutual friendship with Kyle, although their friendship begins to grow strained.\n\nChristine learns that her father, Larry, has been out of a job and battling depression for years. She applies to east coast colleges, despite her mother's insistence that their family cannot afford the fees, with the help of her father, who fills out her financial aid applications without Marion knowing. Christine is accepted at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] but is upset because she feels it is too close to home. Learning she is on the wait list for a university in New York City, she does not share the news with Marion, fearing her response. Christine sets out for her prom with Kyle, Jenna and Jenna's boyfriend, but the other three decide to go to a house party instead. Christine agrees at first, but then changes her mind and says she actually does want to go to the prom. Christine asks them to drop her off at Julie's, where the two rekindle their friendship and go to the prom together.\n\nAfter graduation, Danny accidentally reveals Christine's place on a college wait list in front of Marion, who stops speaking to her daughter for the rest of the summer. Larry shares a cupcake with Christine on her eighteenth birthday, and she celebrates reaching the age of majority by buying a pack of cigarettes, a [[Scratchcard|scratch-off lottery ticket]], and an issue of ''[[Playgirl]]'' magazine. Christine learns she has been accepted at the New York school and can afford tuition with financial aid and her father's help. Her parents take her to the [[Sacramento International Airport|airport]], but Marion refuses to go inside to say goodbye. She starts crying while leaving the airport and drives back, only to discover Christine has already gone through security. She cries in Larry's arms, who consoles her that their daughter \"will come back\".\n\nArriving in New York, Christine finds in her luggage several letters which were written and originally discarded by her mother, but secretly collected and passed along by her father. She begins using her given name again and is hospitalized after drinking heavily at a party. Leaving the hospital, she visits a [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] church service and is moved to tears. She calls home and leaves an apologetic voicemail message for her mother, thanking her for everything she has done for her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Christine \"Lady Bird\"{{efn|The nickname does not derive from former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Lady Bird Johnson]], but the [[Mother Goose]] nursery rhyme [[Ladybird Ladybird]].<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=564579012|title=Greta Gerwig Explores Mother-Daughter Love (And Angst) In 'Lady Bird'|access-date=November 26, 2017|date=November 16, 2017|first=Terry|last=Gross|website=[[NPR]]|archive-date=November 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124170603/https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=564579012|url-status=live}}</ref>}} McPherson\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Marion McPherson\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as Larry McPherson\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Daniel \"Danny\" O'Neill\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as Kyle Scheible\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Julianne \"Julie\" Steffans\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Sister Sarah Joan\n* [[Stephen McKinley Henderson]] as Father Leviatch\n* [[Odeya Rush]] as Jenna Walton\n* [[Jordan Rodrigues]] as Miguel McPherson\n* Marielle Scott as Shelly Yuhan\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Mr. Bruno\n* [[John Karna]] as Greg Anrue\n* Bayne Gibby as Casey Kelly\n* [[Laura Marano]] as Diana Greenway\n* [[Andy Buckley]] as Matt\n* [[Kathryn Newton]] as Darlene Bell\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nGerwig spent years writing the screenplay.
