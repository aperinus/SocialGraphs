The film's plot and characters are adapted from three novels in author [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], which includes 20 completed novels of [[Jack Aubrey]]'s naval career. The film stars [[Russell Crowe]] as Aubrey, captain in the [[Royal Navy]], and [[Paul Bettany]] as [[Stephen Maturin|Dr. Stephen Maturin]], the ship's surgeon. This is the second onscreen collaboration for Crowe and Bettany, both of whom previously co-starred in 2001\u2019s ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''.\n\nThe film was a personal project of Fox executive [[Tom Rothman]], who recruited Weir to helm the project. Filming took place on the open sea, on replica ships in the water tanks of [[Baja Studios]], and on the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. The film, which cost $150 million to make, was a co-production of [[20th Century Fox]], [[Miramax Films]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], and [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]], and released on November 14, 2003. It was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $212 million worldwide.\n\nThe film was critically well received and garnered Weir the [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]]. At the [[76th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. It won [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], but the rest of the categories were swept by ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. In June 2021, a [[prequel]] film was announced to be in active development.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Captain [[Jack Aubrey]] of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] [[HMS Surprise (O'Brian novels)|''Surprise'']] is ordered to intercept the [[heavy frigate]] ''Acheron'', a French [[privateer]]. ''Acheron'' ambushes ''Surprise'' off the coast of Brazil, causing heavy damage while remaining undamaged by the British guns. The ship's boats tow ''Surprise'' into a fog bank to evade pursuit. Aubrey's officers tell him that ''Surprise'' is no match for ''Acheron'', and that they should abandon the chase. Aubrey responds that ''Acheron'' must not be allowed to plunder the British whaling fleet and orders ''Surprise'' refitted at sea, rather than a lengthy return to port for repairs. Midshipman Blakeney has his arm amputated due to injuries sustained in battle. Shortly afterward, ''Acheron'' again ambushes ''Surprise'', but Aubrey slips away in the night by using a decoy raft and ship's lamps.\n\nFollowing the privateer south, ''Surprise'' rounds [[Cape Horn]] and heads to the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], where Aubrey is convinced that ''Acheron'' will prey on Britain's whaling fleet. The ship's surgeon, [[Stephen Maturin]], is interested in the islands' unique flora and fauna, and Aubrey promises his friend several days' exploration time. However, when ''Surprise'' reaches the Gal\u00e1pagos, they recover the survivors of a whaling ship destroyed by ''Acheron''. Aubrey hastily pursues the privateer, dashing Maturin's expectation of more time to explore.\n\n''Surprise'' is becalmed for several days. The crew becomes restless and disorderly, and superstition begins to take hold among them. Midshipman Hollom, already unpopular with the crew, is named a \"[[Jonah#Cultural influence|Jonah]]\" by the sailors (someone who brings bad luck to a ship). As the tension rises, crew member Nagle deliberately bumps shoulders with Hollom as he passes him on the deck and is flogged for insubordination. That night, Hollom commits suicide by jumping overboard with a cannonball; Aubrey holds a service for Hollom the next morning. The wind picks up again, and ''Surprise'' resumes the chase.\n\nThe next day, Royal Marine officer Captain Howard attempts to shoot an [[waved albatross|albatross]] but accidentally hits Maturin instead. The surgeon's mate informs Aubrey that unless the bullet and a piece of cloth it took with it are removed soon, they will fester. He also recommends the delicate operation be performed on land. Despite closing on ''Acheron'', Aubrey takes the doctor back to the Gal\u00e1pagos. Maturin performs [[Self-surgery|surgery on himself]] using a mirror. Finally giving up the pursuit of the privateer, Aubrey grants Maturin the chance to explore the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and gather specimens before they head for home. While looking for a species of [[flightless cormorant]], the doctor discovers ''Acheron'' on the other side of the island. Maturin abandons most of his specimens and hurries to warn Aubrey. ''Surprise'' readies for battle once more. Due to ''Acheron''{{'}}s stronger hull, ''Surprise'' must be at close quarters to damage her. After observing the [[camouflage]] ability of one of Maturin's specimens, Aubrey disguises ''Surprise'' as a whaling ship; he hopes the French will be lured in to capture the valuable ship rather than destroy it. ''Acheron'' falls for the disguise, and ''Surprise'' launches her attack. With the back wheels of the cannons taken off, the cannons are angled upward and fire upon ''Acheron''{{'}}s mainmast while Captain Howard's Marine sharpshooters pick off the crew of ''Acheron'' from above. ''Acheron'' is disabled when the mainmast snaps and falls into the sea. Aubrey leads boarding parties, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Upon capturing the ship, Aubrey is informed by the ship's doctor that the French captain is dead and is given the Captain's sword.\n\n''Acheron'' and ''Surprise'' are repaired and ''Surprise'' remains in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Pullings is promoted to captain and ordered to sail the captured ''Acheron'' to [[Valpara\u00edso]]. As ''Acheron'' sails away, Maturin mentions that their doctor had died months ago. Realising the French captain deceived him by pretending to be the ship's doctor, Aubrey gives the order to change course to intercept ''Acheron'' and escort her to Valpara\u00edso, and for the crew to assume battle stations. Maturin is again denied the chance to explore the Gal\u00e1pagos, but Aubrey wryly notes that since the bird he seeks is flightless, \"it's not going anywhere.\" The two then play ''[[Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid]]'' by [[Luigi Boccherini]] as ''Surprise'' turns in pursuit of ''Acheron'' once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n | direction = horizontal\n | alt footer= Head shots of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany|footer = [[Russell Crowe]] in 2013 (left) and [[Paul Bettany]] in 2014\n | image1 = Russell Crowe.jpg\n | image2 = Paul Bettany SDCC 2014.jpg\n }}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Jack Aubrey]]<ref name=\"french\" />\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as [[Stephen Maturin]], [[Ship's doctor#Royal Navy|Surgeon]]<ref name=\"french\"/>\n* [[James D'Arcy]] as First Lieutenant [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Thomas Pullings]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=James D'Arcy |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/james_darcy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124170811/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/james_darcy |archive-date=January 24, 2021 |access-date=March 1, 2021 |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n* Edward Woodall as Second Lieutenant [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|William Mowett]]\n* [[Chris Larkin]] as [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Howard, [[Royal Marines]]\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as John Allen, [[Master (naval)|Master]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Robert Pugh |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/onshow/onscreen/pages/robertpugh.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613140002/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/onshow/onscreen/pages/robertpugh.shtml |archive-date=June 13, 2016 |access-date=March 1, 2021 |website=BBC}}</ref>\n* [[Max Benitz]] as [[Midshipman]]/Acting Third Lieutenant Peter Myles Calamy\n* [[Max Pirkis]] as Midshipman Lord William Blakeney\n* [[Lee Ingleby]] as Midshipman Hollom\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as Mr. Higgins, [[Surgeon's Mate]]\n* [[Ian Mercer]] as Mr. Hollar, [[Boatswain]]\n* [[Tony Dolan]] as Mr. Lamb, [[Carpenter]]\n* [[David Threlfall]] as [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Preserved Killick]], [[Chief steward|Captain's Steward]]\n* [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] as [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Barrett Bonden]], [[Coxswain]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moore |first=Roger |date=November 8, 2003 |title=Crowe Isn't Playing \u2014 He Owns Jack Aubrey |work=Orlando Sentinel |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2003-11-08-0311070496-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427220455/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/ |archive-date=April 27, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Bryan Dick]] as Joseph Nagle, Carpenter's Mate\n* [[Joseph Morgan (actor)|Joseph Morgan]] as William Warley, Captain of the [[Top (sailing ship)|Mizzentop]]\n* [[George Innes]] as [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Joe Plaice]], [[Able Seaman]]\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Awkward Davies]], Able Seaman\n* [[John DeSantis]] as [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Shipmates|Padeen Colman]], [[Loblolly boy|Loblolly Boy]]\n* [[Mark Lewis Jones]] as Mr. Hogg, Master of the [[Whaler]] ''Albatross''\n{{div col end}}\nIn trying to find men who looked as though they were from the 19th century, Weir recruited many extras from [[Poland]].<ref name=\"wrap\"/> [[Philip French]] noted that the casting of Crowe, an Australian, as a British naval hero followed a tradition in film (e.g. [[Errol Flynn]] as Geoffrey Thorpe in ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'', [[Peter Finch]] as [[Lord Nelson]] in ''[[Bequest to the Nation (film)|Bequest to the Nation]]'', and [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Fletcher Christian]] in ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'').<ref name=\"french\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Source material===\n{{main|Aubrey\u2013Maturin series}}\n[[File:Patrick45.jpg|thumb|The film was adapted from the [[Aubrey-Maturin series|Aubrey-Maturin novels]] written by [[Patrick O'Brian]] (pictured).]]\nThe film is drawn from the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series|Aubrey\u2013Maturin novels]] by [[Patrick O'Brian]], but matches the events in no one novel.

Their interaction takes on a preening quality, reminiscent of the interaction of the '[[Star Trek]]' characters four or five movies down the line. We come to realize that the specific adventure matters little except as a showcase for these personalities. Once that happens, the story involving the French ship loses much of its interest and all of its danger, and the movie starts taking on water.
