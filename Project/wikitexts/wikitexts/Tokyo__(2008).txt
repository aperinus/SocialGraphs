[[Michel Gondry]] directed \"Interior Design\", [[Leos Carax]] directed \"Merde\", and [[Bong Joon-ho]] directed \"Shaking Tokyo\".\n\n== Plot ==\n=== \"Interior Design\" ===\nDirected by [[Michel Gondry]].  It is an adaptation of the short story comic \"Cecil and Jordan in New York\" by [[Gabrielle Bell]].\n\nHiroko ([[Ayako Fujitani]]) and Akira ([[Ry\u014d Kase]]) are a young couple from the provinces staying in Tokyo with limited funds and short-term lodging. They appear to have a solid and mutually supportive relationship that will seemingly carry each other through any challenge. Akira is an aspiring filmmaker whose debut feature will soon screen in the city, and hopefully lead to a more solid career; in the interim, he works wrapping gifts at a local department store. The couple manage to secure short-term housing in a cramped studio apartment of a friend, Akemi ([[Ayumi Ito]]). Akemi's boyfriend grows weary of Akemi's house guests leading Hiroko to search for a new apartment. Hiroko only finds unsuitable housing, which she nor Akira can afford. After Akira's film screens to dubious acclaim, one spectator informs Hiroko of the inherent struggles in relationships between creative types: often, one half of the couple would feel invisible, useless, or unappreciated. Hiroko relates to these feelings wholeheartedly in the wake of her numerous trials and tribulations in the unfamiliar city of Tokyo, and starts to question her role in the relationship. Hiroko wakes up one morning and sees a small hole where light is going through her. When she goes to the bathroom and unbuttons her shirt, she's shocked to see a hand sized hole in her chest with a wooden pole down the middle. As she walks down the street, the hole gets bigger and stumbling as both her feet turn to wooden poles. Eventually Hiroko is turned into a chair, with only her jacket left hanging on the back. People walking past are unmindful of the chair's presence.\n\n=== \"Merde\" ===\nDirected by [[L\u00e9os Carax]].\n\nMerde (French for \"shit\") is the name given to an unkempt, gibberish-spewing subterranean creature of the Tokyo sewers (played by [[Denis Lavant]]), who rises from the underground lair where he dwells to attack unsuspecting locals in increasingly brazen and terrifying ways. He steals cash and cigarettes from passers-by, frightens old women and sexually assaults schoolgirls, resulting in a televised media frenzy that creates mounting hysteria among the Tokyo populace. After discovering an arsenal of hand grenades in his underground lair, Merde goes on a rampage hurling the munitions at random citizens, which the media promptly cover.  French magistrate Ma\u00eetre Voland ([[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Balmer]]), who arrives in Tokyo to represent Merde's inevitable televised trial, claiming to be one of only three in the world able to speak his client's unintelligible language. The media circus mounts as lawyer defends client in a surreal court of law hungry for a satisfying resolution. Merde is tried, convicted and sentenced to death, until justice takes an unexpected turn.\n\n=== \"Shaking Tokyo\" ===\nDirected by [[Bong Joon-ho]].\n\n[[Teruyuki Kagawa]] stars as a Tokyo shut-in, or [[hikikomori]] (Japanese:\u5f15\u304d\u3053\u3082\u308a), who has not left his apartment in a decade. His only link to the outside world is through his telephone, which he uses to take advantage of delivery services, such as the pizza that he orders every Saturday, resulting in hundreds of pizza cartons stacked throughout his room. One day his pizza is delivered by a lovely young woman ([[Y\u016b Aoi]]) who succeeds in catching the shut-in's eye. Suddenly an earthquake strikes Tokyo, prompting the delivery woman to faint in the hikikomori's apartment and causing him to fall hopelessly in love. Time passes and the shut-in discovers through another pizza delivery person that the improbable object of his affections has become a hikikomori in her own right. Taking a bold leap into the unknown, he crosses the threshold of his apartment and takes to the streets in search of the girl, eventually discovering his kindred spirit at the very moment another earthquake strikes.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== \"Interior Design\" ===\n* [[Ayako Fujitani]] as Hiroko\n* [[Ry\u014d Kase]] as Akira\n* [[Ayumi Ito]] as Akemi\n* [[Satoshi Tsumabuki]] as Takeshi\n\n=== \"Merde\" ===\n* [[Denis Lavant]] as Mr Merde\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Balmer]] as Mr Voland, the lawyer\n* [[Julie Dreyfus]] as The interpreter\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]]\n\n=== \"Shaking Tokyo\" ===\n* [[Teruyuki Kagawa]] as the Hikikomori\n* [[Y\u016b Aoi]] as the Pizza delivery girl\n* [[Naoto Takenaka]] as the Pizza store manager\n\n== Music ==\nDuring the credits [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|HASYMO's]] single \"Tokyo Town Pages\" plays.
