The duo conceived the original script as an [[exploitation film]] designed to break the duo into the film industry, but it went unproduced.<ref name=WashingtonPost/> The concept was subsequently revisited to serve as the second film in a proposed ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' [[film trilogy]] greenlit by [[Universal Pictures]] following the success of the first film spinoff of the [[HBO]] series, ''[[Demon Knight]]'' (1995).<ref name=ComingSoon/> Miller and Everhart were suggested for the cast by executive producer [[Joel Silver]], though Adler and Katz wanted other actors to play the parts.\n\nFilming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, where the production was troubled by limited night time and continuity issues due to Miller's constant improvisation and refusal to show up on set.

Vincent takes out a box containing the four sections of her heart and inserts it in her body, reviving her. Lilith awakens and kills the other treasure hunters, but Vincent subdues her with the key from ''[[Demon Knight]]''.\n\nAfter fighting with his sister Katherine, Caleb Verdoux goes to a dive bar, where an odd man named Jenkins tells him of a [[brothel]] hidden in a [[funeral home]]. Caleb and his friend Reggie visit the address, where they are forced at gunpoint by mortician McCutcheon to climb into a coffin leading to said brothel, unaware the prostitutes are all vampires led by Lilith. A prostitute named Tallulah seduces Reggie, whom Lilith kills before vampirizing Caleb.\n\nWhen the police fail to find Caleb, Katherine reluctantly hires cynical and sarcastic private investigator Rafe Guttman, who tracks Caleb's trail to the bar, where Caleb's friends direct him to the funeral home. After a tip from Jenkins, Rafe revisits the funeral home that night. Initially, it appears as just a funeral home. Rafe overhears Lilith interview a woman, Tamara, followed by Tamara's scream and a body hitting the floor. He finds Caleb's nose ring and escapes. The next day he takes it to Katherine and tells her he's going to stake out the funeral home that evening. Unbeknownst to Rafe, the funeral home conceals a corrupt organization run by Reverend J.C. Current.\n\nRafe is admitted into the brothel and approached by the now-vampirized Tamara, whom he tricks into letting him strap her to a torture rack so he can investigate further, finding Jenkins decapitated in a coffin. While fleeing, Rafe drops his wallet, allowing Lilith to find his address. Having tasted Rafe's blood, Lilith takes an interest and tries to seduce him. When Katherine arrives, Rafe follows and describes the brothel's activity to her. They alert the police, who dismiss Rafe as a fraud due to lack of evidence. Meanwhile, Vincent destroys the key, freeing Lilith.\n\nAs Katherine reviews footage where she confronted Lilith, she notices Lilith is not in the shot. Realizing that Rafe might be right, she calls him over. Caleb calls for help, asking them to meet him at the power plant. Upon arrival, they discover the vampirized Caleb and flee, but Rafe falls out a window, landing on the police chief's car. The vampires catch Katherine and return her to the brothel.\n\nAwakening in a hospital, Rafe is nearly killed by Tamara, who is posing as a nurse, but exposes her to sunlight, killing her. Katherine awakens and begs Caleb to free her, who refuses, too ingrained as Lilith's servant and having fully embraced his newfound vampiric lifestyle. Lilith prepares to feed on Katherine while Caleb watches. Rafe loads up on [[Super Soaker]]s filled with [[holy water]] and raids the brothel, killing Vincent and McCutcheon. He meets up with Current, who, having realized his error and attempting to rectify it, has brought stakes and mallets to kill the vampires. Current tells Rafe that Lilith's heart must be removed from her body and quartered, as before she was found. Rafe gives him a spare water gun and the two enter the brothel and spray the vampires, including Caleb and Tallulah, who burn and explode.\n\nThey find Lilith, who mortally wounds Current and flees after Rafe attacks her with an axe. Rafe finds Katherine, and they head to Current's church to reveal the existence of vampires with its media equipment. Lilith returns, handcuffs Rafe to a railing, and attacks Katherine. Rafe uses a nearby laser to hit Lilith in the heart, quartering it. However, as the pieces remain in her body, Lilith remains alive. As Lilith devolves into a hideous form (her true form) and attacks Rafe, Katherine grabs a candle stand and stabs out Lilith's heart. After Lilith's body burns and collapses to the ground, the two burn her remains and lock away the box with the heart pieces.\n\nLater, in his car, Rafe fondles Katherine, which she seems oddly more accepting of now, having been disgusted by him earlier. They have sex in the car. He notices the scent she's wearing. She remarks, \"It's not perfume. It's sunblock.\" When he pulls back her skirt, he notices bite-marks on her thigh, indicating that Katherine had been vampirized by Lilith while hostage. She then flashes her fangs and bites Rafe in the neck.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Main cast'''\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dennis Miller]] as Rafe Guttman\n* [[Erika Eleniak]] as Katherine Verdoux\n* [[Angie Everhart]] as Lilith\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Reverend J.C.

Silver had recently produced a movie with a [[supermodel]] in a leading role, and while Everhart, whose only previous performance was a minor role in ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', was not a trained actress, Silver thought \"supermodel actresses\" was \"the next big thing\".

Eleniak had left ''[[Baywatch]]'' because she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress, and allegedly did not want to play the character of Katherine as previously written. Katz claimed Katherine was scripted as being a [[stripper]], and Adler and Katz frantically rewrote the script and changed these aspects of the character so she would travel to the set. However, Eleniak disputes this claim, saying that her argument with the producers was due to [[Joel Silver]] wanting to add a \"sexy\" scene between her and Everhart which had not been in the script, and that changes had been made to the script based on Eleniak's casting to make her character \"sexier\".<ref name=TaintedBlood2/> Eleniak expressed disappointment that due to rewrites, the backstory of Katherine having a past as a 300lb ex-[[pornographic film|porn]] star named Chubbie O'Toole was removed from the film.
