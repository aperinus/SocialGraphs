The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat (played by [[Takashi Shimura]]) and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s 1886 novella ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''.\n\nThe major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of [[bureaucracy]], and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. ''Ikiru'' has received widespread critical acclaim, and won awards for Best Film at the [[Kinema Junpo]] and [[Mainichi Film Awards]]. It was remade as a television film in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nKanji Watanabe has worked in the same monotonous [[bureaucrat]]ic position for thirty years and is near his retirement. His wife is dead and his son and daughter-in-law, who live with him, seem to care mainly about Watanabe's pension and their future inheritance. At work, he's a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents are seemingly endlessly referred to one department after another when they want a cesspool cleared out and replaced by a [[playground]]. After learning he has [[stomach cancer]] and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer, but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyo's nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings \"[[Gondola no Uta]]\" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. After one night submerged in the nightlife, he realizes this is not the solution.\n\nThe following day, Watanabe encounters a young female subordinate, Toyo, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm and tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows weary of him. After convincing her to join him for the last time, he opens up and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know, but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel like she is playing with all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realizes that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and begins pushing for a playground despite concerns he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments.\n\nWatanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, and try to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realize that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denies this, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that in the last few moments in Watanabe's life, he sat on the swing at the park he built. As the snow fell, he sang \"Gondola no Uta\". The bureaucrats vow to live their lives with the same dedication and passion as he did. But back at work, they lack the courage of their newfound conviction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Takashi Shimura]] and [[Haruo Tanaka]] have starring roles.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Shimura Takashi.JPG\n | width1    = 154\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Tanaka Haruo.JPG\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      = \n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Kanji Watanabe\n* [[Shinichi Himori]] as Kimura\n* [[Haruo Tanaka]] as Sakai\n* [[Minoru Chiaki]] as Noguchi\n* [[Bokuzen Hidari]] as Ohara\n* Miki Odagiri as Toyo Odagiri, employee\n* [[Kamatari Fujiwara]] as Sub-Section Chief \u014cno\n* [[Nobuo Nakamura]] as Deputy Mayor\n* [[Y\u016bnosuke It\u014d]] as Novelist\n* Minosuke Yamada as Subordinate Clerk Saito\n* Makoto Kobori as Kiichi Watanabe, Kanji's Brother\n* [[Nobuo Kaneko]] as Mitsuo Watanabe, Kanji's son\n* [[Atsushi Watanabe (actor, born 1898)|Atsushi Watanabe]] as Patient\n* [[Noriko Honma]] as Housewife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Living===\nDeath is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe's quest to find the meaning of life.<ref name=\"Sesonske\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/839-ikiru |title=Ikiru |last=Sesonske |first=Alexander |date=19 November 1990 |access-date=19 December 2016 |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |archive-date=4 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604125327/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/839-ikiru |url-status=live }}</ref> Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song \"[[Gondola no Uta]]\" as an expression of loss.{{sfn|Thomas|2011}} Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes \"pleasure is not life,\" and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" symbolizing his rebirth.<ref name=\"Sesonske\"/> Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and is presented as the \"unlikely savior\" in Watanabe's \"redemption.\"{{sfn|Thomas|2011}}\n\nAuthor [[Donald Richie]] wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply \"to live,\" could signify that \"existence is enough.\" However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and takes this as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile.
