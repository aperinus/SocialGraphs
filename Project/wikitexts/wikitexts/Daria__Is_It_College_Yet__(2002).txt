The film was the second film-length installment of [[MTV]]'s animated series ''[[Daria]]'', after 2000's ''[[Is It Fall Yet?|Is it Fall Yet?]],'' and served as the [[series finale]], chronicling the end of high school as the characters prepare for college.<ref>{{cite news|title= Is It College Yet?\n|work= DVD Talk|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4556/daria-is-it-college-yet/|access-date=2010-05-13}}</ref>\n\n''Is It College Yet?'' was produced in lieu of an abbreviated, six-episode sixth season requested by MTV.

Her boyfriend Tom Sloane also applies to Bromwell, where his family have [[Legacy preferences|legacy status]]. Tom's mother agrees to drive them to tour Bromwell in fictional Newtown, followed by Raft in [[Boston]]. At Bromwell, Tom charms the admission officer with stories about his family's experiences there, while a nervous Daria fumbles her interview. To Daria's dismay, they arrive at Raft after the admission office has closed. Daria is accepted by Raft, but [[wait list]]ed by Bromwell. Tom gets into Bromwell and offers to have his parents write Daria a letter of recommendation, but she declines.\n\nJane wants to attend Boston Fine Arts College, but is overwhelmed with creating a portfolio. After being rejected by several less demanding colleges, she considers skipping college entirely. Her older brother Trent encourages this idea, but Daria talks her into sending a portfolio to BFAC, and Jane is accepted. Trent initially calls her a sell out, but finally admits he's going to miss her. Jane points out he'll have lots of chances to play gigs in Boston and sleep on her floor.\n\nDaria accepts Tom's parents recommendation to Bromwell, but is ultimately rejected anyway. She breaks up with Tom, explaining that their lives are diverging and the relationship has run its course.\n\nJodie, exhausted from being the [[model minority]] student at Lawndale, wants to attend [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]] Turner College, while her parents expect her to attend the exclusive Crestmore University. Jodie is accepted by both, but doesn't believe she can attend Turner if her parents don't accept her decision. Mack contacts Jodie's father to explain her distress, leading to her parents changing their minds. Mack is accepted to Vance College on scholarship. While they will be geographically separated, Jodie is convinced this experience has brought them closer.\n\nBrittney is accepted to local Prairie State University, but boyfriend Kevin will need to repeat his senior year due to abysmal grades. Embarrassed, Kevin tries to hide this from Brittney before coming clean, and asks if she'll stay with him through college. Brittney promises she will, while secretly [[Crossed fingers|crossing her fingers]].\n\nDaria's younger sister, Quinn, gets her first job as a restaurant hostess and befriends an older coworker named Lindy. Quinn's work causes her to miss several Fashion Club meetings, and the clique drifts apart; after club president Sandi is rude to her, Stacey secret wishes that Sandi would \"just shut up\" and feels guilty when Sandi suffers a vocal chord injury that causes her to lose her voice. Quinn notices Lindy has a drinking problem, which culminates with Lindy arriving at work drunk and getting fired. Quinn implores her to seek help, but Lindy angrily denies Quinn's assertions. Lindy later apologizes, but still insists she's not an alcoholic. At an end of year party, after Sandi tries to punish Stacey for her bad thoughts, Stacey bluntly says she'd rather take a \"sabbatical\" like Quinn did for her job, and Tiffany joins in, followed by Sandi in an attempt to save face. The group then agrees to hang out as friends without the club banner.\n\nAt graduation, Daria wins an academic award and improvises a speech in which she reiterates her contempt for high school, but ends with a summation of her life philosophy and expresses gratitude for Jane and her family, drawing applause from the crowd. Afterwards, Daria and Jane meet for pizza as usual, and muse on what they'll find once they arrive at college and begin a new era in their lives.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe first music video for \"[[Breaking Up the Girl]]\" by [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] premiered as part of the film, featuring a ''Daria'' montage, and the song was promoted as the \"theme song\" for ''College'';<ref>[http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y296/boylikearose/Garbage%20Memorabilia%202008-2011/BreakinguptheGirlUSAHitstradeadDecember2001.jpg Breaking Up the Girl (trade ad)] in USA: Hits magazine. 2001-12-01.</ref> the song used during the title sequence of the film was [[Splendora]]'s last-ever song \"College Try (Gives Me Blisters)\".\n\n==Alternate version==\nAn edited version of this TV-movie was cablecast by MTV in reruns, which cut several minutes from the original broadcast version. A VHS was distributed in 2002 by MTV Home Video/ Paramount. Both DVD releases (the original single-disc release and the ''Complete Animated Series'' release) include the edited version.
