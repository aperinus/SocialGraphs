This was the second film to be based on the [[children's television series]] ''[[Sesame Street]]'', after ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird]]'' (1985). It stars [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Vanessa Williams]] alongside [[The Muppets|Muppet]] performers [[Kevin Clash]], [[Jerry Nelson]], [[Frank Oz]], and [[Steve Whitmire]].\n\nProduced by [[Jim Henson Pictures]] and [[Children's Television Workshop]], the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on October 1, 1999.<ref name=AFI /> The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $12 million against a budget of more than $26 million.\n\nThe film was one of the few ''Sesame Street'' productions directly produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Alongside ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (which was released the same year), this was the final Muppet feature film to involve Oz, who retired from being a full-time puppeteer the following year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=How Kermit and the Muppets Got Their Mojo Back|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/the-muppets-talk-about-comebacks-and-their-relationship-with-disney-1201128921/|access-date=26 July 2018|newspaper=Variety|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> This was also the final theatrical Muppet film to feature [[Caroll Spinney]] before his retirement in 2018 and his death in 2019, and the final ''Sesame Street'' film to feature [[Emilio Delgado]] before his death in 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\nOne day [[Elmo]] plays with his blanket in his bedroom. He spills [[orange juice]] on his blanket and takes it to the [[laundromat]] where he runs into his friend [[List of Sesame Street Muppets#Z|Zoe]]. Zoe wants to hold the blanket, but Elmo doesn\u2019t consent to share it resulting in a [[tug of war]] that causes it to rip. And then, [[List of Sesame Street Muppets#T|Telly Monster]], rollerskating out of control, comes and accidentally swipes the blanket leading to a chase around Sesame Street. The blanket falls into the hands of [[Oscar the Grouch]], who sneezes on it and drops it in his [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouch's Trash Can|trash can]]. Elmo dives into the bottom of Oscar's trash can, where he finds his blanket snagged on a door.\n\nAttempting to retrieve it, he and his blanket are then teleported through a colorful swirling tunnel to Grouchland, a city filled with 1000 Grouches, trash, and Huxley, a greedy man who loves to steal anything he comes across, including Elmo's blanket. A kind Grouch girl named Grizzy tells Elmo that his blanket is in Huxley's house at the top of the faraway Mount Pickanose. A plant named Stuckweed encourages Elmo that he will make it if he just takes his first step, so Elmo sets out on a quest to retrieve his blanket.\n\nWith Oscar the Grouch's help, the Sesame Street residents go to Grouchland to find Elmo, but when they encounter a Grouch [[police officer]] for help, they end up arrested as they are informed that it is against the law to ask for help in Grouchland.\n\nHuxley has his sidekick, Bug the bug and his minions, the Pesties, trap Elmo in a tunnel. Elmo gets out with the help of fireflies. Huxley then has Bug and the Pesties misdirect Elmo into a [[Landfill|garbage dump]] where he is brought before the Queen of Trash for trespassing. The Queen tests him, requesting that he blows 100 raspberries for her in 30 seconds. Elmo succeeds with some help from the audience and the Queen allows him to pass through. Huxley sends in a huge pet [[chicken]] to stop Elmo, who tosses Elmo far away. Elmo decides to give up on retrieving his blanket for the night. Meanwhile, Grizzy sneaks into the jail where she informs Elmo's friends that he has decided to travel all the way to Huxley's castle on top of Mount Pickanose. After finally admitting that Elmo is his friend, Oscar convinces all the Grouches to cooperate, but just this once, since it is the only way they can stop Huxley from stealing any more of their trash. The police officer decides to release the Sesame Street residents and the Grouches so that they can go to Huxley's castle to fight for their trash and rescue Elmo.\n\nEarly the next morning, A [[caterpillar]] wakes Elmo up. He convinces Elmo that he has what it takes to be brave. Elmo then arrives at Huxley's castle and rescues his blanket as Huxley sends the Pesties to stop him. But Elmo falls into a basket as Huxley decides to make him and his blanket both his property by using a claw to put them on his conveyor stamper. The Sesame Street and Grouchland citizens arrive and the Pesties flee in panic. Huxley tries to escape with Elmo's blanket only to have Elmo's blanket sucked up with the vacuum cleaner nozzle on his helicopter. Elmo launches a basket over Huxley's shoulders, incapacitating him. Bug is revealed to be at the controls of the helicopter, and refuses Huxley's demand for the blanket, instead returning it to Elmo. Elmo returns to Sesame Street with his friends, where he apologizes to Zoe and allows her to hold his blanket. She accepts his apology, agreeing that they can resume their friendship. Then, Elmo says goodbye to the audience and thanks them for helping and goes to dance with his friends.\n\nThroughout the movie, both [[Bert and Ernie]] serve as hosts, and interrupt the film at certain points to explain things to the audience.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Muppet performers ===\n{{main|List of Sesame Street Muppets}}\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as [[Elmo]], Pestie, Grouch Jailer and Grouch Cab Driver, Various Grouches\n* [[Fran Brill]] as [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], Pestie, [[Prairie Dawn]] and Grouches\n* [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] as Grizzy and Pestie\n* [[Dave Goelz]] as Humongous Chicken\n* [[Joey Mazzarino|Joseph Mazzarino]] as Bug, Grouch Chef\n* [[Jerry Nelson]] as [[Count von Count]], Pestie, Grouch Mayor, Grouch Cop and Mr. Johnson\n* [[Carmen Osbahr]] as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] \n* [[Martin P.

The regular puppets were used for the normal Sesame Street characters, and puppets for assorted Grouches (including Grizzy) were designed and built by Mark Zezsotek. Paul Andrejco, Muppet designer for [[Bear in the Big Blue House]], also designed Humungous Chicken. [[Sonia Manzano]] reprised her role as Maria and [[Roscoe Orman]] reprised his role as Gordon. [[Vanessa Williams]] was cast as the Queen of Trash and the hairstylist colored her hair green for the role. [[Mandy Patinkin]] was a last-minute replacement for the original actor hired to play Huxley. For the role, the makeup artist designed false [[eyebrows]] for Patinkin to wear to make him seem like he had bushier eyebrows than normal.\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot over a 30-day period (starting May 26, 1998) at the [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studio in Wilmington.<ref>{{Cite web|archive-date=1999-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991129011234/http://www.elmoingrouchland.com/frame_story.html|title=Story|url=http://www.elmoingrouchland.com/frame_story.html|website=The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland|url-status=unfit|via=web.archive.org}}</ref> The set was raised so that puppeteers would be able to stand up instead of squatting below street level like usual. Filming wrapped and [[visual effects]] by D.Rez were added during the following month, and the Ernie and Bert scenes were later shot in New York in 1999, with [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] assisting [[Steve Whitmire]] in performing Ernie and [[Eric Jacobson]] assisting [[Frank Oz]] with Bert.\n\n=== Music ===\n==== Songs ====\n# \"Together Forever\" \u2013 Elmo, Blanket, Frazzle, Big Bird, Rosita, Prairie Dawn, Hoots The Owl, Count von Count, Baby Bear, Sock Quartet, Savin, Celina, Miles, Gabi, Gordon, Gina, Susan, Luis, Jamal, Angela, Bob  (Written by Michael Silversher and Patty Silversher; produced by Jeff Elmassian and [[Siedah Garrett]])\n# \"Welcome to Grouchland\" \u2013 The Grouchland Ensemble (Written by Martin Erskine and Seth Friedman; produced by Martin Erskine)\n# \"Take the First Step\" \u2013 Stuckweed (Written by Michael Reagan and Greg Matheson; produced by Jeff Elmassian and [[Siedah Garrett]])\n# \"Make It Mine\" \u2013 Mandy Patinkin, Fran Brill, Stephanie D\u2019Abruzzo, Kevin Clash, Ivy Austin (Written by Martin Erskine and Seth Friedman; produced by Martin Erskine)\n# \"I See a Kingdom\" \u2013 Vanessa Williams (Written by Siedah Garrett, Jeff Elmassian, and Andy Rehfeldt; produced by Jeff Elmassian and [[Siedah Garrett]])\n# '''\"Precious Wings\" \u2013 [[Tatyana Ali]] (Written by Siedah Garrett, Jeff Elmassian, and Andy Rehfeldt; produced by Keith Thomas)'''\n\n==== Soundtrack ====\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Sesame Street]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = [[1999 in music|1999]]\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack album|Soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Jim Henson Records|Jim Henson]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Sesame Street]]\n| prev_title = [[Elmo Saves Christmas]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[CinderElmo]]\n| next_year  = 2000\n}}\nThis album, released in 1999, is the soundtrack to ''The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland''.\n\nThis album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children in 2000.\n\n\"Make It Mine\" is excluded from the soundtrack.\n\n===== Track list =====\n# \"Together Forever\"\n# \"Welcome to Grouchland\"\n# \"Take the First Step\"\n# \"I See a Kingdom\" - [[Vanessa Williams]]\n# \"Precious Wings\" - [[Tatyana Ali]]\n# Elmo Tells His Grouchland Story (Spoken Word)\n# \"The Grouch Song\" - Elmo, Grizzy, Oscar the Grouch (Written by Jeff Moss)\n# \"There's a Big Heap of Trash at the End of the Rainbow\" - The Stenchmen (Written by [[Tony Geiss]])\n# \"[[I Love Trash]]\" - [[Steven Tyler]] \n# Little Butterfly Friend [[Elmo]]\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film has a rating of 77% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 6.72/10.
