The series  won the [[54th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and [[59th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] awards for best miniseries.\n\nThe series dramatizes the history of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|\"Easy\" Company]], 2nd Battalion, [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]] of the [[101st Airborne Division]], from jump training in the United States through its participation in [[European theater of World War II|major actions in Europe]], up until Japan's capitulation and the end of World War II. The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans.

Excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors are used as preludes to the episodes, but they are not identified by name until the end of the finale.\n\nThe title of the book and series comes from the [[St Crispin's Day Speech]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', delivered by [[Henry V of England|King Henry]] before the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by [[Carwood Lipton]] in the series finale.\n\n==Plot==\n''Band of Brothers'' is a dramatized account of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|\"Easy Company\"]] (part of the 2nd [[Battalion]], [[506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|506th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]), assigned to the [[United States Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]] during World War II. Over ten episodes the series details the company's exploits during the war. Starting with jump training at [[Camp Toccoa]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], ''Band of Brothers'' follows the unit through the [[American airborne landings in Normandy]], [[Operation Market Garden]], the [[Siege of Bastogne]], the invasion of Germany, including the liberation of a [[Kaufering concentration camp complex|concentration camp]], and on to the war's end. It includes the taking of the ''[[Kehlsteinhaus]]'' (Eagle's Nest) at Obersalzberg in Berchtesgaden and refers to the surrender of Japan. [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Richard Winters]] (1918\u20132011) is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company's missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.<ref name=\"BBCDrama\"/>\n\nAs the series is based on historic events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based. Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to them being sent home. Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the story's narrative.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was developed chiefly by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Erik Jendresen]], who spent months detailing the plot outline and individual episodes.<ref name=\"TV Notes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/02/arts/tv-notes-world-war-ii-the-mini-series.html |title=TV Notes: World War II, The Mini-Series |first=Lawrie |last=Mifflin |date=December 2, 1998 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116173025/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/02/arts/tv-notes-world-war-ii-the-mini-series.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Steven Spielberg]] served as \"the final eye\" and used ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', the film on which he and Hanks had collaborated, to inform the series, although Jendresen served as showrunner.<ref name=\"Private Ryan\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/arts/television-radio-learning-how-the-private-ryans-felt-and-fought.html |title=Television/Radio: Learning How the Private Ryans Felt and Fought |first=Kristin |last=Hohenadel |date=December 17, 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=August 24, 2008 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116173154/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/arts/television-radio-learning-how-the-private-ryans-felt-and-fought.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Grater |first1=Tom |title='Band Of Brothers' showrunner Erik Jendresen on US TV industry: 'the fear of failure is extraordinary' |url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/band-of-brothers-showrunner-on-us-tv-industry-the-fear-of-failure-is-extraordinary/5131712.article |access-date=24 August 2022 |work=Screen International |date=17 August 2018}}</ref> Accounts of Easy Company veterans, such as [[Donald Malarkey]], were incorporated into production to add historic detail.<ref name=\"Private Ryan\" />\n\n===Budget and promotion===\n[[File:Band of Brothers poster.jpg|thumb|Promotional poster for ''Band of Brothers'']]\n\n''Band of Brothers'' was at the time the most expensive TV miniseries to have been made by any network.<ref name=\"Pentagon\">{{cite news |title=On Television: HBO Bets Pentagon-Style Budget on a World War II Saga |first=Bill |last=Carter |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 3, 2001 |access-date=August 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/03/business/on-television-hbo-bets-pentagon-style-budget-on-a-world-war-ii-saga.html |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116173030/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/03/business/on-television-hbo-bets-pentagon-style-budget-on-a-world-war-ii-saga.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news |title='Brothers' invades fall lineup HBO's WWII miniseries battles network premieres |first=Gary |last=Levin |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 9, 2001}}</ref>  Its budget was about $125 million, or an average of $12.5 million per episode.<ref name=\"Private Ryan\" />\n\nAn additional $15 million was allocated for a promotional campaign, which included screenings for World War II veterans.<ref name=\"Pentagon\" /> One was held at [[Utah Beach]], Normandy, where U.S. troops had landed on June 6, 1944.

The scenes set in Germany and Austria were shot in Switzerland, in and near the village of [[Brienz]] in the [[Bernese Oberland]], and at the nearby Hotel Giessbach.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nTo preserve historical accuracy, the writers conducted additional research. One source was the memoir of Easy Company soldier [[David Kenyon Webster]], ''Parachute Infantry: An American Paratrooper's Memoir of D-Day and the Fall of the Third Reich'' (1994).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This was published by [[LSU Press]], following renewed interest in World War II and more than 30 years after his death in a boating accident.

Simon Atherton, the weapons master, corresponded with veterans to match weapons to scenes, and assistant costume designer Joe Hobbs used photos and veteran accounts.<ref name=\"Private Ryan\" />\n\nMost actors had contact with the individuals they were to portray before filming, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site.<ref name=\"Private Ryan\" /> Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: \"We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down a vast number of characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this.\"<ref name=\"Arts Abroad\" /> As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.<ref>{{cite news |title=Miniseries put actors through boot camp |first=Sandy |last=MacDonald |date=September 15, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Daily News (Halifax)|Daily News]]|location=Halifax}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the premiere of the series, Tom Hanks asked Major Winters what he thought of ''Band of Brothers''. The major responded, \"I wish that it would have been more authentic. I was hoping for an 80 percent solution.\" Hanks responded, \"Look, Major, this is Hollywood.
