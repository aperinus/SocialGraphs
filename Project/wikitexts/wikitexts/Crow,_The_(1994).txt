Schow]] and [[John Shirley]]. It stars [[Brandon Lee]] in his final film appearance as [[Crow (comics)#Eric Draven|Eric Draven]], a murdered musician who is resurrected to avenge his death and that of his fianc\u00e9e. The film is based on [[James O'Barr]]'s [[The Crow|comic of the same name]].\n\nProduction on ''The Crow'' was struck by tragedy when Lee was fatally wounded during filming. As Lee had finished most of his scenes before his death, the film was completed through script rewrites, a stunt double, and digital effects.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-crow/brandon-lee-death-shooting-truth |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-crow/brandon-lee-death-shooting-truth |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Brandon Lee, Michael Massee and the 'curse' of The Crow|work=telegraph.co.uk|access-date=26 January 2017|date=2016-10-27|last1=Robey|first1=Tim}}{{cbignore}}</ref> ''The Crow'' is dedicated to Lee and his fianc\u00e9e, Eliza Hutton.\n\nAfter Lee's death, [[Paramount Pictures]] opted out of distributing the film and the rights were picked up by [[Miramax]], who oversaw ''The Crow''{{'}}s completion. ''The Crow'' was released to positive reviews, with the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus praising its tone, visuals, [[Dariusz Wolski]]'s cinematography, the production design, and Lee's performance.<ref name=rt/> It also grossed $94 million on a $23 million budget and attained a strong [[Cult film|cult following]]. The film's success led to a [[The Crow (franchise)|media franchise]] that includes three sequels and a television series. The sequels, which mostly featured different characters and none of the original cast members, were unable to match the success of the first film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot. The guideline recommends a maximum of 700 words, and this 688 words long. -->\nOn October 30, [[Devil's Night]] in [[Detroit]], Sergeant Albrecht is at the scene of a crime where Shelly Webster has been beaten and raped. Her fianc\u00e9, musician Eric Draven, lies dead on the street after having been stabbed, shot, and thrown out the window. The couple had planned on getting married the following day, [[Halloween]]. As he leaves for the hospital with Shelly, Albrecht meets a young girl, Sarah, who says that she is their friend, and that they take care of her. Albrecht reluctantly tells her that Shelly is dying.\n\nOne year later, a crow taps on Eric's gravestone; Eric awakens and climbs out of his grave. Meanwhile, the street gang who perpetrated the deaths of Eric and Shelly, headed by T-Bird, is setting fires in the city. Upon returning to his old, now-derelict apartment, Eric experiences flashbacks of T-Bird and his gang (Tin Tin, Funboy and Skank) committing the murder. Eric soon discovers that any wounds he receives heal immediately; guided by the crow, he sets out to avenge his and Shelly's murders by killing the perpetrators.\n\nThe crow helps Eric locate Tin Tin; Eric kills him (by stabbing him in every major bodily organ in alphabetical order) and takes his coat before going to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring, forcing the owner, Gideon, to return it. He then blows up the shop with [[gasoline]], sparing Gideon so that he can warn the others. After finding Funboy with Sarah's drug addict mother, Darla, and killing him (by making him overdose on his own morphine stash), Eric confronts Darla, squeezing the [[morphine]] from her veins, making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. In the meantime Top Dollar, the crime boss who controls all the street gangs in the city, and his lover/half-sister Myca have become aware of Eric's actions through various reports from witnesses.\n\nEric visits Albrecht, explaining who he is and why he is here. Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched her suffer for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and feels the pain Shelly felt during those hours. Upon leaving Albrecht's apartment, he saves Sarah from getting run over by a car on her way home. He hides his face but gives her a clue to his identity before disappearing.\n\nT-Bird and Skank stop at a convenience store to pick up supplies, and Eric arrives and kidnaps T-Bird. Skank follows the pair and witnesses Eric kill T-Bird by forcing his car into the river; he escapes and goes to Top Dollar. The next morning, Sarah and her mother begin repairing their strained relationship, and Sarah goes to Eric's apartment to tell him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric assures her that although they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her. After Grange, Top Dollar's right-hand man, checks the gravesite of Eric, finding it open and empty, Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates where they discuss new plans for their Devil's Night criminal activities. Eric arrives, looking for Skank, and a gunfight ensues, with nearly everyone present being killed including Skank. Top Dollar, Myca and Grange escape and Myca hypothesizes that by killing the crow, his guide, Eric will no longer be immortal.\n\nEric, having finished his quest, returns to his grave. Sarah bids him farewell, and he gives her Shelly's engagement ring. As Sarah walks home, Grange abducts her and takes her into the church where Top Dollar and Myca are waiting. Through the crow, Eric realizes what has happened and goes to rescue her. Grange shoots the crow after it flies into the church, sapping Eric of his immortality. Myca grabs the wounded crow, intending to take its mystical power.\n\nAlbrecht arrives, wanting to pay his respects to Eric, just after Eric is shot and wounded. Top Dollar grabs Sarah and climbs the bell tower as a fight ensues, and Albrecht kills Grange. The crow escapes Myca's grip, claws out her eyes, and sends her down the bell tower to her death. When Albrecht is wounded, Eric climbs to the roof of the church on his own. There, Top Dollar admits ultimate responsibility for Eric and Shelly's deaths. In their fight, Eric gives Top Dollar the thirty hours of pain he absorbed from Albrecht; the sensation sends Top Dollar over the roof of the church to his death.\n\nSarah accompanies Albrecht to the hospital, and Eric is reunited with Shelly at their graves. The crow, carrying Shelly's engagement ring in its beak, later lands on Eric's grave and drops the ring into Sarah's hand before flying off over the city and into the night, while Sarah's monologue affirms that while people die, love lasts forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Brandon Lee]] as [[Crow (comics)|Eric Draven / The Crow]]\n* Rochelle Davis as Sarah Mohr\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Sergeant Daryl Albrecht\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Top Dollar\n* [[Bai Ling]] as Myca\n* [[Sofia Shinas]] as Shelly Webster\n* [[Anna Thomson|Anna Levine]] as Darla Mohr\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as T-Bird\n* Angel David as Skank\n* [[Laurence Mason]] as Tin Tin\n* [[Michael Massee]] as Funboy\n* [[Tony Todd]] as Grange\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Gideon\n* [[Bill Raymond]] as Mickey\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as Detective Torres\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Brandon Lee's death===\n\nOn March 31, 1993, at [[EUE Screen Gems Studios]] in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], Lee was filming a scene where his character, Eric, is shot after witnessing the beating and rape of his fianc\u00e9e. Actor Michael Massee's character Funboy fires a [[.44 Magnum]] [[Smith & Wesson Model 629]] revolver at Lee as he walks into the room.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-01/news/mn-17681_1_actor-brandon-lee |title=Bruce Lee's Son, Brandon, Killed in Movie Accident |first=Robert W. |last=Welkos |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=April 1, 1993 |access-date=November 6, 2015}}</ref> A scene filmed two weeks before Lee's had called for the same gun to be shown in close-up. Revolvers often use [[dummy cartridges]] fitted with bullets, but no [[smokeless powder|powder]] or [[primer (firearm)|primer]], during close-ups as they look more realistic than [[blank rounds]] which have no bullet. Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film's prop crew, hampered by time and money constraints, created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge but not the primer, then reinserting the bullets. Witnesses reported that two weeks before Lee's death they saw an unsupervised actor pulling the trigger on the gun while it was loaded with the powderless but primed round. Having not removed the primer, the primer could detonate with enough energy to launch a bullet and lodge it in the barrel.<ref name=\"Conner35\" /><ref name=\"Brown\" />\n\nIn the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12\u201315 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged for [[blank rounds]], which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. As the production company had sent the firearms specialist home early, responsibility for the guns was given to a prop assistant who was unaware of the rule for inspecting all firearms before and after any handling. Therefore, the barrel was not checked for obstructions when the time came to load it with the blank rounds.<ref name=Conner35/><ref name=Brown/> Since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel, this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brandon Lee's Mother Claims Negligence Caused His Death : Movies: Linda Lee Cadwell sues 14 entities regarding the actor's 'agonizing pain, suffering and untimely death' last March on the North Carolina set of 'The Crow' | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=August 11, 1993|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-11/entertainment/ca-22553_1_linda-lee-cadwell | access-date =2010-12-04|first=Terry|last= Pristin}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/article/1993/04/16/brief-life-and-unnecessary-death-brandon-lee |title=The brief life and unnecessary death of Brandon Lee |first=Mark |last=Harris |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 16, 1993 |access-date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lee's death, the producers were faced with the decision of whether or not to continue with the film.

The song \"Big Empty\" was not the [[Stone Temple Pilots]]' original choice for the soundtrack; they first recorded a version of \"Only Dying\", which they had recorded earlier as Mighty Joe Young in demo form, but it was replaced following Lee's death.<ref name=StoneTemplePilots />\n\nThe bands [[Medicine (band)|Medicine]] and [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]] make cameo appearances in the film on stage in the nightclub below Top Dollar's headquarters.\n\nThe score consists of original, mostly orchestral music, with some electronic and guitar elements, written for the film by [[Graeme Revell]].\n\n==Sequels==\nIn 1996, a sequel was released, called ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]''. In this film, [[Vincent P\u00e9rez]] plays Ashe Corven, who, along with his son Danny, is killed by criminals. Ashe is resurrected as a new Crow. The character of Sarah Mohr ([[Mia Kirshner]]) reappears in this film and assists Ashe.<ref name=imdbcity /> The film also features [[Iggy Pop]], who, according to the booklet insert for the film's soundtrack, was the producer's first choice for Funboy in the first Crow movie, but he was unable to commit due to his recording schedule. The band [[Deftones]] can be seen playing live in a festival scene and they contributed the song \"Teething\" to the soundtrack. The film received mostly negative reviews. The film was followed by a television series and two direct-to-video sequels, each with a different person as The Crow.\n\n''[[The Crow: Stairway to Heaven]]'' was a 1998 Canadian television series created by [[Bryce Zabel]] and starring [[Mark Dacascos]] in the lead role as Eric Draven, originally played by Brandon Lee.\n\nThe third film, ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'', was released in 2000. Directed by [[Bharat Nalluri]], it stars [[Eric Mabius]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] and [[William Atherton]]. It is loosely based on [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s novel ''[[The Lazarus Heart (novel)|The Lazarus Heart]]''. After its distributor cancelled the intended theatrical release due to ''The Crow: City of Angels''{{'}} negative critical reception, ''The Crow: Salvation'' was released directly to video with mixed reviews.\n\nThe fourth film, ''[[The Crow: Wicked Prayer]]'', was released in 2005. Directed by [[Lance Mungia]], it stars [[Edward Furlong]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Tito Ortiz]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] and [[Danny Trejo]]. It was inspired by [[Norman Partridge]]'s novel of the same title. It had a one-week theatrical premi\u00e8re on June 3, 2005, at AMC Pacific Place Theatre in [[Seattle]], Washington, before being released to video on July 19, 2005. Like the other sequels, it had a poor critical reception, and it was considered the worst of the four films.\n\n''The Crow: 2037'' was a planned sequel written and scheduled to be directed by [[Rob Zombie]] in the late 1990s;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428859/zombie-will-write-direct-next-crow-flick.jhtml |title=Zombie Will Write/Direct Next \"Crow\" Flick |work=MTV |date=February 11, 1997 |access-date=November 24, 2012}}</ref> however, it was never made.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 22, 2008|title=The Crow: 2037 A New World of Gods and Monster {{!}} Scripts On The Net|url=http://www.roteirodecinema.com.br/scripts/files/crow_2037_a_new_world_of_gods_and_monster.htm|access-date=November 24, 2012|work=Roteiro de Cinema}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|date=August 10, 2012|title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed|url=http://io9.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed|access-date=November 24, 2012|work=Gizmodo}}</ref>\n\n==Reboot==\n{{Main|The Crow (upcoming film)}}\nOn December 14, 2008, [[Stephen Norrington]] announced in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that he planned to write and direct a \"reinvention\" of ''The Crow''.

time I hear of one, not that I believe I've been able to. I think extenuating circumstances have stopped it being made because if Hollywood wants to make something that they don't listen to schmucks like me who bring noble and moralistic issues. My point is that Brandon Lee made that movie what it is. He made that movie, he made that character. That character was not taken from a comic book, that was Brandon. And Brandon Lee died making that movie, he paid the worst price anyone could ever pay making a movie and it's his legacy. The guy would have been a huge star after that movie. He wasn't able to ever do that. That's his final testimony to his talent and that's why I finished the movie. I finished it for Brandon. After being devastated about what happened we shut down the production and I went back to Australia. Months later I went back and watched the movie and his family all the other actors, everyone involved, said 'You've got to finish this movie because Brandon is so great in it' and he was. I was able to watch it and see how great he was and I thought then the movie deserves to be completed because it's his legacy. So that's what the movie is, it's not just a movie that can be remade. It's one man's legacy. And it should be treated with that level of respect.</blockquote>\n\nOn April 1, 2022, it was announced by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' that [[Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd]] is set to star as Draven, [[Rupert Sanders]] directing and Edward R.
