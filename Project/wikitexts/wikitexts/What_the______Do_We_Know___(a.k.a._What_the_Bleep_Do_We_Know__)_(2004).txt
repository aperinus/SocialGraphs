Do We Know!?''''') is a 2004 American [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] film that posits a [[spirituality|spiritual]] connection between [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]]. The plot follows the fictional story of a photographer, using [[documentary film|documentary]]-style interviews and [[computer graphics|computer-animated graphics]], as she encounters emotional and [[Existential crisis|existential]] obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the [[Nature|material world]]. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the film's scientifically-unsupported thesis about quantum physics and consciousness.\n\n''Bleep'' was conceived and its production funded by [[William Arntz]], who co-directed the film along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of [[Ramtha's School of Enlightenment]]. A moderately low-budget [[independent film]], it was promoted using [[viral marketing]] methods and opened in art-house theaters in the western United States, winning several independent film awards before being picked up by a major distributor and eventually [[gross (economics)|grossing]] over $10 million. The 2004 theatrical release was succeeded by a substantially changed, extended home media version in 2006.\n\nThe film  has been described as an example of [[quantum mysticism]], and has been criticized for both misrepresenting [[science]] and containing [[pseudoscience]]. While many of its interviewees and subjects are professional scientists in the fields of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biology]], one of them has noted that the film [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|quotes him out of context]].<ref name=\"salon\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nFilmed in [[Portland, Oregon]], ''What the Bleep Do We Know!?'' presents a viewpoint of the [[physical universe]] and human life within it, with connections to [[neuroscience]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]]. Some ideas discussed in the film are:\n* That the universe is best seen as constructed from thoughts and ideas rather than from [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]].\n* That \"empty space\" is not empty.\n* That matter is not solid, and electrons are able to pop in and out of existence without it being known where they disappear to.\n* That beliefs about who one is and what is real are a direct cause of oneself and of one's own realities.\n* That [[peptide]]s produced by the brain can cause a bodily reaction to emotion.\n\nIn the narrative segments of the film, [[Marlee Matlin]] portrays Amanda, a photographer who plays the role of [[everyman|everywoman]] as she experiences her life from startlingly new and different perspectives.\n\nIn the documentary segments of the film, interviewees discuss the roots and meaning of Amanda's experiences. The comments focus primarily on a single theme: \"We create our own reality.\" The director, William Arntz, has described ''What the Bleep'' as a film for the \"[[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[leftism|left]]\".<ref name=\"beliefnet\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Amanda\n* [[Elaine Hendrix]] as Jennifer\n* [[Barry Newman]] as Frank\n* [[Robert Bailey Jr.]] as Reggie\n* [[John Ross Bowie]] as Elliot\n* [[Armin Shimerman]] as Man\n* [[Robert Blanche]] as Bob\n* [[Larry Brandenburg]] as Bruno\n* Patti B.

This has led to accusations, both formal and informal, directed towards the film's proponents, of spamming online message boards and forums with many thinly veiled promotional posts. Initially, the film was released in only two theaters: one in [[Yelm, Washington]] (the home of the producers, which is also the home of [[Ramtha]]), and the other the [[The Bagdad Theater and Pub|Bagdad Theater]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], where it was filmed. Within several weeks, the film had appeared in a dozen or more theaters (mostly in the western United States), and within six months it had made its way into 200 theaters across the US.<ref name=\"PW\" />\n\nAccording to the makers of the film, \"Bleep\" is an [[expurgation]] of \"[[fuck]]\".

In the letter, the authors write: \"the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's nothing wrong with that. It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old [[Lemuria]]n warrior, and on to even greater nonsense.\" It went on to say that \"Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided,\" and that \"a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics,\" a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which \"we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered\".<ref name=\"Physics-Today\">{{cite journal |last=Kuttner |first=Fred |author2=Rosenblum, Bruce  |title=Teaching physics mysteries versus pseudoscience |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume=59 |issue=11 |page=14 |date=November 2006 |doi=10.1063/1.2435631|bibcode = 2006PhT....59k..14K |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Dawkins]] stated that \"the authors seem undecided whether their theme is quantum theory or consciousness.
