An urban retelling of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', the film was written by Cynthia Friedlob and [[John Semper]] from a story by Michael Swerdlick, Richard Brenne and Wayne Allan Rice. Filmed at [[Van Nuys High School]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] section of Los Angeles, it is the third of five films starring Kid 'n Play, following ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' (1990) and ''[[House Party 2]]'' (1991), and preceding ''[[House Party 3]]'' (1994) and ''[[House Party: Tonight's the Night|House Party 5: Tonight's the Night]]'' (2013).\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Anchor|Characters and story}}\nGenius high school student Duncan Pinderhughes is getting ready for graduation, but is somewhat disheartened to find out that, despite his perfect [[SAT]] score and 4.0 GPA, prestigious Hafford University (parody of [[Harvard University]]) will not admit him unless he can pass [[Physical education|phys. ed]]. Ex-convict Michael \"Blade\" Brown is released from jail, and told by his parole officer that the condition of his release is satisfactory graduation from high school. A mishap results in their pictures being swapped on their permanent school records. In effect, Blade is surprised to find out that he is being placed in [[Gifted education|gifted classes]], while Duncan is shocked to be placed in minimal classes with substandard conditions and miscreants for classmates.\n\nBlade realizes this and sees Duncan as his ticket permanently out of jail, since Duncan could pass his classes with ease. He transforms Duncan into a version of himself with dreadlocks, and does his best to teach Duncan how to act and talk like a gangsta. Having no grasp of [[hip hop culture]], Duncan's parents begin to worry about their son's new \"friend\"; his father especially, beginning to suspect Duncan is [[homosexuality|gay]].\n\nBlade manages to smooth-talk his way through his advanced classes, even successfully executing a dissertation on sexual intercourse (one of his favorite subjects). Duncan ends up running into trouble with a high school thug named Wedge, but also discovers an uncanny ability to kick field goals, and joins the school's football team. Both Blade and Duncan end up with girlfriends that the other would have, with Blade smooth-talking the intelligent but excitement-seeking Ellen and Duncan being pursued by the wild Damita (Alysia Rogers).\n\nA drug dealer named Mink was told by his employee Wedge that Blade Brown was stepping into his territory and a chase involving the guys and their girlfriends and one of Duncan's new buddies ensues. The gang briefly lose Wedge and Mink and go to Damita's workplace (a wax museum), but are discovered by Mink and Wedge. Once there, the girlfriends realize that their men are swapped, and both guys eventually end up dumped. Still, Duncan manages to knock out Wedge in the museum, while Blade handles Mink, but they all end up in jail.\n\nAfter the mix-up is corrected, Blade, Duncan and company are all set free. In an anti-climax, Duncan and Blade both enter a [[Brain Bowl|Knowledge bowl]] in an effort to get Blade back with Ellen. They succeed when Blade answers a tiebreaker question to win the competition, recalling a choice tidbit Ellen once told him. Afterward, both couples end up together. In a final scene, Duncan's dad finds out the hard way that Duncan is definitely not gay by catching him and Damita having sex in Duncan's bedroom. However, after returning to his room with his wife, he expresses relief and notes that his son's girlfriend is \"stacked\".\n\nWalking in each other's shoes dramatically changed the lives of both Duncan and Blade. In the epilogue, the audience learns that Blade graduated from high school and attended Hafford (even wearing preppy attire), while Duncan attended Stanford on a football scholarship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher \"Kid\" Reid]] \u2013 Duncan Pinderhughes\n* [[Christopher Martin (entertainer)|Christopher \"Play\" Martin]] \u2013 Michael Charles \"Blade\" Brown\n* [[Karyn Parsons]] \u2013 Ellen\n* [[Thomas Mikal Ford]] \u2013 Mink\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] \u2013 Parole Officer Reichert\n* Alysia Rogers \u2013 Damita\n* Andre Rosey Brown \u2013 Jail Guard\n* David Basulto \u2013 Go-Go\n* [[Doug E.

Their comic timing is right, and their humor manages to be both traditional and current. (An argument about whether one of them is \"deaf\" or \"def\" unfolds in the best \"Who's on first?\" fashion.) The film easily incorporates a crowd-pleasing rap and dance episode featuring both of them, and it meanders only when taking on anything more complicated. A chase sequence through a wax museum only confuses matters by becoming too crowded, and temporarily losing track of the stars.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=JANET MASLIN|date=June 5, 1992|title=Review/Film; No Recess For Excelling In High Jinks|work=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7D8163AF936A35755C0A964958260|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Peter Travers]] said that \"first-time director Randall Miller guides [the actors] over every predictable comic misstep with a timeout for a hip-hop number.
