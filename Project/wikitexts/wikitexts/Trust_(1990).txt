She meets Matthew, a highly educated and extremely moody electronics repairman who keeps losing jobs through inability to accept the views of employers and customers. He offers her a room in the house of his sadistic father, who kicks both of them out. Braving the wrath of her ferocious mother, Maria then goes home with Matthew who, though they never do more than kiss, offers to get a good job, marry her, and bring up her child. But it is not to be. Matthew's father and Maria's mother both try to destroy the innocent relationship and the young people both crack under the strain. Maria has an abortion and Matthew, in despair, tries to blow himself up at the plant where he works. Maria's last sight of him is in a police car as he is driven away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adrienne Shelly]] as Maria Coughlin\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Matthew Slaughter\n* Merritt Nelson as Jean Coughlin\n* John MacKay as Jim Slaughter\n* [[Edie Falco]] as Peg Coughlin\n* [[Karen Sillas]] as Nurse Paine\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Festival of Festivals]] on September 9, 1990 and was released in theatres on July 26, 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.halhartley.com/trust ''Trust''] at Halhartley.com\n* {{IMDb title|0103130}}\n* {{Amg title|id=51164|title=Trust}}\n\n{{Hal Hartley}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Hal Hartley]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Republic Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
