Set in [[Vienna]], Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century, the film is a fictionalized story of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] from the time he left Salzburg, described by its writer as a \"fantasia on the theme of Mozart and Salieri\". Mozart's music is heard extensively in the soundtrack. The film follows a fictional rivalry between Mozart and Italian composer [[Antonio Salieri]] at the court of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]]. The film stars [[F. Murray Abraham]] as Salieri and [[Tom Hulce]] as Mozart. Abraham and Hulce were both nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], with Abraham winning.\n\n''Amadeus'' was released by [[Orion Pictures]] on September 19, 1984, thirteen days following its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 6, 1984. Upon release, it received widespread acclaim and was a box office hit, grossing over $90 million. Considered by many to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]], ''Amadeus'' was nominated for 53 awards and received 40, including eight Academy Awards (including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]), four BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and a Directors Guild of America award. {{As of|2021|}}, it is the most recent film to have more than one nomination in the Academy Award for Best Actor category. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it 53rd on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Tartaglione| first=Nancy| title=National Film Registry Adds 'Purple Rain', 'Clerks', 'Gaslight' & More; 'Boys Don't Cry' One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers| url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/| magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| date=December 11, 2019| access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Women Rule 2019 National Film Registry| url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-116/women-rule-2019-national-film-registry/2019-12-11/| access-date=2020-09-14| website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Complete National Film Registry Listing| url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/| access-date=2020-09-14| website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the winter of 1823, [[Antonio Salieri]] is committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] after a [[suicide attempt]], during which his servants overhear him confess to murdering [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The young priest Father Vogler approaches Salieri for elaboration on Salieri's confession. Salieri recounts how, even in his youth in the 1760s, he desired to be a composer, much to his father's chagrin. He prays to God that if He makes Salieri a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri has become court composer to [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] in Vienna. Seven years later, at a reception in honor of Mozart's patron, the [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]], Salieri is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is [[Mozart and scatology|obscene]] and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift to Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart's talent to mock Salieri's mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.\n\nMozart's [[alcoholism]] deteriorates his health, marriage, and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work. Salieri hires a young girl to pose as Mozart's maid and discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|The Marriage of Figaro]]'', which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow [[The Marriage of Figaro|his opera]] to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that [[Leopold Mozart|his father]] has died, he writes ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in his grief. Salieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]''. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart's friend [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] invites him to write an opera for his theatre. Mozart obliges despite his wife [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]]'s insistence that he finish the ''Requiem'', as the opera is a riskier venture financially. After arguing with Mozart, Constanze leaves with their young son, [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl]].\n\nThe opera in question, ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', is a great success, but the overworked Mozart collapses during one performance. Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue the ''Requiem'', offering to take the bedridden Mozart's dictation; the two lay down the opening of the ''Confutatis'' together. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and demands that Salieri leave immediately. In her guilt, she locks the unfinished ''Requiem'' away in a cabinet, keeping it away from both composers; as she and Salieri argue, Mozart dies from exhaustion. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave.\n\nBack in 1823, Vogler is too shocked to absolve Salieri, who surmises that the \"merciful\" God preferred to destroy His beloved Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of his glory. Salieri promises, with bitter irony, to both pray for and absolve Vogler along with all of the world's mediocrities as their \"patron saint\". As Salieri is wheeled down a hallway, absolving the hospital's patients of their own inadequacies as he passes by, Mozart's laughter rings in the air.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[F.

In it, Salieri actually murders Mozart on stage. The play was made into the opera ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] 67 years later,<ref name=\"bbc\"/> which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent-film director [[Victor Tourjansky]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web |title=Religion and Characters in Symphony of Love and Death (1914) |url=http://www.comicbookreligion.com/?s=9073 |access-date=2021-11-13 |website=Comic Book Religion}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant departure in the film is the portrayal of Salieri as a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity, when in reality he was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress.<ref name=guardian/>\n\nMozart was indeed commissioned to compose a Requiem Mass by an anonymous benefactor.

However, he explains why the scenes were eventually restored in a subsequent 2002 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'':\n{{blockquote|\nWhen you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don't have any idea. You don't know if you made a success or a flop, when it comes to the box office. And in the '80s, with [[MTV]] on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, \"Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far\". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision [to limit the running time]. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long.
