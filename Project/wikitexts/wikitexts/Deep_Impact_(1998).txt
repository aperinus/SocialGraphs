He sends a picture to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes it is a comet on collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car crash while racing to raise the alarm.\n\nA year later, journalist Jenny Lerner investigates [[Secretary of the Treasury]] Alan Rittenhouse over his connection with \"Ellie\", whom she assumes to be a mistress but is confused when she finds him and his family loading a boat with large amounts of food and other survival gear. She is apprehended by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and taken to meet President Tom Beck, who persuades her not to share the story in return for a prominent role in the press conference he will arrange. She subsequently discovers that \"Ellie\" is actually an acronym \u2014 ELE \u2014 which stands for \"[[extinction event|extinction-level event]]\". Two days later, Beck announces that the comet Wolf\u2013Beiderman is on course to impact the Earth in roughly one year and could cause humanity's extinction. He reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing the ''Messiah'' in orbit, a spacecraft to transport a team to alter the comet's path with nuclear bombs.\n\nThe ''Messiah'' launches a short time later with a crew of five American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut. They land on the comet's surface and drill the nuclear bombs deep beneath its surface, but the comet shifts into the sunlight. Consequently, one astronaut is blinded and another propelled into space by an explosive release of gas. The remaining crew escape the comet and detonate the bombs.\n\nRather than deflect the comet, the bombs split it in two. Beck announces the mission's failure in a television address, and that both pieces \u2014 the larger now named Wolf and the smaller named Beiderman \u2014 are both still headed for Earth. [[Martial law]] is imposed and a lottery selects 800,000 Americans to join 200,000 pre-selected individuals in underground shelters in the [[Meramec Caverns]] in [[Missouri]]. Lerner is pre-selected, as are the Beiderman family as gratitude for discovering the comet, though Leo's girlfriend Sarah and her family are not selected. Leo marries Sarah in a vain attempt to save her family; while this saves Sarah, her family are still not selected, and she refuses to go without them.\n\nA last-ditch effort to deflect the comets with [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] fails. Upon arrival at the shelter, Leo eschews his safety and leaves to find Sarah. He reaches her on the freeway and takes her and her baby brother to high ground while her parents remain. Lerner gives up her seat on the evacuation helicopter to a colleague and her young daughter, and instead travels to the beach where she reconciles with her estranged father.\n\nThe Beiderman fragment hits the Atlantic Ocean, creating a [[megatsunami]] that destroys much of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and also hits Europe and Africa, resulting in millions of fatalities, including Sarah\u2019s parents, Lerner and her father. Leo, Sarah, and her baby brother survive after making it to the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The crew of ''Messiah'' decide to sacrifice themselves to destroy the larger Wolf fragment by flying deep inside it and detonating their remaining nuclear bombs. They say goodbye to their loved ones and execute their plan. Wolf is blown into smaller pieces which burn up harmlessly in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAfter the waters recede, President Beck speaks to a large crowd at an under-construction replacement [[United States Capitol]], encouraging them to remember those lost as they begin to rebuild.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Captain Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner, a veteran astronaut who becomes the rendezvous pilot of the ''Messiah''\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Jenny Lerner, an MSNBC journalist\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Leo Beiderman, a teenage astronomer who discovers the Wolf\u2013Beiderman comet\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Robin Lerner, the mother of Jenny\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Jason Lerner, the estranged father of Jenny\n* [[Rya Kihlstedt]] as Chloe Lerner, 2nd wife of Jason Lerner\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Tom Beck, the President of the United States\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Alan Rittenhouse, the Secretary of the Treasury who resigns in light of the Wolf\u2013Beiderman comet threat\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Commander Oren Monash, the Mission Commander for the ''Messiah''\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Dr. Gus Partenza, the medical officer of the ''Messiah''\n* [[Laura Innes]] as Beth Stanley, the co-worker of Jenny\n* [[Bruce Weitz]] as Stuart Caley, Jenny's boss at MSNBC\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Andrea \"Andy\" Baker, the pilot of the ''Messiah''\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Don Beiderman, the father of Leo\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Ellen Beiderman, the mother of Leo\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Sarah Hotchner, the girlfriend of Leo\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Mark Simon, the navigator of the ''Messiah''\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Eric Vennekor, the co-worker of Jenny\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Tim Urbanski, another co-worker of Jenny\n* [[Aleksandr Baluev]] as Colonel Michail Tulchinsky, a nuclear specialist from Russia and crew member of the ''Messiah''\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Mike Perry, Leo's teacher\n* [[Francis X.

In the mid-1990s, they approached director Steven Spielberg, with whom they had made the 1975 blockbuster ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', to discuss their long-planned project.<ref name=\"starlog\"/> However, Spielberg had already bought the film rights to the 1993 novel ''[[The Hammer of God (Clarke novel)|The Hammer of God]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], which dealt with a similar theme of an asteroid on a collision course for Earth and humanity's attempts to prevent its own extinction. Spielberg planned to produce and direct ''The Hammer of God'' himself for his then-fledgling [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] studio, but opted to merge the two projects with Zanuck and Brown, and they commissioned a screenplay for what would become ''Deep Impact''.<ref name=\"starlog\"/> In 1995, the forthcoming film was announced in industry publications as \"Screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin, based on the film ''When Worlds Collide'' and ''The Hammer of God'' by Arthur C Clarke\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwLsAAAAMAAJ |title=Deep Impact |journal=The Film Journal |volume=98 |issue=1\u20136 |publisher=Pubsun Corporation |year=1995 |access-date=July 14, 2017 |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224154001/https://books.google.com/books?id=WwLsAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> though ultimately, following a subsequent redraft by Michael Tolkin, neither source work would be credited in the final film. Spielberg still planned to direct ''Deep Impact'' himself, but commitments to his 1997 film ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' prevented him from doing so in time, particularly as [[Touchstone Pictures]] had just announced their own similarly-themed film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', also to be released in summer 1998.<ref name=\"starlog\"/> Not wanting to wait, the producers opted to hire Mimi Leder to direct ''Deep Impact'', with Spielberg acting as executive producer.<ref name=\"starlog\"/> Leder was unaware of the other film being made. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. And the press was trying to pit us against each other. That didn\u2019t feel good.
