It is the third and final entry in Mushi Production's adult-oriented ''[[Animerama]]'' trilogy, following ''[[A Thousand and One Nights (1969 film)|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1970). Its initial release was a commercial failure and caused the studio to go bankrupt. The film was remastered in 2016 by [[Cinelicious Pics]] and has received generally favorable reviews from contemporary [[film critics]].\n\nIt follows the story of Jeanne, a peasant woman who makes a faustian [[deal with the devil]] after she is raped by the local nobility on the night of her wedding day. It is notable for its erotic, violent, and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] imagery and considered a [[cult film]].<ref name=\"tasteofcinema2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2015/15-cult-animated-movies-you-might-not-have-seen/2/ |title=15 Cult Animated Movies You Might Not Have Seen \u00ab Taste of Cinema |publisher=Tasteofcinema.com |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJeanne and Jean are newlyweds in a rural village in [[France in the Middle Ages|Medieval France]]. But on Jeanne's wedding night, she is brutally gang-raped in a [[Droit du seigneur|ritual deflowering]] by the local baron and his courtiers. She returns to Jean terrified and he attempts to calm her by saying they can start over from that moment. Shortly after they embrace, however, Jean strangles Jeanne to a state of unconsciousness. Ashamed, he flees outside their home.\n\nThat night, Jeanne begins to see visions of a phallic-headed spirit who promises her power. The spirit tells her it heard her calling for help, and that it can grow as big and powerful as she wants it to. As a result, the couple's fortunes rise even as famine strikes the village and the baron raises taxes to fund his war effort. Formerly exhausted by his life of menial labor, Jean is elevated to the role of tax collector. But the baron cuts off Jean\u2019s hand as punishment when he could not extract enough money from the village, leaving him miserable and drunk.\n\nThe spirit visits Jeanne once again (having grown in size) and rapes her in exchange for more riches. Although she submits her body, she attests that her soul still belongs to Jean and to God. Shortly after, Jeanne takes out a large loan from a usurer and sets herself up in the same trade, eventually becoming the true power in the village. The baron returns victorious from his war, and his wife, envious of the respect and admiration Jeanne received, calls her a witch and turns the villagers against her. Running from the mob, Jeanne tries to return home to Jean, but he refuses to open the door and she is assaulted.\n\nThat evening, when soldiers come to arrest her, she flees into the nearby forest. In the wilderness, she finally makes a [[Deal with the Devil|pact]] with the spirit, who reveals himself to be [[the Devil]]. She is granted magical powers, and returns to find the village has been infected with the [[Black death|Bubonic plague]]. Jeanne uses her powers to create a cure for the disease, and the village flocks to her for aid. Having won their favor, Jeanne presides over [[orgy|orgiastic rites]] among the villagers.\n\nA page, who is in love with the baron's wife, begs Jeanne to help him seduce her. She gives him a potion that causes the baron's wife to accept his advances, but the baron catches his wife sleeping with the page and kills them both. Perturbed by Jeanne's power, the baron sends Jean to invite her to a meeting. The couple reconcile and Jeanne accepts the invitation. In exchange for sharing her cure for the plague, the baron offers to make Jeanne the second-highest noble in the land, but she refuses, saying she wishes to take over the entire world.\n\nAngered at her refusal, the baron orders Jeanne burnt at the stake. Jean is killed by the baron's soldiers when he tries to retaliate, which angers the villagers. As Jeanne is burned, the faces of the villagers transform into Jeanne's, fulfilling a priest's warning that if a witch is burnt while her pride is intact, the evil in her soul will survive and spread to influence everyone around her. Centuries later, the influence of Jeanne's spirit initiates [[The French Revolution]].\n\n==Cast==\n* Aiko Nagayama as Jeanne\n* Katsutaka Ito as Jean\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as the Devil\n* Masaya Takahashi as Milord\n* Shigako Shimegi as Milady\n* [[Masakane Yonekura]] as Catholic Priest\n* [[Chinatsu Nakayama]] as Narrator\n\n==Production and release==\n\n[[File:Belladonna of Sadness title-card.png|thumb|350px|English-subtitled still of the film's title card, showing the Japanese title, \u54c0\u3057\u307f\u306e\u30d9\u30e9\u30c9\u30f3\u30ca, the original Roman-character title, ''La Sorci\u00e8re'', and the English title of the 4K restored version, ''Belladonna of Sadness''.]]\n\nDirected and co-written by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] and inspired by [[Jules Michelet]]'s 1862 [[non-fiction]] book ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorci\u00e8re]]''.
