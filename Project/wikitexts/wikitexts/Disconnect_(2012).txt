It stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Jason Bateman]], [[Hope Davis]], [[Frank Grillo]], [[Michael Nyqvist]], [[Paula Patton]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[Colin Ford]], and [[Jonah Bobo]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|title=Jason Bateman-Hope Davis Drama 'Disconnect' to Open Santa Barbara Film Festival|date=2 January 2013 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jason-bateman-hope-davis-drama-407780|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> The film explores how people experience the negative sides of modern communication technology by following three interconnecting stories.\n\n==Plot==\nAmbitious, up-and-coming reporter Nina Dunham interviews an underage video chat-room stripper named Kyle. Kyle, a runaway, works for a man named Harvey in a \"house\" with other chat-room strippers. However, after the interview achieves some prominence, the FBI demands that she reveal the address of the house so that they can shut down the operation. Since she has paid Kyle in order to make initial contact, she may have broken the law. As a result, police and her employer also put pressure on her to cooperate. Nina wants to save him from the business, yet fears losing his trust in the process. Kyle reluctantly gives her the address, but Harvey is tipped off and the entire household flees. Nina follows them to a motel where they're staying and asks Kyle to leave with her. Kyle is willing to do so at first, but when Nina is hesitant to guarantee him safe haven in her home, he refuses. Harvey watches them argue, then slaps Nina. The entire group of chat-room strippers leave and Nina drives away in tears.\n\nTwo boys, Jason and his friend Frye, [[catfishing|impersonate]] a girl named \"Jessica Rhony\" on Facebook Messenger and convince teenager Ben (the son of Rich, a lawyer for the TV station where Nina works) to send a nude picture of himself. The boys distribute it to classmates and the picture circulates to nearly everyone in their grade. Ben is so embarrassed by this [[cyber bullying]] that he attempts suicide by [[hanging]] himself and ends up in a coma. Rich doggedly searches Ben's social media, looking for answers, and begins chatting with \"Jessica\". Rich visits Ben in the hospital, where he meets Jason, who falsely calls himself Mike. Jason's father (who is actually named Mike) discovers what Jason and Frye have been doing and is furious. However, he protects his son by erasing the evidence on Frye's iPad. Later, Rich discovers the identity of \"Jessica\" and angrily goes to Mike's house, which results in a physical altercation. Jason tries to intervene and Rich hits him with a hockey stick. The fight ends when Mike hits Rich, who falls to the ground.\n\nA young married couple, Derek and Cindy, are still devastated due to a tragedy that occurred two years earlier: the death of their only son of [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]]. Cindy cannot stop mourning, and Derek cannot talk about their loss or deal with his feelings. One day, the couple finds their identities have been stolen online. They hire private detective Mike (Jason's father) to find the thief; after discovering that Cindy has been regularly chatting on a support group website, Mike determines who the identity thief is. Cindy and Derek go after the suspect, Stephen Schumacher, following him and even breaking into his home for evidence. Just before Derek plans to confront him at his front door, Mike calls to tell him that Schumacher is not their man, and that Schumacher too was a victim of the thief. Schumacher, who has noticed Cindy and Derek stalking him, confronts them in their car with a rifle; however, Derek, a former Marine, disarms him and forces him back into his house. Cindy is able to coax the gun away by explaining that Schumacher has been comforting her online.\n\nThe film ends without any of the stories being resolved, yet all of the characters have stopped \"disconnecting\" and grown closer to the ones they love.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jason Bateman]] as Rich Boyd\n*[[Hope Davis]] as Lydia Boyd\n*[[Frank Grillo]] as Mike Dixon\n*[[Michael Nyqvist]] as Stephen Schumacher\n*[[Paula Patton]] as Cindy Hull\n*[[Andrea Riseborough]] as Nina Dunham\n*[[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Derek Hull\n* [[Daniella Rahme]] as Anne Dixon\n*[[Max Thieriot]] as Kyle\n*[[Colin Ford]] as Jason Dixon\n*[[Jonah Bobo]] as Ben Boyd\n*[[Haley Ramm]] as Abby Boyd\n*[[Norbert Leo Butz]] as Peter\n*[[Kasi Lemmons]] as Roberta Washington\n*[[John Sharian]] as Ross Lynd\n*[[Marc Jacobs]] as Harvey\n*Aviad Bernstein as Frye\n*Teresa Celentano as Maria\n*Cole Mohr as Cole\n*Kevin Csolak as Shane\n*Ella Lentini as Cassie\n*[[Tessa Albertson]] as Isabella\n*[[Erin Wilhelmi]] as Tracy\n*Ryder Gering as drive by bully 1\n*Andrew Seddon as drive by bully 2\n*Nicholas Zakotiria as Muscle Head\n*Alex Manette as McManus\n*Adalberto Bermudez as gym owner\n*Deidre Daly as math teacher\n*Darlene Troiano as customer at dry cleaners\n*Mark Zupan as drug dealer\n*Katelin Baxter as webcam model 1\n*Jackie Austin as webcam model 2\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Disconnect'' opened in a [[limited release]] on April 12, 2013 in 15 theaters and grossed $124,000 with an average of $8,267 per theater ranking #31 at the box office.

I believed the lives of these people. I believed they'd do the drastic things they do in the face of crisis. I ached for them when things went terribly wrong and rooted for them when there were glimmers of hope. You should see this movie.
