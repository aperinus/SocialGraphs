[[Michael J. Fox]] stars as the title character, a high school student whose ordinary life is changed when he discovers that he is a [[werewolf]]. [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]], [[Scott Paulin]], [[Susan Ursitti]], [[Jerry Levine]], [[Matt Adler]], and [[Jay Tarses]] appear in supporting roles. Filming took place from November to December 1984.\n\n''Teen Wolf'' was released on August 23, 1985, by [[Atlantic Releasing Corporation]]. It received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success, grossing over $80 million on a $1.2 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl4269114881/weekend/ |title= Teen Wolf|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref> Due to its success, the film spawned an [[Teen Wolf (1986 TV series)|animated series adaptation]] in 1986 and a [[Teen Wolf Too|1987 sequel]] that featured Hampton and [[Mark Holton]] as the only returning cast members. ''Teen Wolf'' also influenced a [[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|supernatural drama series of the same name]] that aired on [[MTV]] from 2011 to 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nScott Howard, a 17-year-old [[high school]] student, is tired of just being average. Living in a small town in Nebraska, his only claim to popularity is playing on the Beavers, his school's unsuccessful [[basketball]] team. Scott fawns after Pamela Wells even though she is dating his rival Mick who plays for the Dragons, an opposing team that bullies him on the court. Completely oblivious to the affections of his best friend Boof, Scott constantly rebuffs her advances due to their history together.\n\nAfter startling changes such as long hair suddenly sprouting on his hands, he decides to quit the team, but his coach, Finstock, changes his mind. Scoring a [[keg]] with his friend Stiles for a party, Scott and Boof end up alone in a closet and Scott gets rough when they begin making out, accidentally clawing her back. When he returns home, he undergoes a strange transformation, discovering he is a [[werewolf]]. His father Harold reveals he is one too, and that he had hoped Scott would not inherit the curse because 'sometimes it skips a generation'.\n\nScott reveals his secret to Stiles, who agrees to keep it a secret. But, when Scott becomes stressed on the court, he becomes the wolf and helps win their first game in three years. This has an unexpected result of fame and popularity as the high school is overwhelmed with 'Wolf Fever'. Scott is alienated from Boof and his teammates as he begins to hog the ball during games.\n\nStiles merchandises \"Teen Wolf\" paraphernalia and Pamela finally begins paying attention to Scott. After he gets a role as a \"werewolf cavalryman\" in the school play alongside her, she comes onto him in the dressing room and they have sex. Later, after a date set up to make Mick jealous, Pamela tells Scott that she is not interested in him as a boyfriend, much to his disappointment. Harold tells Scott he is responsible for vice principal Rusty Thorne breathing down his neck due to a scare he had given him when he was in high school. He advises Scott to be himself.\n\nBoof agrees to go with Scott to the upcoming Spring Dance, but only if he goes as himself. Scott goes alone as the Wolf instead. She takes him into the hallway and they kiss, which turns Scott back into himself. When they return to the dance, Scott garners everyone's attention, including Pamela. A jealous Mick punches him in the face, then proceeds to insult Boof and taunt Scott until the Wolf angrily attacks. Scott runs out of the hall right into Thorne, who threatens expulsion. Harold defends his son before going on to intimidate Thorne by growling in his face, causing the vice principal to wet himself.\n\nScott renounces using the Wolf and quits the basketball team. During the championship game, he arrives to rally his teammates to play without the Wolf. Despite the odds, the team begins to work together and they make ground against the Dragons. During the final quarter, behind by one point, Scott is fouled by Mick at the buzzer. He makes both free throws, winning the championship. Brushing past Pamela, he kisses Boof as his father embraces them both. Mick tells Pamela that they should leave, but she tells him to \"drop dead\" and storms off while everyone else celebrates the victory.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per opening tombstone credits, roles and order per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael J.
