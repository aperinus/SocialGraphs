Hoping to utilize their horse-riding skills, they decide to start a stage coach transportation business. They go to Buchanan City and ask local magnate Cal Drake if he is willing to sell them a stage coach. Instead, Drake offers them a franchise from his own stage coach line - a line out to bustling Crescent City.\n\nUpon arriving at Crescent City, Blair and Adams quickly realize that they had been bamboozled into paying for the line as Crescent City is a ghost town. The only residents are the mayor, Rocky O'Brien, and Dr. William Forsythe. The mayor is thrilled to get not only new residents to double the size of the town, but a stage coach line too. Blair protests that there are no customers to transport. The mayor says there is a way for Blair to get all the money he owes and more. There will be a contest in the next few days where the fastest team in a race will win a $25,000 government contract to deliver mail to the area. With Blair's luck returning, he also meets a telegraph crew, whom he saves from poisoning after drinking from a local water hole. In appreciation, the telegraph crew offers to run the line through Crescent City if Blair will give them laborers to build the telegraph line.\n\nBlair is able to get laborers to build the telegraph line and the population of Crescent City begins to skyrocket. Drake, upset that Blair has turned his con into a competing business, then decides to hire Blair to drive a gold shipment to Sacramento, only to ambush him. If Blair can get the gold to the destination, Drake will take $1,000 off of the original loan. Blair escapes the ambush and collects the money at gunpoint. Drake next hopes to stop Blair at the race. He gets his henchman to throw obstacles in Blair's way to defeat him by any means necessary. But despite all odds, Blair wins the race and the $25,000 reward.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Wayne]] as John Blair\n* [[Phyllis Fraser]] as Barbara Forsythe\n* [[Lew Kelly]] as Mayor Rocky O'Brien\n* [[Douglas Cosgrove]] as Cal Drake (Buchanan Stage Line)\n* [[Lane Chandler]] as Larry Adams (Blair's partner)\n* [[Sam Flint]] as Dr. William \"Doc\" Forsythe\n* [[Bob Kortman]] as Cherokee Joe (henchman)\n* [[Ed Cassidy (actor)|Ed Cassidy]] as Mr. Dodge (Pony Express manager)\n* [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] as Jim (Pony Express rider)\n* [[Merrill McCormick]] as Henchman Pete\n* [[Christian J.
