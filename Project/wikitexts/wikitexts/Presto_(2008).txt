The short is about Presto, a magician who is trying to perform a show, but his rabbit, Alec, would not cooperate with him until he gets his carrot. The short is a gag-filled homage to classic cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as well as the work of [[Tex Avery]]. ''Presto'' was written and directed by veteran Pixar animator [[Doug Sweetland]], in his directorial debut with the story written by Ted Mathot, Valerie Lapointe and Justin Wright.\n\nThe original idea for the short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from [[stage fright]]. This was considered to be too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in ''Presto'', the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.\n\nReaction to the short was positive, and reviewers of ''WALL-E'' film's home media release considered it to be an enjoyable special feature. ''Presto'' was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] and [[Academy Award]]. It was included in the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]] in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Vaudeville]] era magician Presto DiGiotagione{{ref label|name1|a|}} is famous for a [[hat-trick (magic trick)|hat trick]] wherein he pulls his [[rabbit]] Alec Azam{{ref label|name2|b|}} out of his [[top hat]]. A hungry and irritated Alec is locked in a cage, unable to reach his [[carrot]].<ref name=\"smith\"/> After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec. Anything that passes into either hat will emerge from the other.\n\nIntending to feed Alec, Presto realizes that his show is starting and rushes onstage instead. Alec refuses to cooperate with the act until he is given the carrot, and turns the hats against Presto in a variety of ways that lead to escalating degrees of humiliation, such as letting him catch his finger in a mousetrap, hit himself in the eye with an egg, and get his head sucked into a ventilation shaft; each of these mishaps is interpreted by the audience as being part of the act. Presto continues to antagonize Alec at the same time, first turning the carrot into a flower and later smashing it to pulp with a piece of a ladder, resulting in Alec sticking Presto's hand in an electrical socket via the wizard's hat.\n\nFed up with Alec's behavior, Presto storms backstage after him, but releases a set of hanging stage props and gets his foot caught in a rigging rope. He is yanked up into the [[fly system|fly space]] above the stage; when his foot comes loose, he falls and finds himself in danger of being crushed by both the props and a falling piano. Realizing this, Alec uses the hats' magic to save Presto, earning the audience's wild approval for the both of them. Presto gratefully gives Alec the carrot (having used his magician skills to return it to its original form) and starts to give him second billing on the posters advertising the act.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Presto screenshot1.jpg|thumb|alt=Film screenshot of a rabbit in a cage desperately reaching for a carrot sitting on a nearby table. The table has various jars on it, and posters for the magic show can be seen on the wall in the background.|In the opening shot, Alec is shown desperately stretching for an out of reach carrot.

Sweetland provides the dialogue-free voice acting for both of the movie's characters.<ref name=\"smith\">{{Cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/vault/supplement.pdf |title=Supplement to Dave Smith's 2006 book ''Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia'' |access-date=December 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Disney.com]]}}</ref> He pitched the film at the start of 2007 and began production late in the year, completing it in May 2008.<ref name=\"Douglas\"/> ''Presto''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> gag based format was heavily influenced by classic cartoons. ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons directed by [[Tex Avery]] were a major influence, with Alec being easily compared to [[Bugs Bunny]]. Other influences include ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', the [[Marx Brothers]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The character design for Presto was based on [[William Powell]].<ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite web|author=Douglas, Edward|title=Presto Director Doug Sweetland|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=February 6, 2009|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=52513|access-date=February 6, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Suite\">{{cite web|date=September 25, 2008 |url=http://hollywood-animated-films.suite101.com/article.cfm/interview_doug_sweetland_on_presto |title=Interview: Doug Sweetland on Presto |author=Von Riedemann, Dominic |publisher=Suite101.com |access-date=December 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113173609/http://hollywood-animated-films.suite101.com/article.cfm/interview_doug_sweetland_on_presto |archive-date=January 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe original scenario for the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.<ref name=\"Suite\" />\n\nTo achieve the highly formal environment, the filmmakers looked at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London, the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] and classic [[vaudeville]] theaters like the Geary in [[San Francisco]]\u2014which the crew took a tour through\u2014for set design ideas. Animating the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons proved an expensive proposition, even with the help of the crowd-generating ''[[MASSIVE (software)|MASSIVE]]'' software.\n\nEarly suggestions were to show cutaways of just a small portion of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience.<ref name=AWN /> To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, [[Ratatouille (film)|''Ratatouille'']]. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is [[Ratatouille (film)#Main characters|Skinner]]'s lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.\n\n==Reception==\nReaction to the short film was positive.
