The film, which also features [[John Agar]], [[Adele Mara]] and [[Forrest Tucker]], was written by [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]] and [[James Edward Grant]], and directed by [[Allan Dwan]]. The picture was a [[Republic Pictures]] production.\n\n''Sands of Iwo Jima'' was [[nominate]]d for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (John Wayne), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Recording]] ([[Daniel J.

Initially he is greatly disliked by the men of his squad, particularly the combat replacements, for the rigorous training he puts them through. He is especially despised by [[Private first class|PFC]] Peter \"Pete\" Conway, the arrogant, college-educated son of Colonel Sam Conway, whom Stryker served under and admired, and PFC Al Thomas who blames him for his demotion.\n\nWhen Stryker leads his squad in the [[Battle of Tarawa|invasion of Tarawa]], the men begin to appreciate his methods. The platoon commander, Lieutenant Baker, is killed seconds after he lands on the beach, and PFCs \"Farmer\" Soames and Choynski are wounded. The Marines are pinned down by a [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]]. Several more men are killed before Stryker is able to demolish the pillbox. Later on, Thomas stops for coffee when he goes to get ammunition for two comrades. As a result, he returns too late&nbsp;\u2014 the two Marines run out of ammunition, and Hellenopolis is killed, while Bass is badly wounded. On their first night, the squad is ordered to dig in and hold their positions. Alone and wounded, Bass begs for help. Conway considers Stryker brutal and unfeeling when he refuses to disobey orders and go to Bass's rescue. After the battle, when Stryker discovers about Thomas's [[dereliction of duty|dereliction]], he gets into a fistfight with him. A passing officer spots this serious offense, but Thomas claims that Stryker was merely teaching him [[judo]]. Later, a guilt-ridden Thomas abjectly apologizes to Stryker for his dereliction of duty.\n\nBack on leave, Stryker reveals a softer side while on leave in [[Honolulu]]. He picks up a [[bargirl]] and goes with her to her apartment. He becomes suspicious when he hears somebody in the next room, but upon investigation, finds only a hungry baby boy. Stryker gives the woman some money and leaves. Later, during a training exercise, McHugh, a replacement, drops a live [[hand grenade]]. Everybody drops to the ground, except Conway, who is distracted reading a letter from his wife. Stryker knocks him down, saving his life, and then proceeds to bawl him out in front of the platoon.\n\nStryker and his squad are deployed to the [[battle of Iwo Jima]] where they suffer heavy casualties within the first couple of hours. Stryker's squad is selected to be a part of the 40-man patrol assigned to charge up [[Mount Suribachi]]. During the charge, Eddie Flynn, Stein, and Fowler are killed. While the men are resting during a lull in the fighting, Stryker is shot dead by a Japanese soldier emerging from a [[spider hole]]. The remaining squad members find a letter he wrote but never sent to his son. In it, Stryker expresses emotions he wanted to say to him but never did. Moments later, the surviving squad members witness the iconic [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag raising on Iwo Jima]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Major General Graves B.

Although the original use and implied meaning are disputed, it typically described the action of arming an [[M1 Garand]] rifle by first locking the bolt back by pulling the charging handle rearward and then loading an 8 round [[Clip (firearms)|clip]] into its [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Saving Private Ryan: \"Lock and Load\" | website=Saving Private Ryan Online Encyclopedia | date=2009-04-11 | url=http://www.sproe.com/l/lock-and-load.html | access-date=2021-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe production used actual combat veterans from Iwo Jima in the film. The three survivors of the five Marines ([[Rene Gagnon]], [[Ira Hayes]], and [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]]) and a [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] who were credited with raising the second flag on [[Mount Suribachi]] during the actual battle appear briefly in the film just before the flag raising scene. Hayes was made the subject of a film biography, ''The Outsider'', and Bradley the subject of a book by his son James, ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. Subsequent research has established that the figures identified in the flag raising photograph as Bradley and Gagnon were actually Marine PFC [[Harold Schultz]] and Marine Cpl [[Harold Keller]].\n\nAlso appearing as themselves are 1st Lt. [[Harold Schrier]], who led the flag-raising patrol up Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima and helped raise the first flag, Col. [[David M. Shoup]], later [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] and recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] at Tarawa, and Lt. Col. [[Henry Pierson Crowe|Henry P. \"Jim\" Crowe]], commander of the 2nd Battalion 8th Marines at Tarawa, where he earned the U.S. [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].<ref>{{cite news|author=T. M.

Scenes were filmed at the Marine Corps Base at [[Camp Pendleton]], [[Leo Carrillo State Beach]], [[Santa Catalina Island (California)|Santa Catalina Island]], Channel Islands, Janss Conejo Ranch, Thousand Oaks, Republic Studios and Universal Studios. Actual combat footage from the [[Pacific War]] was also used in the film.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the television show ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (1997\u20132010), this is the favorite film of [[Cotton Hill]], father of main character [[Hank Hill]]. Hank recalls that, during his childhood, his father would travel around [[Texas]] searching for showings of this film.\n\nThe episode \"Call of Silence\" (2004) in ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'''s season 2 references the film and a documentary as shared background to [[Marine (military)|Marine]] history and legacy. The episode shows the NCIS character [[Timothy McGee]] watching the documentary ''[[To the Shores of Iwo Jima]]''; the character [[Anthony DiNozzo]] approaches and, in furtherance of the character's [[Shtick|schtick]] as an avowed and knowledgeable movie [[Fan (person)|buff]], begins talking about the theatrical film ''Sands of Iwo Jima'', some scenes of which were taken from the documentary.\n\nThe [[Southern rock]] band [[Drive-By Truckers]] have a song title \"The Sands of Iwo Jima\" on their 2004 album ''[[The Dirty South (album)|The Dirty South]]''. It is sung from the perspective of a young boy who has been exposed to World War 2 through old John Wayne movies. He asks his great-uncle, a World War II veteran, if ''The Sands of Iwo Jima'' represents the war properly; the old man smiles, shakes his head and responds, \"I never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[John Wayne filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title | id=0041841 | title=Sands of Iwo Jima}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=23383|title=Sands of Iwo Jima}}\n* {{Amg movie|42815|Sands of Iwo Jima}}\n* {{AFI film|id=26092|title=Sands of Iwo Jima}}\n\n{{Allan Dwan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sands Of Iwo Jima}}\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1940s war drama films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Battle of Iwo Jima films]]\n[[Category:Pacific War films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kiribati]]\n[[Category:Republic Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Allan Dwan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Harry Brown (writer)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Victor Young]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:1949 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
