It won the award for Best Artistic Contribution at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival of 1988]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/324/year/1988.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Drowning by Numbers |access-date=2009-07-26|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's plot centres on three married women \u2014 a [[grandmother]], her [[daughter]], and her [[niece]] \u2014 each named Cissie Colpitts. As the story progresses, each woman successively drowns her husband. The three Cissie Colpittses are played by [[Joan Plowright]], [[Juliet Stevenson]] and [[Joely Richardson]], while [[Bernard Hill]] plays the [[coroner]], Madgett, who is cajoled into covering up the three crimes.\n\nThe structure, with similar stories repeated three times, is reminiscent of a [[fairy tale]], most specifically 'The [[Billy Goats Gruff]]', because Madgett is constantly promised greater rewards as he tries his luck with each of the Cissies in turn. The link to [[folklore]] is further established by Madgett's son Smut, who recites the rules of various unusual games played by the characters as if they were ancient traditions. Many of these games are invented for the film, including:\n\n*Bees in the Trees\n*Dawn Card Castles\n*Deadman's Catch\n*Flights of Fancy (or Reverse Strip Jump)\n*The Great Death Game\n*[[Hangman (game)|Hangman]]'s [[Cricket]]\n*The [[Paper Chase (game)|Hare and Hounds]]\n*[[Sheep]] and [[Tide]]s\n\nIn ''Drowning by Numbers'', number-counting, the rules of games and the repetitions of the plot are all devices which emphasise structure. Through the course of the film each of the numbers 1 to 100 appear, the large majority in sequence, often seen in the background, sometimes spoken by the characters.<ref name=\"numberloc\">{{cite web | url=http://petergreenaway.org.uk/numberloc.htm | title=Number locations | access-date=31 August 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114024105/http://petergreenaway.org.uk/numberloc.htm | archive-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film is set and was shot in and around [[Southwold]], Suffolk, England, with key landmarks such as the Victorian water tower, [[Southwold Lighthouse]], and the estuary of the [[River Blyth, Suffolk|River Blyth]] clearly identifiable.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Joan Plowright]] - Cissie Colpitts\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] - Cissie Colpitts\n* [[Joely Richardson]] - Cissie Colpitts\n* [[Bernard Hill]] - Madgett\n* [[Jason Edwards (actor)|Jason Edwards]] - Smut\n* [[Bryan Pringle]] - Jake\n* [[Trevor Cooper]] - Hardy\n* [[David Morrissey]] - Bellamy\n* [[John Rogan (actor)|John Rogan]] - Gregory\n* [[Paul Mooney (actor)|Paul Mooney]] - Teigan\n* [[Jane Gurnett]] - Nancy\n* [[Kenny Ireland]] - Jonah Bognor\n* Michael Percival - Moses Bognor\n* [[Joanna Dickens]] - Mrs. Hardy\n* [[Janine Duvitski]] - Marina Bellamy\n}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Drowning by Numbers\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| cover        = Drowningbynumbers.jpg\n| released     = 1988\n| recorded     = 1988\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[contemporary classical music]], [[Minimalist music]], [[film score]]\n| length       = 44:48\n| label        = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], [[Caroline Records|Caroline]]\n| director     = Michael Nyman\n| producer     = [[David Cunningham (musician)|David Cunningham]] & Michael Nyman\n| prev_title   = [[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (opera)|The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]\n| prev_year        = 1988\n| year         = 1988\n| next_title   = [[La Travers\u00e9e de Paris (album)|La Travers\u00e9e de Paris]]\n| next_year        = 1989\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]] \n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} <ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r193472|first=Stephen|last=Cook}}</ref>\n| rev2      = \n| rev2Score = \n}}\nOn Greenaway's specific instructions, the film's musical score by [[Michael Nyman]] is entirely based on themes from the slow movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra|''Sinfonia Concertante'' in E flat]], bars 58 to 61 of which are heard in their original form immediately after each drowning. Greenaway alerted Nyman to the potential of this piece in the late 1970s and had previously used it as material for part of the score of his ''[[The Falls (1980 film)|The Falls]]'' and for ''[[\"The Masterwork\" Award Winning Fish-Knife]]'' and ''[[Tristram Shandy (opera)|Tristram Shandy]]''.<ref>Michael Nyman, sleevenotes to ''Drowning by Numbers'' CD, Virgin Records CDVE23, 1988</ref>  \"Trysting Fields\" is the most complicated use of the material: every [[appoggiatura]] from the movement, and no other material from the piece, is used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe album is the tenth by Nyman and the seventh to feature the [[Michael Nyman Band]].\n\n===Track listing===\n#\"Trysting Fields\"\n#\"Sheep and Tides\"\n#\"Great Death Game\"\n#\"Drowning by Number 3\"\n#\"Wheelbarrow Walk\"\n#\"Dead Man's Catch\"\n#\"Drowning by Number 2\"\n#\"Bees in Trees\"\n#\"Fish Beach\"\n#\"Wedding Tango\"\n#\"Crematorium Conspiracy\"\n#\"Knowing the Ropes\"\n#\"Endgame\"\n\nThe back cover of the album booklet has a large number \"58\".
