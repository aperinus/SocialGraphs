''Mother'' was Reynolds's first major film role in over 20 years. The film earned positive reviews and was Brooks's most financially successful film as a director.\n\n==Plot==\nSuccessful [[science fiction]] writer John Henderson is finalizing his second divorce. Perplexed by his issues with women, realizing that none of them supported or encouraged him, John decides to initiate an experiment that will help him understand what went wrong in his relationships: he moves back in with his widowed mother Beatrice, occupying the same bedroom he had as a child. His sports agent brother Jeff thinks John is oversensitive to their mother's criticisms, while John believes that their mother favors Jeff.\n\nJohn's relationship with his mother is characterized by constant bickering and power struggles; both are perfectionists strongly committed to their respective points of view. John believes she's overly critical of him, while Beatrice contends that he unfairly blames her for his personal failings. A rare bright spot in their relationship appears when she notices John's word processor and impresses him with her fast, flawless typing. Beatrice seems surprised by his interest in her life but is reluctant to discuss it.\n\nWhen Beatrice cancels her plans to visit Jeff, he has a meltdown and argues with his wife over needing to constantly contact his mother. Jeff's wife tells him that he may need to evaluate his relationship with his mother just as much as John. John and Beatrice go to the zoo, where they finally reach some common ground. When they return home, Jeff is waiting; upset by the aborted visit, he came to talk Beatrice into visiting for the weekend. All three argue and Jeff leaves alone, with John satisfied that Jeff is the \"sickie\" while John is \"pretty darn healthy to begin with.\"\n\nBeatrice tells John that she has a friend, Charles, who comes through San Francisco every few weeks and stays over a few days, but while John is there this visit will be just for one day. John is surprised that she would call someone she is intimate with not important, but she dismisses it, saying they \"just have sex occasionally\". John meets Charles, who knows a lot about John because, as he tells John, Beatrice brags about him when he's not around. Beatrice and Charles go to dinner; in the car they discuss the evening, with Beatrice refusing to have anything more than dinner because of her son's visit.\n\nWhile alone at the house, John discovers a box of novel and short story manuscripts that his mother wrote in her youth. He learns she was a skilled writer who went to college on a scholarship, only to have her talent discouraged by her husband and the then-prevailing social expectation that mothers should not have careers outside the home. John realizes now that his mother's [[passive aggression]] toward him stems from his career reminding her of her unfulfilled ambitions. Beatrice admits that John's observation is correct, and the two warmly reconcile.\n\nThe film ends with John meeting a single female fan of his novels, and Beatrice beginning to write a story based on John's moving in with her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as John Henderson\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Beatrice Henderson\n* Laura Weeks as Karen Henderson\n* [[Rob Morrow]] as Jeff Henderson\n* [[Isabel Glasser]] as Cheryl Henderson\n* Danielle Quinn as Jill Henderson\n* Spencer Klein as Josh Henderson\n* [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]] as the lawyer\n* [[John C.

Day turned down the offer; Reagan loved the script, and considered coming out of retirement for her first acting role in more than 40 years, but decided instead to stay home and care for her husband [[Ronald Reagan]], who was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Brooks then asked his good friend [[Carrie Fisher]] if she could send the script to her mother [[Debbie Reynolds]], who accepted the part.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/debbie-reynolds-biography-facts|title=7 Fun Facts About The Unsinkable Debbie Reynolds |website=biography.com|access-date=2016-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228195352/http://www.biography.com/news/debbie-reynolds-biography-facts|archive-date=2016-12-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Reynolds hadn't had a starring role since the late 1960s.\n\n''Mother'' was filmed on location in and around the Sausalito, Greenbrae, and Tiburon, California areas, with additional shooting in San Francisco.

The site's consensus states \"Albert Brooks' pugnacious insight is in fine form throughout ''Mother'', a gentle showcase for the comedic curmudgeon and a sweetly acidic Debbie Reynolds.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|1075959-mother|Mother}}</ref> Roger Ebert of ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' gave ''Mother'' 3.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing that while the premise seemed like the setup for a cheap sitcom, Brooks \"is much too smart to settle for the obvious gags and payoffs...the dialogue in ''Mother'' is written so carefully that some lines carry two or three nuances.\" The audience laughter wasn't a reaction to obvious punchlines, wrote Ebert, \"but the laughter of recognition, of insight, even sometimes of squirmy discomfort, as the truths hit close to home\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mother-1997 | title=Review: ''Mother'' | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=January 10, 1997 | website=RogerEbert.com | access-date=July 6, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Mother'' has won the most awards of the films Brooks has directed.
