Inspired by a wide variety of sources, including [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' and its 1870 sequel ''[[Around the Moon]]'', the film follows a group of astronomers who travel to the [[Moon]] in a cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon's surface, escape from an underground group of [[Selene|Selenites]] (lunar inhabitants), and return to Earth with a captive Selenite. Its [[ensemble cast]] of French theatrical performers is led by M\u00e9li\u00e8s himself as the main character Professor Barbenfouillis. The film features the overtly theatrical style for which M\u00e9li\u00e8s became famous.\n\nScholars have commented upon the film's extensive use of [[pataphysical]] and [[anti-imperialist]] satire, as well as on its wide influence on later film-makers and its artistic significance within the French theatrical ''[[f\u00e9erie]]'' tradition. Though the film disappeared into obscurity after M\u00e9li\u00e8s's retirement from the film industry, it was rediscovered around 1930, when M\u00e9li\u00e8s's importance to the history of cinema was beginning to be recognised by film devotees. An original [[Film colorization|hand-colored]] print was discovered in 1993 and restored in 2011.\n\n''A Trip to the Moon'' was an internationally popular success on its release, and was extensively [[film piracy|pirated]] by other studios, especially in the United States. Its unusual length, lavish production values, innovative special effects, and emphasis on storytelling were markedly influential on other film-makers and ultimately on the development of narrative film as a whole. It was ranked 84th of the 100 greatest films of the 20th century by ''[[The Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{citation|author=Village Voice Critics' Poll|title=100 Best Films|work=[[filmsite.org]]|publisher=[[American Movie Classics|AMC]]|year=2001|url=http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html|access-date=2 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613044825/http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html|archive-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> The film remains M\u00e9li\u00e8s' best known, and the moment in which the capsule lands in the Moon's eye remains one of the most iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema. It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the [[science fiction film]] genre and, more generally, as one of the most influential films in cinema history.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Voyage dans la lune title card.png|thumb|Title card]]\nAt a meeting of the Astronomy Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis,{{efn|Proper names taken from the authorized English-language catalogue description of the film: see {{Harvnb|M\u00e9li\u00e8s|2011a|pp=227\u201329}}.}}{{Efn|Barbenfouillis is French for \"Tangled-Beard\".<ref name=Rosen748>{{Harvnb|Rosen|1987|p=748}}</ref> The name probably parodies President Impey Barbicane, the hero of Jules Verne's ''From the Earth to the Moon''; M\u00e9li\u00e8s had previously used the name in a different context in 1891, for the stage magic act \"Le D\u00e9capit\u00e9 Recalcitrant\".<ref name=Essai111/>}} proposes an expedition to the [[Moon]].

A space capsule in the shape of a bullet is built, along with a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \"marines\", most of whom are played by young women in sailors' outfits. The [[Man in the Moon]] watches the capsule as it approaches, and, in an iconic shot, it hits him in the eye.{{Efn|The image is a [[visual pun]]: the phrase ''dans l'\u0153il'', literally \"in the eye,\" is the French equivalent of the English word \"[[bullseye (target)|bullseye]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2011|p=123}}</ref>}}\n\nLanding safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of [[space suits]] or breathing apparatus) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a [[comet]] passes, the [[Big Dipper]] appears with human faces peering out of each star, old [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and [[Phoebe (Titaness)|Phoebe]], goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.\n\nAt this point, a Selenite (an [[insect]]oid [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, [[Selene]]) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear, and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.\n\nThe astronomers run back to their capsule while continuing to hit the pursuing Selenites, and five get inside. The sixth astronomer, Barbenfouillis himself, uses a rope to tip the capsule over a ledge on the Moon and into space. A Selenite tries to seize the capsule at the last minute. Astronomer, capsule, and Selenite fall through space and land in an ocean on Earth, where they are rescued by a ship and towed ashore. The final sequence (missing from some prints of the film) depicts a celebratory parade in honour of the travellers' return, including a display of the captive Selenite and the unveiling of a commemorative statue bearing the motto \"[[Labor omnia vincit]]\".{{Efn| \"Labor omnia vincit\" is [[Latin]] for \"work conquers all\".<ref name=Frazer98>{{Harvnb|Frazer|1979|p=98}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:George Melies.jpg|thumb|upright=0.68|Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]\nWhen ''A Trip to the Moon'' was made, film actors performed anonymously and no credits were given; the practice of supplying [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] in films was a later innovation.<ref name=Ezra13>{{Harvnb|Ezra|2000|p=13}}</ref> Nonetheless, the following cast details can be reconstructed from available evidence:\n* [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] as Professor Barbenfouillis.<ref name=Technicolor186>{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|p=186}}</ref><ref name=Malthete125>{{Harvnb|Malth\u00eate|Mannoni|2008|p=125}}</ref> M\u00e9li\u00e8s, a pioneering French film-maker and magician now generally regarded as the first person to recognise the potential of [[narrative film]],<ref name=Cook18/> had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of ''[[Cinderella (1899 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1899) and ''[[Joan of Arc (1900 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1900).<ref>{{Harvnb|Malth\u00eate|Mannoni|2008|p=106}}</ref> His extensive involvement in all of his films as director, producer, writer, designer, technician, publicist, editor, and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic ''[[auteur]]s''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ezra|2000|p=17}}</ref> Speaking about his work late in life, M\u00e9li\u00e8s commented: \"The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas forced me to sometimes play the leading role in my films&nbsp;...

Cinema historians, the mid-20th-century French writer [[Georges Sadoul]] first among them, have frequently suggested [[H. G.

Though he often moved his camera when making actualities outdoors (for example, 15 of [[Paris Exposition, 1900 (film series)|his 19 short films about the 1900 Paris Exposition]] were shot with a moving camera setup), he considered a theatrical viewpoint more appropriate for the fiction films staged in his studio.<ref>{{Harvnb|Malth\u00eate|2002|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;2}}</ref>}} This stylistic choice was one of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's first and biggest innovations.\n\nAlthough he had initially followed the popular trend of the time by making mainly [[actuality film]]s (short \"[[slice of life]]\" [[documentary film]]s capturing actual scenes and events for the camera), in his first few years of filming M\u00e9li\u00e8s gradually moved into the far less common genre of fictional narrative films, which he called his ''sc\u00e8nes compos\u00e9es'' or \"artificially arranged scenes\".<ref name=Ezra13/> The new genre was extensively influenced by M\u00e9li\u00e8s's experience in theatre and magic, especially his familiarity with the popular French ''[[f\u00e9erie]]'' stage tradition, known for their [[fantasy]] plots and spectacular visuals, including lavish scenery and mechanically worked stage effects.<ref name=Cambridge>{{citation|first=Laurence|last=Senelick|title=F\u00e9erie|work=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|publisher=[[Credo Reference]]|year=2000|url-access=subscription |url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/cupthea/f%C3%A9erie/0|access-date=11 March 2014}}</ref> In an advertisement he proudly described the difference between his innovative films and the actualities still being made by his contemporaries: \"these fantastic and artistic films reproduce stage scenes and create a new genre entirely different from the ordinary cinematographic views of real people and real streets.\"<ref name=Kovacs>{{citation|title=Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s and the ''F\u00e9erie''|first=Katherine Singer|last=Kov\u00e1cs|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1\u201313|date=Autumn 1976|doi=10.2307/1225446|jstor=1225446}}</ref>\n\nBecause ''A Trip to the Moon'' preceded the development of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as [[Edwin S. Porter]] and [[D. W. Griffith]], it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dancyger|2007|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Rather, each camera setup in M\u00e9li\u00e8s's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cook|2004|p=14}}</ref>{{efn|The specification of ''visible'' editing is necessary because, in reality, M\u00e9li\u00e8s used much splicing and editing within his scenes, not only for stop-trick effects but also to break down his long scenes into smaller [[take]]s during production. Thus, ''A Trip to the Moon'' actually contains more than fifty shots.

For example, some recent academicians, while not necessarily denying M\u00e9li\u00e8s's influence on film, have argued that his works are better understood as spectacular theatrical creations rooted in the 19th-century stage tradition of the ''f\u00e9erie''.<ref>{{citation|last1=Gaudreault|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Le Forestier|first2=Laurent|publisher=[[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle]]|title=M\u00e9li\u00e8s, carrefour des attractions|year=2011|type=academic conference program|url=http://www.ccic-cerisy.asso.fr/melies11.html|access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Tom Gunning has argued that to fault M\u00e9li\u00e8s for not inventing a more intimate and cinematic storytelling style is to misunderstand the purpose of his films; in Gunning's view, the first decade of film history may be considered a \"cinema of attractions,\" in which filmmakers experimented with a presentational style based on spectacle and direct address rather than on intricate editing. Though the attraction style of filmmaking declined in popularity in favour of a more integrated \"story film\" approach, it remains an important component of certain types of cinema, including [[science fiction film]]s, [[musical film|musicals]], and [[avant-garde film]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cook|2004|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Trip to the Moon Statue Color.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.36|The statue of Barbenfouillis, seen here in a frame from the hand-colored print, may be intended to satirise colonialism.<ref name=SolomonSatire/>]]\n\nWith its pioneering use of themes of scientific ambition and discovery, ''A Trip to the Moon'' is sometimes described as the first [[science fiction film]].<ref name=Creed58>{{citation|last=Creed|first=Barbara|title=Darwin's Screens: Evolutionary Aesthetics, Time and Sexual Display in the Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTV9jLGsOFQC&pg=PA58|year=2009|publisher=Academic Monographs|isbn=978-0-522-85258-5|page=58}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Fischer|first=Dennis|title=Science Fiction Film Directors, 1895\u20131998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7msrAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA9|date=17 June 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8505-5|page=9}}</ref>{{efn|name=SF|M\u00e9li\u00e8s's earlier film ''[[Gugusse and the Automaton]]'' has also been nominated as the first science fiction film.<ref name=Menville>{{citation|last1=Menville|first1=Douglas|first2=R.|last2=Reginald|title=Things to Come: An Illustrated History of the Science Fiction Film|location=New York|publisher=Times Books|year=1977|page=3}}</ref>}} ''A Short History of Film'' argues that it codified \"many of the basic generic situations that are still used in science fiction films today\".<ref name=Dixon12/> However, several other genre designations are possible; M\u00e9li\u00e8s himself advertised the film as a ''pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 grand spectacle'',<ref name=Malthete125/> a term referring to a type of spectacular Parisian stage [[extravaganza]] popularised by [[Jules Verne]] and [[Adolphe d'Ennery]] in the second half of the nineteenth century.<ref>{{citation|last=Margot|first=Jean-Michel|chapter=Introduction|editor-last=Verne|editor-first=Jules|title=Journey Through the Impossible|location=Amherst, N.Y.|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2003|isbn=1-59102-079-4|page=13}}</ref> [[Richard Abel (cultural historian)|Richard Abel]] describes the film as belonging to the ''[[f\u00e9erie]]'' genre,<ref name=Cine/> as does Frank Kessler.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2011}}</ref> It can also be described simply as a [[trick film]], a catch-all term for the popular early film genre of innovative, special effects-filled shorts\u2014a genre M\u00e9li\u00e8s himself had codified and popularised in his earlier works.<ref name=Ideas>{{citation|last=Parkinson|first=David|title=100 Ideas That Changed Film|location=London|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=2012|page=19}}</ref>\n\n''A Trip to the Moon'' is highly satirical in tone, poking fun at nineteenth-century science by exaggerating it in the format of an adventure story.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frazer|1979|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The film makes no pretense whatsoever to be scientifically plausible; the real waves in the splashdown scene are the only concession to realism.<ref name=Essai111/> The film scholar Alison McMahan calls ''A Trip to the Moon'' one of the earliest examples of [[pataphysical]] film, saying it \"aims to show the illogicality of logical thinking\" with its satirically portrayed inept scientists, anthropomorphic moon face, and impossible transgressions of laws of physics.<ref name=McMahan4>{{citation|last=McMahan|first=Alison|title=The Films of Tim Burton: Animating Live Action in Contemporary Hollywood|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-1566-0|page=4}}</ref> The film historian Richard Abel believes M\u00e9li\u00e8s aimed in the film to \"invert the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in a riot of the carnivalesque\".<ref name=McMahan4/> Similarly, the literary and film scholar [[Edward Wagenknecht]] described the film as a work \"satirizing the pretensions of professors and scientific societies while simultaneously appealing to man's sense of wonder in the face of an unexplored universe.\"<ref name=Wagenknecht35>{{Harvnb|Wagenknecht|1962|pp=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a strong [[anti-imperialist]] vein in the film's satire.<ref name=EzraSatire>{{Harvnb|Ezra|2000|pp=120\u201321}}</ref><ref name=SolomonSatire>{{Harvnb|Solomon|2011|pp=9\u201312}}</ref> The film scholar Matthew Solomon notes that the last part of the film (the parade and commemoration sequence missing in some prints) is especially forceful in this regard.

Finally, in that same year, M\u00e9li\u00e8s had a sudden fit of rage and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frazer|1979|p=54}}</ref> In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the [[Gare Montparnasse]] in Paris.<ref>{{Harvnb|Malth\u00eate|Mannoni|2008|p=10}}</ref> ''A Trip to the Moon'' was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.<ref name=Solomon3/>\n\nThanks to the efforts of film history devot\u00e9es, especially [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], [[Jean George Auriol]], and [[Paul Gilson]], M\u00e9li\u00e8s and his work were rediscovered in the late 1920s.

Mauclaire obtained a copy from Paris in October 1929, and LeRoy found one from London in 1930, though both prints were incomplete; Mauclaire's lacked the first and last scenes, and LeRoy's was missing the entire final sequence featuring the parade and commemorative statue. These prints were occasionally screened at retrospectives (including the Gala M\u00e9li\u00e8s), avant-garde cinema showings, and other special occasions, sometimes in presentations by M\u00e9li\u00e8s himself.<ref name=S35>{{Harvnb|Solomon|2011|pp=3\u20135}}</ref>\n\nFollowing LeRoy's death in 1932, his film collection was bought by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of ''A Trip to the Moon'', under the direction of MoMA's film curator [[Iris Barry]], opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians<ref name=S35/> and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema.<ref name=Solomon6>{{Harvnb|Solomon|2011|p=6}}</ref> LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]'s print.<ref name=S35/> A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the [[La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que M\u00e9li\u00e8s|Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que M\u00e9li\u00e8s]], a foundation set up by the M\u00e9li\u00e8s family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Solomon|2011|p=8}}</ref>\n\n=== Hand-colored print ===\n\n[[File:Melies_color_Voyage_dans_la_lune.jpg|upright=1.36|thumb|A frame from the restored hand-colored print of ''A Trip to the Moon'']]\n\nNo hand-colored prints of ''A Trip to the Moon'' were known to survive until 1993, when one was given to the [[Filmoteca de Catalunya]] by an anonymous donor as part of a collection of two hundred silent films.<ref name=Technicolor12>{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|p=12}}</ref> It is unknown whether this version, a hand-colored print struck from a second-generation negative, was colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's lab, but the perforations used imply that the copy was made before 1906.

Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] for the hand-colored print, and Gimenez accepted. Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film, but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass, none believed restoration to be possible. Consequently, Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames, discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together, and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable.<ref name=Technicolor183>{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|p=183}}</ref> Between 2002 and 2005, various digitisation efforts allowed 13,375 fragments of images from the print to be saved.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|pp=183\u201384}}</ref> In 2010, a complete restoration of the hand-colored print was launched by Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage.<ref name=Technicolor12/> The digitised fragments of the hand-colored print were reassembled and restored, with missing frames recreated with the help of a black-and-white print in the possession of the M\u00e9li\u00e8s family, and time-converted to run at an authentic silent-film speed, 16 frames per second.
