Starring [[Holly Hunter]], [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Sam Neill]], and [[Anna Paquin]] in her first major acting role, the film focuses on a [[Elective mutism|mute]] Scottish woman who travels to a remote part of [[New Zealand]] with her young daughter after her arranged marriage to a frontiersman.\n\nA co-production between New Zealand, [[Australia]] and [[France]], ''The Piano'' was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$140.2&nbsp;million worldwide against its US$7&nbsp;million budget. Hunter and Paquin both received high praise for their performances. In 1993, the film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], making Jane Campion the first female director to ever receive this award. It won three [[Academy Awards]] out of eight total nominations in March 1994: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Hunter, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Paquin, and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Campion. Paquin was 11 years old at the time and remains the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees|second-youngest actor]] to win an Oscar in a competitive category.\n\nThe plot has similarities to [[Jane Mander]]'s 1920 novel \"The Story of a New Zealand River\", but also substantial differences. Campion says that ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' were her inspirations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/print/0009/field-piano.html|title=Field Notes: The Purloined Piano?|publisher=Lingua Franca|first=Hillary|last=Frey|date=September 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1800s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/the-piano-review-jane-campion-holly-hunter |title=The Piano review \u2013 Jane Campion's drama still hits all the right notes &#124; The Piano |work=The Guardian |date= 15 June 2018|accessdate=2022-02-17}}</ref> an [[Elective mutism|electively mute]] [[Scots people|Scotswoman]] named Ada McGrath is sold by her father into marriage to a New Zealand frontiersman named Alisdair Stewart, bringing her young daughter Flora with her. Ada has not spoken a word since she was six and no one, including herself, knows why. She expresses herself through her piano playing and through sign language, for which her daughter, in [[Parentification|parent-child role]] reversal, has served as her interpreter. Flora is the product of a relationship with a piano teacher whom Ada believed she had seduced through mental [[telepathy]], but who \"became frightened and stopped listening\" and thus left her.\n\nAda, Flora, and their belongings, including a hand-crafted piano, are deposited on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The following day, Alisdair arrives with a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] crew and his neighbor, George Baines, a fellow forester and retired sailor who has adopted many of the M\u0101ori customs, including [[Ta moko|tattooing his face]]. Alisdair at first tells Ada there  aren't enough bearers for the piano, then refuses to go back for it saying they all must make sacrifices. Ada, in turn, is cold to him and is determined to be reunited with her piano. Unable to persuade Alisdair, Ada and Flora visit George with a note asking to be taken to the piano and although he cannot read he agrees. He is spellbound by Ada's playing and offers Alisdair land he coveted in exchange for the instrument, and lessons from Ada. Alisdair consents, oblivious to George's attraction to her. Ada is enraged but cannot resist being able to play when George says he wants to learn by listening. Very soon,  George proposes Ada can earn her piano back at a rate of one piano key per \"lesson\", provided he can observe her and do \"things he likes\" while she plays. She agrees, but negotiates for a number of lessons equal to the number of black keys only. Ada continues to rebuff Alisdair's affectionless overtures while beginning to explore her sensuality with George, who bargains for more intimacy in exchange for greater numbers of keys, while Ada holds back a great deal still. Realizing she is not willing to commit to him emotionally, George gives up and simply returns the piano to Ada, saying their arrangement \"is making you a whore, and me wretched\", and what he really wants is for her to actually care for him.\n\nDespite having her piano back, Ada finds herself missing George. She returns soon after and does not hold back; Alisdair hears them having sex as he walks by George's house and then watches them through a crack in the wall. Outraged, he follows her the next day and confronts her in the forest, where he attempts to force himself on her, despite her intense resistance. He eventually exacts a promise from Ada she will not see George.\n\nSoon afterwards, Ada orders Flora to take a package to George containing a single piano key inscribed with a declaration of love reading, \"Dear George, you have my heart. Ada McGrath\". Flora argues, then brings the piano key to Alisdair instead. After reading the love note burnt onto the piano key, Alisdair runs home with an axe, with Flora on his heels, and cuts off Ada's index finger in a rage, to deprive Ada\u2019s ability to play the piano. He then sends a sobbing Flora to George with the severed finger wrapped in cloth, saying if the latter ever attempts to see Ada again, he will \u201cchop off another, and another, and another\u201d. Later that night, while touching Ada in her sleep, Alisdair hears what he believes to be Ada's voice inside his head, asking him to let George take her away. Deeply shaken, he goes to the man's house and asks if she has ever spoken words to him.  George assures him she has not. They depart from the same beach on which she first landed in New Zealand. While being rowed to the ship with her baggage and Ada's piano tied onto a M\u0101ori longboat, Ada asks George to throw the piano overboard. As it sinks, she deliberately tangles her foot in the rope trailing after it. She is pulled overboard but, deep under water, changes her mind and kicks free and is pulled to safety.\n\nIn an [[epilogue]], Ada describes her new life with George and Flora in [[Nelson, New Zealand]], where she has started to give piano lessons in their new home, and her severed finger has been replaced with a metal finger made by George. Ada describes taking speech lessons and practicing, and sometimes dreaming of her piano's resting place in the ocean and of herself still tethered to it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Ada McGrath\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as George Baines\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Alisdair Stewart\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Flora McGrath\n* [[Kerry Walker]] as Aunt Morag\n* [[Genevieve Lemon]] as Nessie\n* [[Tungia Baker]] as Hira\n* [[Ian Mune]] as Reverend\n* Peter Dennett as Head seaman\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Mana\n* George Boyle as Ada's father\n* [[Rose McIver]] as Angel\n* [[Mika Haka]] as Tahu\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nCasting the role of Ada was a difficult process.
