After the line was created, Tarek is now considered to live in West Beirut (the mixed part and Tarek is Muslim himself) and is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed (and is situated in East Beirut no longer accessible to West Beirut residents), the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave the country; but his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, an orphaned Christian girl living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Zeytouni Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there. Family tensions rise. Later on and as he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to a nationwide tragedy.\n\n==Cast==\n* Rami Doueiri as Tarek\n* [[Mohamad Chamas]] as Omar\n* Rola Al-Amin as May\n* [[Carmen Lebbos]] as Hala, Tarek's mother\n* [[Joseph Bou Nassar]] as Riad, Tarek's father\n* [[Liliane Nemri]] as Nahida (a neighbor)\n* [[Le\u00efla Karam]] as Brothel Madam (Oum Walid)\n* Hassan Farhat as Roadblock Militiaman\n* [[Mahmoud Mabsout]] as Baker\n* [[Fadi Abou Khalil]] as Bakery Militiaman\n\n==Awards==\n* ''[[Prix Fran\u00e7ois Chalais]]'' at the [[Directors' Fortnight|Directors' fortnight]] of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] (1998)\n* ''FIPRESCI International Critics' Award'' at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (1998)\n* ''Best First Film'' at the [[Carthage Film Festival]] (1998)\n* ''Youth Jury Award'' at the [[Valladolid International Film Festival]] (1998)\n* ''SAA Script Award'' at the [[Fribourg International Film Festival]] (1999)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 71st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Lebanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0157183|title=West Beirut}}\n\n{{Fran\u00e7ois Chalais Prize}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s war drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Arabic-language films]]\n[[Category:Lebanese Civil War films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1975]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]\n[[Category:Lebanese drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ziad Doueiri]]\n\n\n{{war-drama-film-stub}}\n{{lebanon-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
