The film depicts the troubled production behind the 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. The film's title is a reference to the original production number of ''Citizen Kane''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1940, [[Orson Welles]] (Schreiber), [[RKO]] studio head [[George Schaefer (movie producer)|George Schaefer]] (Scheider), and [[screenwriter]] [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] (Malkovich) struggle in making what will be considered the greatest [[United States|American]] film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Welles and Mankiewicz attend a party at [[Hearst Castle]] where meeting the hypocritical and tyrannical [[William Randolph Hearst]] (Cromwell) gives Welles the inspiration to make a film about Hearst's life. Mankiewicz is against it because he knows Hearst's wrath will be horrible but Welles says this is the film. Mankiewicz finally agrees.\n\nAfter learning from the [[gossip columnist]] [[Hedda Hopper]], who had viewed a press screening, that Welles' film is actually a thinly veiled and exceptionally unflattering biography of him, publishing tycoon Hearst uses his immense power and influence to try to deny the release of the picture. Hearst's mistress, actress [[Marion Davies]] (Griffith), endures the embarrassment of having their private lives exposed and vilified. Later on in their relationship many years after the release of ''Citizen Kane'' she gives Hearst money when his finances begin to diminish (by selling all the jewellery he gave her and giving him the money in the form of a check).\n\nIn the end, after considerable delays and harassment, plus the disintegration of the professional relationship between Welles and Mankiewicz and a costly blow to Schaefer's career, the film is finally released. Its publicity is muted by Hearst's ban on its mention in all his publications and its commercial success is limited. Welles ultimately has the satisfaction of having created one of the most critically acclaimed films of all\ntime.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Orson Welles]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Herman J.
