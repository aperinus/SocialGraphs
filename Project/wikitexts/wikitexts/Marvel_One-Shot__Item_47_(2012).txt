It is a follow up and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''The Avengers'', and is the third [[Marvel One-Shot]] short film set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Louis D'Esposito]], with a screenplay by [[Eric Pearson]], and stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Jesse Bradford]], [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]], and [[Titus Welliver]], with Hern\u00e1ndez reprising [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|his role]] from the film series. In ''Item 47'', two civilians come across a [[Chitauri]] gun and use it to commit crimes.\n\nThe short helped lead to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ordering a television series spin-off, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', which began airing in September 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nBennie and Claire, a down-on-their-luck couple, find a discarded [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] gun (\"Item 47\") left over from the attack on New York City in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. The couple use it to rob a few banks, drawing the attention of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which assigns agents [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]] and [[Felix Blake]] to retrieve the weapon and \"neutralize\" the couple. Agent Sitwell tracks the couple down to a motel room that gets wrecked in the subsequent confrontation, and the stolen money gets destroyed. Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D., with Bennie assigned to the R&D 'think-tank' to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology, and Claire becoming Blake's assistant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Jesse Bradford by David Shankbone.jpg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Lizzy Caplan at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2 = 110\n | alt2 = \n | footer = [[Jesse Bradford]] (left) and [[Lizzy Caplan]] (right), newcomers to the MCU, starred in the film.\n}}\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Claire Wise<ref name=\"Item47\" />\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Bennie Pollack<ref name=\"Item47\" />\n* [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]] as [[Jasper Sitwell (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jasper Sitwell]]<ref name=\"Item47\" />\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as [[Felix Blake]]<ref name=\"Item47\" />\n\n==Production==\n''Item 47'' was directed by Marvel Studios co-president [[Louis D'Esposito]], written by [[Eric Pearson]],<ref name=\"Item47\" /> and music by [[Christopher Lennertz]].<ref name=\"Lennertz\" /> The short film, which was filmed over four days,<ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> has a runtime of 12 minutes, longer than the previous films, which were no longer than 4 minutes.<ref name=\"Item47\" /> Pearson and D'Esposito had the idea for the short after watching ''The Avengers'' and thinking, \"New York is a mess.
