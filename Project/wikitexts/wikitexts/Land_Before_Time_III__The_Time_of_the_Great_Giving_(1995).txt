It is the second sequel to ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' and the third film in the [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|film franchise]].\n\n== Plot ==\nA [[meteorite]] impacts near Great Valley, which causes a drought to threaten the [[dinosaur]]s' lives. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of Great Valley, who have previously lived in relative peace and harmony. When the inter-species situation deteriorates, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water to keep the peace in the valley. They are pursued by a trio of arrogant teenage dinosaurs consisting of Hyp the ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', Mutt the ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]'', and Nod the ''[[Nodosaurus]]''. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the trio emerges and claims the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies. During the pursuit, the bullies are chased away by a [[wasp]], and the children discover the reason behind the blockage of the water source.\n\nBefore they can return and tell the other inhabitants the truth, [[lightning]] hits a tree, and ignites a [[fire]] that spreads rapidly throughout the valley. The fire then devastates the valley destroying most of the green food. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of Mysterious Beyond. When the children tell the adults of their discovery, disagreements about what to do erupts among the adults, preventing them from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Nod, and Mutt set out into Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first. Anticipating the danger Hyp and his cohorts have gotten into and recognizing commonality with them, Littlefoot and the others follow to help if necessary. It becomes so when Hyp jumps into a [[tar pit]] after mistaking it for water. He screams for help, but Mutt and Nod do not save him. Instead, they argue about which one of them must save him, wondering what if each of them gets stuck. But Littlefoot cuts in, and tells Mutt and Nod that Hyp is stuck in the tar pit. Then, he hatches a plan to haul Hyp out. Finally, Littlefoot and the others haul him out of the tar. Soon afterwards, the adults arrive, and Hyp is harshly scolded by his aggressive and grumpy father, leading Cera's dad to realize that he is too hard on Cera sometimes and, after advising Hyp\u2019s dad to be softer on his son, that they need to work together to find the water.\n\nBefore they are able to take further steps, the herd is suddenly attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptors|raptors]]''. The pursuit leads to a dam of boulders created by the rock slide that caused the drought. As the raptors and the adults battle, the children, including Hyp and his cronies, work together to break the dam. They all watch as the freed water washes away the raptors. The water also puts out the fires which are still burning in the valley. Finally, they manage to survive and land on the opposite bank. Now the herd is able to return to Great Valley. The herd returns to Great Valley, which now has enough water for them. However, when they return home, the fire has destroyed most of their green food. The now devastated plants in the valley are beyond repair from the fire. However, despite being irreparable, the dinosaurs find the spots in Great Valley where lots of green food still grows. They proportionately move from one verdant area to another and share everything they find. This pattern results in the event being called the Time of the Great Giving.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Scott McAfee]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Littlefoot|Littlefoot]]\n* [[Candace Hutson]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Cera|Cera]]\n* Heather Hogan as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky|Ducky]]\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Petrie|Petrie]] / [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Hyp, Mutt and Nod|Mutt]] / ''[[Iguanodon]]''\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Spike|Spike]] / [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Kosh|Kosh]]\n* [[Whit Hertford]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Hyp, Mutt and Nod|Hyp]]\n* [[Scott Menville]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Hyp, Mutt and Nod|Nod]]\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Grandpa and Grandma Longneck|Grandpa Longneck]]\n* [[Linda Gary]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Grandpa and Grandma Longneck|Grandma Longneck]] / Mother ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]''\n* [[Nicholas Guest]] as [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Hyp's Father|Hyp's Father]] \n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as [[Stegosaurus]] / [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Ducky and Spike's Mother|Spike & Ducky's mother]] / [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Petrie's mother|Petrie's Mother]]\n* [[John Ingle]] as Narrator / [[List of The Land Before Time characters#Daddy Topps|Cera's father]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the raptors\n\n==Songs==\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Michele Brourman]] and [[Amanda McBroom]]\n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       = \n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n\n| title1          = When You're Big\n| extra1          = [[Whit Hertford]], [[Jeff Bennett]] & [[Scott Menville]]\n\n| title2          = Standing Tough\n| extra2          = [[John Ingle]]\n\n| title3          = Kids Like Us\n| extra3          = [[Scott McAfee]], [[Candace Hutson]], Heather Hogan & [[Jeff Bennett]]\n\n| title4          = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n| extra4          =\n\n}}\n\n== Reception and criticism ==\nIn a brief ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' review, Michael Sauter criticized some modernisms in the dialogue but said that, \"Littlefoot and his friends still retain their youthful charm.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/1995/12/08/land-time-iii-time-great-giving/ |title=Video Review: THE LAND BEFORE TIME III: The Time of the Great Giving |access-date=2009-12-29 |last=Sauter |first=Michael |date=1995-12-08 |work=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly }}</ref> In August 2014, the ''[[New York Post]]'' ranked each of the 13 ''Land Before Time'' films released up to that point and placed ''The Time of the Great Giving'' at number 2, noting the \"genuinely terrifying\" velociraptors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Gregory E.|title=A rundown of the best and worst 'The Land Before Time' movies|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/13/a-rundown-of-the-best-and-worst-the-land-before-time-movies/|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=2016-12-30|date=2014-08-13}}</ref> The film holds a 60% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average critic score of 5.4 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_land_before_time_iii_the_time_of_great_giving |title=The Land Before TIme III: The Time of the Great Giving (1995) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2002 book ''Welcome to the Desert of the Real'', Slovenian [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] cited a song from this movie, \"When You're Big\", as an example of \"hegemonic liberal multiculturalist ideology.\" Quoting the song's lyrics, \u017di\u017eek wrote, \"The same message is repeated again and again: we are all different \u2014 some of us are big, some are small; some know how to fight, others know how to flee \u2014 but we should learn to live with these differences, to perceive them as something which makes our lives richer.\" \u017di\u017eek notes the inconsistency of this vision in the fact that the dinosaurs prey on each other, and have other irreconcilable differences: \"The problem, of course, is: how far do we go? It takes all sorts - does that mean nice and brutal, poor and rich, victims and torturers? The reference to the dinosaur kingdom is especially ambiguous here, with its brutal character of animal species devouring each other - is this also one of the things that 'need to be done to make our life fun'? The very inner inconsistency of this vision of the prelapsarian 'land before time' thus bears witness to how the message of collaboration-in-differences is [[ideology]] at its purest.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=  \u017di\u017eek |first=Slavoj |date=2002 |title=Welcome to the Desert of the Real |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb1NBAAAQBAJ&q=%22zizek%22+Hegemonic+liberal+multiculturalist+ideology+dinosaurs |publisher= Verso Books |pages= 68\u201370 |isbn= 1781680310 |author-link=Slavoj \u017di\u017eek }}</ref>\n\nThe film won \"[[Annie Award for Best Animated Home Entertainment Production|Best Animated Video Production]]\" at the [[24th Annie Awards]] in 1996,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://annieawards.org/legacy/24th-annie-awards |title=Annie Awards - 24th Annie Awards |publisher=[[Annie Awards]] |access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> and was nominated for \"Best Genre Video Release\" at the [[22nd Saturn Awards]] that same year, losing to ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000004/1996 |publisher=[[IMDb]] |title=22nd Saturn Awards |access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
