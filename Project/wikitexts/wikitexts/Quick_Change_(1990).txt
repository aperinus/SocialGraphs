Upon release, it was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $15.3 million worldwide against a budget of $17 million, but received positive reviews, with praise for Murray's performance and humor.\n\n==Plot==\nGrimm, dressed as a [[clown]], robs a bank in [[midtown Manhattan]]. He sets up an ingenious hostage situation strapping fake dynamite all over his waist and successfully gets away with $1 million and his accomplices: girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis.\n\nThe heist itself is comparatively straightforward and easy, but the getaway turns into a nightmare. The relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight out of the country is complicated by the fact that fate, luck and all of [[New York City]] appear to be conspiring against their escape.\n\nTo begin with, the trio is seeking the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] to get to the airport, but the signs were removed during construction work, resulting in the three robbers becoming lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood in Brooklyn. Then, a conman/thief robs the trio of everything they have (except the bank money, which they have taped under their clothes).\n\nAfter changing into new clothes at Phyllis' apartment, they are confronted and nearly gunned down by the paranoid and stressed-out incoming tenant. At the same time, a fire has broken out across the street and the fire department arrives and pushes their car away from a hydrant only to cause it to roll downhill and then down an embankment.\n\nWhen the three crooks eventually manage to flag down a cab, the foreign driver is hopelessly non-fluent in English. This causes a hysterical Loomis to jump out of the moving cab to grab another, but he runs into a newsstand, knocking himself unconscious. The driver leaves, thinking he has killed Loomis. An anal-retentive bus driver, a run-in with mobsters and Phyllis' increasing desperation to tell Grimm the news that she is pregnant with his child add further complications.\n\nAll the while, Rotzinger, a world-weary but relentless chief of the [[New York City Police Department]], is doggedly attempting to nab the fleeing trio. A meeting on board an airliner at the airport occurs between the robbers and the chief, who gets the added prize of having a major crime boss dropped in his lap with their assistance. Unfortunately the chief only realizes who they were after their plane has taken off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Grimm\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Phyllis Potter\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Loomis\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Chief Walt Rotzinger\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Bus Driver\n* [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] as Bank Guard\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Mr. Edison\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Cab Driver\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Mike Skelton\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Johnny\n* [[Kathryn Grody]] as Mrs. Edison\n* Richard Joseph Paul as Lieutenant Dennis Jameson\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as The Mugger\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Vince Lombino / Russ Crane\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Interrogating Policeman\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2018}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.

Also praised were the strong performances by the supporting cast, particularly Robards as the police chief Rotzinger, who, while almost as burned out as Murray, is still determined to capture the robbers as a swan song to his long career.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], in his July 13, 1990 ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' review, wrote: {{\"'}}''Quick Change'' is a funny but not an inspired comedy.
