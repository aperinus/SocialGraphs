The film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Alison Lohman]]. The film premiered on September 2, 2003 at the [[60th Venice International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on September 12, 2003. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $65 million against its $62 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nRoy Waller is a [[con artist]] with severe [[tourette's syndrome]] and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] from [[Los Angeles]]. Alongside his partner and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Frank Mercer, Roy operates a fake lottery, selling overpriced water filtration systems to unsuspecting customers. After Roy experiences a violent [[panic attack]], Frank suggests he see a psychiatrist, Dr. Harris Klein.\n\nKlein provides Roy with medication, and in therapy has Roy recall his past relationship with Heather, his ex-wife who was pregnant during the divorce. At Roy's behest, Klein informs Roy he called Heather, finding out Roy has a 14-year-old daughter, Angela. Roy and Angela meet, and her youthful energy rejuvenates him. Roy thus agrees to work with Frank on a long-con: their target is Chuck Frechette, an arrogant businessman whom they plan to con with the [[pigeon drop]].\n\nOne night, Angela shows up at Roy's, saying she has had a fight with her mother, deciding to stay for the weekend before returning to school. Exploring his belongings, she causes him to rethink his life, which he mentions during therapy with Klein. Angela returns home late one night, leading to an argument between them. During dinner, Roy admits he is a con artist and reluctantly agrees to teach Angela a con. They go to a local laundromat and con an older woman into believing she has won the lottery, so she shares half of her expected winnings with Angela; however, Roy then forces Angela to return the money.\n\nRoy goes bowling with Angela but is interrupted when Frank reveals that Chuck's flight to the [[Caymans]] has been updated to that day instead of Friday as planned. With little time, Roy reluctantly lets Angela distract Chuck midway through the con; however, after the con is finished, Chuck realizes what has happened and chases them into a parking garage before they escape. Roy then discovers Angela was arrested a year earlier, and asks her to stop calling him.\n\nWithout Angela, Roy's myriad phobias resurface, and during another panic attack, he ultimately learns that the medication given to him by Klein is a placebo. He proclaims he needs Angela in his life but that he would have to change his lifestyle, much to Frank's disappointment. Roy and Angela return from dinner one night to find Chuck waiting for them with a gun, alongside a badly beaten Frank. Angela shoots Chuck and Roy sends her off with Frank into hiding until the matter can be sorted out. As Roy prepares to take care of Chuck's body, Chuck suddenly springs to life and knocks Roy unconscious.\n\nRoy awakens in a hospital, where the police inform him that Chuck died from the gunshot and Frank and Angela have disappeared. Klein appears and Roy gives him the password to his large safety deposit box, ordering him to give the money to Angela when she is found. Later, Roy awakens to find the \"police\" have disappeared, his \"hospital room\" is actually a freight container on the roof of a parking garage, \"Dr. Klein's\" office is vacant, and his very substantial cash savings has been taken. He begins to realize Frank pulled a long-con on him. Roy drives over to Heather's (whom he hasn't seen for years) looking for Angela. Roy learns the truth: Heather miscarried their child. There is no \"Angela\": the young woman he thought was his child was actually Frank's accomplice.\n\nOne year later, Roy has become a salesman at a local carpet store, which Angela and her boyfriend one day wander into. Roy confronts her, who is much older than he had thought, but ultimately forgives her, realizing that he is much happier as an honest man. Angela reveals she did not receive her fair share of the cut from Frank, and that it was the only con she ever pulled. Angela says \u201cI\u2019ll see you, Dad\u201d when she and her boyfriend depart. Roy returns home to his new wife Kathy, who is pregnant with his child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Roy Waller\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Frank Mercer\n* [[Alison Lohman]] as Angela\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Dr. Harris Klein\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Chuck Frechette\n* [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as Kathy\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Laundry Lady\n* [[Melora Walters]] as Heather, Roy's Former Wife (uncredited)\n* [[Jenny O'Hara]] as Mrs. Schaffer\n* [[Steve Eastin]] as Mr. Schaffer\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Slacker Boyfriend\n* [[Tim Kelleher (actor)|Tim Kelleher]] as Bishop\n* [[Tim Maculan]] as Pharmacist #2\n* [[Giannina Facio]] as Bank Teller\n* [[Sonya Eddy]] as Parking Garage Cashier\n* [[Jim Zulevic]] as Bartender\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nOpening in 2,711 theaters in the United States and Canada, the film's opening weekend gross stood at second place with $13.0 million for a per-theater-average of $4,827; it ultimately lost the number-one position to ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''.

Renee Graham of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' criticized the film for its sentimentality, writing that \"director Ridley Scott goes all gooey in this off-key adaptation of Eric Garcia's cynical novel.\" Despite praising the performances of Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman, Graham was not fond of Cage, writing that he is more \"irritating than interesting\" and that the film follows a similar style.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morisi |first=Jacki |url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=2603 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923073459/http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=2603 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-09-23 |title=Matchstick Men Movie Review - Matchstick Men Movie Trailer - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |access-date=2013-06-10}}</ref> Similarly, Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' praised the film's acting but noted that the viewer \"may end up feeling as suckered as Roy's victims.\" Lumenick did not enjoy the twist ending, believing that it was a large detractor to the film's value.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://matchstickmenmovie.warnerbros.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|matchstick_men}}\n* {{mojo title|matchstickmen}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Film|United States}}\n{{Ridley Scott}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s heist films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:British crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British heist films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ridley Scott]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ted Griffin]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Scott Free Productions films]]\n[[Category:ImageMovers films]]\n[[Category:Films about obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]\n[[Category:Lottery fraud in fiction]]\n[[Category:2003 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about father\u2013daughter relationships]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
