The film follows a man who, in order to pay a debt, decides to rob a house, only to find out somebody with far more sinister intentions has already broken in.\n\nThe original script, titled ''The Midnight Man'', was at one point shopped as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] to the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], as an origin story for the villain [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer/Jigsaw]], but the producers opposed the idea and dismissed it, leading to the script getting reworked to an original story.<ref name=\"How 'The Collector' Was Almost a Prequel to Saw!\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16731|title=How 'The Collector' Was Almost a Prequel to Saw!|publisher=Blooding Disgusting|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://upcominghorrormovies.com/interview-marcus-dunstan-patrick-melton| title=INTERVIEW: Marcus Dunstan & Patrick Melton | work=UpcomingHorrorMovies.com | date= July 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''The Collector'' was released on July 31, 2009, by [[LD Entertainment]]. It received generally negative reviews from critics. A sequel, ''[[The Collection (film)|The Collection]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nMarried couple Larry and Gena Wharton return home to find the power is out. They discover a large trunk upstairs, and are horrified by its contents. They are then attacked by an unseen assailant.\n\nFormer convict Arkin O'Brien works as a handyman for the Chase family. He is generally well-liked by the Chases, especially the younger daughter Hannah. After work, Arkin meets his wife, whose debt to several loan sharks is due by midnight. To protect her and their daughter, Arkin plans to steal a valuable ruby from the Chase home.\n\nAs Arkin attempts to crack the safe, a masked figure locks the door. Michael, the father, appears with several injuries. Mistaking Arkin for the perpetrator, he grabs a golf club. Michael's action triggers a trap that incapacitates him, and the masked man drags Michael into the basement. Arkin attempts to call 911, but the phone is rigged with a spike that punctures his ear. The windows have been boarded up and lined with razors, making escape impossible.\n\nArkin retreats to the basement, where Michael informs him that his wife Victoria has also been captured, his older daughter Jill is out, and Hannah is hiding somewhere in the house. Michael gives Arkin the combination to the safe, which contains a gun. Arkin finds Victoria and has her distract the intruder in order for him to get to the safe. Arkin grabs the gun (which has no bullets) and pockets the ruby.\n\nWhile searching for Hannah, he finds a trunk containing a bloodied Larry. Larry explains that the masked man is a \"collector\" of people; he only collects one person in a household and kills everyone else. Horrified, Arkin flees, while the Collector locks Larry back in the trunk. Back in the basement, Arkin discovers that Michael is now dead. He frees Victoria, who had been tortured. As they make their way out of the basement, Victoria sees Michael's corpse and panics, alerting the Collector, who stabs her several times.\n\nJill arrives home with her boyfriend Chad. As the two prepare to have sex on the kitchen table, they notice the Collector watching them. Chad attacks him but is killed when he is pushed into a room filled with several bear traps. Jill manages to make a 911 call before being captured. Arkin frees Jill, but she doesn't trust him and reaches for a pair of scissors, only to be killed by a trap. Arkin escapes the house alone, but sees the Collector approaching Hannah. Changing his mind, he reenters the house.\n\nArkin prepares a trap to kill the Collector, but the trap kills Larry instead. Arkin gets to Hannah, and sends her down a laundry chute to the basement to hide. Before Arkin can do the same, the Collector knocks him out, ties him up and brutally tortures him.\n\nA police officer responding to Jill's 911 call is killed by the Collector's dog. Taking advantage of the distraction, Arkin frees himself and discovers a dead Victoria  and armed explosives in the basement. After killing the Collector's dog with a flaming bucket and trapping the Collector in one of his own traps, Arkin escapes with Hannah.\n\nSeeing approaching police cars, Arkin runs into the road to get their attention and is hit by one of the cars. He sees Hannah carried away by the police. He tells the police that the Collector was an exterminator working at the Chase house. The explosives detonate and destroy the house, but the Collector gets away unharmed. While Arkin is being taken to the hospital, The Collector ambushes the ambulance and kills everyone except Arkin, whom he kidnaps.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Collector watches film slides on the trunk containing Arkin, who threatens to kill him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as Arkin O\u2019Brien\n* [[Michael Reilly Burke]] as Michael Chase\n* [[Andrea Roth]] as Victoria Chase\n* [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Alarcon|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]] as The Collector\n* Karley Scott Collins as Hannah Chase\n* [[Daniella Alonso]] as Lisa\n* [[Haley Pullos]] as Cindy\n* William Prael as Larry Wharton\n* [[Diane Ayala Goldner]] as Gena Wharton\n* Alex Feldman as Chad\n* [[Madeline Zima]] as Jill Chase\n* [[Robert Wisdom]] as Roy\n\n==Production==\n''The Collector'' was shot in Shreveport, Louisiana in the spring of 2008 over 19 days. It used 16mm film stock.   The final scene (featuring the van in the rain) was part of a reshoot in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.\n\nWhen Dunstan announced to his producing team he wanted to direct, he set off to make a sizzle reel \u2013 a prolonged trailer of the proposed film.  He reunited with many of his friends from ''[[Feast (2005 film)|Feast]]'' (his first writing credit) and employed [[John Gulager]] as his cinematographer, and used actors [[Clu Gulager]] to play Roy and [[Tom Gulager]] as Arkin.  It was this reel that was used to sell the pitch to [[Dimension Films]], who put up the money to produce the film.  Before its release, Dimension chose not to put a P&A budget into the movie and opted to release it direct to DVD.  However, Dimension gave the filmmakers a chance to sell the film.  In the end, Mickey Liddell bought the movie from Dimension. Liddell organized the reshoots and changed the title from ''The Midnight Man'' to ''The Collector''.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released on July 31, 2009, in the United States, and on [[DVD]] on April 6, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35130/the-collector-dvd-release-april | title= The Collector DVD Release in April?!? | publisher= DeadCentral.com | date=December 28, 2009}}</ref> A rental version was made available February 12, 2010, through [[Blockbuster Video]]'s Exclusive Line.<ref>[https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36013/full-specs-and-art-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-collector Full Specs and Art for DVD and Blu-ray of The Collector]</ref> The DVD includes two [[deleted scene]]s, and also an alternative ending which is Arkin leaving after seeing Hannah in the window{{spaced ndash}}thus cutting off the remaining 25 minutes of the film.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 29% of 74 critics gave the film a positive reviews, with an average rating of 4.12/10.
