E. Lawrence]] and his 1926 book ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]''. It was directed by [[David Lean]] and produced by [[Sam Spiegel]], through his British company [[Horizon Pictures]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film stars [[Peter O'Toole]] as Lawrence with [[Alec Guinness]] playing [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. The film also stars [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Arthur Kennedy]]. The screenplay was written by [[Robert Bolt]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]].\n\nThe film depicts Lawrence's experiences in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] provinces of [[Hejaz Vilayet|Hejaz]] and [[Syria (region)|Greater Syria]] during the [[First World War]], in particular his attacks on [[Aqaba]] and [[Damascus]] and his involvement in the [[Arab National Council]]. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the violence inherent in war, his identity and his divided allegiance between his native Britain with its army and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.\n\nThe film was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]] in 1963; it won seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]]. The dramatic score by [[Maurice Jarre]] and the [[Super Panavision 70]] cinematography by [[Freddie Young]] also won praise from critics.\n\n''Lawrence of Arabia'' is widely regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|best films ever made]]. In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |website=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=8 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008184509/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/ |archive-date=8 October 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Robert M. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry |title=Cinema: 'Lawrence of Arabia' is among those selected for preservation by Library of Congress |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=26 September 1991 |access-date=4 September 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915010517/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry | archive-date=15 September 2015 | url-status=live}}</ref> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it fifth on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] list of the greatest American films and it ranked seventh on their 2007 updated list. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film]]. In 2004, it was voted the best British film in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading film makers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nIn 1935, T. E. Lawrence dies in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries, with little success, to gain insights into the remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]]. Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] who is notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], Mr. Dryden of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets [[Harry Brighton|Colonel Brighton]], who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal; his outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]. Its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a pessimistic Sherif Ali. The teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[An Nafud|Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, and travel day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim, and Sherif Ali is won over.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda Abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[Feud|blood feud]]. Since retaliation by the Howeitat would shatter the fragile alliance, Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. Lawrence is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the man he risked his own life to save, but Lawrence shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Although his report of Aqaba's capture is initially disbelieved, Lawrence is promoted to [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed and confesses that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. Lawrence asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, Allenby states that there is none.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] by blowing up the Ottoman railway between Damascus and Medina and harassing the Turks at every turn. An American [[war correspondent]], [[Jackson Bentley]], publicises Lawrence's exploits and makes him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence reluctantly shoots him dead and then flees.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flagellation|flogged]] before he is thrown into the street, where Ali comes to his aid. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the [[Capture of Damascus|\"big push\" on Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers, who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]] and demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates, despite Ali's protests. He regrets his actions thereafter.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the British cut off access to the [[public utility|public utilities]], leaving the desert tribesmen to debate how to maintain the occupation. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly, and soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist, who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear. [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming, \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=David Lean: Interviews |last=Lean |first=David |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60473-234-4 |page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him, though at {{height|ft=6|in=2|abbr=mos}} tall O'Toole was significantly taller than Lawrence.<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite web |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction |title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction? |website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] |date=16 December 2013 | access-date=10 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155438/https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | archive-date=11 February 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called ''Florence of Arabia''\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Lane |first=Anthony |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane |title=Master and Commander |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=31 March 2008 | access-date=26 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142628/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming. Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas but when the other actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali. A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin, who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]], this character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish [[Bey]]. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> Afterwards Ferrer considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''\". Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class. According to Lawrence in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', this was General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though the film doesn't name him. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others including [[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]] and [[Lawrence James]] argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot. In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S. F. Newcombe]] (in Michael Wilson's original script, the character was named Colonel Newcombe, before Robert Bolt changed it). Newcombe, like Brighton in the film, was Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916 but he escaped. Brighton was created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as Mr. Dryden. Like Sherif Ali and Colonel Brighton, Dryden was an amalgamation of several historical figures, primarily [[Ronald Storrs]], a member of the Arab Bureau but also [[David George Hogarth|David Hogarth]], an archaeologist friend of Lawrence; [[Henry McMahon]], the High Commissioner of Egypt who negotiated the [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]] which began the Arab Revolt and [[Mark Sykes]], who helped draw up the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] which partitioned the post-war Middle East. [[Robert Bolt]] stated that the character was created to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/legacy3/film/film3.htm |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |access-date=8 March 2021 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929015041/http://www.telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/legacy3/film/film3.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref> The character was based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], whose reports helped make Lawrence famous. Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only weeks at most with Lawrence in the field, unlike Bentley, who is a middle-aged man present for all of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script but Bolt reduced his role significantly in the final treatment.\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as General [[Archibald Murray]]. He releases Lawrence to Mr. Dryden. Calls the British occupying Arabia \"a sideshow of a sideshow.\"\n* [[I. S. Johar]] as Gasim. Johar was a well-known [[India]]n actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\n* [[Gamil Ratib]] as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final edit.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas. Mohyeddin, one of Pakistan's best-known actors, played a character based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as the medical officer. He was cast at the last minute during the filming of the Damascus scenes in Seville. The character was based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of the script.\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as the club secretary. Gwillim was recommended to Lean for the film by close friend Quayle.\n* [[Hugh Miller (actor)|Hugh Miller]] as the [[RAMC]] colonel. He worked on several of Lean's films as a dialogue coach and was one of several members of the film crew to be given bit parts (see below).\n* [[Peter Burton]] as a Damascus sheik (uncredited)\n* Kenneth Fortescue as Allenby's aide (uncredited)<ref name=\"Eagan2010\">{{cite book |author=Daniel Eagan |title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&pg=PA586 |date=2010 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-2977-3 |pages=586\u2013|access-date=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211745/https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&pg=PA586|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Harry Fowler]] as Corporal William Potter (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/04/harry-fowler |title=Harry Fowler obituary |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2012 |last1=Baxter |first1=Brian| access-date=2 February 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109022501/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/04/harry-fowler| archive-date=9 January 2012| url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Jack Hedley]] as a reporter (uncredited)\n* [[Ian MacNaughton]] as Corporal Michael George Hartley, Lawrence's companion in O'Toole's first scene (uncredited)\n* [[Henry Oscar]] as Silliam, Faisal's servant (uncredited)\n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Corporal Jenkins (uncredited)<ref name=\"Eagan2010\" />\n* [[John Ruddock]] as Elder Harith (uncredited)<ref name=\"Eagan2010\" />\n* [[Fernando Sancho]] as the Turkish sergeant (uncredited)\n* Stuart Saunders as the [[regimental sergeant major]] (uncredited)\n* [[Bryan Pringle]] as the driver of the car which takes Lawrence away at the end of the film (uncredited)\n\nThe crew consisted of over 200 people, with the cast and extras included over 1,000 people worked on the film.<ref>BFI Film Classics \u2013 Lawrence Of Arabia Kevin Jackson pp. 59. 2007</ref>\nMembers of the crew portrayed minor characters.

Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the Battle of Aqaba and those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate since the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film presents a fictional desertion of Lawrence's Arab army, almost to a man, as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the Arab Revolt and First World War, as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. Bentley's meeting with Faisal is in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba and mentions that the United States has not yet entered the war but the US had been in the war since April. Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is absent, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and the execution of Gasim are based on two incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Newcombe, and Pierce C.

E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{cvt|6|ft|2|in|m}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{cvt|9|in}} taller than the {{cvt|5|ft|5|in|m}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orlans |first=Harold |title=T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero |publisher=McFarland |page=111 |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1307-7}}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evidenced by his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him but Lawrence later agreed to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight but subtly placed himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'' but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955), which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\" as well as a homosexual. That is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |year=1964 |title=Lawrence of Arabia |jstor=1210914 |journal=Film Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=51\u201354 |doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians like [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the Tafas massacre but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film shows that Lawrence spoke and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]] and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]], [[Mesopotamia]], in 1916. Lawrence is made aware of the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it but he may well have known about it much earlier while he fought with the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. The authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real, rather than a composite character and also the highlighting of the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |publisher=T.

Liddell Hart criticised the film and engaged Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin.

Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\" and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313204945/http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |archive-date=13 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125103413/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |archive-date=25 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death, \n\n{{quote|I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade.

Although Allenby manipulated Lawrence during the war, their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life, they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes in which Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nMurray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential but thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer. It was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is the opposite of Murray's real feelings but Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Although Auda at first joined the revolt for monetary reasons, he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. Despite repeated bribery attempts by the Turks, he happily pocketed their money but remained loyal to the revolt and went so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish-made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped to plan it, along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal. Faisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted since he was in his early thirties at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence and worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145955/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |archive-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity. The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000 and went on a campaign in the United States and Britain to denounce the film. He famously said, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\" and went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy\". Later, he said to ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and of most of the film's characters and believed that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film. Criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. Allenby's family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about his portrayal. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further by suing Columbia although the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], the author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs\". Korda said that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\". \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture\".<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda by arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> A British historian of the Arab Revolt, David Murphy, wrote that although the film was flawed by various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for [[the Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=258 }}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography |last=Sellers |first=Robert |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-283-07216-1 |location=London |quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early 50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant A. W. Lawrence to sell the rights to ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=271}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired Robert Bolt to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=270\u201382 }}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1989, Lean said that Lawrence and Ali were written as being in a gay relationship together. When asked about whether the film was \"pervasively homoerotic\", Lean responded: \"Yes. Of course it is. Throughout. I'll never forget standing there in the desert once, with some of these tough Arab buggers, some of the toughest we had, and I suddenly thought, 'He's making eyes at me!' And he was! So it does pervade it, the whole story, and certainly Lawrence was very if not entirely homosexual. We thought we were being very daring at the time: Lawrence and Omar, Lawrence and the Arab boys.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/02/03/david-lean-sorcerer-of-the-screen/784a3547-60d6-47d6-96a4-1f99f3edea55/ |title=David Lean, Sorcerer of the Screen |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=14 March 2022 }}</ref> Lean also compared Ali and Lawrence's romance in the film to the relationship of the two main characters in his 1945 film ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Brief Encounters: Lesbians and Gays in British Cinema 1930-1971 |last=Bourne |first=Stephen |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4742-9134-7 |page=169}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and distributed by Columbia Pictures.

It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transport and extras. Hussein visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the Quran. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. The production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent Cairo, Jerusalem and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]] and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan soldiers substituting for the Turkish army; Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production and the playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the Battle of Abu El Lissal in 1917. Jordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so film makers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology |last=Caton |first=Steven Charles |publisher=University of California Press |year=1950 |isbn=0-520-21082-4 |location=Los Angeles |pages=70, 71 }}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Epic Films of David Lean |last=Santas |first=Constantine |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |year=2012 |location=Plymouth UK |page=xxvi}}</ref> O'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview \"I loathe it\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM |title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview |publisher=YouTube |access-date=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was {{convert|24,987.5|ft|m}} of 70&nbsp;mm film, or {{convert|19,990|ft|m}} of 35&nbsp;mm film. With {{convert|90|ft|m}} of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' was never edited after its premiere and is {{convert|19,884|ft|m}} of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission and exit music). Most of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two scenes were excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier.\n\nMost of the missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign and the battle of Petra (later reworked into the first train attack) but these scenes were probably not filmed. Living actors dubbed their dialogue and [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue was dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.
