It is based on the 1963 novel [[I Am David|of the same name]] (originally published in the USA under the name ''North to Freedom'') by [[Anne Holm]]. The film was produced by [[Walden Media]] and [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nSeven years after [[World War II]], a 12-year-old boy named David (Ben Tibber) escapes a [[Gulag]] in [[Bulgaria]] where he has spent his entire life where his mother has been taken away from him. He sets out on a risky journey to [[Denmark]], initially believing he is on an important mission to deliver a letter, but eventually discovering that the \"mission\" was to reunite him with his mother, of whom he has distinct memories. Along his journey, he faces danger, fear, loneliness, hunger, missions and encounters various people.\n\nJohannes ([[Jim Caviezel]]), his friend and mentor in the camp, who prepares him for escape, is killed by a guard, leaving David to face escape on his own. David is helped by a guard to escape, who gives him a [[compass]] and tells him he must go southwest to [[Greece]], take a boat to [[Italy]] and finally go north to Denmark, a peaceful and neutral country. The guard also tells him to trust no one. Since David was locked in a camp all his life, he has repressed feelings and trusts no one anyway, and so feels lost and disoriented in the world.\n\nAlong his journey, though he is mistreated by some people, he is well-treated by others. Gradually he learns that some people can be trusted, and to open up and experience his own feelings.  Finally, with the help of decent people whom he has learned to trust, David is reunited with his mother in Denmark.\n\n==Cast==\n* Ben Tibber - David\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] - Johannes\n* [[Joan Plowright]] - Sophie\n* [[Hristo Shopov]] - The Man\n* Roberto Attias - Baker\n* [[Maria Bonnevie]] - David's mother\n* [[Francesco De Vito]] - Roberto\n* Viola Carinci - Maria\n* [[Silvia De Santis]] - Elsa\n* [[Alessandro Sperduti]] - Carlo\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews from critics.
