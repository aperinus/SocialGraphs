They marry and move to the city, where her powers tend to influence everyone she meets while working in the shop. Through her advice, she helps others and eventually finds the true man of her dreams in a psychiatrist (Daniels).\n\n''The Butcher's Wife'' was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only $9 million at the box office. According to her 2019 memoir ''Inside Out'', Moore regretted starring in the film, saying she only did it to increase her fee after the success of ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAs a clairvoyant, Marina awaits signs from beyond that her true love, whoever he may be, is waiting for her, somewhere. When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny [[Outer Banks|North Carolina island]] of [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]], where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband. After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's [[blue-collar]] neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist Dr. Alex Tremor, and [[closeted]] [[lesbian]] dress shop clerk Grace. But what Marina fails to grasp about her powers is that she can see the future of strangers far more clearly than her own, and love is unpredictable no matter how many ways you have to look for it.\n\nThe film makes use of several phenomena that can be described as occult portents that meeting a love match is imminent or occult tools to help strengthen, seal or bring about love, luck and happiness.  These include the sudden \"finding\" of a ring that would serve as a wedding band, falling stars with twin tails, zig-zagged rainbows and found objects symbolizing a change in the finder's path that will cause it to cross with their beloved.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Marina Lemke\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Dr. Alex Tremor\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Leo Lemke\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Stella Keefover\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Grace\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Robyn Graves\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Eugene\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Gina\n* [[Christopher Durang]] as Mr. Liddle\n* [[Luis Avalos]] as Luis\n* [[Helen Hanft]] as Molly\n* [[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]] as Grammy D'Arbo\n* [[Diane Salinger]] as Trendoid\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 25%, based on 16 reviews, and an average rating of 3.9/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/butchers_wife |title=The Butcher's Wife (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-04-24 |website=CinemaScore |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"Too much of the film is spent matching up lovers who must almost literally get their stars uncrossed in order to find happiness.
