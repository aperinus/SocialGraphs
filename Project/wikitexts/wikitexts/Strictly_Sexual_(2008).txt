Meanwhile, construction workers and best friends, Stanny and Joe, come from New York but can't find jobs in Los Angeles. Without money, the guys decide to go to a fancy bar to drink and leave the place without paying the bill. Donna and Christi Ann meet Stanny and Joe and invite them home believing they are gigolos. After a night of sex, the women discover the misunderstanding and that the men are, indeed, unemployed construction workers. The women offer to have the men stay in their swimming pool cabana, furnishing them with beer and food while the boys search for jobs. In return, they would be their on-call \"boy-toys\" in a strictly sexual relationship. During the ensuing months, the couples become closer and change their feelings and behaviors with the development and growing of their relationships as the couples begin to develop romantic feelings.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Amber Benson]] as Donna\n*[[Johann Urb]] as Joe\n*Kristen Kerr as Christi Ann\n*Stevie Long as Stanny\n*Trevor Murphy as Damian\n*[[Brooke Mueller|Brooke Allen]] as Cassandra\n*Elizabeth Wood as Fabric Woman\n*Ashley Hinson as Boutique Employee\n*Shravan Kambam as Niki\n*Scott Weston as Scott\n*Rick Ramnath as Rich\n*Lindsay Frame as Complimentary Woman\n*Carlos Conrado Sanchez as Carlos\n*Justin Phillips as Justin\n*Mark Radcliffe as Mark\n\n== Business ==\nNPR reported that ''Strictly Sexual'' was the most-watched film of all time on [[Hulu.com]] as of February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|date=8 February 2010|title=Thanks To Hulu, Indie Film 'Strictly Sexual' Hits Big|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=15 March 2010|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123499181}}</ref>\n\n== TV series ==\nIn 2011, Hulu produced a six-episode spin-off series, ''Strictly Sexual: The Series'', featuring some of the original cast.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0494277}}\n*[http://www.hulu.com/watch/99258/strictly-sexual ''Strictly Sexual''] at [[Hulu]]\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=strictly_sexual_a_love_story|title=Strictly Sexual}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
