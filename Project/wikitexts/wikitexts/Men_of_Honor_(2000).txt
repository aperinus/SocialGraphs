As a crew member of the salvage ship [[USS Hoist (ARS-40)|USS ''Hoist'']], where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] Leslie William \"Billy\" Sunday. He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a [[Master Diver (United States Navy)|master diver]]. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate second class]]. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails.\n\nBrashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the seventh grade, in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the New York Public Library in Harlem. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer, the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open on purpose. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Sunday and his fellow divers. Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass.\n\nThe paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday diverge. Brashear rises quickly through the ranks, even becoming a national hero in the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|1966 Palomares incident]] for recovering a missing hydrogen bomb and for saving the lives of Navy crewmen. Sunday continually loses his composure around officers who disrespect his accomplishments, until he is finally demoted to [[chief petty officer]] and relegated to menial duties.  He becomes a brooding alcoholic displeased with his lowered rank.\n\nThe two eventually meet again after Brashear's left leg was so mangled in the Palomares incident that he feels that his only chance to return to active duty and a relatively normal life is for the leg to be amputated and replaced with a prosthesis. Until this time, no Navy man had ever returned to full active duty with a prosthetic limb.  Sunday again trains Brashear and aids him in his fight against the Navy's bureaucracy and an antagonistic Navy captain (Brashear's and Sunday's former ''Hoist'' [[executive officer]]) in order to return to full active duty and fulfill his dream of becoming a master diver. They succeed in getting Brashear reinstated.\n\nIn the epilogue, it is noted that two years later Brashear becomes a master diver. It is added that he does not retire from the Navy for another nine years.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Brashear Gooding.jpg|thumb|right| Carl Brashear (center) received an Outstanding Public Service Award in October 2000 from actor [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]] and then-[[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[William Cohen]] for 42 years of combined military and federal civilian service.

The equipment was custom made by DESCO, who manufactured the gear for the Navy along with three other makers. The helmets used were actually commercial helmets (which have larger glass windows or \"lights\") on Navy breast plates, allowing greater visibility of the actors. The divers wore equipment weighing about {{convert|200|lb}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened at the third position at the North American box office behind ''[[Little Nicky]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', which was on its second week at the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2000W45/?ref_=bo_rl_table_1|title=Domestic 2000 Weekend 45|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=8 November 2020 |date=12 November 2000}}</ref>\n\n''Men of Honor'' was met with mixed reviews.
