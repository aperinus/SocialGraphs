It is a sequel to ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990) and ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992). All three movies featured Clancy's character [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], though Ford only played the role in the last two. It is the last film version of Clancy's novels to feature [[Harrison Ford]] as Ryan and [[James Earl Jones]] as Vice Admiral James Greer, as well as the final installment directed by Noyce.\n\nAs in the novel, Ryan is appointed [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Acting Deputy Director (Intelligence) (DDI), and discovers he is being kept in the dark by colleagues who are [[CIA activities in Colombia|conducting a covert war]] against a [[drug cartel]] in [[Colombia]], apparently with the approval of the President. The film premiered in theaters in the United States on August 3, 1994, and was a major financial success, earning over $200 million at the box office.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[United States Coast Guard]] vessel intercepts and boards a U.S. registered yacht in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Evidence shows that the ship's previous occupants, American businessman Peter Hardin and his family, were murdered by the occupying Colombian crew. CIA analyst Jack Ryan learns that Hardin was laundering money for the South American [[Cali Cartel]]. Drug lord Ernesto Escobedo ordered Hardin's murder for embezzling millions in drug profits. U.S. President Bennett, Hardin's close friend, discreetly authorizes [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] James Cutter to initiate covert operations in [[Colombia]] to destroy the cartel.\n\nRyan is appointed acting [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director of Intelligence]] when Admiral James Greer undergoes treatment for [[pancreatic cancer]]. Ryan requests [[United States Congress|Congress]] increase funding to support Colombians fighting the drug cartels, giving his assurance there is no U.S. military involvement. Ryan is unaware that Cutter will use the funds to assemble RECIPROCITY, a special forces team recruited by CIA operative [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]], and aided by Robert Ritter, the CIA [[Director of the National Clandestine Service|Deputy Director of Operations]]. President Bennett sends Ryan to negotiate with the Colombian government to allow the United States to seize Escobedo's assets, including $650 million hidden in off-shore accounts. Escobedo's intelligence officer, Colonel F\u00e9lix Cortez, secretly orders the Cartel to ambush Ryan's convoy. Jack survives, though several colleagues are killed, including Dan Murray and FBI Director Emile Jacobs. Cortez's identity is ascertained after he murders Murray's secretary, Moira, who was an unwitting informant.\n\nEscobedo, blamed for the attack, organizes a meeting with the other Cartel heads. RECIPROCITY discovers this and launches an airstrike on the meeting location. Escobedo and Cortez, en route to the gathering, barely escape unscathed. Cortez learns Americans were responsible and brokers a deal with Cutter: Cortez will kill Escobedo to assume leadership, then will reduce drug shipments to the U.S. and allow American law enforcement to make regular arrests to influence public opinion that the United States is winning the [[War on drugs|drug war]]. In exchange, Cortez wants the location of RECIPROCITY and all CIA support eliminated to establish his position within the Cartel. Cutter accepts Cortez's deal, then strands Clark's team, who are overwhelmed by Cortez's mercenaries in the jungle.\n\nUnbeknownst to Cutter, U.S. surveillance monitored his conversation with Cortez. Ryan accesses Ritter's computer and obtains evidence regarding the illegal Colombian operations. Ritter, however, warns Ryan that because he obtained funding for the operation, Congress will hold Ryan solely responsible, whereas Ritter and Cutter have been granted President Bennett's [[Get Out of Jail Free card|pre-emptive pardons from any wrongdoing]]. Jack flies to Bogota to seek out Clark, unaware Cutter and Ritter have falsely told Clark that Ryan betrayed RECIPROCITY. Ryan and Clark team up after Clark realizes Ritter and Cutter deceived them both.\n\nRyan and Clark procure a helicopter and fly to RECIPROCITY's last known position. They find team [[sniper]] Chavez, who reports that most members were killed; Captain Ramirez and one remaining squad member were captured. Ryan meets with Escobedo and informs him of Cortez's deception, whilst Clark simultaneously commences rescuing his men who are being held captive in a coffee facility fronting Escobedo's cocaine operation. Escobedo confronts Cortez but is killed by Cortez's associate. Ryan narrowly escapes with Clark and the freed prisoners. Chavez kills Cortez during the escape, saving Ryan. Back in the United States, Ryan confronts President Bennett and refuses to help cover up the conspiracy. He testifies before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Congressional Oversight Committee]] about the recent events.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]]\n* [[Joaquim de Almeida]] as Colonel F\u00e9lix Cortez\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Ernesto Escobedo\n* [[Henry Czerny]] as Bob Ritter\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as James Cutter\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as President Bennett\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Captain Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Domingo Chavez\n* Jorge Luke as Sipo, Cortez's Henchman\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Jim Greer\n* Tom Tammi as Emil Jacobs\n* Tim Grimm as Dan Murray\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Cathy Ryan\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Moira Wolfson\n* [[Belita Moreno]] as Jean Fowler\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as CIA Director Judge Moore\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Petey\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Sally Ryan\n* [[Ellen Geer]] as Rose\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Senator Mayo\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Enrique Rojas\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAfter completing ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', [[John McTiernan]] had wanted to direct an adaptation of ''Clear and Present Danger'', and departed from the production after an early script by [[John Milius]] was rejected in favor of ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/revisiting-patriot-games-the-first-jack-ryan-reboot/|title=Revisiting Patriot Games: The First Jack Ryan \"Reboot\"|date=2015-03-26|website=Den of Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16|archive-date=June 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629192750/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/revisiting-patriot-games-the-first-jack-ryan-reboot/|url-status=live}}</ref> Milius's first draft was more faithful to the original book than the final film, and he later added the sequence where Jack Ryan is ambushed in [[Sports Utility Vehicle|SUV]]s. He said that the original ending had Cortez going to Washington to kill the National Security Advisor, only to be killed in a mugging by drug addicts.<ref>Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

In March 1992, [[Donald E. Stewart]] was hired to rewrite Milius's script to provide greater screen time to Jack Ryan. After Clancy openly criticized the script, [[Steven Zaillian]] rewrote it further in an attempt to gain his approval. Milius was retained during production to provide consultation on the action scenes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/08/19/harrison-ford-takes-tom-clancyagain/|title=Harrison Ford takes on Tom Clancy...again|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-03-16|archive-date=April 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430105327/https://ew.com/article/1994/08/19/harrison-ford-takes-tom-clancyagain/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nThe film was shot in [[Mexico]] after the studio decided that filming on-location in Colombia was too dangerous, with [[Mexico City]] standing in for [[Bogot\u00e1]] and the Hacienda San Gabriel de la Palmas in [[Cuernavaca]] serving as a set for Escobedo's headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/24/cool-movie-sets-clear-and-present-danger/|title=Cool Movie Sets: 'Clear and Present Danger'|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-03-16|archive-date=June 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629192816/https://ew.com/article/1994/06/24/cool-movie-sets-clear-and-present-danger/|url-status=live}}</ref>  Ironically, the decision to produce the film in Mexico encountered further difficulties due to the outbreak of the [[Chiapas conflict]].
