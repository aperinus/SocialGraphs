Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time.\n\nIn 1931, when Jacob was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student taking his [[final exam]] at [[Cornell University]], he learns that his parents were killed in a car accident. After the bank [[foreclosure|forecloses]] on the family home and in the midst of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], he [[Freighthopping|jumps]] onto a passing [[circus train]]. Jacob meets Camel, an employee with the Benzini Bros., who agrees to help Jacob obtain a job. Jacob meets [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] August, who after learning of Jacob's veterinary background, hires him to care for the animals. Jacob meets August's wife, Marlena Rosenbluth, and informs her that their star [[show horse]] has [[laminitis]].\n\nAugust instructs Jacob to keep the horse performing as long as possible, but Jacob takes it upon himself [[euthanize]] it. August is furious and he threatens to throw Jacob off the moving train to scare him into submission. However, August later expressed gratitude to Jacob for potentially saving Marlena from being injured by the sick horse. August soon procures Rosie, an [[Asian elephant]], and assigns Jacob to train her. He invites Jacob to dinner with him and Marlena, and Jacob learns that August is possessive of her. After August passes out from drunkenness, Jacob and Marlena share a dance and nearly kiss.\n\nJacob attempts but fails to train Rosie, and August beats her with a [[bullhook]] when she fails to follow orders. After Rosie runs off and nearly injures Marlena during a show, August savagely beats her. Jacob, with help from Marlena, Camel and his roommate Walter, clean her wounds and give her buckets of [[whisky]] to numb her pain. They unexpectedly learn that Rosie understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. Rosie begins to perform beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success.\n\nJacob and Marlena grow closer, and after escaping a [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] raid at a restaurant, they kiss. Marlena expresses regret and Jacob considers quitting but can't bear to leave Rosie with August. When August later observes their chemistry, he abuses Marlena and cruelly taunts them. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. They have sex but are ambushed by August's [[henchmen]] who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.\n\nJacob covertly returns to the circus train, finds Marlena, and nearly kills August with a knife while he sleeps. Marlena tells Jacob that Camel and Walter were thrown from the train and killed and that several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and betrayal. The following day, they unlock all of the animal cages while an audience watches Marlena and Rosie's performance. Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos, but August attacks him. Marlena tries to save Jacob from being beaten by August, but this causes the latter to turn his fury on her. August strangles Marlena while Jacob fights with August's lead henchman. Two circus employees save Jacob, and Rosie hits August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him and rescuing Marlena. The Benzini Bros. circus is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.\n\nBack in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien that he and Marlena took Rosie and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob finished his degree and worked as a circus veterinarian while Marlena continued to perform with Rosie. They purchased a farm, married, had 5 children, and kept Rosie until her death. He took on a job as a vet at the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] zoo and after many happy years together, Marlena died peacefully. Not wanting to return to the lonely nursing home, Jacob asks for a job as a ticket taker, and O'Brien agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Marlena Rosenbluth\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as older Jacob Jankowski\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as August Rosenbluth\n* [[Tai (elephant)|Tai]] as Rosie, the elephant\n* [[James Frain]] as Rosie's caretaker\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Charlie O'Brien\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Earl\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Diamond Joe\n* [[Mark Povinelli]] as Kinko/Walter\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Blackie\n* [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as Camel\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Grady\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Hyde\n* [[John Aylward]] as Mr. Ervin\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Mr. Robinson \n* [[Uggie]] as Queenie, the terrier\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $38 million,<ref name=\"LABox\">{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/04/movie-projector-water-for-elephants-tyler-perrys-madeas-big-happy-family.html |title=Movie Projector: Tyler Perry's latest 'Madea' film should trample 'Water for Elephants' |last=Kaufman |first=Amy |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 21, 2011 |access-date=April 21, 2011}}</ref> filming began on May 20, 2010 in [[Los Angeles]], [[Piru, California|Piru]], [[Fillmore, California|Fillmore]] in [[California]], [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kensington, Georgia|Kensington]] and [[Chickamauga, Georgia|Chickamauga]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

A video released by the [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\n''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded to the video stating, \"The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants.
