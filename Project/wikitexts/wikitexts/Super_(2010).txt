It tells the story of Frank Darbo, a short-order cook who becomes a superhero without having any superhuman ability, calling himself the \"Crimson Bolt\". He sets out to rescue his wife Sarah from the hands of a drug dealer.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2010 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in theaters in the United States on April 1, 2011 and on [[video on demand]] on April 13, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamesgunn.com/2010/11/29/the-super-release-date-new-photos |title=The SUPER Release Date  |date=November 29, 2010 |access-date=January 1, 2011}}</ref> The film was released unrated<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Batts |url=http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2011/04/james-gunn-brings-super-to-st-louis/ |title=James Gunn Brings SUPER to St. Louis |date=April 17, 2011 |access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> in U.S. theaters, and later received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] for its [[DVD-Video|DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] release. Upon release, ''Super'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $590,000 against a budget of $2.5 million, making it Gunn's lowest-grossing film.\n\nIn 2019, Wilson reprised his role as the Crimson Bolt in the [[mid-credits scene]] of Gunn's [[Supervillain|supervillain film]] ''[[Brightburn]]'', via a new photo taken for the film.\n\n==Plot==\nShort-order cook Frank Darbo recalls his only two good memories from a disappointing life: marrying his wife, Sarah, and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a [[public-access television]] show (based on the actual Christian superhero series, ''[[Bibleman]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/james-gunn-54615 |title=James Gunn - Interview - The A.V. Club  |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=April 15, 2011 |access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>), who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose.\n\nFrank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the store clerk, Libby. Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of \"The Crimson Bolt\". Armed with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] and [[Child sexual abuse|child molesters]] to a man who cuts in line at the movies. The Crimson Bolt soon becomes a media sensation. Initially, the media view him as a violent [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light.\n\nFrank later attempts to rescue Sarah at Jacques' house, but Jacques' thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees while climbing over a fence. A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolt's \"kid sidekick\", christening herself \"Boltie\" and designing a costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to nearly kill a man who possibly vandalized her friend's car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques' thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored of Frank, but he turns down her advances, insisting that he is still married.\n\nArguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby rapes Frank while the two are in costume (although she claims to have been suffering from [[Sleep sex|sexsomnia]]). Frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of Sarah in the toilet. He decides that it is time to rescue her from Jacques. Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques' ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. However, they are both shot. Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is shot in the head and killed.\n\nDevastated by her death, Frank goes into a rage, slaughtering all of Jacques' thugs. Inside, Jacques shoots Frank, but Frank gains the upper hand and stabs Jacques to death as Sarah watches, horrified. Frank takes her home, and she stays with him for a few months \"out of a sense of obligation\" for saving her life, Frank surmises. One day, Frank returns home to find Sarah has left him again. This time, she manages to overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems.\n\nShe marries a man named Patrick and has four children. Frank is convinced that her children will change the world for the better. Frank, content and now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories. The wall is covered with pictures of his experiences from his time spent with Libby and pictures of Sarah's kids, who call him \"Uncle Frank\". Frank looks at Libby's picture, and a tear runs down his cheek.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Frank Darbo / The Crimson Bolt\n** Grant Goodman as Young Frank Darbo\n* [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Page}} as Libby / Boltie\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as Sarah Helgeland\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jacques\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as The Holy Avenger\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Abe\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Detective John Felkner\n* [[Andre Royo]] as Hamilton\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Toby\n* [[Stephen Blackehart]] as Quill\n* Greg Ingram as Long-Haired Hood\n* [[William Katt]] as Sgt.
