After recently parting ways with her boyfriend when she caught him cheating, Hilary finds herself living with her eccentric mother. One day, Hilary answers an ad in a newspaper for a nurse only to find herself being escorted out before the interview starts.\n\nVictor Geddes is a well-educated, rich, and shy 28-year-old. As the film progresses, Victor's health worsens progressively, due to [[leukemia]]. Despite his father's protests, Victor hires Hilary to be his live-in caretaker while he undergoes a traumatic course of [[chemotherapy]]. Hilary becomes insecure of her ability to care for Victor after her first exposure to the side effects of his chemotherapy treatment. She researches leukemia and stocks healthier food in the kitchen.\n\nVictor is \"finished\" with his chemotherapy and suggests they take a vacation to the coast. They rent a house and Hilary begins to feel that she is no longer needed to care for him. They fall in love and continue living at the coast. Victor hides his use of morphine to kill the pain. During dinner with one of the friends they made at the coast, Victor starts acting aggressively and irrationally. He collapses and is helped to bed. Hilary searches the garbage and discovers his used syringes. She confronts him and he admits he was not finished with his chemotherapy. Victor explains that he wants quality in his life and Hilary says that he has been lying to her. She calls his father, who comes to take him home, but Victor wants to stay for one last Christmas party. Hilary and Victor reconnect at the party and he tells her that he is leaving with his father to go back to the hospital in the morning.\n\nAfter speaking with Victor's father, who says Victor wants to spend one night alone before leaving, Hilary goes back to the house they rented only to find Victor packing clothes, ready to run away and not go with his father to the hospital. Hilary confronts him about running away and Victor admits that he is afraid of hoping. At this confession, Hilary finally tells Victor she loves him and they then decide to go back to the hospital, where he will fight for his life with Hilary. The last scene of the film shows Victor and Hilary leaving the house, which has a small picture of [[Gustav Klimt]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' (the first painting Victor shows Hilary) in the window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Hilary O'Neil\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Victor Geddes\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Gordon\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Estelle Whittier\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Mrs. O'Neil\n* [[David Selby]] as Richard Geddes\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as Malachi\n* [[Adrienne-Joi Johnson|A.J.
