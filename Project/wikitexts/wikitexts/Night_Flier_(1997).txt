It premiered in the United States on [[HBO]] on November 7, 1997, receiving a theatrical release by [[New Line Cinema]] the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nRichard Dees is a cynical [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporter whose motto is \"Never believe what you publish and never publish what you believe.\" Merton Morrison, editor-in-chief at the tabloid ''Inside View'', confides a case to him about a bloody murder in a rural airfield, committed by a passing aviator who thinks he is a [[vampire]] and registered under the name of Dwight Renfield. Dees refuses, but reverses his decision when two more murders are committed in another airfield, the victims drained of their blood. He recovers the case from Morrison who, in the meantime, had entrusted it to the novice reporter Katherine Blair, and leaves in the footsteps of the killer aboard his own light aircraft.\n\nDees gathers accounts, pays bribes and even desecrates a grave for the purposes of his investigation. He senses that the case is stranger than it seems and receives messages telling him to stop his investigation. Dissatisfied with Dees' attitude, Morrison sends Blair to conduct her own parallel investigation. Dees offers the young woman to join forces to hunt down the killer.\n\nThey find his trail at the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] airfield and, as he no longer needs her, Dees abandons Katherine to continue alone. He lands at Wilmington and finds Renfield's [[Cessna Skymaster]] with dirt inside and the interior covered in blood. The airfield seems deserted, but Dees finds several massacred people. After taking photographs, he goes to the bathroom to vomit and is surprised by Renfield, who reveals his face and turns out to truly be a vampire. Renfield destroys Dees' photographic film and forces him to drink a little of his blood, which gives Dees visions of all the victims coming back as zombies. In a trance, he attacks the bodies with an axe and is shot by the police officers who arrived on the scene with Blair. She sees Renfield get on his plane and take off but, adopting Dees' motto, she publishes an article that portrays Dees as the killer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Richard Dees\n* Julie Entwisle as Katherine Blair\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Merton Morrison\n* Michael H. Moss as Dwight Renfield\n* John Bennes as Ezra Hannon\n* Beverly Skinner as Selida McCamon\n* Rob Wilds as Buck Kendall\n* Richard K. Olsen as Claire Bowie\n* Elizabeth McCormick as Ellen Sarch\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and casting===\n''The Night Flier'' is based on the 1988 [[The Night Flier|short story of the same title]] by [[Stephen King]]. Jack O'Donnell, who co-wrote the film alongside director Mark Pavia, said that, \"Mark and I wanted to keep this film as close to the story as possible. Obviously, a 40-page short story is going to need to be filled out to turn it into a feature film.\"{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=81}} The character of Katherine Blair was added to the screenplay when O'Donnell, Pavia, and King decided to include \"a younger rookie for Dees to play off of.\"{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=81}}\n\n[[Miguel Ferrer]], who plays Richard Dees, first met King during the production of the 1994 miniseries ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]''.{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=81}} Ferrer became aware of the ''Night Flier'' adaptation about a year prior to the film's production, when ''The Stand'' director [[Mick Garris]] informed him that he was being considered for a role in it.{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=81}} Ferrer was not familiar with the short story at the time, and stated that, \"I went out and got it and read it, and I thought, 'Well, this is a great story, but I don't see a movie here,' you know what I mean? I didn't get it; I didn't see what they were going to do with it. So I spoke to Stephen and Mark, and I got the script and I thought, 'This is a really, really ingenious adaptation.{{' \"}}{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=81}}\n\nThe name of the vampire in the film, Dwight Renfield, is derived from American actor [[Dwight Frye]] and his role as [[Renfield]] in the 1931 English-language film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''.{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=40}}\n\n===Filming===\n''The Night Flier'' was shot on location in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. The production lost a day when [[Hurricane Bertha (1996)|Hurricane Bertha]] made landfall in the state in July 1996.{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=44}} Pavia stated that, \"I was pretty worried that we might lose some sets that we had just built, but we were lucky. We inspected them the day after the hurricane hit and they were fine. Some of the detail had gotten lost, some of the landscaping had changed, but overall it didn't really affect us.\"{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=44}}\n\n===Special effects===\nThe [[special effects]] and [[prosthetic makeup]] for the film was provided by [[KNB EFX Group]].{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=41}} Moss recalled that, when he first auditioned for the role of Renfield, \"I didn't know I would be in full makeup with the jaws and stuff. All I had were the [written] scenes, which I had been given for the audition. So I immediately felt how sad this man is, to have to be immortal and fly around and land in places with some kind of anonymity and all off people to feed, and I thought that aspect of him really was the most attractive [thing about the role]. But later, when I found out about all the rest of the stuff, I went, 'Oh, cool!{{' \"}}{{sfn|Palmer|1998|p=41}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film, which was independently financed by European investors, attracted strong interest from [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"kingbook\"/> Due to a crowded release schedule, the studio could only bring the film to theaters in time for [[Halloween]] 1998.<ref name=\"kingbook\"/> Director Mark Pavia and producer Richard P.
