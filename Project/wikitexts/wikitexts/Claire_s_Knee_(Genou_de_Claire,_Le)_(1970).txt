It is the fifth movie in the series of the ''[[Six Moral Tales]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story happens between 29 June and 29 July, presumably in 1970. Intertitles of the dates are displayed before the daily events are shown.\n\nWhile holidaying at [[Lake Annecy]] on the eve of his wedding, career diplomat J\u00e9r\u00f4me accidentally meets up with Aurora, an old personal friend. Through Aurora, he meets Aurora's landlady, Madame Walter, and Laura, Madame Walter's youngest teenage daughter. Observant Aurora detects Laura's crush on J\u00e9r\u00f4me, and advises J\u00e9r\u00f4me of such. After J\u00e9r\u00f4me and Laura take a hike in the mountains together, she confesses that she is \"a little in love with\" J\u00e9r\u00f4me.\n\nDays later (on 8 July), Laura's attractive older step-sister Claire arrives.  Upon seeing Claire's knee while she is on a ladder, J\u00e9r\u00f4me finds himself longing to touch it. However, he controls his temptation. Eventually an opportunity presents itself during a boat trip on the lake when J\u00e9r\u00f4me and Claire have to seek shelter in a hut from an approaching storm. J\u00e9r\u00f4me tells Claire that he saw her boyfriend, Gilles, together with another girl. When Claire starts to cry J\u00e9r\u00f4me consoles her by placing his hand upon Claire's knee.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Montcharvin, the diplomat\n* [[Aurora Cornu]] as Aurora, the novelist\n* [[B\u00e9atrice Romand]] as Laura, the younger step-sister\n* [[Laurence de Monaghan]] as Claire, the elder step-sister\n* [[Mich\u00e8le Montel]] as Madame Walter, the mother of Laura\n* [[G\u00e9rard Falconetti]] as Gilles\n* [[Fabrice Luchini]] as Vincent\n\n== Accolades==\nThe film received the [[Louis Delluc Prize]] for Best French film of the year,<ref name=\"NYT Overview\">{{cite web|title=Claire's Knee (1970)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9792/Claire-s-Knee/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015044238/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9792/Claire-s-Knee/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2007|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Hal Erickson|author-link=Hal Erickson (author)|date=2007|access-date=18 May 2012}}</ref> the 1971 [[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics|Prix M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] and the Grand Prix at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Film-maker Rohmer dies in Paris\">Ruadh\u00e1n Mac Cormaic (2010-01-11). \"Film-maker Rohmer dies in Paris\".

It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\nIt was a huge international success. [[Vincent Canby]] called it \"something close to a perfect film.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 919-928\">John Wakeman, World Film Directors, Volume 2, 1945-1985. New York: H. W.

Yet these 'fragments of a love speech' make up a special study of desire, verbal pleasure, almost literary, which accompanies every inclination. A jewel.\"\n\n==Style==\nIt was Rohmer's second film shot in color, with Rohmer explaining \"the presence of the lake and the mountains is stronger in color than in black and white. It is a film I couldn't imagine in black and white. The color green seems to me essential in that film...This film would have no value to me in black and white.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman. pp. 919-928\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0065772}}\n* {{Amg movie|9792}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=71022}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|claires_knee}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/438-claire-s-knee-rohmer-s-women ''Claire\u2019s Knee: Rohmer\u2019s Women''] an essay by [[Molly Haskell]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/cteq/claires_knee/ on Claire\u2019s Knee] by Daniel Hayes\n\n{{\u00c9ric Rohmer}}\n{{Golden Shell}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1970 films]]\n[[Category:1970s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by \u00c9ric Rohmer]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Annecy]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Barbet Schroeder]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1970 drama films]]\n[[Category:National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film winners]]\n[[Category:1970s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s French films]]"}]}}}}
