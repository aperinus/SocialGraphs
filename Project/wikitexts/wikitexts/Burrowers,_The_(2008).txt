T. Petty]]. The film is based on an original short film, ''Blood Red Earth'' directed by Petty.<ref>[http://www.shockya.com/news/2009/04/15/the-burrowers-world-premiere-exclusively-free-on-fearnetcom/ The Burrowers World Premiere Exclusively Free on Fearnet.com]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 1879, and beyond the fringes of civilization a handful of pioneers maintain settlements while exploring the unknown territories. One night, a family from one of these settlements is brutally dragged into darkness by a group of unknown invaders. At first the kidnappers are thought to be hostile [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s, and a posse forms to bring the family back home safely.\n\nVenturing out into the unmapped territories is an Irish immigrant desperate to find his lost love, a na\u00efve teen eager to prove his worth, a [[freedman]] seeking his fortune, and a hardened pair of battle-weary Indian fighters. But nature's wrath and the [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]s of hostile tribes are not the only threats that this group will be forced to confront, because as the bodies begin to multiply and the truth about the abductors gradually emerges, these rescuers will find out that there are forces in this world that cannot be described in human terms\u2014and that seem to have motivations beyond our comprehension.\n\nA species, called \"Burrowers\" by the Natives, used to subsist on [[American Bison|buffalo]]. When white settlers depleted the buffalo, the species began to survive on human meat \u2013 first hunting nearby Indians and later the settlers. One tribe in particular, the [[Ute people|Ute]], have experience in combating the hunter-species. The \"Burrowers\" first lace their victims by cutting them and drugging them with a toxin. The victim is then buried alive and eaten only after decomposition has begun. By the time the film's protagonists meet up with the Ute their numbers are severely depleted, but the Ute method of drugging someone already infected with \"Burrower\" toxin proves effective. When the \"Burrowers\" go to eat the twice drugged victim they themselves fall asleep and are vulnerable, especially to the rays of the sun, which are the only apparent thing that can kill them. However, the surviving member of the posse, the Irishman Coffey, is unable to discover exactly what the Ute used to drug the \"Burrowers\", as most of the remaining Ute are executed by the overzealous cavalry. The film ends with the suggestion that the \"Burrower\" attacks will continue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Clancy Brown]] as John Clay\n*[[William Mapother]] as William Parcher\n*[[Laura Leighton]] as Gertrude Spacks\n*[[Alexandra Edmo]] as Faith\n*[[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Walnut Callaghan\n*[[Doug Hutchison]] as Henry Victor\n*[[Tatanka Means]] as Tall Ute\n*[[Anthony Parker]] as Ten Bear\n*[[Karl Geary]] as Fergus Coffey\n*[[Galen Hutchison]] as Dobie Spacks\n*[[David Mindhunter]] as Dull Kinfe\n*[[Jocelin Donahue]] as Maryanne Stewart\n}}\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=January 2018}}\n''The Burrowers'' was first screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2008.<ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|title=The Burrowers (2008) \u2013 J.T.
