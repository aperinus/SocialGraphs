It is the seventh installment in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]]. Ignoring the Jamie Lloyd story arc of the previous three installments, ''H20'' is a retcon and reboot of the franchise, acting as a direct sequel to the second film. It follows a [[Post traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic]] [[Laurie Strode]], who has faked her death in order to go into hiding from her murderous brother, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], who finds her working at a private [[boarding school]] in [[California]].\n\n''Halloween H20'' was released in the United States on August 5, 1998. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and grossed $75 million worldwide against a budget of $17 million. A sequel, ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'', was released four years later in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 29, 1998, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] burgles [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]' [[Retirement home|retirement house]] in Langdon, Illinois. Loomis' former colleague, Marion Chambers, who took care of Dr. Loomis until he died, arrives and discovers that the file on [[Laurie Strode]] (who is presumed dead in an automobile accident) is missing. Michael murders her, her teenage neighbor Jimmy, and his friend Tony before leaving the house in Jimmy\u2019s car with Laurie's file.\n\nIn Summer Glen, California, Laurie (having faked her death to avoid Michael) lives under an assumed name, \"Keri Tate.\" She is the [[headmistress]] of Hillcrest Academy, a private [[boarding school]]. Her career is supported by her secretary Norma Watson and the Hillcrest [[guidance counselor]] Will Brennan, who she is also in a relationship with. However, Laurie is far from happy, as the tragic events from 1978 still haunt her; she lives in fear that Michael may return for her. While a woman and her daughter are at a rest stop, Michael steals their car. At the academy campus, the students leave to attend a school trip to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]], leaving only Laurie; Will; security guard Ronny Jones; Laurie's son John; his girlfriend Molly Cartwell; and their classmate Charlie Deveraux plus his girlfriend Sarah Wainthrope, who are having a Halloween party in the school basement.\n\nLaurie receives some maternal advice from Norma before she leaves work for the weekend and later that night reveals her true identity to Will while Michael arrives at the school. He quickly murders Charlie and Sarah before attacking John and Molly, who are rescued by Laurie and Will, and Michael and Laurie come face to face for the first time in 20 years. Will accidentally shoots Ronny (who had been patrolling the hallway) when he mistakes Ronny's shadow for Michael, and Michael kills Will while Will and Laurie are examining Ronny's body.\n\nLaurie manages to get John and Molly to safety, and realizing that she'll never be safe from Michael as long as he's alive, decides to confront Michael head-on. Laurie stabs Michael numerous times and pushes him over a balcony. She prepares to stab him again, but Ronny (who survived the shooting) stops her. The authorities arrive at the scene and load Michael into a coroner's van, but Laurie, knowing that Michael is still alive, steals the van to kill him for good. Michael awakens and attacks Laurie, who slams on her brakes, sending Michael crashing through the windshield. As Michael rises again, Laurie hits him with the van before sending them both tumbling down a steep embankment. Laurie, having fallen out of the van, discovers Michael pinned between the van and a tree. Michael reaches for Laurie, who feels a moment of pity for her brother, before she finally decapitates him with an axe.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n{{Main|List of Halloween (film series) characters}}\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]] (Keri Tate)\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as John Tate\n* [[Adam Arkin]] as Will Brennan \n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Molly Cartwell\n* [[Adam Hann-Byrd]] as Charlie Deveraux \n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Sarah Wainthrope\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as Norma Watson \n* [[LL Cool J]] as Ronald 'Ronny' Jones\n* Chris Durand as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]\n* [[Nancy Stephens]] as Marion Chambers-Whittington\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Jimmy Howell\n* Branden Williams as Tony Alegre\n* [[Beau Billingslea]] as Detective Fitzsimmons\n* [[Matt Winston]] as Matt Sampson\n* Larisa Miller as Claudia\n* Emmalee Thompson as Casey\n* [[Tom Kane]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] (voice)\n* [[LisaGay Hamilton|Lisa Gay Hamilton]] as Shirley 'Shirl' Jones (voice)\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\nThe original idea for the seventh Halloween film began as the second half of the treatment written by [[Daniel Farrands]] during pre-production of ''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers'', which he later submitted as a new treatment entitled ''Michael Myers: Lord of the Dead''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|title=Daniel Farrands Interview (1997)|url=https://73miles-blog.tumblr.com/post/8817919523/daniel-farrands|access-date=2021-01-05|website=73 Miles to Haddonfield|date=August 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|date=2014-10-24|title=[Interview] Daniel Farrands Reveals 'Halloween 6' and '7' That Could Have Been|url=https://halloweendailynews.com/2014/10/interview-halloween-6-daniel-farrands/|access-date=2021-01-05|website=Halloween Daily News|language=en-US}}</ref> The story would have opened immediately after the events of the previous film and involved Tommy Doyle discovering that the entire town of Haddonfield was involved in a conspiracy to control Michael Myers.

Originally intended to be a [[direct-to-video]] film, this would have involved Michael Myers stalking an all women's boarding school. The plot eventually also revealed a [[Copycat crime|copycat killer]], causing many fans to compare such a twist to [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|''The Silence of the Lambs'']]. The pitch itself was changed a couple of times, changing the title to ''Halloween: Blood Ties'' as they involved Laurie Strode into the storyline, before scrapping the idea entirely.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Millman|first=Ashleigh|date=2019-05-08|title=Every Halloween Movie (They Never Actually Made)|url=https://whatculture.com/film/every-halloween-movie-they-never-actually-made|access-date=2020-09-17|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay was based on a story by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://horrorpedia.com/2013/10/20/halloween-h20-20-years-later/|title=Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|date=October 20, 2013|website=HORRORPEDIA|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref> with the original working title for the film being ''Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Williamson was initially hired to write a script, and the story was situated as a sequel to the previous six films, thereby keeping the timeline's continuity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/halloween-h20-original-script-jamie-lloyd-story-continuation/|title=Halloween H20 Original Script Continued Jamie Lloyd's Story|date=2020-04-14|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://lairofhorror.tripod.com/myerslair/dyk7.html|title=Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later: Did You Know?|website=LairofHorror.Tripod.com|access-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2019}} When Williamson first outlined ''Halloween H20'', he created the storyline in which Laurie Strode has faked her own death and taken on a new identity as a specific way of [[retroactive continuity|retconning]] the character's death in ''Halloween 4''.

Audio clips from ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' were initially considered when playing his monologue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, instead of the voice of [[Donald Pleasence]] himself, sound-alike voice actor [[Tom Kane]] provides this voice-over.\n\n[[John Carpenter]] was originally in consideration to be the director for this particular follow-up since [[Jamie Lee Curtis|Curtis]] wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original to have active involvement in it. It was believed that Carpenter opted out because he wanted no active part in the sequel; however, this is not the case. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million, so he demanded a three-picture deal with Dimension Films. Carpenter's bargain was denied by the Weinsteins, and therefore no deal took place. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing.\n\n''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' writer/producer Kevin Williamson was involved in various areas of production. Although not directly credited, he provided rewrites in character dialogue and helped make alterations and sketches of the script. He also came up with the paramedic storyline that explained how Michael survived the ending, which was partially filmed the day after principal photography ended and later utilized in the film's sequel. The writers of ''Halloween H20'' were left with a dilemma when Curtis wanted to end the series, but Moustapha Akkad had a clause that legally wouldn't allow the writers to kill Michael Myers off. According to the Blu-ray released by [[Scream Factory]], Curtis almost left the project just weeks before filming, until Kevin Williamson came up with the paramedic storyline and presented it to Akkad. Curtis finally agreed to be a part of the film under the condition that no footage hinting toward a sequel would be presented by the film, and that the audience would believe that Michael was dead until the inevitable sequel was announced.
