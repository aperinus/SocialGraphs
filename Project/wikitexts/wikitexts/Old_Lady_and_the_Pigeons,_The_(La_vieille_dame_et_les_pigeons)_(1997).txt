It tells the slightly surreal story of a starving policeman who dresses up as a pigeon and tricks an old lady into feeding him. The film was produced through the French company Les Armateurs with support from companies in Canada, Belgium and the United Kingdom. It was Chomet's debut film and won several awards including the Grand Prix at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nAn emaciated Parisian policeman discovers an old lady who feeds pigeons in the park excessively. After having a nightmare ending in giant pigeon-men pecking at his stomach, the policeman constructs a pigeon mask, which he wears to the old lady's home. She welcomes him inside and, despite his rude behavior, allows him to gorge himself. As weeks pass, the policeman grows increasingly fat. As he goes up flights of stairs to the woman's home each day, he passes a maid sweeping the floor.\n\nEventually, the policeman discovers the old lady's other pet: the woman who swept the floor, dressed as a cat. When the old lady spots the police man, she begins to pursue him with a large pair of shears. He tries to remove his fake pigeon head, to reveal himself as human, but it has become stuck around his neck. As the old lady is cornering him, the policeman falls out the window and onto the street, among a small group of pigeons. In the final scene the policeman, skinny once more and without his pigeon suit, is seen behaving like a pigeon in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n==Dialogue==\nIn [[Jacques Tati|Tati]]-esque fashion, the bulk of the film is without any dialogue at all. And what there is in English: supplied by overweight American tourists in the opening and closing scenes.\n\n==Production==\n[[Sylvain Chomet]] had been based in London and worked as an animator in advertisement since the 1980s. He returned to his native France in 1990 and, inspired by [[Nick Park]]'s ''[[Creature Comforts]]'', set about making his own film.<ref name=lenburg>{{Harvnb|Lenburg|2006|p=45}}</ref> Chomet pitched ''The Old Lady and the Pigeons'' to [[Didier Brunner]], producer at Les Amateurs, with whom he began to work on the film in 1991. The producers had difficulties raising enough money, but decided to start anyway, with money from the [[National Center of Cinematography and the moving image|National Center of Cinematography]]. The backgrounds were designed by [[Nicolas de Cr\u00e9cy]], who had studied with Chomet and previously collaborated on comics projects. The team produced the film's first four minutes at the [[Folimage]] studios in [[Bourg-l\u00e8s-Valence]]. They then attempted to use the finished footage to attract more investors, but failed. In 1993, Chomet relocated to Canada in hope of a fresh start; however, Brunner suddenly managed to pre-sell the film to the [[BBC]] and several other broadcasters, and production could continue.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foley|first=Jack|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/film/belleville_rendezvous_chometQ&A.html|title=Belleveille Rendez-vous - Sylvain Chomet Q&A|work=IndieLondon|access-date=2011-07-20<!-- |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60JMWFqZK?url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/film/belleville_rendezvous_chometQ&A.html -->}}</ref> Five years after production started the film was completed.<ref name=lenburg />\n\n==Reception==\nThe film competed at the 1997 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].
