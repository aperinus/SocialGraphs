Retrieved 2010-10-18.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Cold Mountain''''' is a 2003 [[Epic film|epic]] [[historical drama|period]] [[war film]] written and directed by [[Anthony Minghella]]. The film is based on the bestselling [[Cold Mountain (novel)|1997 novel of the same name]] by [[Charles Frazier]]. It stars [[Jude Law]], [[Nicole Kidman]], and [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] with [[Eileen Atkins]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Jack White]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Donald Sutherland]], and [[Ray Winstone]] in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a wounded deserter from the [[Confederate army]] close to the end of the [[American Civil War]], who journeys home to reunite with the woman he loves. The film was a co-production of companies in Italy, Romania, and the United States.\n\n''Cold Mountain'' was released theatrically on December 25, 2003 by [[Miramax Films]]. It became a critical and commercial success grossing over $173 million and receiving seven nominations at the [[76th Academy Awards]], with Zellweger winning \n[[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[North Carolina]] secedes from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on May 20, 1861, the young men of [[Cold Mountain (North Carolina)|Cold Mountain]] enlist in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Among them is W.P. Inman, a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada Monroe, the preacher's daughter who came from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to care for her father. Their courtship is interrupted by the war, they share their first kiss the day Inman leaves for battle. Ada promises to wait for him.\n\nThree years later, Inman fights in the [[Battle of the Crater]] and survives. He then comforts a dying acquaintance from Cold Mountain, while fellow soldier Stobrod Thewes plays a tune on his [[fiddle]]. Inman is later wounded in a skirmish, and as he lies in a hospital near death, a nurse reads him a letter from Ada, who pleads for Inman to come home to her. Inman recovers and deserts, embarking on a long trek back to Cold Mountain.\n\nInman encounters corrupt preacher Veasey, and stops him from drowning his pregnant enslaved lover. Exiled from his parish, Veasey joins Inman on his journey. They later meet a young man named Junior, and join him and his family for dinner. Junior brings the [[Confederate Home Guard]], who take Inman and Veasey away along with other deserters. Veasey and the group are killed in a skirmish with Union cavalry, while Inman is left for dead. An elderly hermit living in the woods finds Inman and nurses him back to health. He eventually meets a grieving young widow named Sara and her infant child Ethan, and stays the night at her cabin. The next morning, three Union soldiers arrive demanding food. They take Ethan hostage and try to rape Sara, forcing Inman and Sara to kill them.\n\nBack in Cold Mountain, Ada's father has died, leaving her with no money and little means to run their farm in Black Cove. She survives on the kindness of her neighbors, particularly Esco and Sally Swanger, who eventually send for Ruby Thewes (Stobrod's daughter) to help. Ruby moves in and together they bring the farm to working order, becoming close. Meanwhile, Ada continues to write letters to Inman, hoping they will reunite and renew their romance.\n\nAda has several tense encounters with Captain Teague, the leader of the local [[Confederate Home Guard|Home Guard]] who covets Ada and her property, and whose grandfather had once owned much of Cold Mountain. One day, Teague and his men kill Esco, and then torture Sally to coax her deserter sons out of hiding and kill them as well. Ada and Ruby rescue Sally, who is traumatized and rendered mute. The women celebrate Christmas with Stobrod, who has come to Cold Mountain with fellow deserters and musicians Pangle and Georgia.\n\nWhile camping in the woods one night, Stobrod and Pangle are cornered by Teague and the Guard while Georgia secretly watches; Pangle inadvertently reveals they are deserters, and the Guard shoot Pangle and Stobrod. Georgia escapes and informs Ruby and Ada, who return to the scene to find Pangle dead and Stobrod badly wounded. The women and Stobrod take shelter in an abandoned [[Cherokee]] camp. Ada goes hunting for food and is reunited with Inman, who has finally returned to Cold Mountain. They return to the camp, and spend the night consummating their love.\n\nAs they head home, Ada and Ruby are surrounded by Teague and his men, having captured and tortured Georgia for their whereabouts. Inman arrives and kills Teague and most of his posse in a gunfight. He then chases Teague's lieutenant, Bosie, and they exchange [[fast draw]]s. Bosie is killed but Inman is mortally wounded. Ada finds and comforts Inman, who dies in her arms.\n\nYears later, it is revealed that Ada's night with Inman produced a daughter, Grace Inman, and that Ruby has married Georgia bearing two children. With Stobrod and Sally, the family celebrates Easter together at Black Cove.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jude Law]] as William \"W.

Their justification is the effect popular media have on national and worldwide perceptions of Appalachian people, particularly southern Appalachians in this case. The opinions vary, but the consensus among them is the historical context of the movie is close to the scholarship.<ref>Arnold, Edwin T., Tyler Blethen, Amy Tipton Cortner, Anna Creadick, John Crutchfield, Silas House, John C. Inscoe, Gordon B. McKinney and Jack Wright. \"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40934797 APPALJ Roundtable Discussion: Cold Mountain, the Film].\" ''Appalachian Journal'' (Spring/Summer 2004): 316-353;  Crawford, Martin. \"Cold Mountain Fictions: Appalachian Half-Truths.\" Review of Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier.

James |work=Music Copyright Infringement Resource |publisher=USC Gould School of Law |quote=At the time of the Civil War these songs, in the only available edition of the Sacred Harp, had only one verse apiece, and neither contained an alto part.}}</ref>\n\nThe beginning [[Battle of the Crater]] is depicted as happening in broad daylight but it began at 4:44 am with the detonation of the mine.\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1997, [[United Artists]] bought the rights to ''Cold Mountain'' for Anthony Minghella to write and direct, with Sydney Pollack as producer. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/United Artists and [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] then announced a deal to produce eight films together, sharing the profits.\n\nAs the script was developed, the scope of the film grew from a period love story with a budget of $40 million into an expensive epic. The budget grew to nearly $120 million, with Minghella having trouble finding American landscapes that could pass for 19th-century towns. [[Tom Cruise]], at the time married to [[Nicole Kidman]], wanted to play Inman, but the studio did not want to pay his $20 million demand. To get the budget down, production was moved to Romania, but three weeks before filming began in July 2002, MGM pulled out. Producer [[Harvey Weinstein]] was going to cancel the shoot, but with Minghella already in pre-production he agreed to fund the $80 million project after receiving a $10 million tax break.<ref name=breakeven/>\n\n===Location===\n[[Cold Mountain (North Carolina)|Cold Mountain]], where the film is set, is a real mountain located within the [[Pisgah National Forest]], [[Haywood County, North Carolina]]. It was filmed mostly in [[Romania]], with numerous scenes filmed in [[Virginia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]]. The film was one of an increasing number of Hollywood productions made in eastern Europe as a result of lower costs in the region; and because, in this instance, [[Transylvania]] having fewer infrastructure like power cables and paved roads was less marked by modern life than the [[Appalachia]]ns.\n\n===Editing===\nThe film marked a technological and industry turnaround in editing. [[Walter Murch]] edited ''Cold Mountain'' on [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s sub-$1000 [[Final Cut Pro]] software using off-the-shelf [[PowerMac G4|G4]]s. This was a leap for such a big budgeted film, where expensive [[Avid Technology|Avid]] systems are usually the standard [[Non-linear editing system|editing system]].

(soundtrack)|O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', a largely old-time and folk album with limited radio play that still enjoyed commercial success, and garnered a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. As a result, comparisons were drawn between the two albums. The soundtrack, however, also employs many folk and blues elements.\n\nIt features songs written by [[Jack White]] of The [[White Stripes]] (who also appeared in the film in the role of Georgia), [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Costello and Sting's contributions, \"[[The Scarlet Tide]]\" and \"[[You Will Be My Ain True Love]]\", were both nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and featured vocals by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] singer [[Alison Krauss]]. [[Gabriel Yared]]'s [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated score is represented by four tracks amounting to approximately fifteen minutes of music.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was nominated for more than seventy awards, including seven [[Academy Award]] nominations.
