The film is set in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw]] neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]], and follows the life of Kaydee \"Caine\" Lawson ([[Tyrin Turner]]) and his close friends. It gained notoriety for its scenes of violence, profanity, and drug-related content, and also received critical acclaim for the performances of Turner, [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]], and [[Larenz Tate]], the direction, and its realistic portrayal of urban violence and powerful underlying messages.\n\n==Plot==\nKaydee \"Caine\" Lawson and his best friend Kevin \"O-Dog\" Anderson enter a [[liquor store]] to buy some [[malt liquor]], where a [[Korean people|Korean]] [[cashier]] and his wife rush them to pay for their drinks and leave, suspecting that they might be trying to steal something. After their purchase, the cashier insults and provokes O-Dog by saying, \"I feel sorry for your mother.\" Consequently, O-Dog argues with him, fatally shoots both the cashier and his wife, takes the surveillance tape, robs the clerk's wallet and the cash register, and flees with Caine.\n\nIn a [[voice-over]], Caine reveals that his father Tat, a drug dealer, was killed in a [[drug deal]] gone wrong when Caine was 10, and his mother Karen, a [[heroin]] addict, died of a drug overdose. This led to his grandparents raising him in the crime-ridden [[Jordan Downs]] housing projects.\n\nO-Dog flaunts the surveillance tape to his admiring friends, greatly annoying Caine. Later, Caine and his cousin Harold are [[carjacking|carjacked]] en route from a party, with Caine being wounded and Harold being murdered. After learning the carjackers' whereabouts, Caine, O-Dog, and their friend A-Wax, an OG, hunt them down and kill them, avenging Harold's death.\n\nCaine and O-Dog attempted to steal a car then got caught and bitten by a police dog. The two men get arrested after a failed [[Motor vehicle theft|car theft]] attempt. Caine's fingerprints match those taken from a beer bottle he dropped in the liquor store on the night of the murders, and though he is interrogated by a detective who tricks him by changing the times to confuse him, he soon walks free nonetheless as the police fail to link him. Caine's friends, Stacy and Sharif, try to convince him to accompany them to [[Kansas]], and both his grandfather and Sharif's father warn him that he will either end up dead or imprisoned unless he changes his ways. Caine, nevertheless, ignores all advice.\n\nAfter buying a [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]] from a [[chop shop]], Caine [[Carjacking|carjacks]] another young black man for his gold [[Dayton wire wheels]] and his jewelry, subsequently orders some [[double cheeseburger|double cheeseburgers]] at the [[fast food restaurant]], then purchases a large quantity of [[cocaine]], planning to sell it as [[Crack cocaine|crack]]. Caine also meets a local girl named Illena and eventually has sex with her. While driving one night, he and Sharif are pulled over and beaten by cops. The two are dumped in a [[Hispanic-American|Hispanic]] neighborhood, but the Hispanic gang members surprisingly take them to a [[hospital]] rather than beat them further as feared. During his hospitalization, Caine's friend Ronnie invites him to accompany her to [[Atlanta]], where she has found a job. Initially hesitant, he ultimately agrees.\n\nAt a party, Chauncey, a confederate of Caine in an insurance scam, drunkenly moves sexually towards Ronnie. Caine rescues her and starts [[pistol-whipping]] Chauncey, prompting Stacy and Sharif to restrain him. Illena calls Caine and tells him she's pregnant, but he denies paternity and drops her. Chauncey retaliates by sending a copy of the surveillance tape to the police, who begin hunting Caine and O-Dog, now wanted for the liquor store crimes. Doc, Caine & O-Dog's friend, alerts O-Dog and others of Chauncey's actions, forcing O-Dog and Caine to hide out at Ronnie's and other friends' houses. O-Dog vows to murder Chauncey if the police don't catch him first.\n\nMeanwhile, Caine beats up Illena's cousin when he confronts Caine outside his grandparents' house about the pregnancy. After witnessing the beating, Caine's grandparents decide that it's best for him to not live with them anymore, despite his pleas to stay until he moves to Atlanta. Meanwhile, Illena's cousin gathers his friends to get revenge on Caine.\n\nAs Caine and Ronnie are preparing to leave for Atlanta, Illena's cousin and his friends drive by Ronnie's house and engage in a [[drive-by shooting|drive-by]] shootout. Sharif is killed instantly, while Caine is fatally wounded trying to protect Ronnie's son. Stacy and Ronnie come running out of the house screaming for help. O-Dog retaliates at the attackers and is unharmed and Stacy tells him to get help. As Caine slowly dies, he recalls his grandfather asking him if he cares whether he lives or dies, and he realizes in his dying moment that he does.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Tyrin Turner]] as Kaydee \"Caine\" Lawson\n**[[Brandon Hammond]] as five-year-old Caine\n*[[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] as Ronnie\n*[[Larenz Tate]] as Kevin \"O-Dog\" Anderson\n*[[MC Eiht]] as A-Wax\n*[[Glenn Plummer]] as James \"Pernell\" Richards\n*[[Clifton Powell]] as Chauncey\n*[[Arnold Johnson (actor)|Arnold Johnson]] as Thomas Lawson\n*[[Pooh-Man]] as Doc\n*Julian Roy Doster as Anthony\n*[[Too Short]] as Lew-Loc\n*[[Khandi Alexander]] as Karen Lawson\n*Vonte Sweet as Sharif Butler\n*[[Bill Duke]] as Detective\n*[[Samuel L.

[[MC Eiht]] replaced MC Ren's role as A-Wax. Rappers [[Spice 1]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] were initially set to play Caine and Sharif respectively, but they were later fired, with director Allen Hughes stating that Shakur was causing trouble on the set. Shakur was angry for not being told why Sharif would turn Muslim. When Shakur was cast in the role of Sharif who, as described in the film was \u201can ex-knucklehead turned Muslim\u201d, he did not agree with how the character was written. While many of his rap music contemporaries, that were also staring in the film, were portraying roles similar to their gangsta rap personas, playing Sharif would have required Shakur to portray the character with as a stoic & pious Muslim. According to MC Eiht, who played A-Wax in the film:\n\n''\u201cMy take on it was, everytime we got ready to reherse, he had an opinion about his character\u2026He wanted them to write in the script WHY he turned Muslim\u2026\u201d''\n\n''\u201cShow me why I turned Muslim and they wouldn\u2019t do it and that\u2019s what angered him\u2026\u201d''\n\n''\u201cYou\u2019re not just going to give people that ideal that Tupac is just this yeah you know, \u201cpreach my brother\u201d, fuck that!\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite web |title=EXCLUSIVE: MC Eiht Says 2Pac Thought 'Menace II Society' Character Wasn't Gangster |url=https://www.vladtv.com/article/216398/mc-eiht-says-2pac-thought-menace-ii-society-character-wasnt-gangster |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=www.vladtv.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nSix months after the firing, Shakur assaulted Hughes, resulting in Shakur being found guilty of assault and battery.<ref name=\"jet\">{{Cite magazine |date=February 28, 1994 |title=Tupac Shakur Convicted For Attack On Director Allen Hughes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |page=18 |access-date=September 27, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1708225/menace-ii-society-tupac-shakur/ |title=Tupac Would Have 'Outshined' 'Menace II Society,' Director Admits |date=May 30, 2013 |first=Rob |last=Markman |publisher=MTV |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1708225/menace-ii-society-tupac-shakur/ |archive-date=January 1, 2016}}</ref> Shakur did not want to play the role of Sharif, as he did not believe, in regard to the authenticity of such a role, that a Muslim could also be a [[gangbanger]].
