It features three segments, each based on unrelated short stories by [[Richard Matheson]]. The first follows a college professor who seeks excitement with her students; the second is about twin sisters who have a bizarre relationship.  These two segments were adapted by [[William F. Nolan]]. The third, adapted by Matheson himself, focuses on a woman terrorized by a [[Zuni mythology|Zuni]] [[Fetishism|fetish]] doll in her apartment. Black stars in all three segments, and plays dual roles in the second.\n\nThe film was first aired as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' on March 4, 1975. Black initially turned down the project, but reconsidered when her then-husband, Robert Burton, was cast in the first segment \"Julie\". A television film sequel titled ''[[Trilogy of Terror II]]'', written and also directed by Dan Curtis, was released in 1996.\n\n==Plots==\n===\"Julie\"===\nChad Rogers is a college student with a crush on his English teacher, Julie Eldridge. During one class, Chad is distracted by Julie's thigh as she sits on her desk, and he daydreams about her. Chad reveals his fantasies to his friend Eddie Nells, but Eddie discourages him from becoming romantically involved with teachers. Later that evening, when Julie is undressing in her room, Chad watches her through a window. The next day, he asks Julie out on a date. She initially refuses, but later accepts the offer.\n\nDuring the date at a [[drive-in theater]], Chad spikes Julie's drink, rendering her [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], and drives her to a motel. After checking them in as husband and wife, he photographs her in a variety of sexually provocative positions (it's implied that he also [[Date rape|rapes]] her). He drives her home as she begins to regain consciousness, saying that she had fallen asleep during the movie.\n\nAfter developing the photographs in his darkroom, Chad shows the pictures to Julie. She is furious and threatens to call the police. Chad blackmails Julie into submitting to his romantic attentions. After several weeks of this, Julie announces, \"The game is over.\" She reveals that it was actually she who had manipulated Chad in an elaborate role play of her own design. \"Did you really think that dull, little mind of yours could possibly have conceived any of the rather dramatic experiences we've shared? Why do you think you suddenly had the overwhelming desire to see what I looked like under 'all those clothes?' Don't feel bad ... I always get bored after a while.\" Chad realizes that Julie has poisoned his drink, and then he collapses. Julie drags him into the [[darkroom]] where she sets fire to the offending photographs.\n\nChad's death is later reported in local media as a house fire. Julie adds the newspaper story to a [[scrapbooking|scrapbook]] of articles depicting students who met similar fates. There is a knock at the door, and another young handsome student in need of a tutor enters.\n\n===\"Millicent and Therese\"===\nThis tale of sibling rivalry focuses on a pair of twin sisters, played by Karen Black.\n\nMillicent is a repressed, unattractive, and prudish [[brunette]]; while her twin sister Therese, a worldly, seductive, and free-spirited [[blond]]e. Millicent greets Thomas, one of Therese's lovers, and questions him about the nature of some unspecified immoral event that happened during Thomas and Millicent's sexual relationship. Millicent confides to Dr. Ramsey (Millicent's friend and family therapist) that her sister has [[Incest|engaged in sex with their father]] and is holding her captive inside the family mansion, while gloating to Millicent about her deeds. Ramsey arrives one day to the mansion to speak with Therese, who comes on to Ramsey and furiously throws him out of the house when he refuses her advances.\n\nMillicent writes a letter to Dr. Ramsey, explaining that she has determined that Therese is evil and that she needs to stop her even if that means losing her own life, and plans to use a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] doll to kill her. When Dr. Ramsey enters the house, he finds Therese dead on her bedroom floor with the doll next to her and Millicent nowhere to be found. Dr. Ramsey reveals, as the family doctor, that \"Therese\" and \"Millicent\" are the same person; Therese suffered from [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] brought on by the fact that \"Therese\" slept with her father and subsequently killed her mother \u2014 and \"Millicent\" was an alternative personality with a repressed sexuality to cope with the horror of her actions. The recent death of the woman's father unhinged her further, and the \"murder\" was actually a form of suicide.\n\n===\"Amelia\"===\n\"Amelia\" was filmed like a [[one-man show|one-woman play]], with Karen Black as the only actor. It was also the only film of the three whose script was written by the original author of the story, Richard Matheson. \"Amelia\" is based on his 1969 short story, \"Prey\". The other two are based on stories by Matheson as well, but their teleplays were written by William F. Nolan.\n\nAmelia lives alone in a high-rise apartment building. She returns home after a fateful shopping spree carrying a package containing a wooden fetish doll, crafted in the form of a misshapen aboriginal warrior equipped with nasty, pointed teeth and a spear. A scroll comes with the doll, claiming that the doll contains the actual spirit of a Zuni hunter named \"He Who Kills\", and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. As Amelia makes a call to her mother, we learn that she suffers from her mother's overbearing behavior. Amelia struggles to justify her independence and cancels their plans for the evening by claiming she has a date. As Amelia leaves the room, we see the Zuni doll's golden chain suddenly fall off.\n\nLater, Amelia is preparing dinner, using a carving knife. She enters the darkened living room, and realizes the doll is not on the coffee table. Amelia hears a noise in the kitchen and when she investigates, the knife is missing. Returning to the living room, she is suddenly attacked by the doll, which stabs at her ankles viciously. She attempts to flee, but the doll chases her around the apartment. In the bathroom, Amelia envelops the doll in a towel and attempts futilely to drown it in the bathtub. She later traps it in a suitcase, but the doll begins cutting a circular hole through the top of suitcase with the butcher knife, but Amelia manages to stab it back into the suitcase. Thinking it might be dead, she slowly opens the case up, only to have it leap out and latch its teeth onto her arm. After managing to get it off her arm by smashing it into one of her lamps, it then latches onto her neck, but Amelia manages to detach it and hurl the doll into the oven where it catches fire. She holds the oven door while she listens to the doll howling and screaming as it burns and, while black smoke billows out, she waits until the screaming eventually stops. Opening the oven to ensure that the doll is \"dead\", she is struck by some force that pushes her backward and from which she emits a blood-curdling scream.\n\nAt some point after that, the audience sees Amelia (from behind) place another call to her mother. In a calm, controlled voice, she apologizes for her behavior during the previous call, and invites her mother to come over. She then rips the bolt from her front door and crouches down low in an animalistic manner, carrying a large carving knife. She is now seen frontally, stabbing at the floor with the weapon, grinning ferally and revealing the horrific teeth of the Zuni fetish doll, whose spirit now inhabits her body.\n\n==Cast==\n'''\"Julie\"'''\n* [[Karen Black]] as Julie\n* Robert Burton as Chad Rogers\n* [[Jim Storm (actor)|Jim Storm]] as Eddie Nells\n* [[Gregory Harrison]] as the New Student\n* [[Kathryn Reynolds (actress)|Kathryn Reynolds]] as Anne Richards  \n* Orin Cannon as Motel Clerk\n* Tracy Curtis as Tracy\n\n'''\"Millicent and Therese\"'''\n* Karen Black as Millicent / Therese\n* [[John Karlen]] as Thomas Amman\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Dr. Chester Ramsey\n\n'''\"Amelia\"'''\n* Karen Black as Amelia\n* [[Walker Edmiston]] (uncredited) as the voice of the Zuni doll\n\n==Production==\n===Concept===\nAll three of the segments in ''Trilogy of Terror'' are based on individual stories by horror writer [[Richard Matheson]].<ref name=id>{{cite news|work=Idaho State Journal|location=Pocatello, Idaho|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24408505/idaho_state_journal/|title=Terror in trilogy|page=15|date=February 28, 1975|via=Newspapers.com|access-date=October 10, 2018|archive-date=October 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010095324/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24408505/idaho_state_journal/|url-status=live}} {{open access}}</ref> The segments \"Julie\" and \"Millicent and Therese\" were adapted by [[William F.
