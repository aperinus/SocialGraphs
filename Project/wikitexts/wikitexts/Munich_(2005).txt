From left to right: Avner Kaufman, Robert, Carl, Hans and Steve.]] \nAt the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorist group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] [[Munich massacre|kills]] 11 members of the [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli Olympic team]]. Avner Kaufman, a [[Mossad]] agent of [[German Jews|German-Jewish descent]], is chosen to lead a mission to assassinate 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. At the direction of his [[Agent handling|handler]] Ephraim, to give the Israeli government [[plausible deniability]], Kaufman resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: [[History of the Jews in South Africa|South African]] driver Steve, [[History of the Jews in Belgium|Belgian]] toy-maker and explosives expert Robert, former Israeli soldier and \"[[cleaner (crime)|cleaner]]\" Carl, and German antiques dealer and document forger Hans from [[Frankfurt]]. They are given information by a French informant, Louis.\n\nIn Rome, the team shoots and kills [[Wael Zwaiter]], who is living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus, they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] commandos, they pursue three Palestinian militants\u2014[[Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar]], [[Kamal Adwan]], and [[Kamal Nasser]]\u2014to Beirut, [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon|penetrate the Palestinians' guarded compound]] and kill all three.\n\nBetween hits, the assassins argue with each other about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as their apparent ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] members and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be members of foreign militant groups like [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], [[African National Congress|ANC]], and the [[Red Army Faction]]. Avner has a heartfelt conversation with PLO member Ali over their homelands and who deserves to rule over the lands; Ali is later shot by Carl while the team escapes from the hit on Muchasi.\n\nThe squad moves on to London to track down [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], who orchestrated the Munich massacre, but the assassination attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh in exchange for his promise not to attack US diplomats. Meanwhile, attempts are made to kill the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and execute her at a houseboat in [[Hoorn]], Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death on a park bench and Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. Avner and Steve disagree on whether Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.\n\nA disillusioned Avner flies to Israel, where he is unhappy to be hailed as a hero by two young soldiers and then to his new home in Brooklyn, where he suffers post-traumatic stress and paranoia. Concerns continue to grow when he speaks to Louis's father by phone and it is revealed he knows his real name and promises no violence will come to him from his family. He is thrown out of the Israeli consulate after storming in to demand that Mossad leave his wife and child alone. Ephraim comes to ask Avner to return to Israel and Mossad, but Avner refuses. Avner then asks Ephraim to come to dinner with his family, to break bread as an allegory to make peace, but Ephraim refuses, perhaps as a sign that neither side will reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Avner Kaufman (based on [[Juval Aviv|Yuval Aviv]])\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Steve\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Carl\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Robert\n* [[Hanns Zischler]] as Hans\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as Daphna Kaufman\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Ephraim\n* [[Mehdi Nebbou]] as [[Ali Hassan Salameh]]\n* [[Gila Almagor]] as Avner's Mother\n* Karim Saleh as [[Luttif Afif|Issa]]\n* [[Michael Lonsdale]] as Papa\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Louis\n* Ziad Adwan as Kamal Adwan\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Andreas\n* [[Yvan Attal]] as Tony\n* [[Valeria Bruni Tedeschi]] as Sylvie\n* [[Meret Becker]] as Yvonne\n* Roy Avigdori as [[Gad Tsobari]]\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Jeanette, the Dutch assassin\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as [[Golda Meir]]\n* [[Guri Weinberg]] as [[Moshe Weinberg]]\n* [[Makram Khoury]] as [[Wael Zwaiter]]\n* [[Hiam Abbass]] as Marie Claude Hamshari\n* [[Omar Metwally]] as Ali\n* Sam Feuer as [[Yossef Romano|Yosef Romano]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 78% approval rating based on 211 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10.

The ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]'' said that \"the revenge squad obsess about making sure only their targets are hit -- and meticulous care is taken to avoid collateral damage. Yet in one shootout an innocent man is also slain ... The intense moral contortions the agents experience as the corpses pile up makes up the substance of the movie.\"<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/munich_a_risky_move_for_spielberg_20051202/ ''Munich \u2014 A Risky Move for Spielberg''] Igor Davis, ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]'', December 1, 2005</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ronen Bergman]] as reported in ''[[Newsweek]]'', it is a myth that [[Mossad]] agents hunted down and killed those responsible for the killing of 11 Israeli athletes and a German policeman at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games; in fact most of the people were never killed or caught. Most of the people that Mossad did kill had nothing to do with the Munich deaths. He says the film was based on a book whose source was an Israeli who claimed to be the lead assassin of the hit squad, but in fact was a baggage inspector at Tel Aviv airport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2018/02/16/mossad-israel-rise-and-kill-ronen-bergman-assassinations-secret-history-797888.html|title=A secret history of Israeli assassinations|website=[[Newsweek]]|date=2 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Historical authenticity==\nAlthough ''Munich'' is a work of fiction, it describes many actual events and figures from the early 1970s. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] is depicted in the film, and other military and political leaders such as Attorney General [[Meir Shamgar]], Mossad chief [[Zvi Zamir]] and Aman chief [[Aharon Yariv]] are also depicted. Spielberg tried to make the depiction of the hostage-taking and killing of the Israeli athletes historically authentic.<ref>Note: Israeli actor Gur Weinberg, one month old in September 1972 was used to portray his father [[Moshe Weinberg|Moshe]], the wrestling coach and first hostage killed.</ref> Unlike an earlier film, ''[[21 Hours at Munich]]'', Spielberg's film depicts the shooting of ''all'' the Israeli athletes, which according to the autopsies was accurate. In addition, the film uses actual news clips shot during the hostage situation.\n\nIsraeli/American actor [[Guri Weinberg]] portrays his own father, wrestling coach [[Moshe Weinberg|Moshe]].  The younger Weinberg was only one month old when his father was killed.\n\nThe named members of [[Black September (group)|Black September]], and their deaths, are also mostly factual. [[Abdel Wael Zwaiter]], a translator at the [[Libya]]n Embassy in Rome, was shot 11 times, one bullet for each of the victims of the Munich Massacre, in the lobby of his apartment 41 days after Munich. On December 8 of that year Mahmoud Hamshari, a senior PLO figure, was killed in [[Paris]] by a bomb concealed in the table below his telephone. Although the film depicts the bomb being concealed in the telephone itself, other details of the assassination (such as confirmation of the target via telephone call) are accurate. Others killed during this period include [[Mohammed Boudia]], Basil al-Kubasi, Hussein al-Bashir, and Zaiad Muchasi, some of whose deaths are depicted in the film. [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] was also a real person, and a prominent member of Black September. In 1979 he was killed in [[Beirut]] by a car bomb<ref>[http://www.copi.com/articles/guyatt/harari.html Harari Evidence<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120724143913/http://www.copi.com/articles/guyatt/harari.html |date=2012-07-24 }} Copi</ref> that also killed four innocent bystanders and injured 18 others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946209-1,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012061610/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946209-1,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 12, 2008|title=MIDDLE EAST: Death of a Terrorist|date=5 February 1979|work=TIME.com}}</ref>\n\nThe commando raid in [[Beirut]], known as [[Operation Spring of Youth]], also occurred. This attack included future Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and [[Yom Kippur War]] and [[Operation Entebbe]] hero [[Yonatan Netanyahu]], who are both portrayed by name in the film. The methods used to track down and assassinate the Black September members were much more complicated than the methods portrayed in the film; for example, the tracking of the Black September cell members was achieved by a network of Mossad agents, not an informant as depicted in the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Aaron J.|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5066445 |title='Striking Back' Look at Munich Killings, Aftermath|work=NPR|date=December 22, 2005|access-date=July 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Atlantic Productions]], producers of [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-nominated documentary ''[[Munich: Mossad's Revenge]]'', listed several discrepancies between Spielberg's film and the information it obtained from interviews with Mossad agents involved in the operation. It noted that the film suggests one group carried out almost all the assassinations, whereas in reality it was a much larger team. Mossad did not work with a mysterious French underworld figure as portrayed in the book and the film. The assassination campaign did not end because agents lost their nerve but because of the [[Lillehammer affair]] in which an innocent [[Morocco|Moroccan]] waiter was killed. This is not mentioned in the film. As acknowledged by Spielberg, the targets were not all directly involved in Munich.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/26/bbc.israel |date=January 26, 2006|title=Munich: Mossad breaks cover |work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|access-date=May 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Munich\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[John Williams]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 27, 2005\n| recorded   = 2005\n| venue      =\n| studio     = [[Sony Pictures Studios]]\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 62:37\n| label      = [[Decca Records|Decca]]\n| producer   = John Williams\n| prev_title = [[Memoirs of a Geisha (soundtrack)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]\n| prev_year  = 2005\n| next_title = [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (soundtrack)|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]\n| next_year  = 2008\n}}\n\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/John-Williams-Munich-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/3205810|publisher=[[discogs.com]]|title=John Williams \u2013 Munich Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |access-date=2014-04-09}}</ref>\n\nThe [[soundtrack album]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] but lost to the score of the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain (soundtrack)|Brokeback Mountain]]''.
