The film follows a group of high school [[Security hacker|hackers]] and their involvement in a corporate extortion conspiracy. Made in the mid-1990s when the [[Internet]] was unfamiliar to the general public, it reflects the ideals laid out in the [[Hacker Manifesto]] quoted in the film: \"This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch [...] We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. [...] Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity.\" The film received mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office upon release, but has gone on to achieve [[cult classic]] status.<ref>{{cite web |date=2012-04-12 |author=Scott Tobias |title=Hackers may have been of its time, but it was also ahead of it |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/hackers-may-have-been-of-its-time-but-it-was-also,72249/ |website=[[The A.V.

He is banned from computers and touch-tone telephones until he is 18 years old. On his 18th birthday, he hacks into a local television station and changes the broadcast to an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Another hacker ([[Nickname#Computing|handle]] \"Acid Burn\") counters Dade's attack. Dade identifies himself as \"Crash Override\".\n\nAt school, Dade becomes part of a group of hackers: Ramon \"The Phantom Phreak\" Sanchez, Emmanuel \"Cereal Killer\" Goldstein, Paul \"Lord Nikon\" Cook (named for his [[photographic memory]]), Joey Pardella (a novice hacker without an alias and the youngest member) and Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby \u2013 the hacker who kicked him out of the TV station earlier.\n\nJoey, out to prove his skills, breaks into \"The Gibson\", an Ellingson Mineral Corporation [[supercomputer]]. While downloading a [[Trash (computing)|garbage file]] as proof of his feat, his mother disconnects his computer leaving him with a [[fragmentation (computing)|fragmented file]]. However, his intrusion has been noticed and brought to the attention of computer security officer Eugene \"The Plague\" Belford, a former hacker. Plague realizes the garbage file being downloaded is a [[computer worm|worm]] he himself inserted to defraud Ellingson. Claiming the file is the code to the \"Da Vinci\" [[computer virus]] that will capsize the company's oil tanker fleet, and pretending the hackers are to blame, he enlists the [[United States Secret Service|US Secret Service]] to recover the file. In fact, The Plague had inserted the \"Da Vinci\" virus as a [[red herring]] to cover for his worm.\n\nJoey is arrested and his computer searched, but he had hidden the disk containing the file. Dade and Kate make a bet, with Dade choosing a date with Kate should he win, and Kate having Dade perform menial computing tasks if she prevails. The hacking duel is to harass Secret Service Agent Richard Gill who was involved in Joey's arrest. After various hacks including canceling Gill's credit cards, creating a personal ad in his name, fabricating a criminal record, and changing his payroll status to \"deceased\", the duel remains a tie.\n\nReleased on bail, Joey reveals the disk to Phreak who is arrested the next day and informs Kate the disk is hidden in a bathroom at school. Kate and Cereal Killer ask for Dade's help which he refuses as he has a record. He copies the disk so they have un-tampered evidence. Determining that Dade did not hack into Ellingson, The Plague sends him a powerful laptop with a request that he join him. He later threatens to have Dade's mother incarcerated with a manufactured criminal record. At this, Dade agrees to deliver Kate's copy of the disk.\n\nKate, Lord Nikon, Cereal Killer, and Dade learn that the code is a worm designed to [[Salami slicing|salami-slice]] $25 million from Ellingson transactions, and that the Da Vinci virus is set to capsize the oil fleet the next day to provide cover and distract from the worm. Dade confesses that he gave Plague the disk and reveals his hacking history as \"Zero Cool\".\n\nDade and Kate seek out Razor and Blade, producers of \"Hack the Planet\", a hacker-themed TV show. Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer learn that warrants for their arrest are to be executed at 9AM the next day.\n\nThe next morning, Dade, Kate, Nikon and Cereal roller-blade from Washington Square Park, evading the Secret Service by hacking the traffic lights. Meeting up with Joey at [[Grand Central Terminal]] they use payphones and [[acoustic coupler]]s to hack the Gibson. At first, their attempts are easily rebuffed by Plague, who calls Dade to taunt him. Razor and Blade have contacted hackers around the world, who lend their support and distract Plague long enough for Joey to download the file.\n\nAfter crashing the Gibson, Dade and company are arrested. Dade surreptitiously informs Cereal Killer that he's tossed the disk in a trashcan. As Dade and Kate are being interrogated, Razor and Blade jam television signals and broadcast live video of Cereal Killer revealing the plot and Plague's complicity. Plague is arrested while attempting to flee to Japan. Their names cleared, Dade and Kate begin a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Dade Murphy{{\\}}\"Zero Cool\"{{\\}}\"Crash Override\"\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Kate Libby{{\\}}\"Acid Burn\"\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Joey Pardella\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Emmanuel Goldstein{{\\}}\"Cereal Killer\"\n* [[Laurence Mason]] as Paul Cook{{\\}}\"Lord Nikon\"\n* [[Renoly Santiago]] as Ram\u03ccn S\u00e1nchez{{\\}}\"The Phantom Phreak\"\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as \"The Plague\"{{\\}}Eugene Belford\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Margo Wallace\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Lauren Murphy\n* Darren Lee as Razor\n* Peter Y.

After the crackdown in the United States during 1989 and 1990, he decided to write a script about the subculture. For research, Moreu went to a meeting organized by the New York-based hacker magazine ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''. There, he met Phiber Optik, a.k.a. [[Mark Abene]], a 22-year-old hacker who spent most of 1994 in prison on hacking charges.<ref name=\"McClellan\"/> Moreu also hung out with other young hackers being harassed by the government and began to figure out how it would translate into a film. He remembered, \"One guy was talking about how he'd done some really interesting stuff with a laptop and payphones and that cracked it for me, because it made it cinematic\".<ref name=\"McClellan\"/> The character Eugene Belford uses Babbage as a pseudonym at the end of the film, a reference to [[Charles Babbage]], an inventor of an early form of the computer. The fictional computer mainframe named the \"Gibson\" is a homage to cyberpunk author [[William Gibson]] and originator of the term \"Cyberspace\", first in his 1982 short story \"[[Burning Chrome]]\" and later in his 1984 book ''[[Neuromancer]]''.\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe cast spent three weeks getting to know each other and learning how to type and rollerblade. They studied computers and met with actual computer hackers, including [[Tristan Louis]], [[Kevin Mitnick]], and [[Nicholas Jarecki]].  Jarecki served as a technical consultant and credits his experience on ''Hackers'' as inspiring his later career as the screenwriter and director.<ref>{{cite web |date=30 July 2002 |last=McCallan |first=Steve |title=Breaking In: How 20 Film Directors Got Their Start |url=https://variety.com/2002/more/reviews/breaking-in-how-20-film-directors-got-their-start-1200547048/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref><ref name=\"Empire\">{{cite news | title=Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie - The Happy Couple | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=June 1996 }}</ref> Actor Jonny Lee Miller even attended a hackers\u2019 convention.<ref name=\"Penfold\">{{cite news | date=May 3, 1996 | last=Penfold | first=Phil | title=Good Work If You Can Hack It | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12060781.good-work-if-you-can-hack-it/ }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Fisher Stevens, [[Quentin Tarantino]] was also considered for the role of The Plague.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfucIiS1jbk&t=148 |title=HACKERS: Fisher Stevens A.K.A.
