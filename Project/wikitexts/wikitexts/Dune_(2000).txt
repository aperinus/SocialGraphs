It was first broadcast in the United States on December 3, 2000, on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. It was released on [[DVD]] in 2001 by [[Artisan Entertainment]], with an extended [[director's cut]] appearing in 2002.<ref name=\"DB\"/>\n\nA 2003 [[sequel]] miniseries titled ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' continues the story, adapting the second and third novels in the series (1969's ''[[Dune Messiah]]'' and its 1976 sequel ''[[Children of Dune]]''). The miniseries are two of the three highest-rated programs ever to be broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel.\n\n''Frank Herbert's Dune'' won two [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]] in 2001 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie|Outstanding Cinematography]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects]] in a miniseries or movie, and was nominated for a third Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special|Outstanding Sound Editing]].

Rubinstein]] envisioned the complex material adapted in a miniseries format, as he had done previously with [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2003, \"I have found there's a wonderful marriage to be had between long, complicated books and the television mini-series. There are some books that just can't be squeezed into a two-hour movie.\" Around the same time Rubenstein was first developing the material, the Sci Fi Channel's president, [[Bonnie Hammer]], was spearheading a campaign for the channel to produce \"blockbuster miniseries on a regular basis\".<ref name=\"NYT Berger\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/16/tv/cover-story-where-spice-of-life-is-the-vital-variety.html?|title=Cover Story: Where Spice of Life Is the Vital Variety |last=Berger |first=Warren |date=March 16, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> The ''Dune'' miniseries was greenlit in November 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/sci-fi-doing-dune-mini-1117758232/|title=Sci-Fi doing ''Dune'' mini|first1=Paula|last1=Bernstein|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 19, 1999|access-date=February 21, 2019}}</ref> Released in 2000, ''Frank Herbert's Dune'' was the first of the Sci-Fi Channel's miniseries, followed by Steven Spielberg's miniseries ''[[Taken (miniseries)|Taken]]'' in 2002, and ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica]]''  in 2003. Rubenstein called his two ''Dune'' miniseries \"science fiction for people who don't ordinarily like science fiction\" and suggested that \"the ''Dune'' saga tends to appeal to women in part because it features powerful female characters\".<ref name=\"NYT Berger\"/>\n\n==Adaptation==\nDirector John Harrison has described his adaptation as a \"faithful interpretation\" in which any changes he made served to suggest what Herbert had explained subtly or not at all. The miniseries introduces elements not found in Herbert's novel, but according to the director, these serve to elaborate rather than to edit.<ref name=\"Cinescape\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Television&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=&obj_id=26343 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316172142/http://www.mania.com/dune-remaking-classic-novel_article_26343.html |archive-date=March 16, 2008  |title=''Dune'': Remaking the Classic Novel |first=Steve |last=Fritz |publisher=Cinescape.com |date=December 4, 2000 |access-date=March 14, 2010}}</ref> Hurt was the first to be cast in the 2000 adaptation.

Harrison felt the need to expand Irulan's role because she played such an important part in later books, and [[epigraph (literature)|epigraphs]] from her later writings opened each chapter of ''Dune''.<ref name=\"Cinescape\"/><ref>Julie Cox's narration at the beginning and end of the miniseries reflects Irulan's later role as historian of the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] empire, illustrated by Herbert through epigraphs.</ref> Additionally, the character gave him a window into [[House Corrino]].<ref name=\"Cinescape\"/> Besides the final scene, the only one of Irulan's appearances based on an actual excerpt from the novel is her visit to [[Feyd-Rautha]]. However, in the book it is a different [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Margot Fenring]], who visits the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]] heir, on assignment from the Bene Gesserit to \"preserve the bloodline\" by retrieving his genetic material (through conception) for their [[Bene Gesserit#Breeding program|breeding program]]. The miniseries does not suggest this as Irulan's motive.{{fact|date=August 2021}}\n\nA director's cut special edition was released on DVD featuring expanded footage and dialogue.<ref name=\"DB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/reviews2/dunesescifi.html|title=DVD Review - ''Frank Herbert's Dune'': Special Edition - Director's Cut|first=Bill|last=Hunt|date=May 22, 2002|access-date=February 1, 2019|via=thedigitalbits.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/d/dune00_se.shtml|title=The DVD Journal: ''Frank Herbert's Dune'': The Director's Cut (2000)|first=Alexandra|last=DuPont|date=2002|access-date=February 1, 2019|via=dvdjournal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Dune-Complete-Series/1090 |title=''Dune'' (miniseries) \u2013 ''Dune'' (Special Edition) Review|first=David|last=Lambert|date=June 9, 2002|access-date=February 1, 2019|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005213219/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Dune-Complete-Series/1090 |archive-date=October 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA [[soundtrack]] album for the miniseries was released by [[GNP Crescendo Records]] on December 3, 2000.
