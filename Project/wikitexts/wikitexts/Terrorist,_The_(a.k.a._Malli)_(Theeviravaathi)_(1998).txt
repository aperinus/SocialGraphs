The film portrays a period in the life of a 19-year-old woman, Malli ([[Ayesha Dharker]]), sent to [[assassination|assassinate]] a leader in South Asia through a [[suicide bombing]]. It stars Dharker, K. Krishna and Sonu Sisupal. Released in 1998, the film was shot in 15 days, with natural lighting, on a shoestring budget of \u20b925 lakh (worth \u20b92.2 crore in 2021 prices).\n\nThe film won a number of awards at international [[film festival]]s. Actor [[John Malkovich]] first saw the film at the 1998 [[Cairo International Film Festival]] and subsequently adopted the film as a kind of post-facto executive producer (the reissued film's titles read \"John Malkovich Presents\"). Critic [[Roger Ebert]] has included the film in his series of \"Great Movies\" reviews.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-terrorist-2000 |title=The Terrorist Movie Review & Film Summary (2000) &#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=2005-07-17 |access-date=2020-06-25}}</ref> Ebert concludes his review with the following line: \"Every time I see the film, I feel a great sadness, that a human imagination could be so limited that it sees its own extinction as a victory.\"\nThe film that proved his mastery over the visual language was ''The Terrorist'' which has become a textbook of sorts for visual communication students, with scenes from the movie being used by [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], [[Martin Scorsese]]\u2019s cinematographer, to explain the tenets of cinematography during workshops. According to film critic Roger Ebert, it was a film \u2018scripted by the camera\u2019. Says Sivan: \"One day I got a call from Samuel Lee Jackson who was interested to cast the heroine of ''The Terrorist'', Ayesha, in a Hollywood film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/global-nod-for-malayalam-director-santosh-sivan/264187-71-209.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323080737/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/global-nod-for-malayalam-director-santosh-sivan/264187-71-209.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-03-23 |title=Global nod for Malayalam director Santosh Sivan |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=2012-06-04 |access-date=2014-03-23}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe movie focuses on a 19-year-old woman named Malli, who joined a terrorist organization at a very young age after her brother was killed in the cause. She eventually volunteers herself to become a suicide bomber in an assassination mission.  As the plot moves forward, she discovers the importance of human life, after realizing she is pregnant.  This causes Malli to question her determination to complete the mission.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ayesha Dharker]] as Malli\n* [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnu Vardhan]] as Thyagu\n* Bhanu Prakash as Perumal\n* [[Krishna Kulasekaran|K. Krishna]] as Lover\n* Sonu Sisupal as Leader\n* [[Anu Vardhan|Anuradha]]\n\n== Inspiration ==\nOn 21 May 1991, [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was campaigning in favour of a [[United Communist Party of India|UCPI]] candidate for the upcoming parliamentary elections in [[Tamil Nadu]], when he was assassinated by a [[suicide bomber]] in the Indian town of [[Sriperumbudur]], near [[Madras]].\n\nThe suicide bomber, [[Thenmozhi Rajaratnam]] aka Dhanu, is widely believed to have been a [[Tamil Tigers|LTTE]] member. Dhanu was a cousin of Shivarasan, the supposed mastermind of the assassination. Dhanu wore the belt bomb with the explosive material in her lower back region and the power pack, two switches and the circuitry in front.\n\nWhen [[Santosh Sivan]], a well-known cinematographer, wanted to make a film on terrorism and about a terrorist, he chose the above events as the inspiration for his story.\n\nThe film is not a direct biography of Dhanu, as she had a whole troupe working with her, as backup in case she failed.\n\n== Awards ==\n;Won\n*1998 - [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]] - ''The Terrorist''<ref name=\"asianfilmmarket2007\">{{cite web|url=http://apm.asianfilmmarket.org/eng/database/view_ppp_history.asp?order_year=2007&idx=256&no=4 |title=Asian Project Market |publisher=Apm.asianfilmmarket.org |date=2009-05-28 |access-date=2014-03-23}}</ref><ref>[[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]]</ref>\n*1998 - [[National Film Award for Best Editing]] - ''The Terrorist''<ref>[[National Film Award for Best Editing#cite note-45thawardPDF-21]]</ref>\n*1998 - [[Cairo International Film Festival]]- Best Director - Santosh Sivan<ref name=\"santoshsivan1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santoshsivan.com/html/eng_john.htm |title=John Malkovich |publisher=Santosh Sivan |access-date=2014-03-23}}</ref>\n*1998 - [[Cairo International Film Festival]]- Golden Pyramid For Best film - ''The Terrorist''<ref name=\"santoshsivan1\"/>\n*1998 - [[Cairo International Film Festival]]- Best Artistic Contribution by an Actress - Ayesha Dharker<ref name=\"santoshsivan1\"/>\n*1998 - [[Sundance Film Festival]] - Best Film - ''The Terrorist''<ref name=\"asianfilmmarket2007\"/>\n*1998 - [[Toronto International Film Festival]] - Emerging Master - Santosh Sivan<ref name=\"asianfilmmarket2007\"/>\n*1999 - [[Cinemanila International Film Festival]] - Grand Jury Prize - Santosh Sivan\n*1999 - [[Cinemanila International Film Festival]] - Lino Brocka Award for Best Film - Santosh Sivan\n*2000 - [[Ale Kino!
