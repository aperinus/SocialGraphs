Weiss]], and directed by [[John Landis]]. Among the numerous star cameos are [[George Lazenby]], [[Bill Bixby]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Barry Dennen]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Tony Dow]], [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]], and the voice of [[Shadoe Stevens]]. According to writer [[David Zucker]] on the [[DVD commentary]] track, [[David Letterman]] auditioned for the role of the newscaster, but was not selected. The film also features many former members of [[The Groundlings]] and [[The Second City]]. The \"feature presentation\" portion of the film stars [[Evan C. Kim]] and ''[[hapkido]]'' grand master [[Bong Soo Han]]. ''The Kentucky Fried Movie'' marked the first film appearances of a number of actors who later became famous, and launched the careers of the Zucker brothers, Abrahams and Landis.\n\nLandis was recommended to direct ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' in 1978 based on his work with ''The Kentucky Fried Movie''.<ref name=\"BosGlobe\">{{cite news |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/bravos_funniest/ |title=Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies of All Time |author1=Cammorata, Nicole |author2=Duffy, James |name-list-style=amp |date=July 25, 2006 |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |access-date=2008-01-24 |archive-date=October 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026041324/http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/bravos_funniest/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film's writers were the team of [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker]], who subsequently wrote and directed ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and the ''[[Police Squad!]]'' television series and its film spin-offs, [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' films]].\n\n==Content==\n''The Kentucky Fried Movie'' contains largely unconnected [[sketch comedy|sketches]] that parody various film genres, including [[exploitation film]]s. The film's longest segment spoofs early [[kung-fu]] films, specifically ''[[Enter the Dragon]]''; its title, ''A Fistful of Yen'', refers to ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. Parodies of [[disaster film]]s (\"That's Armageddon\"), [[blaxploitation]] films (\"Cleopatra Schwartz\"), and softcore porn/[[Women in prison film|women-in-prison film]]s (\"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\") are presented as \"Coming Attraction\" [[trailer (promotion)|trailers]]. The fictional films are produced by \"Samuel L. Bronkowitz\" (a conflation of [[Samuel Bronston]] and [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], but also a spoof of B-movie producer and [[American International Pictures]] co-founder [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The sketch \"[[See You Next Wednesday]]\" mocks theater-based gimmicks like [[Sensurround]] by depicting a dramatic film presented in \"Feel-a-Round\", which involves an usher physically accosting a theater patron. Other sketches spoof TV commercials and programs, news broadcasts, and classroom educational films. The city of [[Detroit]] and its high crime rate are a running gag portraying the city as a hell on Earth; in \"A Fistful of Yen\", the evil drug lord orders a captured CIA agent to be sent to Detroit, and the agent screams and begs to be killed instead.\n\n===Sketches===\nThe credits list the sketches incorrectly, as the writers changed the show order after the credits had been written. On second cut, they corrected this error.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The following list is in the running order used in the film:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% \n! colspan=2 | Sketch details\n|-\n| width=20% |\n11 O'Clock News (Part 1) (:04)\n|A news announcer tells the film's viewers the popcorn they are eating has been urinated in...[[Film at 11]].\n|-\n|Argon Oil (1:13)\n|A commercial for a company that found ways to produce oil from [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], Italian people's hair (taken from combs in their trash), and [[Vegetable oil used as fuel#Waste vegetable oil|American fast food]].\n|-\n|''A.M. Today'' (6:05)\n|A morning TV news show with hosts ([[Janice Kent]] and Michael Laurence) and several segments: a news correspondent, unable to hear the announcers, scratches his buttocks and picks his nose on-camera, and a studio debate between two conservative and liberal pundits ends in an obscene personal attack. The show's [[Astrology|astrologer]] declares that astrology is meant to support people who cannot take responsibility for their own lives. An animal segment introduces a rare hamster followed by a gorilla ([[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]). The gorilla, which has been unable to mate, becomes progressively enraged by its female handler's explanations, goes berserk, and tears off her shirt. Studio hands try unsuccessfully to restrain the gorilla as it runs amok and finally smashes the camera.\n|-\n|His New Car (:24)\n|When a man enters a car, multiple alarms sound. As he goes through a succession of actions (locking his door, buckling his seatbelt, and so on) the alarms shut off one by one until only one remains. Eventually he reaches down and zips the [[Fly (clothing)|fly]] on his jeans. The last alarm then stops.\n|-\n|Catholic High School Girls in Trouble (2:00)\n|A parody of [[sexploitation film]]s, including a topless conversation among three young, large-breasted \"Catholic high school girls\" (Nancy Mann, Lenka Novak and Betsy Genson). Later, the school punishes them for breaking curfew by locking them in a jail where they are stripped naked except for brightly colored bikini bottoms. With their wrists chained above them, they face the camera bare-breasted as their backs are whipped by a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] in a clown suit. Another scene shows [[Uschi Digard]]'s large breasts being heavily fondled by a man (with squeaky-balloon sound effects) and later comically squashed against a shower door when he [[doggy style|penetrates her from behind]]. In the following scene, a shocked teenager interrupts his intercourse when he realizes it is actually his girlfriend's middle-aged mother in bed with him (she happily announces to the camera that people always mistake her for her teenaged daughter). Lastly, another teenager learns in horror that [[masturbation]] has made his hands hairy.\n|-\n|([[See You Next Wednesday]] in) Feel-A-Round (4:52)\n|A man watches a movie presented in \"Feel-A-Round.\" In the lobby appears a poster for the Landis film, [[Schlock (film)|''Schlock'']].<ref name=\"filmSCHOOLarchive\">{{Citation|last=filmSCHOOLarchive|title=John Landis on \"Schlock\" & \"Kentucky Fried Movie\"|date=2018-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsKIgR2PBE8|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The usher takes the role of the on-screen female lover. As she asks her male lover to smell her perfume, the usher sprays the viewer with said perfume. It eventually proceeds to chest rubbing and then to a quarrel. The latter culminates with a knife to the throat, but ends with a quick kiss. The cinema's announcer invites the man to also stay over for the next film \u2013 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''.

After the couple disrobe, the record instructs them to kiss and begin [[foreplay]]. After the male experiences [[premature ejaculation]], the recording sends Big Jim Slade, a briefs-wearing, muscular \"[[tight end]] for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]\" to carry the woman away and finish her humiliated partner's job, backed by a vigorous choral rendition of the song \"[[Shalom Aleichem (liturgy)|Heiveinu Shalom Aleichem]].\"\n|-\n|A Fistful of Yen (31:34)\n|One missile from the previously announced (Film at 11) dual U.S.S.R/U.S. attack is revealed to be Chinese-made. The Chinese government denies any involvement. The mastermind behind the attack turns out to be a Chinese [[Fantasy tropes and conventions#Dark Lord|Dark Lord]] named Dr. Klahn ([[Han Bong-soo]]). In a parody of ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', the U.K. government hires Loo ([[Evan C. Kim]] playing a [[Bruce Lee]] lookalike with an [[Elmer Fudd]] voice) to penetrate Dr. Klahn's mountain fortress and destroy his operation. Loo refuses the mission at first but happily agrees when told that he can kill dozens of people. The fortress is so organized that it even has its own guided tours for its storage of drugs and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. When Loo is discovered, he defeats waves of thugs before he is captured by Dr. Klahn. The next morning, Loo defeats Dr. Klahn's bodyguard Bulkus in a deathmatch, forcing the tyrant to order his underlings to kill Loo. Meanwhile, Big Jim Slade appears and frees the fortress' prisoners, who rush to engage in battle as well. Loo confronts and kills Dr. Klahn with a [[Wicked Witch of the West|bucket of water]]. In an homage to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', Loo is sent back to Kansas after his victory and learns that it may have all been a dream.\n|-\n|Willer Beer (:58)\n|A beer commercial featuring [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] monks.\n|-\n|11 O'Clock News (Part 3) (:05)\n|[[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] plagued by fumbles as earthquake rocks [[Los Angeles]]...Film at 11\n|-\n|Scot Free (:58)\n|A commercial for a board game based on US president [[John F.

Among other things, her bra disappears, and her breasts [[Bra#Countering the aging process|instantly sag]] under her shirt. Her car crashes through her house as it has no brakes, and her husband's pacemaker stops working. Eventually, the [[natural gas|gas]] control valves on her stove disappear, her kitchen catches on fire, and everything that can stop the fire also disappears. The segment ends with a brief announcement of a later film in the series, ''Rebuilding Your Home''.\n|-\n|Danger Seekers (1:02)\n|A parody of the 1973\u20131974 television series, ''[[Thrill Seekers]]'': Part-time airline mechanic, full-time [[Stunt performer|daredevil]] Rex Kramer (Robert Starr) vows to take on the most dangerous situations possible \"for the sake of adventure\". Rex, wearing protective gear, walks to the middle of a group of African-American men playing [[Cee-lo (dice game)|Cee-lo]] in an alley and screams the racial epithet \"[[Nigger]]s!\" whereupon he flees as they angrily pursue him. (The name Rex Kramer would later be given to [[Robert Stack]]'s character in ''[[Airplane!]]''.) \n|-\n|[[Eyewitness News]] (4:24)\n|A couple stops watching the TV news to have sex. In a parody of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'''s two-way television, as soon as the man exposes the woman's breasts, the TV news announcer starts stuttering. As the man performs [[cunnilingus]] on the woman, men from the production crew gather around the news announcer to gape and snicker. They scream when she reaches an [[orgasm]], but the crew runs away in time when the suspicious couple stops and turns to look at the television. The news announcer hastily resumes his report. The couple resume having sex. This time [[Woman on top (sex position)|the woman mounts the man]]. The men from the production crew return to the news announcer. They share a collective orgasm with the woman.\n|-\n|11 O'Clock News (Part 4) (:09)\n|The news announcer declares he is not wearing any pants...Film at 11\n|}\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[David Zucker]], [[Jerry Zucker]] and [[Jim Abrahams]] made the rounds of the Hollywood studios with the concept and were rejected by all of them, being told, \"audiences didn't like movies composed of sketches\". Since the three believed in their material, which they had honed in front of the audiences with their [[improvisational theater|improvisational troupe]] \"Kentucky Fried Theater\", they decided to make the movie on their own.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Litwak |first1=Mark |title=Reel Power: The Struggle For Influence and Success in the New Hollywood|year=1986 |publisher=William Morrow & Company |location=New York |isbn=0-688-04889-7 |pages=135}}</ref>\n\nA wealthy real estate investor offered to finance the film if they would write a script. After completion of the screenplay, the investor had second thoughts and decided he did not want to finance the film alone. He said he would try to attract other investors if the three filmmakers would produce a 10-minute excerpt of the film, which he would finance. When the trio presented a budget of the short film to the investor, he backed out.<ref name=Litwak136>Litwak, p. 136</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe prospect of shooting the short film so excited the trio that they decided to pay for it themselves. The 10-minute film cost $35,000, and with it they again approached the Hollywood studios. This time, they attached a young director named [[John Landis]] to the project, who came to their attention after an appearance on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|''The Tonight Show'']] promoting his first film [[Schlock (film)|''Schlock'']].<ref name=\"filmSCHOOLarchive\"/> However, once again, the studios turned them down.<ref name=\"Litwak136\" />\n\n==Distribution and release==\nCurious as to how audiences would react to their film, they persuaded exhibitor Kim Jorgensen to show it before one of his regularly scheduled films. When Jorgenson saw the short, he \"fell out of his seat laughing.\" He was so impressed that he offered to raise the money needed to make the full-length version. By having his fellow exhibitors screen the film before audiences in their theaters, he convinced them to put up the $650,000 budget. When released, ''Kentucky Fried Movie'' was a box-office success, returning domestic American rentals of $7.1 million.<ref name=\"Litwak136\" />\n\n===Home media===\n[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] released a [[DVD region code|region 1]] DVD in 2000. This release is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] and full-frame (1.33:1). It includes commentary by Landis; writers ZAZ; and producer Robert K. Weiss.\n\nOn July 4, 2011, [[Arrow Video]] in region 2 released a two-disc special edition DVD with the following special features:\n* Feature presented in widescreen 1.85:1 and full-frame 1.33:1\n* Original mono audio\n* The audio recollections of director Landis; writers ZAZ; and producer Robert K.
