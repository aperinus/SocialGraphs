It stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] and [[Frank Oz]]. The sequel to ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), it is the sixth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series, the final installment in the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]], and third chronological chapter of the \"[[Skywalker Saga]]\".\n\n''Revenge of the Sith'' is set three years after the onset of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] as established in ''Attack of the Clones''. The [[Jedi]] are spread across the [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]] in a full-scale war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] on a mission to defeat [[General Grievous]], the head of the Separatist army, to put an end to the war. Meanwhile, after having visions of his wife [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] dying in childbirth, [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] is tasked by the Council to spy on [[Palpatine]], the Supreme Chancellor of the [[Galactic Republic]] and, secretly, a [[Sith]] Lord. Palpatine manipulates Anakin into turning to the dark side of [[the Force]] and becoming his apprentice, Darth Vader, with wide-ranging consequences for the galaxy. \n\nLucas began writing the script before production of ''Attack of the Clones'' ended, citing that he wanted the end of the trilogy to have similar aspects to a romantic tragedy, thus building into Darth Vader's state at the beginning of the next film. Production of ''Revenge of the Sith'' started in June 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Revenge of the Sith'' premiered on May 15, 2005, at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received positive reviews and is widely considered to be the best installment of the prequel trilogy, with praise for its mature tone, story, emotional weight, action sequences, score, visual effects, and the performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Oz, and [[Jimmy Smits]]; criticism largely focused on the film's dialogue and Christensen's performance. It broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $868 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film in the ''Star Wars'' franchise at the time. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film worldwide]] in 2005. It also holds the record for the highest opening-day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAbove [[Coruscant]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor [[Palpatine]] from the cyborg Separatist commander [[General Grievous]].{{efn|As depicted in the 2008 animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.}} After infiltrating Grievous' flagship, Obi-Wan and Anakin battle the [[Sith]] Lord [[Count Dooku]], whom Anakin overpowers and decapitates at Palpatine's urging. Grievous escapes the battle-torn ship, which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant. There, Anakin reunites with his secret wife, [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], who reveals that she is pregnant. While initially excited, Anakin soon begins to have visions of Padm\u00e9 dying in childbirth.\n\nPalpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. The Council, suspicious of Palpatine, approves the appointment but declines to grant Anakin the rank of Master and instead instructs him to spy on Palpatine, diminishing Anakin's faith in the Jedi. Meanwhile, on [[Utapau]], Grievous relocates the Separatist leaders to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]]. Obi-Wan travels to Utapau to confront Grievous and kills him, while [[Yoda]] travels to the [[Wookiee]] planet of [[Kashyyyk]] to defend it from a Separatist invasion.\n\nPalpatine tempts Anakin with his knowledge of the dark side of [[the Force]], and offers to teach him the power to prevent Padm\u00e9's death. Anakin deduces that Palpatine is the Sith Lord behind [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|the war]] and reports his treachery to [[Mace Windu]], who confronts and subdues him. Desperate to save Padm\u00e9's life, Anakin severs Windu's hand before he can kill Palpatine, who sends Windu falling to his death with a blast of [[Force lightning]].<!--The Star Wars databank confirms he died.--> Anakin pledges himself to the Sith, and Palpatine knights him Darth Vader. Palpatine issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], which commands the [[clone trooper]]s to kill their commanding Jedi generals across the galaxy, while Vader and a battalion of clone troopers kill the remaining Jedi in the Jedi Temple. Vader then travels to Mustafar to assassinate the Separatist leaders, while Palpatine declares himself Emperor before the [[Galactic Senate]], transforming the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and denounces the Jedi as traitors.\n\nHaving survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant, where Obi-Wan learns of Anakin's turn to the dark side. Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to confront Vader while he faces Palpatine. Obi-Wan seeks out Padm\u00e9 to find out Vader's whereabouts and reveals his treachery. Padm\u00e9 then travels to Mustafar \u2013 with Obi-Wan stowing away on her ship \u2013 and pleads with Vader to abandon the dark side and leave with her, but he refuses. Seeing Obi-Wan aboard the ship, and thinking that they are conspiring to kill him, Vader uses the Force to strangle Padm\u00e9 to unconsciousness in a blind rage. Obi-Wan then engages Vader in a [[lightsaber]] duel that ends with Obi-Wan severing Vader's legs and left arm, leaving him at the bank of a lava flow where Vader is horribly burned. Obi-Wan retrieves Vader's lightsaber and leaves him for dead.\n\nOn Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Realizing he cannot defeat Palpatine, Yoda flees with Senator [[Bail Organa]] and regroups with Obi-Wan and Padm\u00e9 on the [[planetoid]] [[Polis Massa]]. There, Padm\u00e9 gives birth to twins, whom she names [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia]], and dies soon after, having lost her will to live but still believing there is good in Vader. Palpatine retrieves a barely-alive Vader and takes him to Coruscant, where his mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. When Vader asks if Padm\u00e9 is safe, Palpatine says that he killed her out of anger, and Vader screams in agony.\n\nObi-Wan and Yoda plan to conceal the twins from the Sith and go into exile until the time is right to challenge the Empire. As Padm\u00e9's funeral takes place on her home world of [[Naboo]], Palpatine and Vader supervise the construction of the [[Death Star]]. Bail takes Leia to [[Alderaan]], where he and his wife adopt her, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-uncle and -aunt, Owen and Beru Lars, on [[Tatooine]] before going into exile to watch over the boy.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 400\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| perrow = 3\n| image1 = Ewan McGregor Premiere Down to love in Sydney 2003 (cropped).JPG\n| alt1 = A photograph of Ewan McGregor\n| image2 = Natalie Portman Thor 2 cropped.png\n| alt2 = A photograph of Natalie Portman\n| image3 = Hayden-cfda2010-0004 (1) (cropped).jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Hayden Christensen\n| image4 = The Emperor Has No Robes (cropped).jpg\n| alt4 = A photograph of Ian McDiarmid\n| image5 = Samuel L.

Another planned scene by Lucas that was written during the early development of the film was a conversation between Master [[Yoda]] and the ghostly [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], with [[Liam Neeson]] reprising his role as Jinn (he also hinted his possible appearance in the film).<ref>{{cite web |last=Keck |first=William |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-01-09-palm-springs_x.htm |title=Movie-star night in Palm Springs |work=USA Today |date=January 10, 2005 |access-date=December 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420233707/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-01-09-palm-springs_x.htm |archive-date=April 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, the scene was never filmed and Neeson was never recorded, although the scene was present in the film's novelization.\n\nAfter principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more changes in Anakin's character, rewriting his turn to the dark side.

Although this is still intact in the finished film, by revising and refilming many scenes, Lucas emphasized Anakin's desire to save Padm\u00e9 from death. Thus, in the version that made it to theaters, Anakin falls to the dark side primarily to save Padm\u00e9.<ref name=\"Within\" />\n\n=== Art design ===\nFor the [[Kashyyyk]] environment, the art department turned to the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' for inspiration.<ref name=\"holiday\">{{cite web |work=StarWars.com |title=Kashyyyk Revisited |url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon116.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214071838/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon116.html |access-date=May 17, 2008 |archive-date=December 14, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Over a period of months, Lucas would approve hundreds of designs that would eventually appear in the film.

These included the limestone mountains depicting [[Kashyyyk]], which were filmed in [[Phuket Province|Phuket, Thailand]]. The production company was also fortunate enough to be shooting at the same time that [[Mount Etna]] erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.<ref name=\"Within\" />\n\nWhile shooting key dramatic scenes, Lucas would often use an \"A&nbsp;camera\" and \"B&nbsp;camera\", or the \"V&nbsp;technique\", a process that involves shooting with two or more cameras at the same time in order to gain several angles of the same performance.<ref name=\"Within\" /> Using the HD technology developed for the film, the filmmakers were able to send footage to the editors the same day it was shot, a process that would require a full 24 hours had it been shot on film.<ref name=\"Within\" /> Footage featuring the planet Mustafar was given to editor [[Roger Barton (film editor)|Roger Barton]], who was on location in Sydney cutting the climactic duel.\n\n[[Hayden Christensen]] says Lucas asked him \"to bulk up and physically show the maturity that had taken place between the two films.\"<ref name=\"MovieWeb\">{{cite web |url=http://movieweb.com/hayden-christensen-talks-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith/ |last=B. |first=Brian |title=Hayden Christensen Talks Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith |date=October 10, 2005 |website=Movieweb |access-date=December 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608142907/http://movieweb.com/hayden-christensen-talks-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith/ |archive-date=June 8, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The actor says he worked out with a trainer in Sydney for three months and ate \"six meals a day and on every protein, weight gain supplement that man has created\" to go from 160 lbs to 185 lbs.<ref name=\"SciFi\">{{cite web |last1=Rea |first1=Darren |title=Hayden Christensen Interview |url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/Interview/05-11-01_HaydenChristensen.htm |website=Sc-Fi Online |access-date=December 25, 2016 |date=November 1, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321025339/http://www.sci-fi-online.com/Interview/05-11-01_HaydenChristensen.htm |archive-date=March 21, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChristensen and [[Ewan McGregor]] began rehearsing their climactic [[lightsaber]] duel long before Lucas would shoot it.

The most media coverage was likely given to an exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, leading to the aforementioned conflict: \"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy\", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' concluded, \"Without naming [[George W.

The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody, [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] soundtrack. Lucas' coverage of the exterior cityscapes, skylines and interior isolation in the so-called \"Ruminations\" sequence is similar to the [[cinematography]] and ''[[Mise en sc\u00e8ne|mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]'' of ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil.<ref name=\"DevilDeal\">{{cite web |work=[[Today.com]] |title=Star Wars III: \"Titanic in Space\" |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/lucas-calls-new-star-wars-film-tearjerker-wbna7224080 |access-date=July 30, 2008 |date=April 11, 2005 |archive-date=September 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927073947/https://www.today.com/popculture/lucas-calls-new-star-wars-film-tearjerker-wbna7224080 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Other media ==\n\n=== Novelization ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Anakin Skywalker]] -->\n{{main|Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (novel)}}\n\nThe film's novelization was written by [[Matthew Stover]].

A number of plot threads initially developed for inclusion in ''Revenge of the Sith'' were instead incorporated into ''The Clone Wars''. These include [[Boba Fett]]'s revenge plot against Mace Windu for his father [[Jango Fett|Jango]]'s death, and the solving of the mystery behind deceased Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas which was introduced in ''Attack of the Clones''. The final four episodes of the series take place concurrently with ''Revenge of the Sith''. Several scenes from the film were recreated and expanded for these episodes in order to showcase the whereabouts of Anakin Skywalker's former Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the events of the film. While Ahsoka was a major character in ''The Clone Wars'', she is not referenced in ''Revenge of the Sith'' as the character had not yet been created at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/entertainment/star-wars-the-clone-wars-series-finale-preview/index.html |title='Star Wars: The Clone Wars' meets 'Revenge of the Sith' in final episodes |access-date=October 31, 2020 |archive-date=July 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716022231/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/entertainment/star-wars-the-clone-wars-series-finale-preview/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Obi-Wan Kenobi'' ===\n{{Main|Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)}}\n\nThe 2022 miniseries takes place ten years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' (and approximately eight years before ''A New Hope''), and features flashbacks taking place prior and during the events of the film, with some of the latter via archive footage.
