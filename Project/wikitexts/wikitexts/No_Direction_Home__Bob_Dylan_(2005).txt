The film focuses on the period between Dylan's arrival in New York in January 1961 and his \"retirement\" from touring following his motorcycle accident in July 1966. This period encapsulates Dylan's rise to fame as a [[folk singer]] and songwriter where he became the center of a cultural and musical upheaval, and continues through the [[Electric Dylan controversy|electric controversy]] surrounding his move to a [[rock music|rock]] style of music.\n\nThe title of the film is taken from the lyrics of Dylan's 1965 [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\".\n\n==Production and content==\nThe film was first shown on [[television]] in both the United States (as part of the ''[[American Masters]]'' series on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]) and the United Kingdom (as part of the ''[[Arena (British TV series)|Arena]]'' series on [[BBC Two]]) on September 26\u201327, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Dylan - About the Film|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/bob-dylan/about-the-film/574/|website=[[American Masters]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=June 28, 2006|access-date=October 19, 2022}}</ref> A [[DVD]] version of the film and accompanying [[soundtrack album]] (''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'') were released that same month.\n\nThe project began to take shape in 1995 when Dylan's manager, Jeff Rosen, began scheduling interviews with Dylan's friends and associates. Among those interviewed were poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] and folk musician [[Dave Van Ronk]], both of whom died before the film was completed. Dylan's old girlfriend [[Suze Rotolo]] also granted a rare interview, and she later told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that she was very pleased with the project's results. Dylan himself also sat for ten hours in a relaxed and open conversation with Rosen in 2000. Other interviews with those who knew him at the time include [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Liam Clancy]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Peter Yarrow]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], singer [[Mavis Staples]], artist [[Bob Neuwirth]], guitarist/organist [[Al Kooper]], and promoters like [[Harold Leventhal]].<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Tom Nelson. Interviews with record industry A&R reps, promoters and executives [[Izzy Young]], [[Mitch Miller]], [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]], Artie Mogul. Filmmaker [[D. A. Pennebaker]].\n\nAccording to ''Rolling Stone'', an unnamed source close to the project claimed that Dylan had no involvement with the project apart from the interview, saying that \"[Dylan] has no interest in this . . . Bob truly does not look back.\" However, work on the first installment of Dylan's autobiography, ''[[Chronicles: Volume One]]'', did overlap production of the project, though it is unclear how much, if any, influence ''Chronicles'' may have had on ''No Direction Home''.\n\nThough raw material was being gathered for the project, Rosen needed someone to edit and shape it into a quality motion picture, and celebrated filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]] was approached to direct the documentary planned from the project. Scorsese eventually agreed and came aboard in 2001.\n\nIn the meantime, Dylan's offices gathered hundreds of hours of historical film footage dating from the time covered in ''No Direction Home''. These included a scratchy recording of Dylan's high school rock band, his 1965 [[screen test]] for [[Andy Warhol]], and newly discovered footage of the famous [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Free Trade Hall]] concert from May 17, 1966, when [[Electric Dylan controversy|an angry fan called out \"Judas!\"]] just before Dylan and [[the Band|the Hawks]] performed \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Shot by D. A. Pennebaker, the onstage color footage was found in 2004 in a pile of water-damaged film recovered from Dylan's vault.\n\nThe cover photo on the DVD package, by [[Barry Feinstein]], shows Dylan standing in front of the [[Aust Ferry]] terminal in [[Gloucestershire]], England, in May 1966, shortly before the opening of the [[Severn Bridge]] which replaced the ferry.\n\n==Reception and awards==\nThe film received positive reviews from film critics, as review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 14 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=No Direction Home|url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/1148076-no_direction_home_bob_dylan/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2009-10-07}}</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of a possible four stars, stating that it \"creates a portrait that is deep, sympathetic, perceptive and yet finally leaves Dylan shrouded in mystery, which is where he
