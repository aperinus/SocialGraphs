[[Stanley Tucci]] and [[Richard Schiff]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on [[Daily News (New York)|New York ''Daily News'']] [[photographer]] [[Weegee|Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig]], and some of the photos in the film were taken by Fellig.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1940s, Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein is a freelance crime and street photographer for the [[New York City]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s, dedicated to his vivid and realistic work and his unique ability to capture shots that nobody else can. He is very confident of his skills, declaring at one point, \"Nobody does what I do. Nobody\".\n\nWith a police [[radio]] under the dashboard of his car and a makeshift [[darkroom]] in his trunk, he quickly races to the scene of horrific crimes and accidents in order to snap exclusive photographs. He is so good at his job that he becomes known affectionately as the \"Great Bernzini\".\n\nBernzy meets a sultry widow, Kay Levitz, who owns a fancy nightclub. It seems the [[organized crime|mob]] is muscling in on her due to some arrangement with her late husband. Kay asks if Bernzy could investigate an individual she considers troublesome. Generally unsuccessful with women, Bernzy agrees to help Kay, and he slowly begins to fall in love with her.\n\nAfter talking to his contacts, including [[journalism|journalist]] friend Arthur Nabler, he tracks down Kay's man, only to find him murdered. But when he calls the police, he becomes a suspect in the man's death. The police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] are also very interested in this case. Bernstein makes a connection with a local gangster, Sal, uncovering a conspiracy involving a mob turf war about illegal [[rationing|gas rationing]], and the Federal government. His activities get Sal killed and place Bernzy's life in great danger as he waits in hiding at an Italian restaurant where a mob hit is about to take place.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Kay Levitz\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Sal\n* [[Jerry Adler]] as Arthur Nabler\n* [[Dominic Chianese]] as Spoleto\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Officer O'Brien\n* [[Max Brooks]] as Teen At Thompson Street\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Thompson Street Photographer\n* [[Christian Stolte]] as Ambulance Attendant\n* Jack Denbo as Photo Editor\n* Timothy Hendrickson as Richard Rineman\n* [[Del Close]] as H.R. Rineman\n* Lisa Christakis as Young Bride With Soldier Husband\n\n==Production==\nJoe Pesci took this role right after his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning performance in ''[[Goodfellas (film)|Goodfellas]]''.  It was an attempt to capitalize on his popularity at the time and help elevate Pesci from respected character actor to star status.\n\nDirector and writer Howard Franklin was unable to secure the rights to Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig's story.  Franklin, then, wrote the story of a Weegee-like photographer who smokes cigars and he named him Leon \"Bernzy\" Bernstein.  In the film, like Weegee, cops wonder if Bernzy uses a [[ouija board]] to snap his photographs and find the stories.<ref>Gallagher, Sean. ''Suite 101,'' film review.</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist Doug Trapp, Franklin was inspired to write the screenplay after seeing a show of Fellig's photos in the 1980s at the [[International Center of Photography]] in [[New York City]]. And Weegee did, in real life, have  a \"soul-mate\" named Wilma Wilcox, who was the woman in charge of his estate.  But, Franklin has always denied that the film was about their relationship.<ref>[http://www.citybeat.com/2002-07-18/cover.shtml Trapp, Doug]. ''[[Cincinnati CityBeat]]'', Fellig article, July 24, 2002.</ref>\n\nAs the film is loosely modelled on Weegee, but the story is not, several photographers' pictures, along with some by Weegee, stand in for his work, including those of [[Lisette Model]], Mickey Pallas, Wilbert H. Blanche, Irving Haberman, [[Ray Platnick]], Roger Smith and Charles Steinheimer. Director Franklin says he was looking for \"edgy, modern, high-contrast 40's\" lighting and compositions with the \u201cstark, rather lurid effects of flash, which pick out the central subject while everything around falls off rapidly into darkness\u201d<ref>Goldberg, Vicki.

The New York Times, Oct 11, 1992</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''The Public Eye'' began filming on July 24, 1991 and completed October 28, 1991.\n\nEven though the film takes place in [[Manhattan]], it was shot in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n==Release==\nThe producers used the following tagline when marketing the film:\n:Murder. Scandal. Crime. No matter what he was shooting, \"The Great Bernzini\" never took sides he only took pictures ... Except once.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Festival of Festivals]] in September 1992.<ref>[http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=3946 Levy, Emanuel]. Film Review.</ref>  The film also was shown at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the Valladolid International Film Festival in [[Spain]].\n\nIt opened on October 14, 1992 in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and expanded to 635 theatres two days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1992/0PUEY.php|title=The Public Eye (1992)|website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film's box office performance was a disappointment. The film grossed $1,139,825 for the weekend and the total receipts after 12 days were $3,067,917.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released in [[video format]] on April 14, 1993 and in [[LaserDisc]] on April 21, 1993.\n\nIn September 2007 an [[Unbox]] Digital Video Download was made available. The movie is also available at Amazon.com as digital Video on Demand.\n\nIt was released on DVD on January 31, 2011 in the Universal Vault Series. It was released on Blu-ray from [[Kino Lorber]] on July 28, 2020.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic, [[Roger Ebert]], was especially complimentary of the film and of actor Joe Pesci, and wrote, \"One of the best things about the movie is the way it shows us how seriously Bernzy takes his work. He doesn't talk about it. He does it, with that cigar stuck in his mug, leading the way with the big, ungainly [[Speed Graphic]] with the glass flashbulbs. In the movie's big scene of a mob assassination, he stares death in the face to get a great picture.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-public-eye-1992|title=The Public Eye|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=October 14, 1992|work=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> Ebert said the film made him \"think\" a little bit of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942).\n\n''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine liked the acting and the script, and wrote, \"The main virtue of screenwriter Franklin's debut as director is Pesci's portrayal of [[Weegee]], the famous low-life tabloid photographer of urban disaster, lightly concealed as Bernstein, 'The Great Bernzini'... good dialogue, nice period recreation, great performances.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/71554.html ''Time Out Film Guide'']. ''Time Out-New York'', film review. Last accessed: November 29, 2007.</ref>\n\nDesson Howe, film critic for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"''Public'' wants to be taken for an atmospheric film noir, full of intrigue, romance and street toughness. But it's all flash and no picture. Despite the usual quippy, perky performance from Pesci, as well as [[cinematographer]] [[Peter Suschitzky]]'s moodily delineated images, the movie is superficial and unengaging. It's as if [[Life magazine|''Life'']] magazine decided to make an oldtime gangster movie.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thepubliceyerhowe_a0af21.htm Howe, Desson]. ''The Washington Post'', film review, October 16, 1992.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe original score for the film was written and recorded by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] but he was replaced by [[Mark Isham]] at a late stage. As such, Isham had a lot of work to do and in a short time.  He found working with director Franklin a wonderful and educational experience.<ref>[http://www.scoremagacine.com/Entrevistas_eng_det.php?Codigo=17 ''Score Magazine''] interview with Mark Isham, by Miguel \u00c1ngel Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez and Pablo Nieto, 2005.</ref>\n\nA motion picture original soundtrack was released.  [[Shorty Rogers]] also worked on the score and contributed 1 track.  The [[CD]] contained nineteen tracks in total.  The CD was released on October 13, 1992 on the Varese Sarabande label.<ref>[[Amazon.com]] web site.</ref>  Mark Isham uses a dark melody played mostly on piano. Isham mixes [[symphonic]], [[jazz]] and [[electronic music]]; [[String instrument|strings]] and [[trumpet]] also play a major role.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0105187|title=The Public Eye}}\n* {{TCMDb title|id=87345|title=The Public Eye}}\n* {{Letterboxd film|the-public-eye}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=public_eye|title=The Public Eye}}\n* [http://www.weeklyscript.com/Public%20Eye,%20The.txt ''The Public Eye''] shooting screenplay draft for educational purposes\n* {{YouTube|fq3cjZPwjCg|''The Public Eye'' film trailer}}\n\n{{Howard Franklin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Public Eye, The}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about photojournalists]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of journalists]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of photographers]]\n[[Category:Films about tabloid journalism]]\n[[Category:Films about organized crime in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Howard Franklin]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Isham]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Howard Franklin]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
