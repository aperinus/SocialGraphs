It deals with the patient-inmates of [[Bridgewater State Hospital]] for the Criminally Insane, a [[List of Massachusetts state correctional facilities|Massachusetts Correctional Institution]] in [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]]. The title is taken from that of a [[talent show]] put on by the hospital staff. Titicut is the [[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]] name for the nearby [[Taunton River]].\n\nThe film won accolades in Germany and Italy. Wiseman went on to produce a number of such films examining social institutions (e.g. hospitals, police, schools, etc.) in the United States.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Titicut Follies'' portrays the occupants of [[Bridgewater State Hospital]], who are holed up in empty cells and infrequently bathed. It also depicts inmates/patients required to strip naked publicly, [[force feeding]], and the indifference and bullying by many of the hospital\u2019s staff.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Titicut Follies'' was the beginning of the documentary career of [[Frederick Wiseman]], a Boston-born lawyer turned filmmaker. He had taken his law classes from [[Boston University]] to the institution for educational purposes and had \"wanted to do a film there\". He began calling the facility superintendent, seeking permission to film a year prior to production. Wiseman had previously produced ''[[The Cool World (film)|The Cool World]]'' (1964), based on [[Warren Miller (author)|Warren Miller]]\u2019s [[The Cool World (novel)|novel of the same name]], an experience that informed his desire to direct.\n\n===Filming===\nWiseman drafted a proposal that was verbally agreed to by the superintendent, which later came into question when the film began distribution. Following that agreement, filming began, with corrections staff following Wiseman at all times and determining on the spot whether the subjects filmed were mentally competent, adding further confusion to an already fraught process.<ref name=Anderson1981>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Carolyn |title=The Conundrum of Competing Rights in TITICUT FOLLIES |journal=Journal of the University Film Association |date=1981 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201322 |jstor=20687550 }}</ref> While on location, Wiseman recorded the sound and directed the cameraman, established [[ethnography|ethnographic]] filmmaker [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]], via microphone or by hand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Carolyn |last2=Benson |first2=Thomas W. |title=Documentary Dilemmas: Frederick Wiseman's Titicut Follies |date=1991 |publisher=SIU Press |isbn=978-0-8093-1518-5 }}{{page needed|date=February 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\n29 days were spent documenting the conditions at Bridgewater and 80,000 feet of film was shot.

Before, a narrative warning and an introduction by [[Charlie Rose]] were played.

Zipporah released the DVD to the home market in December 2007.\n\nIn 2020, the film was shown on [[Turner Classic Movies]].\n\n===Accolades===\n* Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival: Mannheim Film Ducat, Frederick Wiseman; 1967.\n* Festival Dei Popoli: Best Film Dealing with the Human Condition; Florence, Italy; 1967.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1967]]\n*''[[Cocksucker Blues]]'', Rolling Stones tour documentary largely unseen due to legal restrictions on exhibition related to privacy issues.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Carolyn Anderson and Thomas W.
