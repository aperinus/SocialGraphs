W. Murnau]], starring [[G\u00f6sta Ekman (senior)|G\u00f6sta Ekman]] as [[Faust]], [[Emil Jannings]] as Mephisto, [[Camilla Horn]] as Gretchen/Marguerite, [[Frida Richard]] as her mother, [[William Dieterle|Wilhelm Dieterle]] as her brother and [[Yvette Guilbert]] as Marthe Schwerdtlein, her aunt. Murnau's film draws on older traditions of the legendary tale of Faust as well as on [[Goethe|Goethe's]] [[Goethe's Faust|classic 1808 version]]. Ufa wanted [[Ludwig Berger (director)|Ludwig Berger]] to direct ''Faust'', as Murnau was engaged with ''[[Variety (1925 film)|Variety]]''; Murnau pressured the producer and, backed by Jannings, eventually persuaded [[Erich Pommer]] to let him direct the film.\n\n''Faust'' was Murnau's last German film, and directly afterward he moved to the US under contract to [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] to direct ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' (1927); when the film premiered in the [[Ufa-Palast am Zoo]] in Berlin, Murnau was already shooting in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. It has been praised for its [[special effect]]s and is regarded as an example of [[German Expressionism#Cinema and architecture|German Expressionist film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe demon [[Satan|Mephisto]] has a bet with an [[Archangel]] that he can corrupt a righteous man's soul and destroy in him what is divine. If he succeeds, the Devil will win dominion over earth.\n\nThe Devil delivers a plague to the village where [[Faust]], an elderly alchemist, lives. Though he prays to stop the death and starvation, nothing happens. Disheartened, Faust throws his alchemy [[book burning|books in the fire]], and then the Bible too. One book opens, showing how to have power and glory by making a pact with the Devil. He goes to a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] as described in the book's procedure and conjures up the forces of evil. When Mephisto appears at the roadside, he induces Faust to make a trial, 24-hour [[Deals with the Devil in popular culture|bargain with the Devil]]. Faust will have Mephisto's service till the sand runs out in an hourglass, at which time the Devil will rescind the pact. At first, Faust uses his new power to help the people of the village, but they shun him when they find out that he cannot face a cross. They stone him and he takes shelter in his home.\n\nFaust then makes a further deal with Mephisto, who gives Faust back his youth and offers him earthly pleasures and a kingdom, in return for his immortal soul. Mephisto tempts Faust with the vision of a beautiful woman. He then takes him to a wedding feast in [[Parma]], to meet the subject of his vision, [[duchy of Parma|an Italian Duchess]]. Faust departs with her, leaving the Devil to kill her groom. Just as Faust is making love to her the sands run out. He is obliged to seal the deal permanently in order to continue his love-making; he is Mephisto's forever.\n\nFaust soon grows weary of debauchery and yearns for \"Home\". Here Faust falls in love with an innocent girl, Gretchen, who is charmed into loving Faust by a golden chain left by the Devil.\n\nFaust comes to Gretchen's room. The devil rouses the mother who sees them and drops dead from shock. The devil then incites her soldier brother, Valentin, to run home to catch her lover. Valentin and Faust fight a duel. The Devil intervenes and stabs Valentin in the back. He then goes around town shouting \"murder\". Faust and Mephisto flee on the back of a hellish steed.\n\nValentin condemns Faust for his murder and his sister as a harlot in his dying breath. She is put in [[the stocks]] and subjected to jeering. The girl has a child (by Faust) and ends up in the streets. In a blizzard she sees a vision of a warm cradle and lays her child down on the snow, where [[death by hypothermia|the child dies]]. Soldiers find her and she is sent [[burned at the stakes|to the stake]] as a murderess. Faust sees what is happening and demands Mephisto take him there. Faust arrives just as the fire has been started to burn his lover. Faust wishes he had never asked to have his youth back. Mephisto smashes the mirror with Faust's reflection and he loses his youth. He runs through the assembled mob towards Gretchen; and it is as an old man that Faust throws himself onto the fire to be with his beloved.\n\nGretchen recognizes Faust and sees him in her heart as a young man again as the fire consumes them together. Their spirits rise to the heavens. The angel reveals to Mephisto that he has lost the bet because Love has triumphed over all.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[G\u00f6sta Ekman (senior)|G\u00f6sta Ekman]] \u2013 [[Faust]]\n* [[Emil Jannings]] \u2013 [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]]\n* [[Camilla Horn]] \u2013 Gretchen\n* [[Frida Richard]] \u2013 Gretchen's mother\n* [[William Dieterle]] \u2013 Valentin, Gretchen's brother\n* [[Yvette Guilbert]] \u2013 Marthe Schwerdtlein, Gretchen's aunt\n* [[Eric Barclay]] \u2013 Duke of Parma\n* [[Hanna Ralph]] \u2013 Duchess of Parma\n* [[Werner Fuetterer]] \u2013 Archangel\n\n==Production, release history and restoration==\n\n===Production history===\nMurnau's ''Faust'' was the most technically elaborate and expensive production undertaken by Ufa until it was surpassed by ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' the following year. Filming took six months, at a cost of {{Reichsmark|2 million}} (only half was recovered at the box office). According to film historians, ''Faust'' seriously affected studio shooting and special effects techniques. Murnau uses two cameras, both filming multiple shots; many scenes were filmed time and again. As an example, a short sequence of the contract being written on parchment in fire took an entire day to film.\n\n===Intertitles===\nThe task of writing the intertitles was originally assigned to {{ill|Hans Kyser|de}}, a German novelist and playwright who had moved into screenwriting. He decided to combine various lines from the original folk tale, [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]] and [[Johann Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[Faust, Part 1]], as well as providing some of his own.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|pp=136-7}} However, his efforts were disliked by the Ufa production team, and [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], one of Germany's leading playwrights and winner of the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel prize for literature]], was engaged instead.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|pp=137}} Hauptmann agreed to write his own completely new intertitles for {{Reichsmark|40,000}}, twice what Ufa had offered. Kyser found out, and there was an exchange of vituperative letters between the two writers.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|pp=137}}\n\nThe film received a pre-release showing with Hauptmann's intertitles at the [[Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz]] on 26 August 1926.<ref>{{cite news |last=Conrad |first=Andreas |date=30 July 2014 |url=https://www.pnn.de/potsdam-kultur/877929/ |title=Hauptsache historisch |language=de |website=Potstdamer Neuesten Nachrichten |access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=filmportal>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmportal.de/film/faust_cff7c3b9e2fa42808ca1aa64b803765f |title=Faust |website=Filmportal.de |language=de |access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref> Unfortunately, Ufa's directors felt that Hauptmann's titles were even worse: Ufa informed Hauptmann just a week before the premiere of \"unexpected difficulties\", and in the end ''Faust'' opened with Kyser's intertitles at the [[Ufa-Palast am Zoo]] on 14 October 1926.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|pp=137}}<ref name=filmportal /> Hauptmann's verses were separately printed as a brochure for sale in cinemas.\n\n===Variant cuts===\nThere were several versions created of ''Faust'', several of them prepared by Murnau himself. The versions are quite different from one another. Some scenes have variants on pace, others have actors with different costumes and some use different camera angles. For example, a scene with a bear was shot with both a person in costume and an actual bear. In some versions, the bear simply stands there. In one version, it actually strikes an actor.\n\nOverall, five versions of ''Faust'' are known to exist out of the over thirty copies found across the globe: a German original version (of which the only surviving copy is in the [[Danish Film Institute]]), a French version, a late German version which exists in two copies, a bilingual version for Europe prepared by [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]], and a version prepared by Murnau himself for [[MGM]] and the US market (July 1926).\n\n===Restoration and versions known to exist===\nThe copy of the original German version lacks a number of scenes. With the copies available, a 106-minute reconstructed version has been released by [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]] with English intertitles on DVD. A commentary is also an optional extra on the DVD. The original intertitles have also been recovered.\n\nThe US version includes titles and scenes filmed especially by Murnau, where for example the scene in which Aunt Marthe offers Mephisto a drink that he rejects as causing heartburn: in the US version, Mephisto rejects the drink for having had alcohol, an ironic reference to Prohibition in the United States; again in the US version, Mephisto offers Marta a necklace, from the Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Tartars]], rather than the cousin from [[Lombardy]], as Murnau believed the US audience would not have heard of Lombardy. One scene was done with a text juxtaposition, as again, Murnau believed the American audience wouldn't grasp the imagery by itself. This is also the only version having the originally conceived finale of the ascension of Faust and Gretchen into Heaven. In all others, the scene is rather more conceptual. Books appearing in the film were labeled or any plans with text were shot twice, in German and in English.\n\nThe bilingual version was prepared to be shown aboard trans-Atlantic ships traveling from [[Hamburg]] to [[New York City]]. Therefore, they catered to both American and German audiences.\n\nThe French version is generally believed to represent the poorest choice of scenes, both including the largest number of filming errors (e.g., showing assistants holding doors, actors slipping, Gretchen stepping on her dress, showing the stage maquette). It does hold takes that do not exist in any other versions, however.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\n\n''Faust'' was a \"financial flop\". German critics disliked the adaptation from its source texts and G\u00f6sta Ekman's performance.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cultural studies of modern Germany : history, representation, and nationhood |year=1993 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0299140106}}</ref>\n\nIn later years, the film has been called one of seven \"canonical examples of [[German Expressionism#Cinema and architecture|German Expressionist cinema]]\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Film : a critical introduction |year=2005 |publisher=Laurence King |isbn=978-1856694421}}</ref> Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 94%, based on {{nowrap|31 reviews}}, with a rating average of 8.59/10.<ref name=\"rtomatoesrating\">{{cite web|title=Faust (1926) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1031274-faust/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nA 2006 review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"one of the most astonishing visual experiences the silent cinema has to offer.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kehr |first1=Dave |title=New DVD's: F.
