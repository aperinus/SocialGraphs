The movie opens with a panoramic shot of a bucolic Russian countryside. Katerina Matveyevna, Sukhov's beloved wife, is standing in a field. Awakening from this daydream, Sukhov is walking through the Central Asian desert \u2013 a stark contrast to his homeland.<ref name=script3/> He finds Sayid buried in the sand. Sayid, an austere Central Asian, comes to Sukhov's rescue in sticky situations throughout the movie. Sukhov frees Sayid, and they strike a friendly but reticent relationship. While traveling together they are caught up in a desert fight between a Red Army cavalry unit and [[Basmachi movement|Basmachi guerrillas]]. The cavalry unit commander, Rakhimov, leaves to Sukhov the [[harem]], which was abandoned by the Basmachi leader Abdullah, for temporary protection. He also leaves a young Red Army soldier, Petrukha, to assist Sukhov with the task, and proceeds to pursue the fleeing Abdullah.\n\nSukhov and women from Abdullah's harem return to a nearby shore village. There, Sukhov charges the local museum's curator with protecting the women, and prepares to head home. Sukhov hopes to \"modernize\" the wives of the harem, and make them part of the modern society. He urges them to take off their [[burqa]] and reject [[polygamy]]. The wives are loath to do this, though, and as Sukhov takes on the role of protector, the wives declare him their new husband.\n\nSoon, looking for a seaway across the border, Abdullah and his gang come to the same village and find Abdullah's wives. Sukhov is bound to stay. Hoping to obtain help and weapons, Sukhov and Petrukha visit Pavel Vereschagin, a former Tsar's customs official. Vereschagin warms to Petrukha who reminds him of his dead son, but after discussing the matter with his nagging wife, Vereschagin refuses. Sukhov finds a [[machine gun]] and a case of [[dynamite]] that he plants on Abdullah's ship. Meanwhile, Abdullah has confronted his wives, and is preparing to punish them for their \"dishonor\", as they did not kill themselves when Abdullah left them. Sukhov manages to capture and lock Abdullah as a hostage, but after he leaves, Abdullah convinces Gyulchatai, the youngest wife of the harem, to free him and then kills Gyulchatai and Petrukha.\n\nThe museum curator shows Sukhov an ancient underground passage that leads to the sea. Sukhov and the women of the harem attempt to escape through the passage, but on arriving at the seashore they are impelled to hide in a large empty oil tank. Abdullah discovers that and plans on setting the oil tank on fire.\n\nEnraged at the cold-hearted murder of Petrukha, Vereschagin decides to help Sukhov and takes Abdullah's ship. Sayid also helps Sukhov, and together they fend off Abdullah's gang. Vereschagin, unaware of the dynamite on the ship and not hearing Sukhov's shouted warnings, tragically dies on the exploding ship.\n\nSukhov kills Abdullah and his gang, and returns the harem to Rakhimov. He then begins his journey home on foot, having refused a horse since a horse is merely \"a nuisance\".<ref name=sp7/> Whether Sukhov will make it home to his beloved wife is unclear: the revolution is not over in Central Asia, and an exemplary Red Army soldier like Sukhov may well be needed.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anatoly Kuznetsov (actor)|Anatoly Kuznetsov]] as [[:ru:\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0446 \u0421\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432|''Fyodor Ivanovich Sukhov'']] \u2013 a [[Red Army]] soldier, who returns home on foot through the desert after recovering in a hospital from wounds sustained in the war. He shows much wisdom and skill in his actions and a gentle human side in his graphical dreams, in which he mentally writes letters to his beloved wife.\n:[[Georgi Yumatov]] was chosen for the role, but was dismissed for a drunken brawl right before the shooting. Therefore, Motyl called for Kuznetsov, who was the second choice during the selection.<ref name=script/>\n*[[Pavel Luspekayev]] as [[:ru:\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d|''Pavel Vereschagin'']] \u2013 a former tsarist customs official. Vereschagin lives a lonely life as the only [[Russian people|Russian]], along with his wife, in a remote village. The walls of his house are covered with pictures of the military campaigns where he was awarded and wounded. The Civil War has left him without an official job and a place to go. He is a big man and a straightforward person with a tendency for alcoholism due to the nostalgia for his past. He has an arsenal of weapons that brings both conflicting parties (Sukhov and Abdullah's men) to his house at some point in the film. Initially neutral, he eventually takes the side of Sukhov.\n:This was Luspekayev's last role. A World War II veteran and an experienced stage actor, both of his feet were amputated in the 1960s due to past injuries. Given Luspekayev's condition, Motyl wrote a script for a man on [[crutch]]es. Luspekayev refused, arguing that his character should appear not as a cripple, but as a strong person who died prematurely.<ref name=script/> While filming, he walked on prosthetic legs and had to take regular rests due to pain. He died in 1970.<ref name=pavel/><ref name=pavel2/>\n*[[Spartak Mishulin]] as [[:ru:\u0421\u0430\u0438\u0434|''Sayid'']] \u2013 a skilled man of few words. He seeks revenge on [[:ru:\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0435\u0442|Dzhavdet]], a [[Basmachi movement|Basmachi]] gang leader who killed his father, robbed his family and buried him in sand for a slow death; otherwise his motives and reactions are unclear and unexpected. For example, after Sukhov dug him out, Sayid, instead of thanking him, says, \"Why did you dig me out? There will be no rest while Dzhavdet is alive.\" Sayid suddenly appears every now and then to help Sukhov against bandits, but when asked why, simply replies that he has \"heard shooting,\"<ref name=sp2/> giving an impression that he just seeks Dzhavdet via any armed conflict nearby. His relationship with Sukhov is well described by the following dialogue:<ref name=sp5/>\n{{blockquote|\nSayid \u2013 Now, leave. You can't stay alone.<br>\nSukhov \u2013 I can't. Abdullah will kill the women.<br>\nSayid \u2013 Abdullah will kill you. These are his wives. In half an hour it will be too late. I must leave.<br>\nSukhov \u2013 I counted on you.<br>\nSayid \u2013 If I get killed, who will take revenge on Dzhavdet?<br>\nSukhov \u2013 I counted on you, Sayid.\n}}\n:In contrast with Luspekayev, this was one of the first movie roles for Mishulin, although he was previously active as a TV and stage actor.<ref name=filming/>\n*[[Kakhi Kavsadze]] as [[:ru:\u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430|''Abdullah'']] \u2013 a cunning Basmachi leader with no respect for human life. Both he and Sayid originate from poor families, and their fathers were friends. However, contrary to Sayid, Abdullah took the path of banditry.<ref name=sp4/>\n:Kavsadze, a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] by nationality, fit very well into the role of an Asian gang leader. However, he had never ridden a horse, while his character was supposed to be a keen horse rider. He never actually rides in the film, but only sits on a horse, or even on the shoulders of an assistant.<ref name=filming/>\n*[[:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Nikolai Godovikov]] as [[:ru:\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0430|''Petrukha'']] \u2013 a young Red Army soldier.

She is the only wife who interacts with outsiders, i.e., Sukhov and Petrukha.\n\nMost of Abdullah's wives were portrayed by non-professional actors. As they wore [[burqa]]s most of the time, they were often replaced by other women, and even by male soldiers from the military unit stationed nearby.<ref name=motyl2/> Motyl shot a few semi-nude scenes involving some of the wives for character development, but those scenes were cut by censors.<ref name=script/>\n\n;Honorifics\nThe script makes use of different levels of [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorifics]] in the Russian language. All locals are known only by their first names. Vereschagin is called by his last name by strangers and by his first name \"Pasha\" (short for Pavel) by his wife. Sukhov is called by his last name, often with an addition of a symbolic title \"Krasnoarmeets\" (Red Army Soldier) or \"Tovarishch\" ([[Comrade]]). Vereschagin initially also calls him Sukhov, but by the end of the film warms up to the less formal and more respectful \"Fyodor Ivanovich\"<ref name=sp7/> after Sukhov called him \"Pavel Artemievich\".\n\n==Weapons==\n[[File:Lewis gun St Thomas 6.JPG|thumb|Sukhov supposedly uses a [[Lewis gun]] (bottom), though in some scenes it is replaced by a Russian [[Degtyaryov machine gun#Variants|DT]] gun with an attached dummy cooling shroud.<ref>[http://tainy.info/technics/pulemet-tovarishha-suxova/ \u041f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u0421\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603081730/http://tainy.info/technics/pulemet-tovarishha-suxova/ |date=3 June 2013 }}. tainy.info</ref> Abdullah's gang members carry rifles similar to the one shown on top.]]\n[[File:MWP Nagant.JPG|thumb|[[Nagant M1895|Nagant revolver]] similar to that used by Sukhov]]\nWeaponry is explicitly used to characterize and develop the characters. Sayid is found barehanded in the beginning; he acquires all his weapons through the film and uses them skillfully. Sukhov gives him a knife, which Sayid later throws to kill an attacker. He shoots a [[carbine]] taken from a bandit, whom he strangled using rope as a [[lasso]] (while helping Sukhov).<ref name=sp2/> His skills in riding are demonstrated when he jumps on a horse, back first, while walking backwards and keeping his enemy at gunpoint. He then slowly rides away, sitting backwards on the horse.\n\nVereschagin, despite having an arsenal of [[small arms]], fights barehanded, which accentuates his brute force and straightforwardness. Both Sukhov and Abdullah use handguns rather than rifles, as appropriate to their leading, officer-like positions. Sukhov carries a [[Nagant M1895]] revolver, a personal gift from brigade commander M. N. Kovun,<ref name=sp2/> whereas Abdullah uses a [[Mauser C96]]. To deal with Abdullah's gang, Sukhov fetches and fixes a machine gun. Petrukha has a rifle that jams and never fires when needed.<ref name=sp5/> Abdullah's gang members carry carbines and long knives characteristic of the time and region.\n\n==Development and script==\nThe director, [[Vladimir Motyl]], said such films as ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' and ''[[High Noon]]'' influenced him and he has described the film as being a \"cocktail\" of both an adventurous Russian folktale and a [[western (genre)|western]]. Initially several directors, including [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], were offered the film but they turned it down, Motyl claims,<ref name=motyl/> for two main reasons. Firstly, Konchalovsky thought only [[United States|American]] actors could pull off the part of a lead role in a western, and secondly the screenplay was considered weak.<ref name=b1/> Motyl also initially turned down the offer, but then found himself in a no-choice situation, as he would not be given any other film to direct.<ref name=motyl2/><ref name=motyl/>\n\nAfter the first version of the film was turned down by Mosfilm, Valentin Yezhov and Rustam Ibragimbekov were assigned to improve the script. Ibragimbekov was chosen by his nationality as an expert on the East, though in reality he was raised in Russia and never been in the region.<ref name=script3/> A war veteran told Yezhov a story of a harem abandoned by a [[Basmachi movement|Basmachi leader]] on the run, which became the pivot of the new script.<ref name=script/><ref name=b1/> Further rewriting came from Motyl after he replaced Konchalovsky as director. Motyl completely reshaped and put forward the character of Vereschagin \u2013 all his dialogues, as well as about 60% of the entire script, were rewritten and improvised during the filming. Motyl also came up with the idea of revealing Sukhov's personality through his dreams, in which he writes letters to his beloved wife. Those letters were composed by [[Mark Zakharov]], a friend of Motyl's.<ref name=motyl/>\n\nYears later, Konchalovsky praised the final script as a masterpiece.<ref name=script3/>\n\n==Filming==\n\nSukhov's dream scenes were filmed first, near [[Luga, Leningrad Oblast]], while the bulk of the film was shot on the western shore of the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Makhachkala]], [[Dagestan]]. The sand dune scenes were shot in the [[Karakum Desert]] near [[Mary, Turkmenistan]], with the museum scenes filmed in the nearby ancient city of [[Merv]].<ref name=luga/> The distinctive [[wikisource:tk:Mary:Uly Gyzgala we Ki\u00e7i Gyzgala|Kyz Kala (Gyz Gala)]] fortress, for example, figures prominently. The dune scenes were demanding for actors, who had to make large circles in the scorching heat to approach the shooting location without leaving telltale traces in the sand. However, the heaviest burden fell on Mishulin, who spent in total several days in a box buried in sand while preparing for several takes of the opening scene.<ref name=script/><ref name=script2/> The village buildings and Vereschagin's house were temporary mockups that had to be regularly repaired due to damage from frequent winds.<ref name=motyl/>\n\nHorse riding scenes were performed by the special stunt unit formed for the ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'' film series. Although it did not perform any stunts in this film, one member of the unit died in an accident during filming. Some other accidents occurred due to poor overall discipline and security. For example, a cut is seen on Vereschagin's face when he fights on the ship. He received this cut in a drunken brawl the day before. Also, some [[Theatrical property|props]] were stolen by local thieves one night. Security was improved after Motyl hired a local criminal leader for the role of a member of Abdullah's gang.<ref name=script/><ref name=b1/>\n\nThe film involved two dangerous stunts, the first when Abdullah's officer, supposedly thrown out by Vereschagin, breaks through a second-floor window and falls to the sand below. The other is when Sukhov jumps from an oil tank set on fire. Both stunts were performed by Valentin Faber.<ref name=filming/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack to ''White Sun of the Desert'' is one of the most celebrated of Russian film.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The score contains guitar music, [[balalaika]] and orchestral music. Many of the songs are inspired by the 1960s urban song culture of metropolitan Russia. These songs are often just a voice and guitar, with the music drawing on traditional Russian folk music.<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\">{{cite journal|author=David Gillespie|title=The Sounds of Music: Soundtrack and Song in Soviet Film |volume=62|issue=3|year=2003|pages=477\u2013478|jstor=3185802|journal=Slavic Review}}</ref>\n\n\"Your Honor, Lady Luck\", sung by Vereschagin accompanied by a guitar, is a musical motif in the film. The lyrics talk about loneliness, humanity\u2019s dependence on luck, and hope for love. These lyrics mirror many of the film's central themes, including Vereschagin's sadness and Sukhov's separation from Katerina. The song was written by Okudzhava on personal request by Motyl, who had worked with him in the past.<ref name=motyl/> A line from this song, \"Nine grams to your heart, stop, don't call,\" is included as an homage in the script of the 1985 Soviet action film [[The Detached Mission|''Independent Steaming (\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435)'']].\n\n==Reception==\n''White Sun of the Desert'' became one of the most popular movies of all time in Russia, where it has attained the status of a classic. It helped popularize Eastern movies.<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\"/>\n\nThe film received no awards during the Soviet era. With 34.5 million viewers, it was one of the most popular films of 1970, but it lost the 1970 USSR State Prize to ''[[By the Lake]]''. Only in 1998 was it awarded the state prize by President [[Boris Yeltsin]], being recognized as culturally significant.<ref name=r1/>\n\nThe film received limited attention in the West. It was shown at a Soviet film festival at the little Carnegie Theatre in 1973, meant to tie in with Leonid Brezhnev's visit to the United States. Other than that, it was not widely released.
