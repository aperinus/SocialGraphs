Based on the character [[Conan the Barbarian]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]], it is the sequel to ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982). The film stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, respectively. The cast also includes [[Grace Jones]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Tracey Walter]], and [[Olivia d'Abo]].\n\n''Conan the Destroyer'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 29, 1984, by [[Universal Pictures]]. Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics. It grossed between $26.4 million and $31 million in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nConan and his companion, the thief Malak, are confronted by Queen Taramis of Shadizar, who tests their combat ability with several of her guards. Satisfied, she tells Conan that she has a quest for him. He refuses her, but when she promises to resurrect his lost love, Valeria, Conan agrees to the quest. He is to escort the Queen's niece, Princess Jehnna, a virgin, who is destined to restore the jeweled horn of the dreaming god Dagoth. The magic gem Heart of [[Ahriman]] must first be retrieved, in order to locate the horn. Conan and Malak are joined by Bombaata, the captain of Taramis's guard. Bombaata has secret orders to kill Conan once the gem is obtained.\n\nThe gem is secured in the fortress of a powerful wizard, so Conan seeks the help of his friend Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, who must first be rescued from a tribe of [[cannibals]] who have captured him. The adventurers encounter Zula, a powerful bandit warrior being tortured by vengeful villagers. Freeing Zula at Jehnna's request, Conan accepts the indebted warrior's offer to join their quest.\n\nThe adventurers travel to the castle of Thoth-Amon, where the gem is located. As they sleep by the lake surrounding the castle, the wizard takes the form of a giant bird and kidnaps Jehnna. In the morning Akiro divines this and also divines a hidden entrance to the castle through a [[water gate]]. As they search for Jehnna, Conan is separated from the group, and the others are forced to watch him battle a fierce man-beast in a hall of mirrors. By breaking the mirrors Conan mortally wounds the creature which is revealed as a polymorphed Thoth-Amon. With the wizard's death, the castle begins to disintegrate, forcing the group's hasty retreat. They are ambushed by Taramis's guards, but drive them off. Bombaata feigns ignorance about the attack. The gem reveals where the jeweled horn is. Jehnna expresses romantic interest in Conan, but he rebuffs her and declares his devotion to Valeria.\n\nThey reach an ancient temple, where the horn is secured. Jehnna obtains it while Akiro deciphers engravings. He learns that Jehnna will be ritually sacrificed to awaken Dagoth. They are attacked by the priests guarding the horn. A secret exit is revealed, but Bombaata blocks the others' escape and seizes Jehnna. Despite this treachery, Conan and his allies escape from the priests and trek to Shadizar to rescue Jehnna.\n\nMalak shows them a secret route to the throne room. Conan confronts Bombaata and kills him in combat. Zula impales the Grand Vizier before he can sacrifice Jehnna. The rising Dagoth becomes distorted from a human statue into a monstrous entity. He kills Taramis, then attacks Conan. Zula and Malak join the fight, but Dagoth effortlessly sweeps them aside. Grappling with the monster, Conan tears out Dagoth's horn, weakening Dagoth enough to kill him.\n\nThe newly crowned Queen Jehnna offers each of her companions a place in her new court: Zula will be the new captain of the guard, Akiro the queen's advisor, and Malak the court jester. Jehnna offers Conan marriage and the opportunity to rule the kingdom with her as her King, but he declines and departs to find further adventures and his own place in the world... but that is another story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Destroyer]]\n* [[Grace Jones]] as Zula\n* [[Wilt Chamberlain]] as Bombaata\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako]] as Akiro\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Malak\n* [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] as [[A Witch Shall be Born|Queen Taramis]]\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as Princess Jehnna\n* [[Pat Roach]] as [[The Phoenix on the Sword|Thoth-Amon]]\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Grand Vizier\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as Togra\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as the Dagoth monster (uncredited)\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as The Leader\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Toning down the violence===\nWhen [[John Milius]], director of ''Conan the Barbarian'', was unavailable, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] suggested Richard Fleischer to his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis, who was producing ''Conan the Destroyer''. Fleischer had already made ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' (1961) and ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' (1975) for Dino De Laurentiis.\n\n''Conan the Barbarian'' made about $40 million at the U.S. box office when it was released in 1982 with an R-rating, and an additional $50 million in other markets. Because [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and producer Dino De Laurentiis thought it would have been even more successful if it had been less violent, they wanted to tone down the violence in the sequel. ''Conan the Destroyer'' originally received an R-rating like its predecessor, but the film was recut to secure a PG-rating.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}} Fleischer delivered a movie that was less violent (and somewhat more humorous) than the first, although some scenes of violence have bloody results (the [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#Addition of the PG-13 rating|PG-13]] rating did not exist until July 1 of that same year). [[Carlo Rambaldi]] created the Dagoth monster.\n\n===Casting===\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu, who played the Wizard of the Mound and narrator in the first film, return for the second film, while Mako's character is now named Akiro. [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]], who played Thorgrim in the first film, also returned, but this time he had to partially cover his face with a mask, as he was playing a different character. Singer Grace Jones played the warrior Zula, the last of her tribe. This was the basketball player Wilt Chamberlain's only film role and the debut of Olivia d'Abo, who played the petulant teenaged princess.<ref name=afi/> [[David Lander]] was originally cast to play the foolish thief Malak, but due to his deteriorating health from the onset of [[multiple sclerosis]], he was forced to quit the project, and the part was recast with Tracey Walter. Professional wrestler Pat Roach, who memorably played the German Mechanic in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and the Thuggee Overseer in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', was cast as crystal palace Man Ape/sorcerer Toth-Amon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/2004/06/15/squiggy-upbeat-after-ms-storms-into-his-life/|title='SQUIGGY' UPBEAT AFTER MS STORMS INTO HIS LIFE|last=Kearns|first=Michelle|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=June 15, 2004|access-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref> Andr\u00e9 the Giant had an uncredited role as the Dagoth monster.<ref>{{cite book|title=Andre the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2009|isbn=9781439188132|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8RNM7QmEqkC&pg=PA79}}</ref>\n\n===Photography===\n''Conan the Destroyer'' was the fourth film on which British director of photography [[Jack Cardiff]] worked with Fleischer. Cardiff had already photographed ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Crossed Swords (1977 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1977), and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' (1983) for the director. They worked together twice more on ''[[Million Dollar Mystery]]'' (1987), and Fleischer's last film, the short ''[[Call from Space]]'' (1989), which was shot in the 65-mm Showscan process. Cardiff's other notable films include [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985).\n\n===Filming===\nShooting took place in [[Mexico City]] from November 1, 1983, to February 10, 1984.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57064|title=Conan the Destroyer|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|access-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nIn the film, a camel is knocked to the ground, and after struggling to get back up, its hind legs are drawn forward with wires so that it is forced to sit down before falling to the ground. This sequence is cut from the U.K. version, although a later scene in which Conan apologizes to the camel is left in. Also cut is a double horse-fall in the opening battle.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} To secure a PG rating, Sarah Douglas said several scenes involving her character were cut, including a sex scene with Schwarzenegger, slapping Chamberlain, a virgin sacrifice, and the seduction of a statue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/take-one-vol-22-no-2/|title=Take One|last=Bricker|first=Rebecca|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=July 9, 1984|access-date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\nThe musical score of ''Conan The Destroyer'' was composed, conducted, and produced by [[Basil Poledouris]], and it was performed by the orchestra Unione Musicisti Di Roma.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Conan the Destroyer'' grossed $31 million in the U.S.<ref name=mojo/> Schwarzenegger, Fleischer, and De Laurentiis subsequently teamed up again to make ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' a year later.
