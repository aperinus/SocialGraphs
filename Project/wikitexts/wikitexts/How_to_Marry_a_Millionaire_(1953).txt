The screenplay was based on the plays ''The Greeks Had a Word for It'' (1930) by [[Zoe Akins]] and ''Loco'' (1946) by Dale Eunson and [[Katherine Albert]].\n\nIt stars [[Betty Grable]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Lauren Bacall]] as three fashionable Manhattan models, along with [[William Powell]], [[David Wayne]], [[Rory Calhoun]], and [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as their wealthy marks. Although Grable received top billing in the screen credits, Monroe's name was listed first in all advertising, including the trailer.\n\nProduced and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' was the studio's first film to be shot in the new [[CinemaScope]] wide-screen sound process, although it was the second CinemaScope film released by Fox after the biblical [[epic film]] ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (also 1953). It was also the first color and CinemaScope film ever shown on prime-time network television (though [[Pan and scan|panned-and-scanned]]) when it was presented as the first film on NBC's ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies|Saturday Night at the Movies]]'' on September 23, 1961.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gomery|first1=Douglas|last2=Pafort-Overduin|first2=Clara|title=Movie History: A Survey|date=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-1368-3525-4|page=246|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nThe [[How to Marry a Millionaire (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' was released on CD by [[Film Score Monthly]] on March 15, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall in How to Marry a Millionaire trailer.jpg|left|thumb|375px|Monroe as Pola, Grable as Loco, and Bacall as Schatze]]\nResourceful Schatze Page, spunky Loco Dempsey, and ditzy Pola Debevoise are money-hungry [[gold digger]]s. The trio rent a luxurious [[Sutton Place, Manhattan|Sutton Place]] penthouse in New York City from Freddie Denmark, who is avoiding the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] by living in Europe. The women plan to use the apartment to attract rich men. And on the day they move in, Loco carries in groceries, assisted by Tom Brookman, who is attracted to Schatze. She dismisses him as being poor and sets her sights on the charming, classy, rich widower J.D. Hanley. While she is stalking the older J.D., Tom pursues her. After every date, she says she never wants to see Tom again, refusing to marry another \"gas pump jockey\".\n\n[[Image:Alexander D'Arcy and Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire trailer.jpg|left|thumb|375px|Pola is romanced by a phony tycoon, played by [[Alexander D'Arcy]]]]\nMeanwhile, Loco meets grumpy businessman, Walter Brewster. He is married, but she agrees to go with him to his lodge in [[Maine]], thinking it is a convention of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Club]]. Loco discovers her mistake and attempts to leave. However, she comes down with the measles and is quarantined. Upon recovering, she begins seeing forest ranger, Eben Salem. She mistakenly believes Salem is a wealthy landowner instead of a civil servant overseeing acres of forestlands. She is disappointed when she realizes the truth, but loves him anyway and is willing to overlook his financial shortcomings.\n\n[[Image:William Powell, Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire trailer.jpg|left|thumb|375px|[[William Powell]] as J.D. Hanley prepares to marry Schatze, with Loco and Pola as [[bridesmaid]]s]]\n\nPola is [[myopic]] but hates wearing glasses in the presence of men. She falls for a phony oil tycoon, J. Stewart Merrill, unaware he is a crooked speculator. When she takes a plane from [[LaGuardia Airport]] to meet him, she ends up on the wrong plane. A man sits next to her, also wearing glasses. He thinks she is \"quite a strudel\" and encourages her to wear hers. He is the mysterious Freddie Denmark on his way to Kansas City to find the crooked accountant who got him into trouble with the IRS. He has little luck when he tracks the man down, but he and Pola fall in love and get married.\n\nLoco and Pola are reunited with Schatze just before her wedding to J.D.. Schatze is unable to go through with the marriage and confesses to J.D. that she loves Tom. He agrees to call off the ceremony. Tom is among the wedding guests and the two reconcile and marry. Afterwards, the three happy couples end up at a [[greasy spoon]] diner. Schatze jokingly asks Eben and Freddie about their financial prospects, which are slim. When she finally gets around to Tom, he casually admits a net worth of around $200 million, which no one takes seriously. He then calls for the check, pulls out an enormous wad of money, and pays with a $1,000 bill, telling the chef to keep the change. The three astonished women faint, and the men drink a toast to their unconscious wives.\n\n\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Betty Grable]] as Loco Dempsey\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Pola Debevoise\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Schatze Page\n* [[William Powell]] as J.
