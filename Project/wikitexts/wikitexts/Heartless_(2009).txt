This was Ridley's first film in fourteen years since 1995's ''[[The Passion of Darkly Noon]]''. The film garnered positive reception from critics who praised the performances and dark atmospheric tone that complemented the [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian plot]].\n\n==Plot==\nJamie Morgan is a lonely, troubled photographer with a large heart-shaped birthmark that covers nearly half of his face. He is still a virgin at 25 because a lifetime of alienation and bullying have left him unable to make friends or attract women. At the photographic studio he shares with his brother and nephew Lee, he meets aspiring model Tia.\n\nAs Jamie develops photos from a shoot, he notices a disturbing face looking at him from the window of a house. When he goes back to investigate, he follows a suspicious man to a group of hooded vandals around a fire, who emit eerie shrieks. One notices Jamie and shrieks at him. Jamie is shocked to see a demonic lizard-like face under the hood, with huge pin-like teeth. Over time Jamie becomes aware of a series of horrific murders by Molotov cocktail that have been occurring in the neighbourhood. A witness to one of the murders, a little Asian girl, tells a TV reporter that they weren't wearing masks; the demonic faces were real. Jamie's neighbour and new-found friend, A.J. turns up with a huge wound that looks as if it was caused by claw marks. Parts of his dismembered body then turn up in the local area.\n\nJamie and his mother are walking in the neighborhood when they are attacked by the demonic gang. His mother is immolated while Jamie watches helplessly, and he is savagely beaten and left for dead. While unconscious in hospital he glimpses a man in his dream who says he is waiting for Jamie. Later, he receives a phone call from a man with the same voice, and is guided to the apartment of Papa B and his assistant Belle, who looks just like the little Asian girl from the TV report. Papa B offers a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]]: Jamie must fulfil Papa B's desire for chaos with occasional acts of [[Graffiti|vandalism]] in return for the removal of his birthmarks. Despite Papa B admitting that he was responsible for his mother's death as a way of bringing Jamie to him, Jamie consents and they shake hands. Jamie is told to immolate himself with a Molotov cocktail in order to be reborn. Jamie miraculously survives and peels away his burned skin to reveal perfect, unblemished skin.\n\nInitially things go well: a chance meeting with Tia leads a newly confident Jamie to spend the day with her in the park, where his beloved, deceased father first taught him to use a camera. The deal sours, however, when the Weapons Man arrives: Papa B has reneged on their bargain and Jamie must now commit murder by ripping the heart from a living victim. The Weapons Man tortures Jamie until he agrees to kill a street hustler. His hope for a better life returns after he and Tia become lovers. During this time Belle also comes to live with Jamie, after Papa B beat her in a fit of rage. She starts calling Jamie \"Dad\" and becomes a bit of a guide to him, kindly and pragmatically explaining that he has no choice but to kill, to save his own life\u2014and Belle's. But Papa B is outraged at Belle's betrayal and as punishment demands that Jamie kill a new victim\u2014Tia.\n\nTia asks Jamie to put a photo album in his work safe, and it is revealed that Tia and Lee intended to steal his late mother's jewellery. Tia had initially meant only to help Lee gain access to the safe, but she ended up sincerely falling in love with Jamie. During the ensuing struggle Tia is accidentally shot and killed, and Lee is seriously wounded by \"She\", a gang leader to whom he owed money, and who wears a metallic claw in place of a severed hand.\n\nJamie is pursued by She but fights back and kills him. He notices that a mark on a wall from She's claw looks just like the wound received by A.J. Jamie tells Belle, who has turned up from nowhere, that she must flee to stay safe, and she disappears. Jamie spies himself in a mirror and sees that his birthmark has returned, and with it the knowledge that it had been there the entire time, even while he was courting Tia. Jamie confronts Papa B's minions and fights them off, but when faced with a larger demon, Papa B in his true form, runs away. Viewers are left to decide for themselves whether Papa B cheated Jamie by never removing the birthmark, or if much of what transpired was the product of Jamie's imagination.\n\nAfter waking up indoors, Jamie staggers outside. On the ground he sees several masks with sharp teeth, and looks up to see several masked and hooded gang members. But these are ordinary masks made of sacks, not the realistic demon faces Jamie has seen so far. Are these the \"demons\" he had been fighting a short while ago? Jamie now recalls himself walking and talking with Belle\u2014only now he appears to converse with empty space. As realisation sinks in, a gang member catches him with a [[Molotov cocktail]]. As he stands still and burns to death, Jamie experiences a vision of his father, who tells him that you can only see the stars in the blackness of the night. Whether this is a memory or a near-death experience is left unclear. Jamie ascends into bright light. The light fades into a field of stars in the night sky, mirroring the words spoken by his father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Jamie Morgan\n* [[Noel Clarke]] as A.J.\n* [[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]] as Tia \n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Weapons Man\n* [[Joseph Mawle]] as Papa B\n* [[Ruth Sheen]] as Marion Morgan\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as George Morgan\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Lee Morgan\n* [[Fraser Ayres]] as Vinnie\n* Nikita Mistry as Belle\n* Ross McCart as Young Jamie\n\n==Music==\nThe film featured a number of original songs for which Ridley himself had written the lyrics.<ref name=\"Nick\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbicat.com/news/index/?id=2|title=Dreamscape Cradle launched|publisher=Nick Bic\u00e2t|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=9 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702000124/http://www.nickbicat.com/news/index?id=2|archive-date=2 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music for these songs were composed by Ridley's long-time collaborator Nick Bic\u00e2t who had previously written music for productions of Ridley's stage plays<ref>{{cite book|author=Philip Ridley|title=Ridley Plays 1: The Pitchfork Disney; The Fastest Clock in the Universe; Ghost from a Perfect Place|date=16 October 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ18AAAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|pages=7, 137|isbn=978-14081-42332}}</ref> and films.<ref name=\"Nick\"/> On Nick Bic\u00e2t's website it states that the songs had been written to act \"like a Greek chorus, commenting on the action. Every song in the film\u2014whether heard on the radio, in a club, or used as part of the score\".\n\nAs well as being the lead actor, Jim Sturgess also sang two of the songs in the film's soundtrack. When talking about the film's music Ridley explained that Jim Sturgess heard some of the songs and loved them. He wondered if, perhaps, it would be right for him to sing a couple. To be honest, Jim and I had discussed this possibility much earlier (Jim's talents are boundless. As well as being one of the greatest actors around, he is also a great singer...not to mention songwriter, poet\u2014the list goes on!). Initially, we had both agreed it probably wouldn't be right. But as the film progressed, and the exploration of Jamie's mind in the film become ever more obsessive...well, it just seemed to make total sense for Jim to perform the two songs most pertinent to Jamie's state of mind: the theme music, Heartless, and Another Me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimsturgessonline.com/?p=4047|title='HEARTLESS' SOUNDTRACK & JSONLINE STORE|website=JimSturgessOnline.com|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film's first soundtrack album - named ''Heartless''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heartless-Various-artists/dp/B003NCHIJ8/ref=cm_cr_pr_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8|title=Heartless: Various artists: Amazon.co.uk: Music|publisher=[[Amazon.co.uk]]|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> - was distributed on 1 January 2010 and later online 17 May 2010 by Universal Music Digital Services and contained all the songs, the listing of which are below:\n# ''Heartless'' (sung by [[Jim Sturgess]])\n# ''This Is the World We Live In'' (sung by [[Joe Echo]])\n# ''What Skin Is All About'' (sung by Joe Echo)\n# ''The Other Me'' (sung by [[Jim Sturgess]])\n# ''Lie to Me'' (sung by Joe Echo)\n# ''It Must Be Somewhere'' (sung by Mary Leay)\n# ''The Darker It Gets'' (sung by Joe Echo)\n# ''In You Are All the Stories'' (sung by Joe Echo)\n# ''Beautiful'' (sung by Joe Echoe)\n# ''Phoenix in Dynamite Sky'' (sung by Joe Echo)\n# ''Heartless'' (sung by [[Jim Sturgess]])\n# ''Heartless (Instrumental)''\n\nAnother Soundtrack album - ''Heartless (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heartless-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B0059XVHJ6/ref=sr_1_11?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1447110421&sr=1-11&keywords=Heartless|title=Heartless (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack): David Julyan: Amazon.co.uk: Music|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> - was released by [[MovieScore Media]] on 21 June 2011 and contained the orchestral music by [[David Julyan]] used in the film, the listing of which are below:\n# ''Heartless: Main Titles'' \n# ''Demons in the Dark''\n# ''Journey to Cendrillon''\n# ''Papa B''\n# ''New Skin''\n# ''Weapons Man''\n# ''Magical Tree''\n# ''It's Ten O'Clock''\n# ''You're Beautiful''\n# ''Papa B Returns''\n# ''Run, Jamie, Run!''\n# ''I'm Not Afraid''\n# ''So Many Stars''\n# ''Into the Dark''\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its premiere on 31 August 2009 at [[Film 4]]'s [[London FrightFest Film Festival|Fright Fest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empirecinemas.co.uk/?page=synopsis&filmid=1771|title=Film Synopsis: Heartless (FrightFest)|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Verlagsgruppe|Bauer Consumer Media]]|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref> The film was also shown as part of the 2009 [[Cork Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkfilmfest.org/2009/films/291/heartless|title=Heartless - Corona Cork Film Festival|date=7 November 2009|website=[[Cork Film Festival]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928175948/http://www.corkfilmfest.org/2009/films/291/heartless|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was part of the [[Fantasia International Film Festival|Fantasia Festival]] 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38391/fantasia-2010-two-new-heartless-one-sheets|title=Fantasia 2010: Two New Heartless One-Sheets|date=7 July 2010|website=[[Dread Central]]|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe film was noted for being one of the first British films to almost have a simultaneous multi-platform release, being released in cinemas 21 May and distributed on DVD, Blu-ray and Digital Download just four days later on 25 May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviescopemag.com/market-news/featured-editorial/heartless-dop-matt-gray-and-director-philip-ridley/|title=Heartless \u2013 DoP Matt Gray and Director Philip Ridley|last=Baughan|first=Nikki|publisher=movieScope|date=4 September 2011|accessdate=9 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210182547/http://www.moviescopemag.com/market-news/featured-editorial/heartless-dop-matt-gray-and-director-philip-ridley/|archive-date=10 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film has since been released as a digital rental on the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heartless|url=https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-heartless-2009-online|website=BFI Player|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Heartless'' received generally positive reviews from critics. {{As of|2020|06}}, the film holds a 78% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 5.93/10.
