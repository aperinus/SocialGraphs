It is the third (and final live-action) installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' film series]], and a sequel to ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian|Battle of the Smithsonian]]''. The film stars [[Ben Stiller]] in the lead role, [[Robin Williams]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Rebel Wilson]], and [[Ben Kingsley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/27/night-at-the-museum-3-secret-of-the-tomb/12494557/ |title=Sneak peek: 'Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb' |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=July 28, 2014}}</ref> In ''Secret of the Tomb'', security guard Larry Daley must travel to London to return the tablet of Ahkmenrah, an Egyptian artifact which causes the exhibits to come to life, before the magic disappears.\n\nPrincipal photography of ''Secret of the Tomb'' took place from January to May 2014 in London, England and British Columbia, Canada. The film premiered on December 11, 2014, at New York City's [[Ziegfeld Theater]] and was released in the United States on December 19, 2014. ''Secret of the Tomb'' grossed over $363&nbsp;million at the box office, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the series, and like its predecessors, received mixed reviews. The film is dedicated to [[Robin Williams]] and [[Mickey Rooney]], who both died before the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[1938]], a team of archaeologists is searching for the tomb of [[pharaoh]] Ahkmenrah in [[Kingdom of Egypt (1922\u20131953)|Egypt]]. Among the group is young Cecil \"C.J.\" Fredericks, who discovers the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. As the team packs up the artifacts due to an incoming sandstorm, the locals warn them about removing the tablet from the tomb, saying \"the end will come.\"\n\nSeventy-six years later in New York City, [[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian|five years after the events of the previous film]], Larry Daley remains the night guard of the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]]. He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is ready, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new [[Neanderthal]] model resembling Larry. The new Neanderthal calls himself Laaa and considers Larry his father. Later, Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet has a mysterious corrosion. As the corrosion spreads, the exhibits act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After calming the situation, Larry, frustrated, returns home to find his teenage son Nick throwing a party.\n\nTo discover what is happening to the tablet, Larry reunites with now-retired Cecil, a member of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers \"the end will come\" prophecy and realizes it refers to the tablet's magic ending and the exhibits becoming lifeless. Cecil says Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but that they are in the [[British Museum]]. Larry convinces museum curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee believes the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel the U.K. and go to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. Larry discovers that some of the American exhibits have stowed away with Ahkmenrah: [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Sacagawea]], [[Attila the Hun]], miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the [[capuchin monkey]], and Laaa. As Larry and the others search the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life.\n\nThe group is joined by a [[wax figure]] of [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]], who helps fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a ''[[Triceratops]]'' [[skeleton]] and a [[Xiangliu]] statue. The tablet's corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin experiencing side-effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. The group finds Ahkmenrah's parents. They learn the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of [[Khonsu]]. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the [[Holy Grail]], and prepares to leave for [[Camelot]]. Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room, but Attila helps them escape. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly; they become attracted to each other.\n\nLancelot crashes the musical [[Camelot (musical)|''Camelot'']] starring [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Alice Eve]] and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others chase Lancelot to the theatre's roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet, turning the exhibits back into their lifeless forms. The group tells Lancelot that although Camelot never existed, he can have a life. Lancelot gives the tablet back, allowing Larry to straighten the pieces as the moonlight restores the tablet's power and the exhibits. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the London Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the exhibits go home. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends and says goodbye to them before the sun rises, and then he leaves the museum for the last time.\n\nThree years later, Larry now works as a school teacher after the museum rehired McPhee. Tilly, the new night guard, brings a traveling exhibit to New York in a collaboration with the Museum of Natural History. In McPhee's office, Tilly hands the tablet to McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again as they throw a huge party. From across the street, Larry quietly observes the celebration and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Humans===\n\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a security guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/01/rebel-wilson-joins-night-at-the-museum-3/ |title=Rebel Wilson Joins 'Night at the Museum 3' Cast |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=9 January 2014 |access-date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dr. McPhee, the director of the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Madeline Phelps, the chairwoman of the American Museum of Natural History.\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Tilly, the night security guard at the British Museum.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Skyler Gisondo]] as Nick Daley, the son of Larry Daley.<ref name=\"deadline2\">{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/11/skyler-gisondo-lands-night-at-the-museum-3/ |title=Skyler Gisondo Set For 'Night at the Museum 3' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=13 November 2013 |access-date=January 28, 2014}}</ref> He was previously played by [[Jake Cherry]] in the previous films.\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Cecil Fredericks, a retired security guard from the first film.\n** [[Percy Hynes White]] plays the younger Cecil \"C.J\" Fredericks in the [[prologue]].\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Gus, a retired security guard from the first film.\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Reginald, a retired security guard from the first film.\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Rose, an archivist at the Museum of Natural History.\n* [[Brennan Elliott]] as Robert Fredericks, C.J.'s father in the [[prologue]].\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Archibald Stanley, an archeologist who accompanies Robert and Cecil in the prologue\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Himself (uncredited)\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Herself (uncredited)\n\n===Exhibits===\n\n* Ben Stiller as Laaa, a [[Neanderthal]] who was made to resemble Larry.\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[wax sculpture]] of the 26th President of the United States.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n** Williams also voices [[Garuda]].\n* [[Rami Malek]] as Ahkmenrah, the mummy of an ancient pharaoh.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]], the wax statue of the legendary [[Round Table|Knight of the Round Table]].<ref name=\"deadline3\">{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://deadline.com/2013/11/downton-abbeys-dan-stevens-in-lancelot-mode-for-night-at-the-museum-3/ |title='Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens Joins 'Night at the Museum 3' As Lancelot |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=9 November 2013 |access-date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Merenkahre, the mummy of an ancient pharaoh and Ahkmenrah's father.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/01/ben-kingsley-tapped-by-shawn-levy-for-night-at-the-museum-3/ |title=Ben Kingsley Joins 'Night at the Museum 3' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=23 January 2014 |access-date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Octavius, a [[Roman legion|Roman soldier]] miniature and Jedediah's best friend.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Jedediah, a [[cowboy]] [[diorama]] miniature and Octavius' best friend.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as [[Attila the Hun]], the statue of the leader of the Huns.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Mizuo Peck]] as [[Sacagawea]], the polyurethane model of the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman who is Theodore Roosevelt's girlfriend.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Anjali Jay]] as Shepseheret, the mummy of a [[Great Royal Wife]] of Merenkahre and Ahkmenrah's mother.\n* [[Crystal the Monkey]] as Dexter, a [[Capuchin monkey]].\n* [[Brad Garrett]] (voice) as Moai, an [[Easter Island Head]] at the Museum of Natural History.\n\n==Production==\nOn January 21, 2010, co-writer [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] said to ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', \"I think it's a really outstanding idea to do ''Night at the Museum 3'', in fact.
