Roskam]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. It was written by [[Dennis Lehane]], based on his 2009 short story \"Animal Rescue\". It follows Bob Saginowski, a barman who becomes entangled in an investigation after the mafia-run bar where he works is robbed. It stars [[Tom Hardy]], [[Noomi Rapace]], [[James Gandolfini]] (in his final film role), and [[Matthias Schoenaerts]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[TSG Entertainment]] and [[Chernin Entertainment]]. It premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically on September the 12th, 2014. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $4.1 million during its opening weekend and $18.7 million worldwide, against a budget of $12.6 million.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Brooklyn]], Bob Saginowski tends a neighborhood bar run by his cousin Marvin Stipler, which the [[Chechen mafia]] uses as a 'drop' for illegal money. Marv ridicules Bob for commemorating the 10th anniversary of Richie \u201cGlory Days\u201d Whelan's unsolved murder. Bob finds a [[pit bull]] pup abandoned in a garbage can outside the home of a woman named Nadia, and they rescue the battered dog together.\n\nWhen the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is annoyed when Bob tells [[NYPD]] Detective Torres that one thief wore a broken watch. Recognizing Bob from church, Torres questions Bob's reluctance to take [[Eucharist|communion]]. Naming the dog [[Saint Rocco|Rocco]]<!-- After the local parish church's patron saint, who is also the patron saint of dogs. -->, Bob bonds with Nadia, who offers to care for Rocco when Bob is at work. She later reveals that scars on her neck were self-inflicted when she struggled with drugs.\n\nChechen mobster Chovka threatens Marv and Bob to recover his stolen money. Meeting with one of the thieves, Fitz, Marv is revealed to have orchestrated the robbery, and a discussion with his sister Dottie reveals that he is desperate to pay for their father's life support. Bob is approached by a man who later appears at his home with proof he is Rocco's owner, but Bob refuses to return the mistreated dog.\n\nMarv grows paranoid, and he and Bob find a bag outside the bar containing the stolen money and a severed arm with the broken watch, apparently delivered by the Chechens. Rocco's owner visits the bar, appearing to know Nadia, and Marv informs Bob that the man is Eric Deeds, who has long claimed to have killed Richie Whelan. Disposing of the arm, Bob is again questioned by Torres, and confronts Nadia. She later admits that Deeds is her unstable ex-boyfriend, but Bob assures her that he does not care about her past.\n\nBob and Marv return the money to the Chechens, who tell them that the bar will be the drop site on the night of the [[Super Bowl]]. When Fitz refuses to rob the bar again on the night of the drop, Marv kills him and recruits Deeds instead. Bob confronts Deeds, who demands $10,000 and threatens to reclaim and kill Rocco. Sensing Marv's plan, Bob warns him not to do something desperate again.\n\nThe day of the Super Bowl, Bob retrieves cash hidden in his basement and waits for Deeds, who instead breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go the bar with him. At the bar, Bob hides his money and a pistol, and receives numerous deposits of mob cash throughout the night. Marv lines his car's trunk with plastic and waits near the bar, which is eventually empty except for Deeds and a frightened Nadia, who warns that Deeds has a gun. Bob offers the $10,000 for Rocco but Deeds refuses, threatening Nadia if Bob does not open the [[time lock]] safe.\n\nBob explains that years earlier, Marv was a [[loan shark]] skimming money from the Chechens. A customer with a large debt won a casino jackpot and paid Marv everything he owed; Marv seized the opportunity to use the customer's money to cover what he had stolen from the Chechens, leading Bob to kill the man and dispose of the body in his basement. Revealing that the man was Richie Whelan, Bob shoots Deeds dead and allows a terrified Nadia to leave. The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and Chovka makes Bob the bar's new owner, having had Marv shot to death in his car. \n\nSome time later, Detective Torres offers Bob condolences for Marv's death, unconvinced it was a [[carjacking]] gone wrong. Torres asks Bob about Deeds, who has gone missing and was last seen at the bar, just as Whelan had been; Torres reveals that although Deeds took credit for Whelan's death, he was in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres insinuates that Bob is responsible for both disappearances \u2014 \"No one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob?\" Bob visits Nadia to ask if he should stay away, but she offers to join him on a walk with Rocco.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Bob Saginowski\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as Nadia Dunn\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Marvin 'Cousin Marv' Stipler\n* [[Matthias Schoenaerts]] as Eric Deeds\n* [[John Ortiz]] as Detective Evandro Torres\n* [[Elizabeth Rodriguez]] as Detective Romsey\n* [[Danny McCarthy]] as Detective Dexter\n* [[Michael Aronov]] as Chovka Umarov\n* [[Morgan Spector]] as Andre\n* [[Michael Esper]] as Rardy Bernard\n* Khan Baykal as Tim Brennan\n* Ross Bickell as Father Regan\n* [[James Frecheville]] as 'Fitz'\n* [[Tobias Segal]] as Briele\n* Patricia Squire as Millie\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Dottie Stipler\n* [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] as Jimmy\n* [[Jeremy Bobb]] as Stevie\n* Lucas Caleb Rooney as Paul\n* [[James Colby]] as 'Sully'\n* Mike Houston as Danny\n* Michael O'Hara as Sean\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Drop'' opened in 809 theaters in North America and grossed $4,104,552, with an average of $5,074 per theater and ranking #6 at the box office.
