The film serves as a prequel to ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' from Scottish author [[J. M. Barrie]], which was first staged in 1904, and focuses on an alternative [[origin story]] for [[Peter Pan]] and [[Captain Hook]]. It stars [[Hugh Jackman]] as a fictionalized version of [[Blackbeard]], [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Hook, [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]], and [[Levi Miller]] as Peter Pan.\n\n''Pan''{{'}}s world premiere was held in [[London]] on September 20, 2015,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTSPZa4pKMo|title=Pan \u2013 World Premiere - Official Warner Bros. UK|date=September 21, 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> and it was theatrically released in the United States on October 9, 2015, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. ''Pan'' was a [[box-office bomb]], only grossing $128.4 million against a production budget of $150 million, resulting in significant loss for the studio, and was received negatively by critics, with criticism calling the plot formulaic and the action heavily reliant on [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Some also criticized the casting of white actress Rooney Mara as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous American]] character Tiger Lily; Mara would later voice regret over her role in the film. Meanwhile, critics also praised the film for the action sequences, performances by Hedlund, Jackman and Miller, and John Powell\u2019s music.\n\n==Plot==\nNewborn [[Peter Pan|Peter]] is left on the steps of a [[London]] orphanage with a mysterious [[pan flute]] pendant by his mother Mary. Years later during [[World War II]], upon learning that the abusive [[Nun|Mother]] Barnabas is hoarding food for herself, Peter and his best friend Nibs are caught trying to steal the food for the orphans. In the process, they find a letter written to Peter by his mother, declaring her love and assuring him they will meet again \"in this world or another\".\n\nMother Barnabas summons pirates who kidnap Peter, Nibs and several other orphans. Nibs manages to escape, but Peter is taken aboard a flying pirate ship. Following an aerial battle with several [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], the ship reaches [[Neverland]], where the children are forced to mine for Pixum \u2013 crystallized Fairy Dust\u2014for the pirate [[Blackbeard]], who uses the substance to prevent himself from aging. Taken captive by Blackbeard's right-hand man Bishop, Peter meets another miner, [[Captain Hook|James Hook]]. After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] over the deep mine, but survives by flying. Blackbeard tells Peter about the native tribe's prophecy of a flying boy who would lead an uprising to kill him, but Peter refuses to believe in \"bedtime stories\".\n\nPeter joins Hook and his accomplice, [[Mr. Smee|Sam \"Smee\" Smiegel]] in stealing a flying ship and escaping into the forest. Determined to find his mother, Peter refuses to leave Neverland. They are found by the native chief's daughter [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]] and nearly executed, but Chief Great Little Panther notices Peter's pendant, which is said to belong to their people's greatest hero, the legendary Pan. Using the Memory Tree, Tiger Lily tells Peter that many years ago, when the natives and fairies united against the pirates, the Fairy Prince and Mary, the love of Blackbeard's life, fell in love. When Blackbeard discovered them, the Prince took human form and sacrificed himself to rescue Mary, as fairies can live as humans for only one day. Mary was forced to hide their son Peter in the other world and seek shelter in the Fairy Kingdom. As half-fairy, Peter has the ability to fly but is unable to do so because of his lack of faith.\n\nFearful of Blackbeard, Smee betrays the natives\u2019 location, and in the ensuing battle Chief Great Little Panther is shot by Blackbeard, who reveals that he killed Mary. Peter is hurt to learn that Tiger Lily lied to him that his mother was still alive, but she explains that he would have walked away from his destiny if he knew the truth.\n\nPeter, Hook, and Tiger Lily escape in a raft to enlist the help of the Fairy Kingdom. They are attacked by a giant [[crocodile]] and Peter is nearly eaten before being rescued by the [[mermaid]]s. Tiger Lily shows Peter a vision of Blackbeard accidentally killing Mary as she defended the Fairy Kingdom, revealing she was a great warrior who trained Tiger Lily herself. Hook leaves on an abandoned ship to find home while Peter and Tiger Lily arrive at the Fairy Kingdom, only to be ambushed by Blackbeard. Planning to use the fairies' vast amount of Pixum to live forever, Blackbeard takes Peter's pendant, the key to the Fairy Kingdom, and opens their gates, launching an attack.\n\nPeter escapes and meets a fairy named [[Tinker Bell]]. Hook returns and fights Blackbeard's right-hand man Bishop while Tiger Lily duels Blackbeard, and the ship tips over, sending Hook and Bishop plummeting. Peter conquers his fears and flies to save Hook, then rallies the fairies against the pirates as Peter saves Tiger Lily. Blackbeard and his men are forced into an abyss to their deaths, with only Smee having fled. Peter sees a vision of Mary, who reaffirms him to be Neverland's savior: Peter Pan.\n\nPeter, Tiger Lily and Hook, now captain of the ''Jolly Roger'', return to London to rescue Nibs and the other orphans, who become Peter's crew, the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]]. Hook and Tiger Lily fall somewhat in love, and Peter and Hook reaffirm their friendship, certain nothing will ever go wrong between them.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Children's Museum of Indianapolis - May 2016 - Valerie Everett 11.jpg|thumb|Hugh Jackman's Blackbeard costume on display at [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] in 2015.]]\n* [[Levi Miller]] as [[Peter Pan]]<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/levi-miller-tapped-to-play-peter-pan-in-warner-bros-pan-exclusive-1201136941/ |title=Levi Miller Tapped to Play Peter Pan in Warner Bros.'
