An adaptation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1900 children's fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the film was primarily directed by [[Victor Fleming]] (who left the production to take over the troubled ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''), and stars [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Jack Haley]], [[Billie Burke]] and [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. [[Noel Langley]], [[Florence Ryerson]], and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]] and adapted by [[Herbert Stothart]], with the lyrics written by [[Yip Harburg|Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg]].\n\nCharacterized by its use of [[Technicolor]], fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was moderately successful upon its original release of August 25, 1939. The film was considered a critical success and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning in two categories: [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] by Stothart. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGM's most expensive production at that time.<ref name=\"Mannix\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Frank S. | last=Nugent |date=August 18, 1939 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review |title=The Screen in Review; 'The Wizard of Oz,' Produced by the Wizards of Hollywood, Works Its Magic on the Capitol's Screen \u2013 March of Time Features New York at the Music Hall at the Palace |access-date=August 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=How did 'Wizard of Oz' fare on its 1939 release?|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/11/entertainment/la-et-mn-original-wizard-reaction-20130311|access-date=April 24, 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 11, 2013|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114034331/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-mar-11-la-et-mn-original-wizard-reaction-20130311-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[The Wizard of Oz on television|1956 television broadcast premiere of the film]] on the [[CBS]] network reintroduced the film to the public; according to the U.S. [[Library of Congress]], it is the most seen film in movie history.<ref name=\"Fricke\" /><ref name=\"Library of Congress\">{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/ozsect2.html |title=To See The Wizard Oz on Stage and Film |date=December 15, 2010 |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=April 16, 2011 |archive-date=September 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929091335/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/oz/ozsect2.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"registrylist1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Recording Registry Listing \u2013 National Recording Preservation Board \u2013 Library of Congress|website=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=March 18, 2018|archive-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107015811/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/complete-national-recording-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=May 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505082616/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is also one of the few films on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme#Memory of the World Register|Memory of the World Register]].<ref>{{cite web | title= The Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming 1939), produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer | url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22303&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090805040156/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22303%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html | url-status=dead | archive-date= August 5, 2009 | publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme | access-date= September 7, 2009 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI ([[British Film Institute]]) list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 14\", and is on the BFI's updated list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 15\" released in May 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/50-films-to-see-by-15|title=50 films to see by age 15|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=May 6, 2020|access-date=June 1, 2020|archive-date=May 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528163305/https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/50-films-to-see-by-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture.

When Dorothy's dog Toto bites the wealthy Almira Gulch, Miss Gulch obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize the dog to be [[euthanized]]. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect her dog.\n\nProfessor Marvel, a [[charlatan]] [[fortune teller]], tells her to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. Dorothy returns just as a [[tornado]] approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked [[Storm cellar|storm shelter]], Dorothy takes cover in the [[farmhouse]] and is knocked out by a shattered window hitting her head. The tornado lifts the house and drops it on an unknown land.\n\nDorothy awakens and is greeted by short people known as Munchkins, and a \"good\" [[witch]] named Glinda, who explains to Dorothy that she is in Munchkinland in the land of Oz. The Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, appears in a puff of smoke. Before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on, as they must be very powerful. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves in another puff of smoke, but only after telling Dorothy, \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!\" Glinda knows of only one person who might know how to help Dorothy return home: the Wizard of Oz. Dorothy is directed to follow a [[yellow brick road]] that goes to the Emerald City, the Wizard's home.\n\nAlong the way, she meets the [[Scarecrow]], who wants a [[brain]]; the Tin Man, who desires a heart; and the Cowardly [[Lion]], who lacks courage. The foursome and Toto eventually reach the Emerald City, despite the best efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his doorman. The doorman, however, relents on hearing that they were sent by Glinda, and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick.\n\nDuring their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by [[Winged monkeys|flying monkeys]] and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her. The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion free Dorothy, but are pursued by the Witch and her guards. They are cornered by the Witch, who sets fire to the Scarecrow. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, which causes her to melt away.\n\nThe Witch's guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick. The four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the Wizard is revealed to be just an ordinary man, operating machinery that projects the ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront him, upon which he confesses that he, like Dorothy, accidentally arrived in Oz from America. He then \"grants\" the wishes of Dorothy's three friends by giving them tokens that symbolize that they always had the qualities they sought.\n\nThe Wizard offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his [[hot air balloon]]. However, after Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas with the help of the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda's instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating the words, \"There's no place like home.\" She is transported back to Kansas.\n\nShe awakens in her bed with a washcloth on her injured head and is attended to by her aunt, uncle and the farm hands.  Professor Marvel stops by as Dorothy describes Oz, telling the farm hands and the Professor they were there too. (The actors who portrayed Marvel and the farmhands also played the characters in Oz.) Unfazed by their disbelief, Dorothy gratefully exclaims, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| Left to right: The Cowardly Lion, Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man]]\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as Professor Marvel (also [[The Wizard of Oz (character)|the Wizard of Oz]]/Gatekeeper/Carriage Driver/Guard)\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" (also the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]])\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" (also the [[Cowardly Lion]])\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" (also the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]])\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Almira Gulch (also the [[Wicked Witch of the West]])\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Aunt Em|Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]{{efn|Credited as Toto}}\n* [[Leo Singer|The Singer Midgets]] as The Munchkins (For a list of all the Munchkin actors/actresses in the film, see [[Munchkin#Actors and actresses|Munchkin\u00a7Actors and actresses]].) <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n* [[Mitchell Lewis (actor)|Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (uncredited)<ref name=MLewis>{{cite book | last1=Scarfone | first1=Jay | last2=Stillman | first2=William | title=The Road to Oz: The Evolution, Creation, and Legacy of a Motion Picture Masterpiece | publisher=Lyons Press | year=2018 | isbn =9781493035328}}</ref>\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017 |archive-date=January 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114205803/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Candy Candido]] as the voice of the Angry Apple Tree (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url =  https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-wizard-of-oz/cast/2030102068/|date = |website = [[TV Guide]] |publisher = [[TV Guide]]|title = The Wizard of Oz - Full Cast & Crew|access-date = October 17, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last1=Fricke |first1=John |author-link=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]]. Goldwyn had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]], who was under contract to [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields. Also in his outline, the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless that he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. This torture softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Cannon's vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story, in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes. A few weeks later, Mankiewicz delivered a further 56 pages. LeRoy also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline; Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. Langley then turned in three more scripts, this time incorporating the songs written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They were asked to ensure that the story stayed true to Baum's book. However, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.<ref name=\"Coan\">{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|access-date=April 24, 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=December 22, 2011|archive-date=April 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044747/http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|url-status=live}}</ref> During filming, [[Victor Fleming]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes.

And he \u2013 there was eleven screenwriters on that \u2013 and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art.

Because they perceived a need to attract a youthful audience by appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical music and [[operetta]]. The princess challenged Dorothy to a singing contest, in which Dorothy's [[Swing music|swing]] style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]],<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> but was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college, and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others.

He was cast as Nikko, the head [[Winged Monkey]], on September 28, traveling to MGM studios on October 3.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They photographed and cataloged each Munchkin in their costume so they could consistently apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, but withdrew from the role when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') to the familiar \"ugly hag\".<ref name=\"Nissen2007\">{{cite book |last= Nissen |first= Axel |title= Actresses of a Certain Character: Forty Familiar Hollywood Faces from the Thirties to the Fifties |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IbpwDl1nt0MC&pg=PA196 |year= 2007 |publisher= McFarland & Company |isbn= 978-0-7864-2746-8 |pages= 196\u2013202 |access-date= April 22, 2020 |archive-date= August 1, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200801212636/https://books.google.com/books?id=IbpwDl1nt0MC&pg=PA196 |url-status= live }}</ref> She was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]].

According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a rumor concocted by the studio.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, and a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, includes the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.\n\n====Ebsen replaced by Haley====\nThe production faced the challenge of creating the Tin Man's costume. Several tests were done to find the right makeup and clothes for Ebsen.<ref name=\"Care 45\u201347\">{{Cite journal|last=Care|first=Ross|date=July 1980|title=Two Animation Books: The Animated Raggedy Ann and Andy; John Canemaker; The Making of the Wizard of Oz .

Although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley, he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it. To keep down on production costs, Haley only rerecorded \"If I Only Had a Heart\" and solo lines during \"If I Only Had the Nerve\" and the scrapped song \"The Jitterbug\"; as such, Ebsen's voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals.\n\n====George Cukor's brief stint====\nLeRoy, after reviewing the footage and feeling Thorpe was rushing the production, adversely affecting the actors' performances, had Thorpe replaced. During reorganization on the production, [[George Cukor]] temporarily took over under LeRoy's guidance. Initially, the studio had made Garland wear a blond wig and heavy \"baby-doll\" makeup, and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion. Cukor changed Garland's and Hamilton's makeup and costumes, and told Garland to \"be herself\". This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be reshot. Cukor also suggested the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from Fox, as the Tin Man.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harrod |first1=Horatia |title=Stormier than Kansas: how The Wizard of Oz was made |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-wizard-of-oz/making-of-facts-trivia/ |website=The Telegraph |access-date=September 5, 2020 |date=December 25, 2015 |archive-date=May 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509133245/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/the-wizard-of-oz/making-of-facts-trivia/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Victor Fleming, the main director====\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Victor Fleming 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Director Victor Fleming]] -->\nCukor did not shoot any scenes for the film, but acted merely as a creative advisor to the troubled production. His prior commitment to direct ''Gone with the Wind'' required him to leave on November 3, 1938, when [[Victor Fleming]] assumed directorial responsibility. As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already expressed his satisfaction with the film's new course.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4&nbsp;a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C). Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary;<ref>{{Cite AV media|people=Interview of [[Ray Bolger]]|title=The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic|publisher=Jack Haley Jr Productions|date=1990}}</ref> and the toxicity of Hamilton's copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leopold|first1=Ted|title='The Wizard of Oz' at 75: Did you know...?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/showbiz/the-wizard-of-oz-75th-anniversary/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=September 1, 2017|date=August 25, 2014|quote=Margaret Hamilton's copper-based makeup as the Wicked Witch was poisonous, so she lived on a liquid diet during the film, and the makeup was carefully cleaned off her each day.|archive-date=September 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902003320/http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/25/showbiz/the-wizard-of-oz-75th-anniversary/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the Yellow Brick Road.\n\nAll the Oz sequences were filmed in [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|three-strip Technicolor]].<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\">''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Making of a Movie Classic'' (1990).

Its songs were composed by [[Harold Arlen]], with lyrics by [[Yip Harburg]]. They won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song ranks first in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor, and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements. (As usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Although he had to be dropped from the cast because of a dangerous reaction to his aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained on the soundtrack (as mentioned in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). He can be heard in the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\".\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" was far more sedate than the version in the film.

Hail! The Witch Is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces were filmed and deleted later, in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for a sequence where the group journeys to the Witch's castle. Owing to time constraints, it was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage of the song has been lost, although silent home-film footage of rehearsals has survived. The audio recording of the song was preserved, and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the soundtrack, as well as on the film's VHS and DVD editions. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: The Witch tells her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release came right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The witch is dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration by the citizens of the Emerald City, who sang the song as they accompanied Dorothy and her friends to the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost, and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio track was preserved and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record \"deluxe\" soundtrack edition.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nGarland was to sing a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" while Dorothy was trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onward.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n===Underscoring===\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable classical and popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto hurry home after their encounter with Miss Gulch; when Toto escapes from her; and when the house \"rides\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion try to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\", as the Wizard presents awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(This list is excerpted from the liner notes of the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n==Post-production==\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939. Reshoots and pickup shots were done through April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. When the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise was revived after subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song. The footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pickups for the scene where she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy had [[stunt double]] [[Betty Danko]] perform instead. Danko was severely injured when the smoke mechanism malfunctioned.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long, arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] composed the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] perfected the special effects, including many of the rear-projection shots. The MGM art department created [[matte painting]]s for many scene backgrounds.\n\nA significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone. However, it was abandoned because it was too expensive and labor-intensive, and MGM used a simpler, less-expensive technique: During the May reshoots, the inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame. Once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland. If one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy and she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archive-date=November 14, 2007|access-date=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. In 1939, the average film ran for about 90 minutes. LeRoy and Fleming knew they needed to cut at least 15 minutes to get the film down to a manageable running time. Three sneak previews in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], guided LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\n\"Over the Rainbow\" was almost deleted. MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her signature song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n===Original theatrical run===\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]], on August 12, 1939]]\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=September 3, 2019|archive-date=January 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125153124/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|url-status=live}}</ref> The first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref> The film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]] on August 11, 1939,<ref>{{cite web | title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott | last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | access-date= October 21, 2011 | quote= John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.
