Set primarily in Spain, it tells a [[frame story]] containing [[Gothic fiction|gothic]], [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]] and erotic elements. In a deserted house during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], two officers from opposing sides find a manuscript, which tells the tale of the Spanish officer's grandfather, Alphonso van Worden ([[Zbigniew Cybulski]]). Van Worden travelled in the region many years before, being plagued by evil spirits, and meeting such figures as a [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalist]], a [[sultanate|sultan]] and a [[Romani people|Romani person]], who tell him further stories, many of which intertwine and interrelate with one another.\n\nThe film was a relative success in Poland and other parts of [[socialist]] [[eastern Europe]] upon its release.  It later also achieved a level of critical success in the [[United States]], when filmmakers such as [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] rediscovered it and encouraged its propagation.\n\nIn the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], ''The Saragossa Manuscript'' came second on the list of the greatest Polish films of all time.<ref name=\"Muzeum Kinematografii w \u0141odzi 2015\">{{cite web|url=http://kinomuzeum.pl/polska-najlepsze-filmy-wedlug-wszystkich-ankietowanych/|title=Polska \u2013 Najlepsze filmy wed\u0142ug wszystkich ankietowanych|date=2015-12-28|website=Muzeum Kinematografii w \u0141odzi|language=pl|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a battle in the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] town of [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]] (Zaragoza) during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], an officer retreats to the second floor of an inn. He finds a large book with drawings of two men hanging on a gallows and two women in a bed. An enemy officer tries to arrest him but ends up translating the book for him; the second officer recognizes its author as his own grandfather, who was a captain in the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] Guard.\n\nA flashback then recounts the tale of the ancestor, Alfonso van Worden ([[Zbigniew Cybulski]]), who appears with two servants, seeking the shortest route through the [[Sierra Morena|Sierra Morena Mountains]]. The two men warn him against taking his chosen route because it leads through haunted territory. At an apparently deserted inn, the Venta Quemada, he is invited to dine with two [[Moorish]] princesses, Emina ([[Iga Cembrzy\u0144ska]]) and Zibelda ([[Joanna J\u0119dryka]]) in a secret inner room. They inform the captain that they are his cousins and, as the last of the Gomelez line, he must marry them both to provide heirs. However, he must convert to [[Islam]]. He jokingly calls them ghosts (despite having told his servants with great bravado that ghosts do not exist). Then they seduce him and give him a [[Skull (symbolism)|skull]] goblet to drink.\n\nHe wakes and finds himself back in the desolate countryside, lying next to a heap of skulls under a [[gallows]]. He meets a hermit priest who is trying to cure a possessed man; the latter tells his story, which also involves two sisters and a different kind of forbidden love. Alfonso sleeps in the hermitage's [[chapel]], hearing strange voices at night.\n\nWhen he wakes and rides off, he is captured by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. But he is rescued by the two princesses, aided by the [[gang]] of the Zoto brothers (two of whom had appeared dead on the ground near the gallows). Back in the inner room, the two princesses become amorous with Alfonso but they are interrupted by [[Sheikh]] Gomelez, who forces the captain to drink the skull goblet at sword point.\n\nAgain Alfonso awakens at the gallows, but this time a [[Kabbalah|cabalist]] is lying next to him. As they ride to the Cabalist's castle, they are joined by a skeptical mathematician, who remarks, \"The human mind is ready to accept anything, if it is used knowingly.\" Thus ends part 1 of the film.\n\nPart 2 is primarily filled with the nested tales told by the leader of a band of [[Romani people|gypsies]] who visit the castle. [[Frame story]] or tale-within-a-tale-within-a-tale only begins to describe the complexity, because some of the inner tales intertwine, so that later tales shed new light on earlier experiences recounted by other characters. Multiple viewings of the film are recommended in order to comprehend the plot, as well as identify the appearance of certain characters before they are \"introduced\" by the gypsy [[raconteur]] to tell their own tales.<ref>[http://www.martinschell.com/saragossamanuscript/index.html Martin Schell's Saragossa Manuscript website]</ref>\n\nFinally, Alfonso is told to return to the Venta Quemada, where he meets the two princesses. They bid him farewell and the Sheikh gives him the large book so that he can write the end of his own story. The Sheikh explains that the whole adventure was a \"game\" designed to test Alfonso's character.\n\nAlfonso wakes under the gallows again, but his two servants are nearby \u2013 it is as if they are about to begin the journey that he has just \"dreamed\". At the small inn in Saragossa, he writes in the large book until someone tells him that the two princesses are waiting for him. He flings the book aside and it lands on the table where his descendant's enemy found it at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Zbigniew Cybulski]] as Alfonse Van Worden\n* [[Iga Cembrzy\u0144ska]] as Princess Emina\n* [[El\u017cbieta Czy\u017cewska]] as Donna Frasquetta Salero\n* [[Gustaw Holoubek]] as Don Pedro Velasquez\n* [[Beata Tyszkiewicz]] as Donna Rebecca Uzeda\n* [[Joanna J\u0119dryka]] as Zibelda\n* [[Bogumi\u0142 Kobiela]] as Senor Toledo\n* [[Zdzis\u0142aw Maklakiewicz]] as Don Roque Busqueros\n* [[Leon Niemczyk]] as Don Avadoro\n* [[Barbara Krafft\u00f3wna]] as Camilla de Tormez\n* [[Stanislaw Igar]] as Don Gaspar Soarez\n* [[Jan Machulski]] as Count Pena Flor\n* [[Kazimierz Opali\u0144ski]] as Hermit / Sheik\n* [[Janusz K\u0142osi\u0144ski]] as Don Diego Salero\n* [[Slawomir Lindner]] as Van Worden's father\n* [[Miroslawa Lombardo]] as Van Worden's mother\n* [[Franciszek Pieczka]] as Pacheco\n* [[Adam Pawlikowski]] as Don Pedro Uzeda\n* [[Krzysztof Litwin]] as Don Lopez Soarez\n* [[Jadwiga Krawczyk]] as Donna Inez Moro\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Niegowonice - Jura Krakowsko Cz\u0119stochowska - panoramio.jpg|200px|thumb|The film was shot at [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]], near Cz\u0119stochowa]]\n{{expand section|date=June 2018}}\nThe film was shot at [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]] near [[Cz\u0119stochowa]], [[Olsztyn, Silesian Voivodeship|Olsztyn]] castle, [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php?film=121835|title = FilmPolski.pl}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Poland uncut at 182 minutes, but it was shortened for release in the U.S.  and UK at 147 minutes and  125 minutes, respectively.
