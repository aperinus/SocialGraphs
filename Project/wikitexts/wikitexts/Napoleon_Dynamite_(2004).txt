Napoleon daydreams his way through school, reluctantly dealing with various bullies who torment him.\n\nNapoleon's grandmother is injured in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former high-school athlete, who lives in a [[conversion van]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] by selling items door-to-door. Kip wants money to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to travel from Detroit to see him while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of [[National Football League|NFL]] stardom and the recent breakup with his girlfriend.\n\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua|Juarez]], Mexico. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Pedro to let Deb dance with Napoleon.\n\nPedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The factions of the two candidates put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills,\" Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a [[Charity shop|thrift store]] and buys an instructional dance videotape called ''D-Qwon's Dance Grooves''.\n\nKip's girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives from [[Detroit]] and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he is learning to dance, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\n\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\n\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"[[Larger than Life (song)|Larger than Life]]\" by the [[Backstreet Boys]] with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]\" by [[Jamiroquai]]. Proving himself to be a skilled dancer, Napoleon's routine receives a [[standing ovation]] from students, stunning Summer, and her boyfriend, Don.\n\nPedro becomes the class president, Kip and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, Rico reunites with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returns from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play [[tetherball]].\n\nIn a post credits scene set two months later, Kip and Lafawnduh get married, and Napoleon appears with a horse which the bride and groom ride out on.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Napoleon Dynamite cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The cast of ''Napoleon Dynamite'' (from left to right: Majorino, Martin, Heder, Ruell, Ramirez, Gries, and Bader)]]\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Napoleon Dynamite\n* [[Efren Ramirez]] as Pedro S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as Deborah \"Deb\" Bradshaw\n* [[Aaron Ruell]] as Kipland Ronald \"Kip\" Dynamite\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Rico Dynamite\n* [[Haylie Duff]] as Summer Wheatley\n* [[Emily Dunn (actress)|Emily Kennard]] as Trisha Stevens\n* [[Shondrella Avery]] as LaFawnduh Lucas\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Grandma Carlinda Dynamite\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Rex\n* Carmen Brady as Starla\n* Trevor Snarr as Don\n* [[Ellen Dubin]] as Aunt Ilene\n\n==Production==\n===Origin===\n[[File:Pedros house from Napoleon Dynamite.jpg|thumb|right|Pedro's house, located in Preston, Idaho.]]\n{{See also|Peluca}}\nIn 2002, [[Brigham Young University]] film students Jon Heder and Jared Hess collaborated on a class project; the result was a 9-minute short movie shot on black-and-white 16mm film entitled ''[[Peluca]]'' about a nerdy high school student named Seth.<ref name=\"here be ligers\">{{cite magazine |last=Wood |first=Jennifer |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/napoleon-dynamite-oral-history-20140828 |title=Here There Be Ligers: An Oral History of Napoleon Dynamite |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2014-08-28 |access-date=2017-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n''Peluca'' was shown at the 2003 [[Slamdance Film Festival]]<ref name=\"SlamdanceOfficial\">{{cite web| url=http://archive.slamdance.com/2003/festival/film_detail.asp?film_id=401 |title=Peluca | work=Slamdance Film Festival |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108142347/http://www.slamdance.com/2003/festival/film_detail.asp?film_id=401 |archive-date=2007-11-08}}</ref> and was well received.

The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table.

I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\"\n\nWhen it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\"/>\n\n\"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\nThe dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], and ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref name=\"DVD-Commentary\">{{cite video |title=Napoleon Dynamite-(Commentary by Jared Hess, Actor Jon Heder and Producer Jeremy Coon) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] |date=2005}}</ref> \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.'

I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\"<ref name=\"dance scene\"/>\n\n\"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive. So we danced to three different songs. To that song and another Jamiroquai song, \"[[Little L]].\" We danced to Michael Jackson, something off of ''[[Off the Wall]]''. Just those three.
