The film influenced many writers in the [[teen film]] genre and spawned two sequels: ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'' (1983) and ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'' (1985), and an [[ashcan copy]] titled ''[[Porky's Pimpin' Pee Wee]]'' (2009). ''Porky's'' was the [[1982 in film#North America|fifth highest-grossing film of 1982]]. The film received generally positive reviews at the time of its release, but have become more mixed-to-negative over time.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, each boy in a group of Florida high school students plans to lose his virginity. They go to Porky's, a [[strip club]] in the [[Everglades]], believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. The club's proprietor, Porky, takes their money but humiliates the boys by dumping them into the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, Porky's brother, drives them away but not before he extorts them for the rest of their money, further embarrassing them.\n\nAfter Mickey, who returned to Porky's for revenge, is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually sinking Porky's establishment into the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase the group, but the boys make it across the county line, out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction, where local police officers and the high school band meet them. One of the officers, Mickey's older brother, Ted, repeatedly damages Porky's [[Hudson Hornet]], promising to drop all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys are too young to have been allowed into Porky's legally, Porky and his brother agree.\n\nIn a subplot, the boys peep on co-ed students in the girl's locker room shower, and Tommy, Billy, and Pee Wee see several girls showering. Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a heavier girl, who has been blocking his view, to move so that he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his [[Human penis|penis]] through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker, who has a running feud with Tommy, walks into the shower area. Spotting the protruding member, she sneaks up on Tommy, grabs his penis, and pulls with all her might. Tommy pulls free and escapes, but Beulah is determined to prove that the offending member, which has a mole on it, belongs to Tommy, going so far as to request that Principal Carter hold a police-type line-up of the boys in the nude so she can identify it. However, Carter balks at her request. As the other basketball coaches laugh, Coach Brackett suggests asking the police to send a sketch artist and hang wanted posters around the school. When that suggestion gets even Carter laughing, Balbricker leaves in a huff. At the end of the film, she sneaks out of the bushes to ambush Tommy and actually drags his pants down, but she is pulled off him by police and dragged away screaming that she saw \"it\" and that she can identify its owner. Tommy breaks the [[fourth wall]], saying, \"Jeez!\" to the camera.\n\nAnother subplot involves Coach Brackett taking an interest in attractive Coach Honeywell.  Coach Warren repeatedly refers to Honeywell as \"Lassie\" while pointing to the equipment room, much to Coach Brackett's confusion. He quickly finds out why when he and Honeywell hide out in the equipment room after an argument with Balbricker, and Honeywell becomes turned on by the smell. This leads to the pair having sex in the room, but Honeywell begins loudly howling like a dog, thus revealing why she is called Lassie. Her howls are heard throughout the entire school, much to the students' and Coach Warren's amusement. Brackett and Honeywell are fired as a result.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Edward \"Pee Wee\" Morris\n* [[Mark Herrier]] as Billy McCarty\n* [[Wyatt Knight]] as Tommy Turner\n* [[Roger Wilson (actor)|Roger Wilson]] as Mickey Jarvis\n* [[Cyril O'Reilly]] as Tim Cavanaugh\n* [[Tony Ganios]] as Anthony \"Meat\" Tuperello\n* [[Kaki Hunter]] as Wendy Williams\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Miss Lynn \"Lassie\" Honeywell\n* [[Nancy Parsons]] as Coach Beulah Balbricker\n* [[Scott Colomby]] as Brian Schwartz\n* [[Boyd Gaines]] as Coach Roy Brackett\n* [[Doug McGrath]] as Coach Fred Warren\n* [[Susan Clark]] as Cherry Forever\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Ted Jarvis\n* [[Wayne Maunder]] as \"Slime\" Cavanaugh\n* [[Alex Karras]] as Sheriff Wallace\n* [[Chuck Mitchell]] as \"Porky\" Wallace\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Mr. Carter\n* [[Randy Rosenthal]] as Student / Dune Buggy Driver\n* [[Jack Mulcahy (actor)|Jack Mulcahy]] as Frank Bell\n* Will Knickerbocker as The Bartender\n* [[Bill Hindman]] as Coach Goodenough\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBob Clark got the idea to make the film in 1972. It was based on his experiences with five high school friends in Florida in the 1950s.<ref name=\"los\"/> He based the story on actual occurrences at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida]], and [[Fort Lauderdale High School]] in the early 1960s, and on a venue called Porky's Hide Away in [[Oakland Park, Florida]].<ref name=\"miami\" />\n\nClark teamed up with Roger Swaybill on a film, ''[[Breaking Point (1976 film)|Breaking Point]]''. When Clark fell ill with [[mononucleosis]] in 1979, he dictated the story of ''Porky's'' to Swaybill, who then wrote a draft of the script. Every studio in Hollywood turned down the project. Clark eventually obtained financing from Melvin Simon Productions and a Canadian firm, Astral Bellevue Pathe. The film had to be made in [[Canada]] to obtain government tax benefits. This meant Clark, who was an American, got sole screen credit as writer. However, Swaybill was reimbursed with a six-figure sum and was co-writer on the sequel.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n\"It seems incredible to realize that ''Porky's'', which earned more than $200 million worldwide, was done as a tax shelter, but that's the way it was,\" Swaybill says.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKim Cattrall took a small role in the film because she needed the money, and was horrified, at first, to see her name at the top of the poster: \"People thought it was the end of my career\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Kim Cattrall: On the Legacy of 'Porky's' | work=www.howardstern.com | date=27 April 2011 |url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2011/04/27/on-the-legacy-of-porkysrsquo-rundowngallerymodel-2216/ |access-date=2022-01-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Porky's'' was released in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and [[Columbia, South Carolina]], on November 13, 1981.<ref name=\"collections\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/canadian-feature-film-database/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=991&DotsIdNumber=|work=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|title=Item |access-date=January 29, 2020}}</ref> It then received a wide release in Canada and the United States on March 19, 1982.<ref name=\"collections\" />\n\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the film was banned on February 1, 1982; the decision was overturned nineteen days later.<ref name=boardsielist>{{cite web|title=Films banned in Ireland|url=https://www.boards.ie/b/thread/113288|website=boards.ie|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nUpon its release, ''Porky's'' was viewed as \"a likeable [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] coming-of-age comedy\", but the critical appraisal has been more negative since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/the-front-page-bad-with-the-good-bob-clark-1941-2007/|title=Bad with the Good - Bob Clark (1941 - 2007)|last=Gibron|first=Bill|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=April 4, 2007|access-date=September 4, 2017}}</ref> [[Review aggregator|Review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which collects both contemporary and modern reviews, gives the film a score of 34% based on reviews from 38 critics and an average rating of 4.8/10.

In particular, they criticized the film for what they viewed as its objectification and degradation of women and the childish nature of its antagonists, and they disliked that the film took what they felt was a thin, shallow and off-color stance against [[anti-Semitism]].<ref>{{cite video | url = http://siskelandebert.org/video/N44N7DM9RKON/At-the-Movies-Stinkers-of-1982 | title = At the Movies-Stinkers of 1982 | work = At the Movies | access-date = 2013-04-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150224050612/http://siskelandebert.org/video/N44N7DM9RKON/At-the-Movies-Stinkers-of-1982 | archive-date = 2015-02-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In his print review for ''The Chicago Sun-Times'', Ebert noted that the film's sexual content ''per se'' was not the film's failing, but rather the manner it was used: \"Even in an easy scene like the one where the guys spy on the girls in the locker room, the director, Bob Clark, blows it.

The bonus material for the Blu-ray is the bonus material from the \"One Size Fits All\" Edition that focuses on the [[movie]] itself. The trailers for ''Porky's II: The Next Day'' and ''Porky's Revenge!'', and the Porky's [[video game]] sales pitch were not included as bonus materials for the [[Blu-ray]] release.\n\n==Sequels and additional media==\nThe first two ''Porky's'' films were directed by [[Bob Clark]] and produced by [[Harold Greenberg]], who founded Astral Communications (now known as [[Astral Media]]). Following the success of ''Porky's'' in North America and Europe, a sequel, ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'', was released in 1983. It was poorly received by critics and was less commercially successful than the original. Bob Clark did not want to make another film in the series, so director [[James Komack]] made the third and last part of the saga. The third film, ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'', was the worst-received of the series both critically and commercially.\n\nA video game based on the film, also titled ''[[Porky's (video game)|Porky's]]'', was released for the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]] by 20th Century Fox in 1983.<ref name=\"atarimania\">{{cite web|title=Porky's|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-porky-s_4068.html|website=Atari Mania}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nIn 2002, [[Howard Stern]] acquired the [[remake]] rights and has long hoped to produce a remake of the film.
