These children, or ''Kinder'' in German, were taken into foster homes and hostels in Britain, expecting eventually to be reunited with their parents. The majority of them never saw their families again. Written and directed by [[Mark Jonathan Harris]], produced by [[Deborah Oppenheimer]], narrated by [[Judi Dench]], and made with the cooperation of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], it utilized rare and extensive footage, photographs, and artifacts, and is told in the words of the child survivors, rescuers, parents, and foster parents.\n\nThe film received numerous accolades, including winning the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/207046/Into-the-Arms-of-Strangers-Stories-of-the-Kindertransport/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521144040/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/207046/Into-the-Arms-of-Strangers-Stories-of-the-Kindertransport/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2011 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011 |title=Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport |access-date=November 22, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] on August 28, 2001 by [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Jimenez|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=1382|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010715125633/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=1382|title=Warner 'Explorations' Promo Goes Back to School With History Theme|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=July 15, 2001|date=June 28, 2001|access-date=September 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=1238|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010605030925/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=1238|title=Warner Home Video Releases Oscar-Winning Docu-Feature 'Into the Arms of Strangers' on Aug. 28|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=June 5, 2001|date=May 29, 2001|access-date=September 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Interviewed subjects ==\nThe documentary features filmed interviews in which the children of the Kindertransport (aged in their 60s and 70s at the time of the filming) recall their feelings and experiences.
