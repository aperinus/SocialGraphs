It was followed by the sequel ''[[Armour of God II: Operation Condor]]'' in 1991. It also inspired several other [[action-adventure film]]s starring Jackie Chan, including ''[[The Medallion]]'' (2003), ''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005), ''[[CZ12]]'' (2012) and ''[[Kung Fu Yoga]]'' (2017) as well as the cartoon series ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nJackie, a.k.a. \"Asian Hawk\", is a former musician who becomes an adventurer and treasure hunter. After successfully stealing a sword from an African tribe, he has the weapon auctioned before it is won by May Bannon, the beautiful daughter of Count Bannon. He is reunited with his former bandmate Alan, who seeks his help as his girlfriend Lorelei has been kidnapped by an evil religious cult as a means of acquiring Jackie's services. The cult possesses two pieces of a legendary armour called the \"[[Armor of God|Armour of God]]\", and they intend to have Jackie bring them the three remaining armour pieces, including the sword. Jackie and Alan strike a deal with Count Bannon, who is in possession of the three armour pieces: they will borrow the armour pieces for their quest to rescue Lorelei with a promise to complete the armour for the Count, on the condition that May accompanies them.\n\nJackie, Alan and May travel into Yugoslavia to find the cult's monastery. They infiltrate the hideout and secretly rescue Lorelei, unaware that the cult leaders have anticipated their arrival and brainwashed her to do their bidding. At May's rest home, Lorelei drugs Alan and has him steal the three armour pieces. Jackie sneaks back to the monastery and rescues his friends. As Alan and Lorelei make their escape, Jackie fends off against the cult members before discovering the Armour of God in a cave. Before he gets a chance to take the armour, he encounters the Grand Wizard, who unleashes his four female assassins on the adventurer. Exploiting their high-heeled shoes as their weakness, Jackie defeats the assassins in a gruelling fight. Jackie is then surrounded by the rest of the Grand Wizard's men, but he reveals a vest filled with sticks of dynamite under his jacket, threatening to blow himself up with the monastery. After a couple of bluffs, he carelessly lights up the fuse and throws away the sticks of dynamite, running for his life as the monastery quickly begins to cave in, burying the entire cult and the Armour of God. He runs out of a cave and spots a hot-air balloon with Alan, Lorelei, and May aboard. In a daring move, Jackie does a [[BASE jumping|base jump]] off the cave and lands on top of the balloon, ending the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Jackie a.k.a. \"Asian Hawk\", a common treasure hunter and former member of the pop group \"The Losers\" (an allusion to '70s [[Cantopop]] band [[The Wynners]])<ref>{{cite book|title=VideoHound's Dragon: Asian Action & Cult Flicks|last=Thomas|first=Brian|publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]]|year=2003|isbn=9781578591411|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqx4iLRjthAC&pg=PR18}}</ref>\n* [[Alan Tam]] as Alan, a former member of The Losers who has moved on to a successful solo career\n* [[Lola Forner]] as May Bannon, the daughter of a powerful European Count\n* [[Rosamund Kwan]] as Lorelei, Alan's girlfriend and a former member of the Losers who is a prominent fashion designer\n* [[Bo\u017eidar Smiljani\u0107]] as Count Bannon, May's father\n* Ken Boyle as Grand Wizard, the leader of the evil religious cult\n* John Ladalski as Lama\n* Robert O'Brien as the African witch doctor\n* Boris Gregoric as Jackie's representative at the auction\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]] (extra) (uncredited)\n* Kenny Bee \n* Carina Lau \n* Anthony Chan\n\n<ref>[http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6882&display_set=eng Armour of God at HKMDB]</ref>\n<ref>[http://chinesemov.com/1987/Armour%20of%20God.html Armour of God at chinesemov.com]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Armour of God'' was filmed on location in parts of what was then [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]: [[Zagreb]] ([[Dolac Market|Dolac Central Market]]), [[Gradec, Zagreb|Upper town]], [[Trnje]] (near the then-unfinished building of [[Croatian Radio Television]]), [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], and [[Predjama Castle]] near [[Postojna]], [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]]. Filming was also undertaken in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], France, Spain and [[Morocco]]. During filming of the opening sequence, one scene called for Jackie Chan to jump from a wall to a tree branch. The first take went as planned, but Chan insisted on re-shooting the scene. On his second attempt, the branch broke and he fell 5 metres to the ground below. His head hit a rock, cracking his skull and forcing a piece of bone up into his brain. Chan was flown to the hospital and was in surgery eight hours later. As a result, he now has a permanent hole in his head filled with a plastic plug and slight hearing loss in his right ear.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\"/><ref name=\"Empire Magazine\"/> Chan replaced Eric Tsang as director following the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/armour-god/review/132666|title=Armour of God|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=10 December 2014}}</ref> Footage of the accident is shown during the film's ending credits.\n\nWhile shooting the hot-air balloon jump, Chan skydived out of a plane and landed on top of the balloon instead of jumping off a cliff as is seen in the film. For the shot of him jumping off the cliff, the crew rigged him up to a wire as he had no experience of [[BASE jumping]].<ref name=\"Empire Magazine\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Armour of God'' was released in Japan in mid-1986,<ref>Charles, 2000. p.15</ref> specifically on 16 August 1986.<ref name=\"Japan\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c12\u56de\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3672 |website=KungFu Tube |year=2012 |access-date=30 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> The film was released in Hong Kong on 21 January 1987.<ref name=\"hkarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1372Q2Q884O60.1928&profile=hkfa&uri=full=3100024@!52714@!0&ri=3&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&source=192.168.110.61@!horizon&ipp=20&staffonly=&term=Armour+of+god&index=FILMBRP&uindex=&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&ri=3|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702045825/http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1372Q2Q884O60.1928&profile=hkfa&uri=full=3100024@!52714@!0&ri=3&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&source=192.168.110.61@!horizon&ipp=20&staffonly=&term=Armour+of+god&index=FILMBRP&uindex=&aspect=basic_search&menu=search&ri=3|archive-date=2 July 2013|work=[[Hong Kong Film Archive]]|title=Armour of God|access-date=23 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn Hong Kong, the film grossed {{HK$}}35,469,408<ref name=\"hkarchive\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Armour of God (1987) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6882 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie Database]] |access-date=5 June 2020}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:35469408/7.798 round 0}}|link=yes}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) -
