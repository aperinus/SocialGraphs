At their first stop, the [[National Tramway Museum]], Chris confronts a man who is littering, and the man refuses to pick up his rubbish. When they get back to their car, Chris runs him over and kills him. Chris claims that the death was an accident, but smirks after the impact, unseen by Tina. Chris tells Tina that she is his muse.\n\nThey meet Janice, Ian and their dog Banjo (who resembles Poppy) at a caravan park and Janice reveals that Ian is a published writer, something that makes Chris jealous. The next morning Ian goes for a walk. Chris follows him, hits him in the head with a rock, steals his camera and pushes him off a cliff. Tina takes Banjo with them as they go. Tina finds photos of Ian and Janice on the camera and confronts Chris, who confesses to Ian's murder. Tina accepts this. During a walk through a National Trust park, Banjo defecates on the ground and a tourist tells Tina to clear up the mess. Chris arrives and encourages Tina to claim that the man tried to rape her. A row ensues, and Chris beats him to death.\n\nAt the next caravan park, Chris meets Martin, an engineer who is testing a mini-caravan that can be attached to the back of a bicycle. During a meal in a restaurant, Tina goes to the bathroom. When she returns, she finds Chris kissing the bride from the hen party at a nearby table as part of a bachelorette dare. Upset, Tina follows the bride outside and kills her by pushing her down a steep hill onto some rocks, observed by Chris. The next morning, instead of visiting a local tourist attraction, Chris says he is helping Martin make some modifications to his caravan. They argue, and Tina drives off alone. Upset, she calls her mother and is about to confess to the murders, when her mother hangs up. Later that night, Tina tries to seduce Chris by talking about their complicity in the murders, but he rejects her.\n\nChris wakes up to find Tina has left him sleeping in the caravan and is speeding down the highway. He calls her and tells her to pull over. Tina notices a jogger and runs him over. Chris is upset with her chaotic approach to the murders, believing himself to be justified in his choice of victims, and they argue before hiding the body at the side of the road. They drive to a mountain, where they set up camp with the [[Ribblehead Viaduct]] in sight, the final destination on their holiday. When a hailstorm forces them back inside the caravan, Chris falls asleep and Tina looks at his notebook, finding a drawing of her and Chris standing on the viaduct, about to jump.\n\nMartin arrives, with Banjo in the mini-caravan. While Chris is outside, Tina tries to seduce Martin, who is made uncomfortable by her advances and rejects her. When Chris returns, she tells him that Martin propositioned her in a particularly implausible and repulsive manner. Martin returns to his mini-caravan, and Chris and Tina have a fight over whether the dog should be called by the name \"Poppy\" or \"Banjo\". Upset, Tina pushes Martin's mini-caravan off the cliff, with him still in it. She re-enters their caravan and tells Chris that the problem is over. He runs outside, and finds Martin's dead body. He insults Tina and they fight, which ends in them having sex.\n\nChris sets the caravan on fire and kisses Tina. They run to the Ribblehead Viaduct and climb to the top, holding hands. Chris asks Tina if she enjoyed the holiday and she says it was brilliant. He apologises for insulting her and asks if she really wants to kill herself. Just as Chris steps off the viaduct, Tina lets go of his hand, watching as he falls to the ground and dies. Tina stares at her hand as the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Steve Oram]] as Chris\n*[[Alice Lowe]] as Tina\n*[[Eileen Davies]] as Carol\n\n==Production==\nThe characters came together seven years before the film came as a stage experience with Lowe and Oram appearing as innocent campers who slowly revealed they were serial killers. A short film was later produced and was sent to several production companies, however despite being found to be funny, the pitch kept getting turned down for being too dark. They put the short online, and it generated some buzz, and Lowe sent the link to [[Edgar Wright]], with whom she had worked on ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. Wright saw potential for a feature and put them in touch with a production company, Big Talk, who, with Wright on board as an executive producer, greenlit the project. Lowe and Oram did research into horror literature and even took a caravanning holiday, in character and with a cameraman, to the locations that would go on to be featured in the film.<ref name=loweint>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Godfrey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/23/alice-lowe-sightseers |title=Sightseers: Alice Lowe and the secret terrors of caravanning |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]] |date=23 November 2012 |access-date=2 December 2012 }}</ref> Ben Wheatley has said that all the locations were very helpful, even after they explained the nature of the film, because they \"tried to make sure that it was open and fair to places, and that they weren\u2019t the butt of jokes.\"<ref name=wheatleyint>{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Brew |url=https://denofgeek.com/movies/23626/ben-wheatley-interview-sightseers-freakshift-a-field-in-england |title=Ben Wheatley interview: Sightseers, Freakshift, A Field In England |work=Den of Geek |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |date=29 November 2012 |access-date=2 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe two were also inspired by ''[[Withnail and I]]''.<ref name=loweint />\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception has been positive; [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 85% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 7.39/10.
