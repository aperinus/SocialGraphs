It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period.\n\nThe film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|1956 film using the same name]] featuring a significantly different plot and script with some modifications. The second film featured [[James Stewart]] and [[Doris Day]], and was made for [[Paramount Pictures]]. The two films are very similar in tone. In the book-length interview ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'' (1967), in response to filmmaker [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, \"Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\" However, it has been said this statement cannot be taken at face value.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-man-who-knew-too-much-1934|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)|date=19 November 2019|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref><ref name=S&S>{{cite web|last=Coe|first=Jonathan|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/195|work=Sight and Sound|publisher=BFI|access-date=November 28, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108225149/http://www.bfi.org.uk:80/sightandsound/review/195/|archive-date=8 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC&pg=PA94|title=Hitchcock|isbn=9780671604295|last1=Truffaut|first1=Francois|last2=Hitchcock|first2=Alfred|last3=Scott|first3=Helen G.|year=1984}}</ref>\n\nThe 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s 1922 [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (book)|book of the same name]]. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/><ref name=making/>\n\n==Synopsis==\nBob and Jill Lawrence, a British couple on a trip to [[Switzerland]] with their daughter Betty, befriend Frenchman Louis Bernard, who is staying at their hotel. Jill is participating in a [[Skeet shooting|clay pigeon shooting]] contest. She reaches the final but loses to a male sharpshooter, Ramon Levine, because at the crucial moment she is distracted by a chiming watch belonging to Abbott.\n\nThat evening, Louis is shot as Jill dances with him. Before he dies, he tells Jill where to find a note intended for the British [[Consul (representative)|consul]]; she in turn tells Bob. Bob reads the note, which warns of a planned international crime.\nThe criminals involved in the shooting kidnap Betty, and threaten to kill her if her parents tell anyone what they know. Unable to seek help from the police, Bob and Jill return to England, where they discover that the group, led by Abbott, have hired Ramon to shoot a European head of state during a concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Jill attends the concert and throws Ramon's aim off by screaming at the crucial moment.\n\nThe criminals return to their lair behind the temple of a [[Sun cult|sun-worshipping]] cult. Bob had entered the temple searching for Betty, and both are being held prisoner in the adjoining house. The police surround the building and a gunfight ensues. The criminals hold out until their ammunition runs low and most of them have been killed.\n\nBetty climbs up to the roof, fleeing from Ramon, who follows her. A police marksman dares not shoot at him because Betty is so close. Jill grabs the rifle and shoots Ramon, who falls off the roof.\nThe police storm the building. Abbott, the criminal mastermind, is hiding inside but he is betrayed by the chiming of his watch. He shoots himself (as shown by the gunshot smoke) and dies. Betty is reunited with her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Leslie Banks]] as Bob Lawrence\n* [[Edna Best]] as Jill Lawrence\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Abbott\n* [[Frank Vosper]] as Ramon Levine\n* [[Hugh Wakefield]] as Clive\n* [[Nova Pilbeam]] as Betty Lawrence\n* [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Louis Bernard\n* [[Cicely Oates]] as Nurse Agnes\n* [[D.

The deal for an adaptation fell through, and the frame of the plot was reused in the script for ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'', the title itself taken from an unrelated [[G.K. Chesterton]] compilation.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/><ref name=making>\"The Making of The Man Who Knew Too Much\", ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) DVD</ref>\n\nThe story is credited to Bennett and [[D. B. Wyndham Lewis]]. Bennett claimed that Lewis had been hired to write some dialogue that was never used and provided none of the story, though this account has been disputed.<ref>Pat McGilligan, \"Charles Bennett\", ''Backstory 1'', p25</ref><ref name=HitchcockGuide/>\n\nIt was [[Peter Lorre]]'s second English-language film, following the [[multiple-language version]] of ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931). But he was still unable to speak English, having only recently fled [[Nazi Germany]], and learned his lines phonetically.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/multiple-language-version-film-collectors-guide-part-2#m-1931|title=Multiple-Language Version Film Collectors' Guide: M (1931)|date=4 August 2015|publisher=Brenton Film}}</ref><ref name=HitchcockGuide/>\n\nThe shoot-out at the end of the film was based on the [[Sidney Street Siege]], a real-life incident that took place in London's East End (where Hitchcock grew up) on 3 January 1911.<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/72778.html TimeOut Review: \"shootout re-enacting the Sidney Street siege\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/437970/index.html |website= Screenonline.org |title= Review |quote= modelled on the notorious Sidney Street siege of 1911}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much_1934/ |website= Britmovie.co.uk |title= Review |quote= based on the Sidney street siege}}</ref> The shoot-out was not included in Hitchcock's [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|1956 remake]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=104984&mainArticleId=201941 TCM.com]</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired Australian composer [[Arthur Benjamin]] to write a piece of music especially for the set piece at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The music, known as the ''[[Storm Clouds Cantata]]'', is used in both the 1934 version and the 1956 remake.<ref name=HitchcockGuide/>\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] appears 33 minutes into the film.
