A [[sequel]] to ''[[Goon (film)|Goon]]'' (2011), the film stars [[Seann William Scott]], Baruchel, [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Alison Pill]],  [[Elisha Cuthbert]], [[Wyatt Russell]], [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]] and [[Kim Coates]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]] on June 22, 2015. The film was released in Canada on March 17, 2017, and on September 1, 2017, in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goon: Last of the Enforcers|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movie/goon-last-of-the-enforcers-2017|website=ComingSoon.net|publisher=[[Crave Online]]|access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring an [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt's ([[Seann William Scott]]) [[minor-league]] team, the Halifax Highlanders, receive media focus. Their owner, Hyrum Cain ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), seeks to capitalize on the attention. For the opening game, Doug is made [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]], but loses a [[Fighting in ice hockey|fight]] with the rival team's [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]], Anders Cain ([[Wyatt Russell]]), the son of the Highlanders' owner. Badly injured, Doug retires to a more stable job as an [[insurance]] salesman, while he and his [[pregnant]] wife Eva make preparations for their child. Without Doug, the Highlanders embark on a long losing streak which prompts the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Doug finds no joy in his new job, and tries to find a way back into hockey. His old rival, Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea, convinces him to join him in a hockey fighting league, where he could find a way back into the game. He wins a ten-man battle royale, watched by Hyrum. Meanwhile, Anders does not perform well for the Highlanders, and eventually gets suspended for violence. Hyrum adds Doug back to the roster, as competition for his son. Before Doug's first game back, Eva makes him promise not to fight, for the sake of their future child. Doug reluctantly agrees, and the team goes on a winning streak, but when Anders returns from suspension, he goads Doug into being more aggressive. Doug and Anders interrupt a game during a dispute, and they are both suspended for the next game. During the game's afterparty, Anders provokes Doug into a fight, and when Eva sees that Doug has been fighting again, she kicks him out of the house.\n\nMeanwhile, the Highlanders must win the last two games of the season to sneak into the playoffs. Hyrum signs Ross, at the expense of firing Anders. While Ross helps the Highlanders to win the first of their last two games, Eva goes into labor, and Doug reconciles with her as they head to the hospital. After having her baby, Eva realizes that the same drive that led Doug to be with her during the birth, is the same drive that pushes him to want to defend his teammates on the ice, and she gives Doug her blessing to continue fighting. Having been kicked off the team, Anders rejoins his old team, who will play the Highlanders in the last game of the season with a playoff spot on the line. Anders gravely injures Ross, and Doug enters the rink in retaliation.\n\nDoug beats Anders, but when showing mercy at the end of the fight, Anders vengefully threatens Doug, claiming that he will never stop coming for him until they end up like Ross, being carried out on stretchers. Realizing that his new family is more important to him than hockey, Doug uses his weakened right arm to level Anders in the face just as he was about to strike again, throwing his arm out and being helped off the ice. Hyrum rushes to his son's aid, where Anders tells him that he hates hockey, and the two appear to mend things between them. Having been told earlier that further injury to his right arm would be career-ending, Doug realizes that his hockey days are behind him. He watches as the Highlanders win the game in the final seconds, and during the celebration, he sets his stick down and goes home.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, a female reporter talks about the Hockey Story. Doug doesn't know if he's a [[Wayne Gretsky|Gretzky]] and steals her [[microphone]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Eva Glatt, Glatt's love interest, now married to Glatt<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Anders Cain, a volatile young captain of the Halifax Highlanders<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]] as Xavier LaFlamme<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Ronnie Hortense, Highlanders coach<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as \"Pat\" Patrick Hooolihan<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Mary, Eva's outlandish sister<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]], as Hyrum Cain, Highlanders owner and father of Anders<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" />\n* [[Jonathan Cherry]] as Goalie Marco \"Belchie\" Belchior\n* Trent Pardy as Stevenson\n* Karl Graboshas as Oleg Yakovlena\n* George Tchortov as Evgeni Yakovlena\n* [[Richard Clarkin]] as Gord Ogilvey\n* [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] as Bob Forbes\n* [[T.J.
