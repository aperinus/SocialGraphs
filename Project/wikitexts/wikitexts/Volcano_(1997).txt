Moritz]] and Andrew Z. Davis. The film stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Anne Heche]], [[Don Cheadle]], and [[Keith David]] and tells the story of an effort to divert the path of a dangerous [[Lava|lava flow]] through the streets of [[Los Angeles]] following the formation of a [[volcano]] at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray, and was inspired by the 1943 formation of the [[Par\u00edcutin]] volcano in Mexico.\n\n''Volcano'' was released by [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] in the United States on April 25, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $122 million worldwide on a $90 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn downtown [[Los Angeles]], an [[earthquake]] strikes. Mike Roark, the new director of the city's [[Office of Emergency Management]], insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis even though he has been on vacation with his daughter Kelly. His associate Emmit Reese notes that the quake caused no major damage, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at [[MacArthur Park]].\n\nAs a precaution, Mike tries to halt the [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|subway lines]] near the location of the earthquake. [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] Chairman Stan Olber opposes, believing that there is no threat to the trains. Seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes believes that a volcano may be forming beneath the city; however, she has insufficient evidence to make Mike take action.<ref name=\"film\">[[Mick Jackson (director)|Jackson, Mick]] (Director). (1997). ''Volcano'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[20th Century Fox]].</ref>\n\nThe next morning, Amy and her assistant Rachel venture in the storm sewer to investigate. While they take samples, another earthquake strikes at a stronger pace. Rachel falls into a crack that is later engulfed by a rush of hot gases, being swallowed down under to death. A subway train derails underground, and a power outage occurs across the city. In the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], volcanic smoke and ash billow out, followed by [[Volcanic bomb|lava bombs]] that ignite several buildings and cause a [[fire truck]] to flip onto its side.\n\nAs Mike helps injured [[firefighter]]s out of the area, a newly-formed underground volcano erupts from the tar pits and [[lava]] begins to flow down [[Wilshire Boulevard]]. The lava incinerates everything in its path and kills two firefighters in the downed fire truck. The Roarks become separated, as Kelly is injured when a lava bomb burns her leg. \n \nIn the [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] metro tunnel, the passengers in the derailed subway train are rendered unconscious by severe heat and toxic gases, whilst the driver was unable to open the doors. Meanwhile, Stan leads his team through the tunnel to the derailed train to search for survivors. They manage to save everyone, and Stan finds the unconscious train driver just as lava reaches the train and begins to flow underneath it. With the train disintegrating, Stan chooses to sacrifice himself to save the driver and jumps into the lava to be able to throw him to safety. After throwing the driver to the team and saving his life, Stan is consumed and killed by the lava.\n\nMike, Amy, and [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] lieutenant Ed Fox devise a plan to use [[Jersey barrier|concrete barriers]] to create a [[Dead end (street)|blockade]], which obstructs the lava in its path. A fleet of helicopters dump water collected from the ocean to subdue the lava and volcano, forming a crust and making the plan a success. However, Amy later theorizes that the magma is still flowing underground through the Red Line subway extension and calculates that the main eruption will occur at the end of the Red Line at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. After calculating the speed of the flowing lava, Amy and Mike realize that the lava will reach the end of the Red Line in thirty minutes.\n\nMike devises another plan to demolish a 22-story condominium building to block the lava's path from flowing towards the hospital and the rest of the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|West Side]]. The lava reaches the dead end of the subway tunnel extension and bursts out of the ground in a massive geyser. Two men sacrifice their lives to detonate the final explosive charge by giving the all-clear to ignite the charges. Mike then spots Kelly nearby, trying to retrieve Tommy, a little boy who wandered off; the two are in the direct path of the collapsing building. Mike barely manages to save them from being crushed as the building collapses. The plan succeeds, and the lava flows directly into the ocean. The Roarks and Tommy escape from the wreckage alive. In the aftermath, hundreds are dead, thousands are injured, and billions of dollars of damage is caused.\n\nIt starts to rain, the survivors heave a sigh of relief, and the Roarks catch a ride with Amy. The film ends with a view of the volcano and a graphic that reads \"Name: Mount Wilshire. Location: Los Angeles, California. Status: Active.\", accompanied by the opening of the [[Randy Newman]] song \"[[I Love L.A.]]\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Michael \"Mike\" Roark, the O.E.M. director.\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Amy Barnes, a geologist and seismologist from the California Institute of Geological Sciences\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Kelly Roark, the daughter of Michael.\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Emmit Reese, the O.E.M.'s assistant director\n* [[Keith David]] as Ed Fox, a lieutenant for the LAPD.\n* [[Jacqueline Kim]] as Dr. Jaye Calder, an emergency physician\n* [[John Corbett]] as Norman Calder, a businessman and Jaye's husband\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Gator Harris, a co-worker of Mike and Emmit.\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Stan Olber, the chairman of the Los Angeles MTA.\n* [[Dayton Callie]] as Roger Lapher, a supervisor for the Department of Water and Power (DWP)\n* [[Susie Essman]] as Anita, Kelly's babysitter\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Haskins\n* [[Valente Rodriguez]] as Train Driver<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120461/fullcredits/|title=Volcano (1997)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* [[Marcello Thedford]] as Kevin\n* [[Bert Kramer]] as Los Angeles Firefighters Chief\n* [[Bo Eason]] as Bud McVie\n* Laurie Lathem as Rachel\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nFilming was primarily on location in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxconnect.com/volcano.html |title=Volcano DVD |date=March 9, 1999 |access-date=July 14, 2010 |work=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Various filming sites included [[MacArthur Park]], [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].<ref name=\"DVD\" />  Extensive special effects surrounding certain aspects of the film such as the lava flow were created by ten separate digital effects companies including VIFX, Digital Magic Company, Light Matters Inc., Pixel Envy and Anatomorphex.<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\"/> An 80% full-size replica of Wilshire Boulevard, which was one of the largest sets ever constructed in the United States, was assembled in [[Torrance, California]].<ref name=\"McCarthy\" /> The [[computer-generated imagery]] was coordinated and supervised by Dale Ettema and Mat Beck.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Between visuals, miniatures, and animation, over 300 technicians were involved in the production aspects of the special effects.<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaultofculture.com/vault/towering/beverlyheights|title=Tower-ing Fiction #1: Beverly Heights apartment building, Volcano (1997)|website=The Vault of Culture|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe score for the film was originally composed and orchestrated by musical conductor [[Alan Silvestri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/154846/Volcano/credits |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102212826/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/154846/Volcano/credits |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |title=Volcano - Production Credits |access-date=July 14, 2010 }}</ref> Recording artists [[James Newton Howard]] and [[Dillinger (musician)|Dillinger]] among others, contributed songs to the music listing.<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800343248/cast |title=Volcano (1997) Cast and Credits |publisher=[[Yahoo!
