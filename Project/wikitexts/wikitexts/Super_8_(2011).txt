J. Abrams]] and co-produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The film stars [[Joel Courtney]], [[Elle Fanning]], and [[Kyle Chandler]] and tells the story of a group of young teenagers in 1979 who are filming their own [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] movie when a train derails, releasing a dangerous presence into their town. The film was shot in [[Weirton, West Virginia]], and surrounding areas, portraying the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio.\n\n''Super 8'' was released on June 10, 2011,<ref name=\"bom\"/> in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Abram's direction, its [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] elements, [[visual effects]], [[Film score|musical score]] and for the performances of the cast, in particular,  both Fanning and newcomer Courtney's acting was cited, while also being compared to such thematically similar films as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'', ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', and ''[[The Goonies]]'', featuring a darker interpretation of those iconic premises. ''Super 8'' was also a commercial success, grossing over $260 million against a $50 million budget. The film received several awards and nominations, primarily in technical and special effects categories, Giacchino's musical score, as well as for Courtney and Fanning's performances.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1979, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb and his 14-year-old son Joe, mourn wife and mother Elizabeth, killed in a workplace accident. Jack blames Louis Dainard, whose shift she was covering as he showed up drunk. Joe clings to her memory in the form of a locket.\n\nFour months later Joe's friend Charles is making a zombie movie for a [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] film competition. He enlists Joe's help along with friends Preston, Martin, and Cary, as well as Dainard's daughter, Alice. Though their fathers are opposed to their friendship, Joe and Alice become close.\n\nWhile filming at a train depot at midnight, a train approaches and a pickup truck rams the train head-on, derailing it and destroying the depot. The children are separated in the chaos. Joe sees the door of a train wagon violently thrown off. The kids regroup and find crates of strange white cubes amid the wreckage before discovering the truck driver to be their biology teacher Dr. Woodward. Gravely injured, he warns them at gunpoint to forget what they have seen. They flee, as a convoy from the local Air Force base, led by Col. Nelec, arrives. Nelec finds an empty super 8 film box.\n\nIn the following days the town experiences strange events; dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates, and electronic items are stolen. Jack approaches Nelec but Nelec arrests him. Nelec orders flamethrowers to start a wildfire as an excuse to evacuate the residents to the base. Joe and Charles watch their derailment footage and see that a large creature escaped the train. Nelec confronts Woodward in a military hospital, seeking information about the creature, but when Woodward rebukes him, Nelec has him killed.\n\nAlice's father tells Joe the creature has abducted her. Joe, Charles, Martin, and Cary persuade Jen, Charles' older sister, to flirt with Donny so he can get them into town to rescue Alice. Breaking into Dr. Woodward's trailer they find documents and a film from his time as a government researcher.\n\nThe film and tape recorder reveal that in 1958, the Air Force captured an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] when it crash-landed. They experimented on the alien, while withholding its space craft, composed of the strange white cubes, which allowed the craft to shape-shift. The alien had established a psychic connection with Woodward, convincing him to help it escape Earth, but Nelec sabotaged, discredited, and [[Military discharge|discharged]] Woodward. While the kids are watching Nelec captures them but the alien kills Nelec and the airmen, allowing the kids to escape. Jack escapes and agrees with Louis to put their differences aside to save their kids.\n\nThe military attacks the alien but their hardware goes haywire in its presence, resulting in significant collateral damage. Joe and Cary find a massive tunnel system under the town. The missing townfolk, including Alice, are hanging unconscious from the ceiling of a cavern. Here, the alien is creating a device, constructed from the missing electronics, and attached to the base of the water tower. Using firecrackers as a distraction, Joe frees Alice and the others. The alien grabs Joe, who quietly speaks to it. Establishing an emotional connection between the two of them, the alien allows them to return to the surface.\n\nEveryone watches as metal objects from the town are pulled to the top of the tower by an unknown force. The white cubes reassemble to create a spaceship and, as the alien enters it, the locket in Joe's pocket is drawn toward the tower. After a moment, he lets it go, completing the ship. As the ship rises into space, Joe takes Alice's hand.\n\nThe detective-zombie short film the children were making in Super 8 rolls runs at the end of the movie beside the credit roll. In it, Charles asks for his short film \"The Case\" to be picked for a local film festival before being attacked by Alice as a zombie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Joel Courtney]] as Joe Lamb\n*[[Elle Fanning]] as Alice Dainard\n*[[Riley Griffiths]] as Charles Kaznyk\n*[[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]] as Cary McCarthy\n*[[Gabriel Basso]] as Martin Read\n*[[Zach Mills]] as Preston Scott\n*[[Kyle Chandler]] as Deputy Jack Lamb\n*[[Ron Eldard]] as Louis Dainard\n*[[AJ Michalka]] as Jen Kaznyk\n*[[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Mr. Kaznyk\n*[[Jessica Tuck]] as Mrs. Kaznyk\n*[[Brett Rice]] as Sheriff Pruitt\n*[[Michael Giacchino]] as Deputy Crawford\n*[[Michael Hitchcock]] as Deputy Rosko\n*[[Jay Scully]] as Deputy Skadden\n*[[Noah Emmerich]] as Colonel Nelec\n*[[Richard T.

Abrams had the idea to start a film by showing a factory's \"Accident-Free\" sign long before he came up with the rest of the ideas for the film. ''Super 8'' was actually the combination of two ideas; one for a film about kids making their own movie during the 1970s, and another for a blockbuster alien invasion film. Abrams combined the ideas, worried that the former would not attract enough attendance.\n\nAbrams and Spielberg collaborated in a storytelling committee to come up with the story for the film.<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Shot by Shot Description of the SUPER 8 Teaser Trailer; Steven Spielberg Is Producing, J.J.

He conducted a national talent search in order to find the child actors to play each of the leading roles. Courtney (who was hoping to land a part in a commercial) was picked out of many boys because Abrams found something \"different\" in him. Riley Griffiths sent Abrams a tape of himself in order to land the part of Charles.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in [[Weirton, West Virginia]], from September 20, 2010, to December 16, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Super 8 Shooting Schedule for Weirton|publisher=Super 8 News|date=September 23, 2010|url=http://www.super8news.com/2010/09/23/super-8-shooting-schedule-for-weirton/|access-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> To promote the film, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] created a short video game segment and released it alongside the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[OS X|Mac]] versions of ''[[Portal 2]]''.<ref name=\"portal2\">{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Christopher|title=Portal 2 contains an 'interactive teaser' for JJ Abrams' Super 8|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/19/portal-2-contains-an-interactive-teaser-for-jj-abrams-super-8/|publisher=Engadget|access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAbrams' original plan was to film all of the sequences for the film-within-a-film, \"The Case\", in [[Super 8 film|Super-8]] using Pro8mm stock and cameras. However, this approach proved unsuccessful, as visual effects house [[Industrial Light & Magic|Industrial Light and Magic]] found it impossible to integrate CGI into the footage due to the format's graininess.

J. Abrams]]-produced film, ''Super 8'' was promoted through an extensive [[viral marketing]] campaign. The first trailer for the movie was attached to ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', released in May 2010. The trailer gave the premise of a section of [[Area 51]] being closed down in 1979 and its contents being transported by [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] to Ohio. A pickup truck drives into the oncoming train, derailing it, and one of the carriages is smashed open while a Super 8 camera films. Fans analyzing the trailer found a hidden message, \"Scariest Thing I Ever Saw\", contained in the final frames of the trailer. This led to a website, www.scariestthingieversaw.com, which simulated the interface of a [[PDP-11]] and contained various clues to the film's story-line; the computer was eventually revealed to belong to Josh Woodward, the son of Dr. Woodward, who is trying to find out what happened to his father. Another viral website, www.rocketpoppeteers.com, was also found, which like Slusho from ''Cloverfield'' plays no direct part in the film but is indirectly related. The official ''Super 8'' website also contained an \"editing room\" section, which asked users to find various clips from around the web and piece them together. When completed, the reel makes up the film found by the kids in Dr. Woodward's trailer, showing the ship disintegrating into individual white cubes, and the alien reaching through the window of its cage and snatching Dr. Woodward. The video game ''[[Portal 2]]'' contains an interactive trailer placing the player on board the train before it derails, and showing the carriage being smashed open and the roar of the alien within.<ref name=\"portal2\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on June 9, 2011, in Australia; June 10, 2011, in the United States; and August 5, 2011, in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super 8|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&country=00&id=super8.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> On June 8, Paramount also launched a \u201cSuper 8 Sneak Peek\u201d Twitter promotion, offering fans a chance to purchase tickets for an advance screening, taking place on June 9, 2011, in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|title=And the Super 8 Secret Is ...|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/super-8-secret/|access-date=October 25, 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=June 7, 2011}}</ref> The film opened at #1 in the U.S. Box Office for that weekend, grossing about $35 million.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on November 22, 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smith|first=Matthew|title=Super 8 Blu-ray (Updated)|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=7352|access-date=October 25, 2011|newspaper=Blu-ray.com|date=September 17, 2011}}</ref> The release was produced as a combo pack with a Digital Copy, including nine bonus features and fourteen deleted scenes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sarafin|first=Jarrod|title=Super 8 Blu-ray Date Set|url=http://www.mania.com/super-8-bluray-date-set_article_131069.html|access-date=October 25, 2011|newspaper=Mania|date=September 15, 2011}}</ref> A 4K Blu-Ray edition was released on its tenth anniversary (May 24, 2021).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Squires|first=John|date=2021-02-26|title='Super 8' is Coming to 4K Ultra HD for the Film's 10th Anniversary in May|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3653879/super-8-coming-4k-ultra-hd-films-10th-anniversary-may/|access-date=2021-04-16|website=Bloody Disgusting!|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Super 8'' had a production budget of [[United States dollar|$]]50 million.
