The film parallels the true story of a Chicago reporter who proved that a man jailed for murder was wrongly convicted 11 years before. [[James Stewart]] stars as the persistent journalist and [[Richard Conte]] plays the imprisoned Frank Wiecek. Wiecek is based on [[Majczek and Marcinkiewicz|Joseph Majczek]], who was wrongly convicted of the murder of a Chicago policeman in 1932, one of the worst years of [[organized crime]] during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Annex - Stewart, James (Call Northside 777) 01.jpg|left|thumb|James Stewart in ''Call Northside 777'' (1948)]]\nIn Chicago in 1932, during Prohibition, a policeman is murdered inside a [[speakeasy]]. Frank Wiecek ([[Richard Conte]]) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a $5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer.\n\nThis leads the city editor of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|Chicago Times]]'', Brian Kelly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]), to assign reporter P.J. McNeal ([[James Stewart]]) to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration. Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false. In actuality, innocence was determined not as claimed in the film but when it was found out that the prosecution had suppressed the fact that the main witness had initially declared that she could not identify the two men involved in the police shooting.<ref>\"[[Majczek and Marcinkiewicz|J.

Fox had obtained the necessary legal clearances from the persons involved in the story and had dispatched [[Otto Lang (film producer)|Otto Lang]], producer, and Leonard Hoffman, writer, to Chicago to gather material for the film. Eventually, [[Quentin Reynolds]] and Jay Dratler joined Hoffman in writing the script.\n\nCasting the film proved complex. According to a March 7 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Twentieth Century-Fox had named [[Henry Fonda]] to play the newspaper reporter in ''Call Northside 777'', which would precede ''Chicken Every Sunday'' and ''Lone Star Preacher'' on Fonda's schedule. However, after a month, another report pointed out that Fox had named Fonda for a leading role in the screen adaptation of [[Elizabeth Janeway]]'s novel, ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'', which necessitated Fonda's replacement in ''Call Northside 777''. Two months later, another report said that Twentieth Century-Fox was \"negotiating for the services of James Stewart for the leading role in ''Call Northside 777''.\" [[Lloyd Nolan]] was originally named to play the role of Brian Kelly, but Lee J. Cobb replaced him in the end. [[Leopoldine Konstantin]] was originally scheduled to play the wrongly convicted man's mother, but in the end the role went to Kasia Orzazewski.\n\nThis was the first Hollywood feature film to be shot on location in Chicago.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Views of the [[Merchandise Mart]] as well as [[Holy Trinity Polish Mission]] can be seen throughout the film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews when it was first released, and again when it was released on DVD in 2004. In 2004, the ''Onion AV Club Review'' argued that the film may not be a true [[film noir]], but is good nonetheless: \"Outstanding location shooting and Stewart's driven performance turn a sober film into a vibrant, exciting one, even though the hero and the jailbird he champions are really too noble for noir.\"<ref>[http://avclub.com/content/node/8955 Murray, Noel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311000918/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/8955 |date=2007-03-11 }}.
