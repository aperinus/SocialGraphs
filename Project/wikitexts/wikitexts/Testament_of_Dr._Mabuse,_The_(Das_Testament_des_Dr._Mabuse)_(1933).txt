The movie is a sequel to Lang's [[silent film]] ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) and features many cast and crew members from Lang's previous films. Dr. Mabuse ([[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]]) is in an insane asylum where he is found frantically writing his crime plans. When Mabuse's criminal plans begin to be implemented, Inspector Lohmann ([[Otto Wernicke]]) tries to find the solution with clues from gangster Thomas Kent ([[Gustav Diessl]]), the institutionalized Hofmeister ([[Karl Meixner]]) and Professor Baum ([[Oscar Beregi Sr.]]) who becomes obsessed with Dr. Mabuse.\n\n''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' was based on elements of author [[Norbert Jacques]]' unfinished novel ''Mabuse's Colony''. It was Lang's second [[sound film]] for [[Nero-Film]] and was his final collaboration with screenwriter [[Thea von Harbou]], then his wife. To promote the film to a foreign market, a [[French-language]] version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title ''Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse''.\n\nAccording to [[Siegfried Kracauer]], Lang deliberately intended the film to suggest the Mabuse-like qualities of [[Adolf Hitler]],{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=84}} who was on his rise to become Chancellor of Germany while the film was being written.  When Hitler came to power, [[Joseph Goebbels]] became Minister of Propaganda and banned the film in Germany, suggesting that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French-language and German-language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1960) was also directed by Lang. Critics have received the film favorably, and it has influenced filmmakers such as [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Artur Brauner]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a noisy print shop, a disgraced police detective named Hofmeister ([[Karl Meixner]]) escapes from pursuing criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann ([[Otto Wernicke]]) and explains frantically that he has discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose the identity of the responsible criminal, the lights go out, shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at the asylum run by Professor Baum ([[Oscar Beregi Sr.]]).\n\nProfessor Baum introduces the case of Dr. Mabuse ([[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]]), the criminal mastermind and hypnotist who ten years earlier went mad. Mabuse spends his days frantically writing detailed plans for crimes while a criminal gang is committing them according to \"the plans of the Doctor\", with whom they confer only from behind a curtain. When Baum's colleague Dr. Kramm ([[Theodor Loos]]) by chance discovers that recent crimes implement Mabuse's writings, Kramm is shot by the gang's execution squad, Hardy ([[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]]) and Bredow (Oskar H\u00f6cker). A clue scratched in a glass window pane at Hofmeister's crime scene causes Lohmann to suspect Mabuse. On arrival at the asylum, Baum reveals that Mabuse has died. When Lohmann disparagingly talks about \"Mabuse the criminal\", Baum emphatically speaks about \"Mabuse the genius\", whose brilliance would have destroyed a corrupt world.\n\nBaum continues to study Mabuse's writings and communes with the ghost of Dr. Mabuse. The spirit of Mabuse speaks about an \"unlimited reign of crime\" and merges with the Professor's silhouette. During the same night, a hidden figure confers with sections of his organisation, preparing various crimes such as an attack on a chemical plant, robbing a bank, counterfeiting, poisoning water and destroying harvests. One of the gang members, Thomas Kent ([[Gustav Diessl]]), is conflicted between his criminal work, which he needs to do for money, and his affection for a young woman named Lilli ([[Wera Liessem]]). Lilli, devoted to Kent, begs him to confide in her. Kent finally confesses his past and his current situation to her. The two decide to inform the police but are abducted and locked in the strange meeting room with the curtain. The hidden figure announces their death when they discover that the curtained alcove contains only a loudspeaker and that there is a time bomb. After several escape attempts have failed, they flood the place to lessen the impact of the explosion and break free when the time bomb goes off.\n\nMeanwhile, the police are besieging a flat where several gangsters, including Hardy and Bredow, are staying. After a shootout, Hardy commits suicide while the other gangsters surrender. As Bredow testifies that they assassinated Dr. Kramm in the vicinity of the asylum, Lohmann arranges a confrontation between the gangsters and the Professor, which proves inconclusive. On Kent and Lilli's arrival, Baum's shocked reaction to Kent makes Lohmann suspicious. Lohmann and Kent visit the asylum, where they discover that Baum is the mastermind and has planned an attack on a chemical plant that night.  Lohmann and Kent go to the exploding plant, where they discover Baum watching from afar. Baum flees to the asylum with Lohmann and Kent pursuing. Mabuse's spirit leads Baum to Hofmeister in his cell where he introduces himself as Dr. Mabuse, ending Hofmeister's shock. Baum tries to kill Hofmeister but is stopped by guards, just as Lohmann and Kent arrive. The final scene shows the insane Baum in the cell, tearing Mabuse's writings to shreds.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]] as Dr. Mabuse\n* [[Otto Wernicke]] as Inspector Lohmann\n* [[Karl Meixner]] as Detective Hofmeister\n* [[Oscar Beregi (actor, born 1876)|Oscar Beregi Sr.]] as Professor Baum\n* [[Theodor Loos]] as Dr. Kramm\n* [[Gustav Diessl]] as Thomas Kent\n* [[Wera Liessem]] as Lilli\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler]] as Hardy\n* Oskar H\u00f6cker as Bredow\n* [[Theo Lingen]] as Karetzki\n* [[Hadrian Maria Netto]] as Nicolai Griforiew\n* [[Camilla Spira]] as Juwelen-Anna\n* [[Georg John]] as Baum's servant\n* [[Klaus Pohl (actor)|Klaus Pohl]] as M\u00fcller, Lohmann's assistant\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* Wernicke reprises the character Inspector Lohman, a role he first played a year earlier in Lang's film, ''[[M (1931 film)|M]].''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staedeli |first1=Thomas |title=Portrait of the actor Otto Wernicke|url=http://www.cyranos.ch/smwern-e.htm |website=Cyranos.ch |access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Norbert Jacques]] wrote the original [[Dr. Mabuse]] books in the style of other popular thrillers in Europe at the time, such as [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]], [[Fantomas]], and [[Fu Manchu]]. Jacques expanded the traits of these books to include critiques on [[Weimar Germany]]. In 1930, Jacques was approached by a film producer to develop a story for a new Dr. Mabuse film with a female villain. This caused Jacques to start writing a new novel called ''Mabuse's Colony''. In the novel, a character named Frau Kristine obtains a copy of Mabuse's testament which outlines plans for a future world of terrorism and crime that she uses.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" />\n\nAt this time, Lang and his wife [[Thea von Harbou]] were developing the film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Von Harbou and Lang were friends with Jacques since creating the first Mabuse film ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'', and they went on vacation with each other. Lang asked Jacques for help with the screenplay for ''M'' and asked for suggestions for a new Mabuse project.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" /> Jacques sent Lang his unfinished work for ''Mabuse's Colony''. Lang used the idea of Mabuse's will from the story and began working on an outline to what would become ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse''.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" />\n\nUsing the outline that Lang proposed, Jacques signed a contract in July 1931 for the movie to be written by von Harbou and directed by Lang based on Lang's own outline.<ref name=\"Kalat80\">Kalat, 2005. p. 80</ref> The film was released in tandem with Jacques's book. Jacques' contributions are not mentioned in the film. ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' is a direct sequel to ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'' and is related to the film ''M'' which features the Inspector Lohmann character.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\">{{cite AV media\n |people     = Kalat, David\n |date      = 2004\n |title      = DVD Commentary\n |url        = http://www.criterion.com/films/721\n |medium     = DVD\n |publisher  = The Criterion Collection\n |location   = New York City, United States\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n\nMany members of the cast and crew had worked with Lang on his earlier films. [[Rudolf Klein-Rogge]] returned to play Dr. Mabuse as he did in ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''.

[[Klaus Pohl (actor)|Klaus Pohl]] plays Lohmann's assistant M\u00fcller. Pohl acted in Lang's ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' and in an uncredited role in ''M''.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" />\n\n''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' was Lang's second film for the company [[Nero-Film]] and producer [[Seymour Nebenzal]]. The film would be the last film collaboration between Lang and his wife [[Thea von Harbou]], who had worked with Lang on all his directorial efforts since ''Destiny''. Lang's relationship with von Harbou was ending and the two would file divorce papers during 1933.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" /> Cinematographer [[Fritz Arno Wagner]] returned to work with Lang.

After the film's release, director Fritz Lang felt these supernatural scenes should not have been included.]]\n<!--production or filming: actual filming \u2013 dates and places, important artistic decisions, and noteworthy events (delays, re-shoots, financial problems, etc.) -->\nLang filmed ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' at the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene, during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer [[Fritz Arno Wagner]] stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" /> The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes.{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=81}}\n\nWagner filmed the explosion scenes at the factory [[Location shooting|on location]] during nighttime. These explosion scenes were the first scenes of the film to be filmed before returning to the studio to film the rest of the film. The film crew had three weeks to prepare for the factory scene by clearing trees and bringing in some artificial trees to match Lang's idea for the scene. The explosion was triggered by Lang himself.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" />\n\nDuring the early years of sound films before [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]], one way to present a film to a foreign audience was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time-consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer [[Seymour Nebenzal]] felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse''.<ref name=\"KalatTF\" /> The French-language screenplay was adapted by Ren\u00e9 Sti.{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=297}} Lang was fluent in [[French language|French]] and directed ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' in both French and [[German language|German]]. Actor [[Karl Meixner]] played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed.<ref name=\"KalatTF\">{{cite AV media\n |people     = Kalat, David\n |date       = 2004\n |title      = The Three Faces of Dr. Mabuse\n |url        = http://www.criterion.com/films/721\n |medium     = DVD\n |publisher  = The Criterion Collection\n |location   = New York City, United States\n}}</ref> The French version, titled ''Le Testament du docteur Mabuse'', was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=70}}\n\n=== Post-production ===\n<!--post-production: completion of special effects, musical scoring and sound, and editing-->\nFor the film, Lang commissioned a composer for the first time. [[Hans Erdmann]] created the opening theme and the music played during Professor Baum's madness. The soundtrack in the film is deceptive.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" /> As in Lang's ''M'', the film's music and sound are a subtle mix of actual silence with accompanying music and more or less realistic sound effects.{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2008|p=101}} Lang worked with his editor [[Conrad von Molo]] directly on the post-production process. Lang was known for making very long films and to suit foreign fashions, editor Lothar Wolff was contracted to shorten the French-language version. This version deletes parts from the romantic sub-plot between Lilli and Kent.<ref name=\"KalatTF\" />\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1968-101-20A, Joseph Goebbels.jpg|167px|thumb|left|[[Joseph Goebbels]] (pictured) withheld the release of ''Testament of Dr. Mabuse'', stating that the film \"showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence\".{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=76}}]]\nThe film was scheduled for release on March 24, 1933, at the [[UFA-Palast am Zoo]], the same theater that hosted the original premiere of ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'' in 1922. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power at the end of January 1933, and on March 14 he established the new [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] headed by [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Lang had not finished editing the film, and would not have a print for Goebbels to view until March 23. After a screening for Goebbels, he declared that the premiere would be delayed for technical reasons.<ref name=\"KalatDVD\" /> Goebbels hosted a meeting at his home between himself, Lang and several other German filmmakers on discussions on what films would be permitted by [[Nazi]] censorship. Goebbels referred to Lang's films as the style that Hitler wanted for Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=34-35}}\n\nBy March 30, the Ministry of Propaganda banned ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse'' as a menace to public health and safety. Goebbels stated that he would not accept the film as it \"showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence\".{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=76}} During the 1940s, Lang stated that a meeting occurred between Goebbels and himself, in which, in particular, Goebbels expressed his admiration for Lang's 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. Goebbels expressed the desire for Lang to work for him to create films for the Nazis. This offer caused Lang to leave Germany to France that very night.

Slogans and doctrines of the Third Reich have been put into the mouths of criminals in the film. Thus I hoped to expose the masked Nazi theory of the necessity to deliberately destroy everything which is precious to a people. ... Then, when everything collapsed and they were thrown into utter despair, they would try to find help in the 'New order.'{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=248-250}}</blockquote>\n\nGerman cultural critic [[Siegfried Kracauer]], in his book ''[[From Caligari to Hitler]]'' (1947), commented that Lang's comment \"smacks of hindsight,\" but his own analysis of the film indicates that it \"foreshadows Nazi practices,\" and retroactively reveals ''Dr. Mabuse the Gambler'', Lang's first Mabuse film, to be \"one of those deep-rooted premonitions which spread over the German post[-World War I] screen.\"  Still, despite the Nazi ban of the film, Kracauer is dubious that the average German film-goer would have seen the analogy between Baum/Mabuse's elaborate criminal organization and the Nazis.{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=248-250}}{{sfn|Kracauer|1947|p=84}}\n\n=== Reception ===\nIn 1938, Goebbels wrote that on looking at the film that he was \"struck by the dullness of its portrayal, the coarseness of its construction, and the inadequacy of its acting.\" Despite Goebbels' statement, he would present the film uncensored from time to time in private screening rooms for close personal friends.{{sfn|Kalat|2005|p=78}} On the French release, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"It is the French version of Fritz Lang's production, \"Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse\" (\"Dr. Mabuse's Will\").

Nevertheless, he goes on the describe several sequences in the film which illustrate Lang's \"'uncanny genius for evoking terror out of the simplest things.'\"  He also finds fault with the lack of any strong positive character the audience can identify with, since the police captain who destroys the criminal organization is a colorless bureaucratic official whose \"victory lacks moral significance\".  If any in the film's audience was aware of any allegorical connection between the criminals and the Nazis, there is no-one for them to turn to as an alternative to the Nazis. \"As so often with Lang,\" Kracauer writes, \"the law triumphs and the lawless glitters.
