The first film in the [[Home Alone (franchise)|''Home Alone'' franchise]], the film stars [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, a boy who defends his suburban [[Chicago]] home from burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris.\n\nHughes conceived ''Home Alone'' while on vacation, with [[Warner Bros.]] being originally intended to finance and distribute the film. However, Warner Bros. shut down production after it exceeded its assigned budget. [[20th Century Fox]] assumed responsibilities following secret meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were hired soon afterwards. Filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across [[Illinois]].\n\n''Home Alone'' premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16, and it received positive reviews, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. ''Home Alone'' grossed $476.7&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy until the release of ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' (2011), and made Culkin a child star. Moreover, it was the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1990]], behind ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ventured.com/highest-grossing-movies-of-the-90s/|title=The 19 Highest-Grossing Movies Of The 90s}}</ref> It was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Culkin, and for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[John Williams]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\".

See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary detail to this section. -->\n\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend [[Christmas]] in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a Chicago [[Chicago metropolitan area|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings and cousins. Kevin inadvertently ruins the family dinner after a brief scuffle against his oldest brother Buzz, resulting in Kate sending him up to the attic. Kevin berates his mother for allowing the rest of the family to pick on him and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds create a power outage, disabling the alarm clocks and causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.\n\nKevin wakes to find the house empty. Thinking that his wish has come true, he is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. Later, Kevin becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, \"Old Man\" Marley, who is rumored by the local children to be a serial killer who murdered his own family. The McCallister home is soon [[Stalking|stalked]] by the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry Lyme and Marv Murchins, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to postpone their plans to rob the McCallister house.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked, and that the phone lines are still down back home. Peter and the rest of the family stay in his brother's apartment in Paris, while Kate manages to get a flight back to [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]]. She attempts to find a flight to Chicago, but all the flights are booked. Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to Chicago in a moving van.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Marv finally realize that only Kevin is in the McCallister home, and on [[Christmas Eve]], Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into the house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a choir perform, and encounters Marley. Marley proves the rumors about him are false, and points out his granddaughter in the choir; He has never met her, as she is the daughter of his estranged son. Kevin suggests to Marley that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nKevin returns home and rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While Harry and Marv pursue Kevin around the house, he calls the police and lures the duo into a neighboring house which they had previously broke into. Harry and Marv ambush Kevin and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses that they broke into due to Marv's destructive habit of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Kevin is initially disappointed to find that his family is still gone, although Kate arrives home and they reconcile. The rest of the family soon returns after waiting in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then watches Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Marley notices Kevin, and they wave to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short and hot-headed thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Marv\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall and dim-witted thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Harry\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Marley, Kevin's elderly neighbor\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Linnie, Kevin's older sister\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Uncle Frank, Peter's rude, cruel, cantankerous, cheap, and selfish older brother\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister who seems to be the friendliest of his siblings.\n* [[John Candy]] as Gus Polinski, a polka musician who helps Kate\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Officer Balzak\n* [[Michael C.
