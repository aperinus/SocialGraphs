[[Tom Berenger]], [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] and [[Carla Gugino]] also appear. ''Faster'' was released on November 24, 2010, and grossed $35 million against production budget of $24 million.\n\n==Plot==\nOn leaving prison James \"Jimmy\" Cullen retrieves his 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], a gun, and a list of names before heading to an office in [[Bakersfield, California]] and killing a man. He then visits Roy Grone, who gave him the car and gun, and forces him to give him more names. Meanwhile, Cullen is tracked by detectives Cicero and Humphries; a [[hitman]] known as \u201cKiller\u201d is also hired to kill Cullen.\n\nCullen locates the second person on his list, Kenneth Tyson, who films his own personal [[snuff film]]s. After finding and killing Tyson, Cullen gets into a gunfight with Killer in the hallway, but manages to escape. This affects Killer philosophically, and, after proposing to his girlfriend, begins to take the task personally. Humphries and Cicero investigate Cullen\u2019s past and discover he was double-crossed during a robbery. Cicero remembers him from a video of his older half-brother Gary's death filmed by Tyson, which depicts an unidentified man shooting Cullen in the head; he narrowly survives, and has a metal plate surgically implanted in his skull.\n\nCullen visits his former girlfriend, who knows he is killing those involved in the video. After revealing that she aborted their unborn child and has begun a new life, she wishes him well. At a strip club in Nevada Cullen stabs bouncer Hovis Nixon for his role in Gary\u2019s death, but he manages to survive. Soon, both Humphries and Killer get word that Nixon is in the hospital. Knowing Cullen will go back to finish him off, they converge there.\n\nCullen enters the hospital and kills Nixon while he is in surgery. Humphries attempts to unsuccessfully bring down Cullen, but is spared when the latter sees his badge. While driving away from the hospital, Cullen encounters Killer where they get into a high-speed chase on the freeway, culminating in Killer shooting Cullen in the neck.\n\nEventually Cullen comes to believe that his father arranged to have him and Gary killed after they refused to share the money they stole in a bank robbery. However, Cullen finds out that his father died years before, and realises that it was Gary\u2019s girlfriend who sold them out. The last man on his list is a [[circuit preacher|traveling evangelist]] named Alexander Jerrod; after concluding his service, he is confronted by Cullen, but is spared after revealing that he has turned his life around and begging for forgiveness. Cullen is then confronted by Killer.\n\nCicero eventually learns the true identity of the man who shot Cullen, and she hurries to the church where Humphries is already on the scene. As Killer and Cullen confront each other, Humphries walks in and shoots Cullen in the head, revealing it was he who shot him in the video. He offers Killer the money for the job, but Killer declines, telling Humphries to never contact him again.\n\nHumphries calls his wife, who is revealed to have been his informant while she was still Gary's girlfriend. Suddenly, he is shot and killed by Cullen, who survived due to his metal plate. Cicero arrives on the scene after Cullen leaves, and she covers up Humphries\u2019 involvement.\n\nCullen scatters Gary's ashes in the sea and drives off into the sunset, while Killer returns home to his wife; simultaneously, Jerrod begins a sermon on forgiveness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Jimmy Cullen/Driver, a small-time criminal who avenges his brother's death.\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Detective Slade Humphries/Cop, a corrupt police detective responsible for the robbery and murder of Gary, Driver's brother.\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Detective Cicero, a police detective who works with Humphries.\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as Killer, a hit-man hired by Slade to kill Driver.\n* [[Maggie Grace]] as Lily, Killer's girlfriend.
