It starred [[Rene Russo]] as [[Gertrude Lintz|Mrs. Gertrude \"Trudy\" Lintz]] and [[Robbie Coltrane]] as her husband.\n\nThe film was based on the life of a [[gorilla]] called [[Massa (gorilla)|Massa]] with elements of Gertrude Lintz's other gorilla [[Gargantua (gorilla)|Gargantua]] (who was called \"Buddy\" at the time). In real life, Massa became the oldest gorilla on record until 2008, while Buddy/Gargantua died young as a circus attraction and his remains are now on display in a museum.\n\nThe [[gorilla suit]] used for Buddy was created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric millionaire [[Gertrude Lintz|Trudy]] is an animal lover who is not apologetic about it.\n\nTrudy takes her two newly arrived chimpanzees Joe and Maggie to the movies, causing lots of stares. Returning home to her grand estate, she greets her varied animals: kittens, horses, a cheeky talking green parrot, her prize-winning champion pack of [[briard]]s, a [[raccoon]], a [[porcupine]], a tortoise and a flock of geese.\n\nDr. Bill Lindz, Trudy's amiable husband, calls her to the phone. After the call she explains to Dick, their animal handler, he is solely in charge of the animals until the evening, and she drives off to Philadelphia.\n\nThere, finding a sickly baby gorilla, Trudy whisks him home, adding to their family. Bill determines that Buddy, as she names him, has severe pneumonia. Life resumes in the Lintz household, while Trudy plies him to take a bottle. The chimpanzees cause a mischievous ruckus in the kitchen, which she ends using a type of rattle that scares them.\n\nNot having luck finding information about gorillas, Trudy travels to see Professor Spatz, who claims knowledge of them from travel to Congo, but can give her no true insight. She marches home, determined to raise Buddy similarly to the chimpanzees, as her own son.\n\nBuddy finds life in the city very difficult to deal with. Trudy discovers that he, unlike the chimpanzees, dislikes baths. He doesn't like sharing Trudy either. As he grows he gets stronger, making him hard to control. The chimpanzees often get up to mischief, thanks to Maggie's skill at getting the key, unlocking their cages.\n\nA couple come to visit the mansion, the man convincing Trudy to bring the apes to show  in the [[Chicago]] [[World's fair]]. Bill tries to get her to leave Buddy at home, foreseeing problems. The chimpanzees, now there are a few more, are a great hit. However, naughty Maggie unlocks Buddy's cage. He has a particularly bad experience, as he gets disoriented. The noises, plethora of people and unfamiliar things unsettle him. The fair empties from fear of him.\n\nBuddy has constant flashbacks of the incident, leaving him traumatised and making things even harder for him at home. After he goes on an aggressive rampage, causing a lot of damage to their home, Trudy finally takes Buddy to an [[ape]] sanctuary to live among his own kind in peace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Gertrude \"Trudy\" Lintz\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Dr. Bill Lintz\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Dick Croner\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as Professor Spatz\n\n[[Dane Cook]] cameos as a cop at the Chicago World's fair. Buddy operated by [[Peter Elliott (British actor)|Peter Elliott]] (adult Buddy), Lynn Robertson Bruce (juvenile Buddy), Peter Hurst, Mark Sealey (toddler Buddy), [[Michelan Sisti]], [[Leif Tilden]], Star Townsend, Robert Tygner, and [[Mak Wilson]] (facial controls). Buddy's vocal effects provided by Hector C. Gika, Gary A. Hecker, and [[Frank Welker]].\n\n==Production notes==\n[[Rene Russo]] began rehearsals with the chimpanzees a month before principal photography even started.\n\nThe story is loosely based on a real life socialite from the 1920s who raised animals in her mansion to protest inhumane zoo conditions.<ref>{{cite web |date= October 1, 2005 |author= Steve Persall |title=HOLLYWOOD SAYS grow up! |url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1997/06/02/hollywood-says-grow-up/ |website=Tampa Bay Times }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 25% based on reviews from 20 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buddy (1997) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1078022-buddy |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2021-03-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it 2 out of 4, and wrote: \"One of the peculiarities of the film is the vast distance between the movie they've made and the movie they think they've made.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |date=June 6, 1997 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Buddy movie review & film summary (1997) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/buddy-1997 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a grade C+.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=June 6, 1997 |author=Owen Gleiberman |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |title=BUDDY |url=https://ew.com/article/1997/06/06/buddy-2/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>\n\nThe film was criticized for its unrealistic animatronics, especially when compared to the real ape performers.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=BUDDY |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/01/16/buddy/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Other response}}\nIn spite of the film's message, animal rights activists objected to the depiction of chimpanzees as docile pets, happily carrying on wearing human clothes. Among their concerns, was the perpetuation of the idea of chimps as acceptable pets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|60677|Buddy}}\n* {{IMDb title|0118787|Buddy}}\n* {{Amg title|155049|Buddy}}\n* {{Mojo title|buddy|Buddy}}\n\n{{The Jim Henson Company}}\n{{Caroline Thompson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buddy (film)}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American Zoetrope films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American docudrama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional gorillas]]\n[[Category:Films about apes]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Caroline Thompson]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:The Jim Henson Company films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Caroline Thompson]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
