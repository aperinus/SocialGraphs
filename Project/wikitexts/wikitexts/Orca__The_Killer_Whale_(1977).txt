Nolan's crew is currently looking for a [[great white shark]] for a local aquarium, but a marine biologist named Ken is targeted by the shark. An [[Killer whale|orca]] intervenes and kills the shark, saving Ken's life. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. Later while hunting with his crew, Nolan tries to capture what he believes to be a male orca, but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board, where she subsequently [[Miscarriage|miscarries]]. The captain hoses the dead fetus overboard as her mate looks on, screaming in anguish.\n\nSeeking release for his near-dead mate, the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members, Novak, cuts the female off the ship, but the male leaps up and drags him into the sea. The following day, the orca pushes his now-dead mate onto the shore. Al Swain, representative of the local fishermen's union, berates Nolan for his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility, but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca, as the whale's presence is causing the fish that are vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca terrorizes the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking pipelines, thus destroying the village's fuel reserves.\n\nRachel Bedford, a colleague of Ken's and a [[Cetology|cetologist]], shows Nolan how similar whales are to humans and tells him that, \"If he (the orca) is like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.\" Nolan confesses to Bedford that he empathizes with the whale, as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. Nolan promises Bedford that he will not fight the whale, but the orca attacks his seafront house where his injured crew member, Annie, is staying. The house starts slipping into the sea, and the whale bites Annie's left leg off. Nolan decides to fight the orca, but with Novak dead, and Annie maimed and unable to help, Nolan and Paul are now the only crew members left to take up pursuit. Bedford and Ken join the pursuit, along with Jacob Umilak, a [[Mi\u2019kmaq]] enlisted for his ancestral knowledge on orcas.\n\nThe crew begins to follow the whale after he signals Nolan to follow him. Ken (who was saved by the orca at the beginning of the film) is leaning over the side when the whale surfaces and grabs him with its jaws, killing him. They follow the whale until they reach the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], but when Paul starts to get into a lifeboat, the orca knocks Paul out of the boat and drowns him. The next day, the whale shoves an iceberg into the boat and starts to sink it. Nolan manages to harpoon the whale just as he and Bedford escape from the boat, but Umilak is crushed beneath an avalanche of ice just after sending out an [[SOS]].\n\nNolan and Bedford hide on an iceberg, although Nolan slips onto another. The orca separates the icebergs, trapping Nolan. The whale jumps onto the ice, causing it to tilt and sending Nolan into the water. The whale lifts Nolan up with his tail and throws him onto another iceberg, killing him, while Bedford looks on helplessly. With his revenge complete, the whale swims southward under the ice, while a helicopter is seen coming to rescue Bedford.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Harris]] as Captain Nolan\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Rachel Bedford\n* [[Will Sampson]] as Umilak\n* [[Bo Derek]] as Annie\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Novak\n* [[Robert Carradine]] as Ken\n* [[Peter Hooten]] as Paul\n* Scott Walker as Al Swain\n* [[Don \"Red\" Barry]] as Doc Worker\n* [[List of captive orcas#Yaka|Yaka]] and [[List of captive orcas#Nepo|Nepo]] as The Orca\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[Luciano Vincenzoni]] was first assigned to give the film a head start after being called by [[Dino de Laurentiis]] in the middle of the night in 1975. Upon admitting that he had watched the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', Vincenzoni was instructed by de Laurentiis to \"find a fish tougher and more terrible than the great white\". Having had little interest in sea life beforehand, Vincenzoni was directed to killer whales by his brother Adriano, who had a personal interest in zoology. Filming took place largely in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] during the fishing season. Most filming took place in the town of [[Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove|Petty Harbour]], about 15 kilometres south of the capital city, [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].\n\nThe main orcas used for filming were trained animals from [[Marineland of the Pacific]] and Marine World Africa ([[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]]), though artificial rubber whales were also used. These models were so lifelike that several animal rights activists blocked the trucks transporting them, confusing them for real orcas. The shark used early in the film was captured by noted shark hunter [[Ron Taylor (diver)|Ron Taylor]]. The scenery meant to represent a remote polar region of Labrador was fabricated in [[Malta]] by designer [[Mario Garbuglia]].<ref name=\"vincenzoni\">{{cite book|last=Vincenzoni|first=Luciano|year=2005|title=Pane e cinema: il racconto di una vita straordinaria consacrata al mondo del cinema|language=it|publisher=Gremese Editore|isbn=978-8884403919}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Vincenzoni, Richard Harris had begun to drink heavily on set after reading a tabloid magazine and seeing a photograph of his wife [[Ann Turkel]] on a beach with a younger man. He reportedly intended to stop performing and fly to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] in order to kill them, relenting only after getting into a brawl which resulted in Vincenzoni getting a black eye.<ref name=\"vincenzoni\"/> The 46-year-old Harris insisted on performing his own stunts in the polar sequences and was nearly killed on several occasions.<ref name=\"harris\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $3.5 million from 775 theatres in its opening weekend<ref>{{cite magazine|title=A Whale of a Weekend!
