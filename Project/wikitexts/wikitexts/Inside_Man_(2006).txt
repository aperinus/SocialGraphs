It centers on an elaborate bank heist on [[Wall Street]] over a 24-hour period. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]] as Detective Keith Frazier, the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s hostage negotiator, [[Clive Owen]] as Dalton Russell, the mastermind who orchestrates the heist, and [[Jodie Foster]] as Madeleine White, a Manhattan [[Power broker (politics)|power broker]] who becomes involved at the request of the bank's founder Arthur Case ([[Christopher Plummer]]) to keep something in his [[safe deposit box]] protected from the robbers.\n\nGewirtz spent five years developing the premise before working on what became his first original screenplay. After he completed the script in 2002, [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased it to be made by [[Universal Pictures]], with the former company's co-founder [[Ron Howard]] attached to direct. After Howard stepped down, his Imagine partner [[Brian Grazer]] began looking for a new director for the project and ultimately hired Lee. [[Principal photography]] began in June 2005 and concluded in August; filming took place on location in New York City.  ''Inside Man'' premiered in New York on March 20, 2006, before being released in the United States on March 24, 2006. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $184.4 million worldwide against its $45 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nA man identifying himself as Dalton Russell sits in a small, dark space he identifies as a cell. He proclaims he has committed the perfect bank robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name \"Steve\" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. \n\nThey divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don coveralls identical to their own, rotating them among various rooms and occasionally inserting themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms.\n\nPolice surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of negotiations. Russell, the head robber, demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking [[Albanian language|Albanian]], which is later identified as propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]], implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.\n\nWhen Arthur Case, chairman of the board of directors and the bank founder, learns about the holdup, he hires \"fixer\" Madeleine White to try and protect the contents of his [[safe deposit box]] within the bank. Russell allows her to enter the bank and inspect the box's contents, which include documents from [[Nazi Germany]]. \n\nRussell implies that Case started his bank with Nazi money he received for unspecified services, resulting in many Jews dying during [[World War II]]. White tells him that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the box's contents.\n\nFrazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell shows him around the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, he explains he deliberately provoked him, concluding that he is not a killer. However, this is seemingly disproven when a hostage execution is staged.\n\nThe execution prompts an [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|Emergency Services Unit]] team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades, remove their disguises, and exit the bank with the hostages. \n\nThe police detain and question everyone but cannot distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. Unable to identify the suspects and unable to show a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.\n\nFrazier, however, searches bank records and finds that safe deposit box 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. White then confronts him, informs him of Case's Nazi dealings, and attempts to persuade him to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between the two. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis.\n\nRussell repeats his opening monologue while hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. He exits the bank and enters a waiting van filled with his conspirators, some of whom the police had questioned.  \n\nWhen Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell reading, \"follow the ring.\" He confronts Case, urging White to contact the [[Office of War Crimes Issues]] at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped it into his pocket during their \"collision\" while exiting the bank.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 170\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster star in the film.\n   | image1    = Denzel Washington cropped 02.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    = Clive Owen (Berlin Film Festival 2009).jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = \n   | image3    = Jodie Foster.4783.jpg\n   | alt3      = \n   | caption3  = \n}}\n\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Detective Keith Frazier, New York City police detective with a scandal attached to his name who is desperate to make Detective First Grade.

Russell first appears at the beginning of the film, [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and narrating ''[[in medias res]]'' of how he will commit the perfect bank robbery. Owen nearly turned down the role; like Washington, he expressed concerns over the character's disguise of a hood, mask and sunglasses. He said, \"To play whole scenes where you're masked, you've got on sunglasses and you're wearing a hood is very weird, because a lot of acting is often through intent, and intent is shown through the eyes.

In response to the bank heist, Case hires White to prevent a possible career-ending situation.

He described Case as a \"wonderful, rich head of all sorts of organizations \u2014 I suppose a kind of '[[Enron]] creature' \u2014 who runs banks and other world businesses.
