Deriving its title from [[Mary Poppins (book series)#Mr. Banks|the father]] in Travers's story, ''Saving Mr. Banks'' depicts the author's tragic childhood in rural [[Queensland]] in 1906 and the two weeks of meetings during 1961 in [[Los Angeles]], during which Disney attempts to obtain the [[Film rights|screen rights]] to [[Mary Poppins (book series)|her novels]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Films unveils upcoming slate at Cannes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/bbc-films-slate-announcement.html|work=[[BBC]]|publisher=[[BBC Films]]|access-date=July 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Essential Media and Entertainment|Essential Media Entertainment]] and [[BBC Films]] initially developed ''Saving Mr. Banks'' as an independent production until 2011, when producer [[Alison Owen]] approached [[Walt Disney Pictures]] for permission to use copyrighted elements.

The plot summary is an overview of the film's main events, so avoid minute details such as dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, and technical detail.-->\nIn [[London]] 1961, agent Diarmuid Russell urges financially strapped author [[P. L. Travers|Pamela \"P. L.\" Travers]] to travel to [[Los Angeles]] and meet with [[Walt Disney]], who has pursued the [[film rights]] to her ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' stories for twenty years after having promised his daughters to produce a film based on the books. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts, fearing what he will do to [[Mary Poppins (character)|her character]]. Having written nothing new and her book royalties dried up, she risks losing her house. Russell reminds her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations (no animation and unprecedented script approval) before she finally agrees to go.\n\nFlashbacks depict Travers' difficult childhood in [[Allora, Queensland]], [[Australia]] in 1906, which became the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic [[alcoholism]] resulted in his repeated dismissals, strained her parents' marriage and caused her distressed mother's attempted [[suicide]]. Goff died from [[tuberculosis]] when Travers was seven years old. Prior to his death, her mother's stern, practical sister came to live with the family and later served as Travers's main inspiration for the Mary Poppins character.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Travers is annoyed by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the overly-perky inhabitants, personified by her friendly limousine driver, Ralph. At the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], Travers meets the creative team who are developing ''Mary Poppins'' for the screen: [[screenwriter]] [[Don DaGradi]] and songwriters [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard]] and [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert Sherman]]. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view that she also holds of the jocular Disney.\n\nTravers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character [[Mary Poppins (book series)#Mr. Banks|George Banks]], the children's estranged father, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, the team grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.\n\nThe team acknowledges that Travers has valid criticisms and make changes, although she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to [[Disneyland]], which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character and the addition of [[Let's Go Fly a Kite|a new song]] and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins collaborating with the team. Soon afterward however, Travers is enraged to discover an animation sequence has been added. Travers confronts Disney over this and returns home without signing the agreement.\n\nDisney learns that \"P. L. Travers\" is a [[pen name]], taken from Travers' father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff and she is Australian, not English. That gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her home, Disney shares his own less-than-ideal childhood but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers not to let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. That night, after Disney has left, Travers finally relents and grants the film rights to Disney.\n\nThree years later, in 1964, Travers has begun writing another Mary Poppins story, while ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' is to have its world premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches ''Mary Poppins'' with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.<!--This plot summary is in compliance with WP:FILMPLOT's recommended length of 400-700 words; any further plot revisions, especially removing certain details, should be discussed on the talk page first.-->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[P.
