Jackson]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Salma Hayek]]. The film follows a bodyguard (Reynolds) who must protect a convicted hitman (Jackson), who is on his way to testify at the [[International Criminal Court]] against a sadistic, Eastern European dictator (Oldman).\n\n''The Hitman's Bodyguard'' was released in the United States on August 18, 2017, and grossed $176 million worldwide. Critics praised the performances and chemistry of Reynolds and Jackson and the action sequences, but criticized the clich\u00e9d plot and execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/the-hitmans-bodyguard-misses-the-mark/|title=The Hitman's Bodyguard Misses the Mark|first=Jeff|last=Giles|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=August 17, 2017|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard]]'', was released on June 16, 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\nMichael Bryce lives a luxurious life as a successful [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based private [[bodyguard]], until his client Takashi Kurosawa, an international arms dealer, is assassinated on his watch. Two years later, the fallen-from-grace Bryce survives by protecting drug-addicted corporate executives in [[London]].\n\nMeanwhile, Vladislav Dukhovich, the vicious [[dictator]] of [[Belarus]], is on trial for crimes against humanity at the [[International Criminal Court]]. Unable to secure solid evidence or testimony against him, the prosecution's last hope is incarcerated [[Contract killing|hitman]] Darius Kincaid, who agrees to testify against Dukhovich in exchange for the release of his wife Sonia from prison. Led by [[Interpol]] Agent Roussel, an armed convoy escorts Kincaid from the UK to the International Criminal Court in [[The Hague]].\n\nWith the aid of treacherous Interpol Assistant Director Jean Foucher, Dukhovich's men successfully ambush the convoy as it passes through [[Coventry]] and kill most of the security team. Kincaid eliminates the attackers and Agent Roussel, the sole survivor, takes Kincaid to an Interpol safehouse in the city. Realizing that the agency cannot be entrusted with the mission due to a possible leak, she enlists the help of Bryce, her ex, to escort and protect Kincaid on the way to The Hague.\n\nThey hitchhike to a ferry going to [[Amsterdam]], where Sonia is being held. Kincaid reveals to Bryce that he was the one who killed Kurosawa, having spotted him by chance while on another job, causing an outraged Bryce to abandon him. As Bryce evaluates his past mistakes at a beer stand, Dukhovich's men attack Kincaid. Bryce regains his composure and helps Kincaid escape, but is captured in the process. As he's being tortured, Kincaid arrives and rescues Bryce.\n\nAfter reconciling their differences, they arrive at The Hague with seconds to spare. Kincaid testifies that Dukhovich hired him to assassinate a political rival, but Kincaid witnessed Dukhovich carry out a mass execution, and uploaded the massacre photos to a secret [[FTP site]] that he provides to the court.\n\nDukhovich admits guilt, then resorts to his backup plan: bombing the court to escape. Foucher leaves the court before the bombing and Roussel deduces he was the traitor. In the confusion after the bomb goes off, Dukhovich seizes a gun to kill Kincaid, but Bryce dives in front of the bullet, taking the hit. Injured, he tells Kincaid to stop Dukhovich. \n\nFoucher and Roussel struggle until Bryce shoots him to save Roussel. Kincaid pursues Dukhovich to the roof where he attempts to escape by helicopter. Kincaid destroys the helicopter and angrily kicks Dukhovich off the roof to his death for shooting Bryce.\n\nKincaid is rearrested for his various crimes but breaks out of [[Belmarsh Prison]] several months later so he and Sonia can celebrate their anniversary in the bar in [[Honduras]] where they first met. As a wild bar brawl breaks out around them, they kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Michael Bryce, a disgraced triple A rated [[executive protection]] agent and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer.\n* [[Samuel L.
