However, one day, the good king has fallen ill, and his greedy captain of the guard [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] plunders and terrorizes the country in the king's name. [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Goofy]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] are three [[beggar]]s, trying to get money for some food when Captain Pete's carriage, filled with stolen food, passes. Pluto sees a sausage stand out from the carriage and gives chase, pursuing it into the castle. When Mickey knocks on the door to get his dog back, one of the soldiers opens the door and lets him in, mistaking him for the prince. Pete lectures the soldier for letting anyone in, pointing out where the real prince is: in class with his teacher [[Horace Horsecollar]] and his [[valet]] [[Donald Duck]]. The prince hears Pete outside, roughly handling Mickey and Pluto. The prince orders them to be brought to him right away. Pete kicks Mickey through the door and forces Pluto out of the castle.\n\nWhile in the palace, Mickey meets the prince and they both realize that they are entirely identical in appearance. The prince tells the beggar that he is bored with his life and convinces the beggar to exchange clothes and roles with each other. The prince reassures the beggar that everything will be fine, and if there are any problems, everyone will recognize the true prince with his real ring. Disguised as a beggar, the prince tricks Pete into kicking him out of the palace and meets Goofy and Pluto while Mickey is challenged with the prince's studies. The prince witnesses a couple of soldiers trying to steal a chicken from [[Clarabelle Cow]] and her two children. The children explain that for years the soldiers have taken away their food and belongings in the name of the king. When a carriage with the stolen food goes by, the prince stops it by identifying himself through the ring and he returns the food to the people. The soldiers attempt to stop the prince, thinking that he is an impostor, but fail when he escapes with help from the villagers and Goofy. One of the soldiers tells Pete that one of the beggars had the royal ring.\n\nPete is alarmed realizing that he cast out the real prince and that he may see the [[corruption]] and theft going on outside. As such, Pete plans to execute the prince and take control of the kingdom for himself by using Mickey as a [[puppet ruler]]. Mickey, still dressed as the prince, is called to see his father, who is now dying. Mickey enters the room of the dying king and the king tells him he must take his royal birthright and become king. Mickey decides to find and inform the prince as quickly as possible, but Pete arrives and blackmails Mickey to be crowned king by threatening to kill a captured Pluto. Meanwhile, the true prince hears the bells announcing the death of his father and realizes that he must return immediately to the palace. Pete captures the prince and detains him with Donald (whose reasons for imprisonment are unknown), while the [[coronation]] begins. Goofy disguises himself as an [[executioner]], and after accidentally knocking out the guard, the three escape the cell and run to the coronation chamber. While Mickey tries to postpone being crowned by the [[archbishop]], the prince arrives and fights Pete, who becomes entangled with his soldiers in a fallen chandelier, and they fall out of a window. Mickey and the prince then cheer in their success in defeating Captain Pete and his men. However, the archbishop is still confused and does not know whom to crown until Pluto recognizes Mickey. The real prince is crowned [[King of England]], and he happily appoints Mickey and Goofy as members of his royal court while ruling for many years with justice and compassion for all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Wayne Allwine]] as [[Mickey Mouse]] and the Prince\n* [[Arthur Burghardt]] as Captain [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]]\n* [[Tony Anselmo]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as [[Goofy]], [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Weasels (Disney)|Weasel]] #1\n* [[Elvia Allman]] as [[Clarabelle Cow]]\n* [[Charlie Adler]] as [[Weasels (Disney)|Weasel]] #2 & 3 , Pig Driver, Peasant and Man in Street\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the King and Archbishop\n* [[Trevor Eyster]] as Kid #1\n* Rocky Krakoff as Kid #2\n* [[Roy Dotrice]] as the Narrator\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS/LaserDisc===\nThe short was released on VHS several times.
