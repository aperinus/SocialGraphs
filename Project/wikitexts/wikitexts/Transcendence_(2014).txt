The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Cole Hauser]], and follows a group of scientists who race to finish an artificial intelligence project while being targeted by a radical anti-technology organization.\n\nPaglen's screenplay was listed on the 2012 edition of [[The Black List (survey)|The Black List]], a list of popular unproduced screenplays in Hollywood.<ref name=\"blacklist\">{{cite web|url=http://files.blcklst.com/2012_black_list.pdf |title=The Black List 2012 |publisher=The Black List |access-date=April 5, 2017}}</ref> ''Transcendence'' was a [[box-office bomb|box office flop]], grossing just $103 million against a budget of as much as $150 million. The film received mainly negative reviews; it was criticized for its plot structure, characters and dialogue but praised for its cinematography, acting, and score.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Will Caster is a scientist who researches the nature of [[sapience]], including [[artificial intelligence]]. He and his team work to create a [[Computational theory of mind|sentient computer]]; he predicts that such a computer will create a [[technological singularity]], or in his words \"Transcendence\". His wife, Evelyn, is also a scientist and helps him with his work.\n\nAn [[Neo-Luddism|anti-technology]] terrorist group called \"Revolutionary Independence From Technology\" (R.I.F.T.) carry out synchronized attacks on A.I. laboratories, while one member shoots Will with a [[polonium]]-laced bullet. Will is given no more than a month to live. In desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to [[mind uploading|upload Will's consciousness]] into the [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]] that the project has developed. His best friend and fellow researcher, Max Waters, questions the wisdom of this choice, reasoning that the \"uploaded\" Will would only be an imitation of the real person. Will's consciousness survives his body's death in this technological form and requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max believes that the computer is not actually Will and demands that it be shut down. Evelyn, being offended, demands that Max leave.\n\nAt a bar, Max is met by Bree, the leader of R.I.F.T. He refuses to talk with her and leaves, but is kidnapped by other members of R.I.F.T. in the parking lot. They use his cellphone to track down Evelyn\u2019s location. When R.I.F.T. discovers where Evelyn has established her project, she connects the computer intelligence to the [[Internet]] via satellite and escapes before R.I.F.T. destroys the equipment.\n\nIn his virtual form and with Evelyn's help, Will uses his newfound vast capabilities to build a technological [[utopia]] in a remote desert town called Brightwood, where, over the course of two years, he spearheads the development of ground-breaking technologies in medicine, energy, biology and [[nanotechnology]]. However, Evelyn grows fearful of Will's motives when he displays the ability to remotely connect to and control people's minds after they have been subjected to his [[nanoparticle]]s.\n\nAfter visiting Evelyn and the underground facility Will has built, and seeing the capabilities of the hybrids Will has created, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Donald Buchanan and government scientist Joseph Tagger become suspicious of Will's motives and plan to stop the sentient entity from spreading, with help from the government and R.I.F.T. As Will has already spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, Max and R.I.F.T. develop a [[computer virus]] with the purpose of deleting Will's [[source code]], destroying him. Evelyn plans to upload the virus by infecting herself and then having Will upload her consciousness. A side effect of the virus would be the destruction of technological civilization. This would also disable the nano-particles, which have spread in the water, through the wind and have already started to eradicate pollution, disease, and human mortality.\n\nWhen Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is stunned to see Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one. Will welcomes her but is instantly aware that she is carrying the virus and intends to destroy him. The FBI and the members of R.I.F.T. attack the base with artillery, destroying much of its power supply and fatally wounding Evelyn. When Bree threatens to kill Max unless Will uploads the virus, Will explains that he has only enough power either to heal Evelyn's physical body or upload the virus. Evelyn tells Will that Max should not die because of what they've done, so Will uploads the virus to save Max. As Will dies, he explains to Evelyn that he did what he did for her, as she had pursued science to repair the damage humans had done to the [[ecosystem]]s. In their last moment, he tells Evelyn to think about their garden. The virus kills both Will and Evelyn, and a global technology collapse and blackout ensues.\n\nThree years later, in Will and Evelyn's garden at their old home in Berkeley, Max notices that their sunflowers are the only blooming plants. Upon closer examination, he notices that a drop of water falling from a sunflower petal instantly cleanses a puddle of oil \u2014 and realizes that the [[Faraday cage]] around the garden has protected a sample of Will's sentient nano-particles.\n\nThe movie ends with a voiceover by Max: \"He created this garden for the same reason he did everything: So they could be together.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Will Caster, a scientist researching artificial intelligence.\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Evelyn Caster, Will's wife and a fellow scientist.\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Max Waters, Will's best friend.\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Agent Buchanan, an FBI agent.\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Bree, the leader of the Revolutionary Independence From Technology (R.I.F.T.) terrorist organization.\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Colonel Stevens, a military officer.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Joseph Tagger, Will and Evelyn's mentor.\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Martin.\n* [[Cory Hardrict]] as Joel Edmund, a R.I.F.T. terrorist.\n* [[Josh Stewart]] as Paul, a blind man who is healed by Will's nanomachines.\n* [[Falk Hentschel]] as Bob, a R.I.F.T. terrorist.\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Transcendence'' is [[Wally Pfister]]'s [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]].
