One night, he drives his wife and friends home [[Driving under the influence|under the influence]] and causes a collision which kills one of his friends. After taking a [[plea deal]], Jacob is sentenced to 16 months at the [[California Institution for Men]] in [[Chino, California|Chino]].\n\nOn his first night inside, Harlon overhears the gang rape of a fellow inmate and quickly decides his only chance at survival is to go on the offensive. The next day, he stands his ground and attacks an [[African-American]] inmate when provoked, drawing the attention of Bottles, the \u201cshot caller\u201d for the [[white supremacist]] gang [[Public Enemy No. 1 (street gang)|PENI]]; in return for protection and entry into the gang, Jacob is forced to smuggle [[heroin]] and kill a [[Informant|snitch]]. Over time, Harlon rises in rank, obtains the [[Pseudonym|alias]] \u201cMoney\u201d, and grows even more hardened by prison life. During a riot, Harlon stabs another inmate to save the life of the head of the [[Sure\u00f1os]], earning him respect from other gang leaders, but is caught on camera and sentenced to five years (to run concurrently to his original sentence) as a result. Harlon then ceases all contact with his family, demanding that they move on and forget him. Harlon is eventually transferred to [[California State Prison, Corcoran|Corcoran State Prison]] where he is introduced to \"The Beast\", the leader of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] there. Impressed with Harlon's dedication, The Beast promotes him to his second-in-command.\n\nAs he is set to be released, Harlon is ordered by The Beast to orchestrate a weapons deal with the Sure\u00f1os. Though Harlon is initially hesitant as he will be on [[parole]], he eventually relents after The Beast threatens his family. Upon release, he is greeted by \"Shotgun\" and other gang members, including Howie, a young [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan war]] veteran with no criminal record. Harlon survives an attack at a party and orders Howie to answer to no one but him.\n\nHarlon's [[parole officer]] Ed Kutcher is tipped off about the weapons deal and places Harlon under surveillance, who then discovers that Shotgun is Kutcher's [[informant]]. After Harlon transfers his finances to his wife, she brings Joshua to meet him against his wishes, and has a brief emotional breakdown after realizing his son has grown up without him. On the day of the deal, Harlon evades his surveillance and kills Shotgun at his home.  Kutcher finds Shotgun dead and discovers his cellphone has a message about the pending gun deal. After meeting the Sure\u00f1os, Harlon texts their coordinates to Shotgun's cellphone. Realizing that Shotgun hid more of the weapons to sell himself, Harlon warns Howie to leave the criminal life and forces him out of their vehicle. As the deal closes, the police, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], and [[SWAT]]\u2014alerted by Harlon's text\u2014surround the gangs; only Howie manages to escape and watches from a distance, realizing Harlon saved his life.\n\nFully [[Validation (gang membership)|validated]], Harlon is sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. He turns down Kutcher's offer to testify against The Beast in exchange for a full [[pardon]]. Harlon is returned to Corcoran where The Beast, having learned Harlon alerted authorities to the location of the raid, tells him his family will be killed. Harlon had anticipated The Beast's retaliation and concealed a handcuff key and a razor blade in a butt safe. He frees himself and confronts The Beast in his cell. After a brief fight, Harlon cuts The Beast's jugular vein and kills him. He orders a prison guard to report that he acted in self-defense. He then assumes The Beast's place as gang leader.\n\nWith his family's safety secured, Harlon accepts his life sentence, and notifies Kutcher about the remaining weapons. He receives a letter from Joshua, explaining that he and Katherine are moving on, living a successful and happy life, and that he has forgiven his father. Harlon is moved emotionally as he looks at pictures of his former life with his family, and accepts that sacrificing his own freedom to kill The Beast was the only way he could protect his family from his enemies. Harlon then goes outside to exercise in the yard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jacob 'Money' Harlon<ref name=April2015Deadline>{{cite
