Its plot focuses on a series of murders on the campus of a private [[New England]] university, all of which appear to be modeled after popular [[urban legend]]s. In addition to its younger cast, the film features supporting performances from [[Robert Englund]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]], and [[Brad Dourif]].\n\nFilmed in Toronto in the spring of 1998, ''Urban Legend'' was released in the United States on September 25, 1998. It grossed $72.5 million worldwide on a budget of $14 million, and received generally negative reviews from critics, with chief criticisms being that the film was a blatant rip-off of ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996). The film has been credited by both cinema and folklore scholars as being one of the first major films to redistribute the urban legends and folklore depicted within it to the public.{{efn|Gail de Vos notes the film's influence in re-transmitting the legends it depicts intra-narratively.{{sfn|De Vos|2012|p=22}}}}\n\nIt was followed by two [[sequel]]s: ''[[Urban Legends: Final Cut]]'', which was released theatrically in 2000, and the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Urban Legends: Bloody Mary]]'' in 2005. In February 2020, a reboot of the film was announced to be in development, to be written and directed by [[Colin Minihan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3604232/screen-gems-making-new-urban-legend-digital-age/|title=Screen Gems is Making a New 'Urban Legend' for the Digital Age|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=February 10, 2020|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Fictional location|Pendleton University]] student Michelle Mancini is decapitated by a [[killer in the backseat]] of her car during a rainstorm. Meanwhile, at the campus coffee shop, student Parker regales friends Natalie and Brenda with a story about a massacre that occurred in Stanley Hall, an abandoned dormitory. Journalism student Paul discredits this as an [[urban legend]]. News of Michelle's murder quickly spreads the following day, but the Dean Adams and campus police officer Reese seem determined to bury the story. Damon, a jokester [[fraternity]] member, attempts to console Natalie, who is notably disturbed by the murder. In Damon's parked car at a bluff, Natalie rejects his sexual advances. When Damon goes outside to urinate, he is attacked by an assailant in a hooded [[parka]] who [[The Hook|hangs him from a tree]]. Natalie flees to retrieve help, but Damon's body and car have disappeared when she returns with Reese. Parker and his girlfriend Sasha assure Natalie that Damon has pranked her.\n\nLater, Natalie's [[Goth subculture|goth]] roommate Tosh is strangled to death by the killer while Natalie sleeps. Natalie finds Tosh's body in the morning, along with a message scrawled in blood on the wall. Distraught, Natalie confides to Brenda that Michelle was her high school friend, and that the two had received probation for causing a fatal car accident after [[Headlight flashing#Urban legend|driving with their headlights turned off and pursuing the first driver who flashed them]]. Paul meanwhile investigates local urban legends, and discovers that the Stanley Hall massacre was in fact real, and Professor Wexler, a professor of [[American folklore]], was its only survivor.\n\nDean Adams is murdered in the campus parking garage, and Reese later finds Wexler's office in disarray and covered in blood. Meanwhile, Natalie, Brenda, and Sasha attend a fraternity party coinciding the massacre's 25th anniversary. During the party, Parker is incapacitated by the killer in the bathroom, who murders him by forcing [[Pop Rocks#Urban legend|pop rocks and bathroom chemicals]] down his throat. Meanwhile, Sasha leaves the party to host her late-night talkshow at the campus radio station. During the broadcast, she and her assistant are attacked by the killer, and her screams are played live on air; the fraternity partygoers assume it is a prank referencing the massacre, but Natalie fears Sasha is in danger. She rushes to the station, where she witnesses the killer murder Sasha with an axe.\n\nNatalie soon finds Paul and Brenda on campus. Paul, convinced that Wexler is responsible, escorts them away in his car. They stop at a gas station, and while Paul is inside, Natalie and Brenda find Wexler's mutilated body in the trunk. The two women flee through the woods back toward campus as Paul pursues them. They become separated, and Natalie flags down the university's janitor passing by in his truck. He picks her up, but their car is forced off the road by the killer, who pursues them in a separate vehicle. The crash kills the janitor, but Natalie leaves unscathed and flees on foot.\n\nWhile passing Stanley Hall, Natalie hears Brenda's screams from inside. In the building, she finds her friend's corpses, along with an apparently dead Brenda outstretched on a bed; however, Brenda knocks Natalie unconscious moments later. When Natalie comes to, Brenda reveals herself as the killer, enacting revenge for her fianc\u00e9 David Evans, the fatality in the road accident Natalie and Michelle caused. Brenda attempts to [[Organ_theft#the#urban#legend|remove Natalie's kidney]], but is thwarted when Reese arrives and holds Brenda at gunpoint. Brenda manages to stab Reese with a switchblade, and Paul comes upon the scene. Natalie gains control of the gun, and shoots Brenda, who falls out a window. Natalie and Paul leave to get help for Reese. As they drive away, the two talk about how this will later be an urban legend and all the facts will be misconstrued. Paul asks, \"Well if this is an urban legend, where is the twist?\" Brenda then appears in the back seat and attacks them with an axe. Paul crashes the car on a bridge, causing Brenda to go through the windshield and into the river below.\n\nLater, a group of students at a different university have recounted the events of Brenda's killing spree, during which they say that her body was never discovered. Most of them disbelieve the tale with the exception of one young woman, who is revealed to be Brenda. She claims that the story was incorrectly told, and begins to tell them \"how the story really goes.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Paul Gardner\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Natalie Simon\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Brenda Bates\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Sasha Thomas\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Parker Riley\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Reese Wilson\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Damon Brooks\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Dean Adams\n* [[Robert Englund]] as Professor William Wexler\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Tosh Guaneri\n* [[Natasha Gregson Wagner]] as Michelle Mancini\n* [[Stephanie Anne Mills]] as Felicia\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Michael McDonnell\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Weird Janitor\n}}\n\n==Urban legends depicted in the film==\nThe film depicts various urban legends, some of which are featured as murder sequences and others that are merely referenced or discussed in passing.\n\n===Re-enacted===\n* Michelle is murdered by a [[killer in the backseat]].
