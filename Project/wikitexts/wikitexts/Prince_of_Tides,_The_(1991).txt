Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. \n\nDuring his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at his profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.\n\nTom is also torn with his own problems but hides behind what he calls \"the Southern way\"\u2014laughing at things instead of crying. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. \n\nTom and Lowenstein begin to have feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. \n\nTom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. He discovers that Savannah has been in such a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated state]] that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. \n\nAs Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer.\n\nTom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. He reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom bursts into tears, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life.\n\nDiscovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits, return to his music lessons, to prepare to leave for [[Tanglewood Music Center|Tanglewood]], a prestigious music academy. \n\nTom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affair. Tom takes Herbert's \"million dollar\" violin and threatens to throw it off the high-rise balcony unless he apologizes. Tom throws the violin in the air, Herbert nervously apologizes, and Tom catches it before it falls.\n\nTom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. \n\nTom then receives a call from his wife, who has finally decided she wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and tells Lowenstein he doesn't love his wife more, \"just longer.\u201d Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family, but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman. \n\nAfter finally working out the traumatic events in his past with Lowenstein's help, Tom is happy in his renewed life. He thinks of her daily as he reaches the top of the bridge on his drive home from work. Her name comes to him as a kind of prayer, a blessing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Tom Wingo\n* [[Barbra Streisand]] as Dr. Susan Lowenstein\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Sallie Wingo\n* [[Kate Nelligan]] as Lila Wingo Newbury\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Herbert Woodruff, Lowenstein's husband\n* [[Melinda Dillon]] as Savannah Wingo\n* [[George Carlin]] as Eddie Detreville, Savannah's gay neighbor\n* [[Jason Gould]] as Bernard Woodruff, Lowenstein's son (and Streisand's real life son with [[Elliott Gould]])\n* [[Brad Sullivan]] as Henry Wingo\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nPrincipal photography began in June 1990 in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/films/prince_of_tides_1.html|title=Barbra Streisand Archives {{!}} The Prince of Tides {{!}} 1991|website=barbra-archives.com|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref> Other locations in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry]] included St. Helena Island and Fripp Island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciway.net/movies/sc-movie-prince-tides.html|title=The Prince of Tides - Movies Filmed in South Carolina|website=www.sciway.net|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref> ''The Prince of Tides'' wrapped production in New York in September 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/473925%7C0/The-Prince-of-Tides.html|title=The Prince of Tides|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n[[Pat Conroy]] gave Streisand a copy of his novel ''[[The Prince of Tides (novel)|The Prince of Tides]]'' with the inscription: \"To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you're also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life.

In the film, ''The Prince of Tides'' is the title of a book of poetry written by Savannah and dedicated to Tom. Luke only appears intermittently, and his death is only vaguely described.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nStreisand initially hired English composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] to write a score for the film, but Barry eventually left due to creative differences. In a March 7, 1996, Cinemusic conference interview, Barry explained his exodus from the film, stating, \"I was asked by Barbra Streisand to do ''The Prince of Tides'' &ndash; I live in New York, she lives in Los Angeles &ndash; and I went and met with her, and she showed me some footage, and she said, 'Why aren't you moving to Los Angeles?' and I said, 'Absolutely not.' And she said, 'Well, I like to know what's going on' &ndash; Barbra's an extreme case, by the way &ndash; and I said, 'Even if I did move to Los Angeles, I have no desire to meet with you once I know what I'm going to do.
