Fonda received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nA washed-up, [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] actress, Alex Sternbergen (played by Fonda), wakes up on [[Thanksgiving]] 1986<!---Thursday is said to fall on the 28th--> next to a murdered man, a sleazy photographer. She feels [[hangover|sick]] and remembers nothing from the night before. She calls her friend Jackie about what happened the night before. (We find out later that he is her husband, they are separated.) He informs her that she missed out on getting what could have been her best gig in a while the night before because she was drunk and rude. She tells him about the body. He tells her to call the cops and she says that she is scared but he insists, telling her it will be all right. She retorts saying \"ya wanna bet?\" She leaves the apartment, and it is implied that she has not called the police. While trying to flee at the airport, Alex encounters an ex-policeman, Turner ([[Jeff Bridges]]), who believes in her innocence. [[Raul Julia]] plays Jackie, a hairdresser who wants to divorce her, as he has fallen in love with socialite Isabel Harding ([[Diane Salinger]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-morning-after-1986|title=The Morning After Movie Review (1986) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=Rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Sternbergen / Viveca Van Loren\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Turner Kendall\n* [[Raul Julia]] as Joaquin \"Jackie\" Manero, Alex's Husband\n* [[Diane Salinger]] as Isabel Harding, Jackie's New Lover\n* [[Richard Foronjy]] as Sergeant Herb Greenbaum\n* [[Bruce Vilanch]] as Harry, The Bartender\n* [[Geoffrey Scott (actor)|Geoffrey Scott]] as Bobby Korshack\n* James Haake as Frankie, Drag Queen and Friend of Alex's \n* Don Hood as Mr. Hurley, The Lawyer\n* [[Corey Everson]] as Miss Olympia\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as \"Red\", Jackie's Assistant At His Salon\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Korshack's Neighbor\n* [[Frances Bergen]] as Mrs. Harding, Isabel's Mother\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 63% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 19 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning After (Rotten Tomatoes)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/morning_after/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nJane Fonda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy Awards Database|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1359620233501|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=2013-01-31}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning After|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091554/|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2013-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0091554}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|morning_after}}\n\n{{Sidney Lumet}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morning After, The}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sidney Lumet]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Paul Chihara]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1985]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Thanksgiving in films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
