The episode was broadcast on [[BBC One]], [[PBS]] and [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] on 1 January 2016. It depicts the characters of the show in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]]: the [[Victorian London]] setting of the original stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. The title is based on the quote \"Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife\" from \"[[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]]\" (1893), which refers to a case mentioned by Holmes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-24/what-does-the-title-the-abominable-bride-tell-us-about-the-sherlock-special |title=What does the title The Abominable Bride tell us about the Sherlock special? |last=Jones |first=Paul |work= [[Radio Times]] |date=24 October 2015 |access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> The story also draws on elements of original Conan Doyle stories of Holmes such as \"[[The Five Orange Pips]]\" (1891) and \"[[The Final Problem]]\" (1893).\n\nThe episode won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie]], the first win of the series in that category.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot revolves around Victorian England and the present day. In the 19th&nbsp;century, [[Dr. Watson|Dr. John Watson]] has been medically discharged from the Army and moves to [[London]]. Watson is introduced to [[Sherlock Holmes]] by a fellow student of [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|Bart's]], and becomes interested in his investigative principles. Holmes invites Watson to share his new flat in Baker Street, which Watson accepts.\n\nIn 1895, [[List of Sherlock characters#Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade|Inspector Lestrade]] arrives and presents Holmes and Watson with a puzzling case: Emelia Ricoletti, a [[tuberculosis|consumptive]] bride, had fired on by-passers in the street from a balcony before fatally shooting herself. Later that evening, Mr.&nbsp;Ricoletti was confronted by Emelia, who shot him dead before disappearing into the fog. Fascinated by Emelia's apparent survival, Holmes takes the case. At the morgue, Dr.&nbsp;Hooper informs Holmes that the woman who killed herself, the woman who murdered Mr.&nbsp;Ricoletti and the body on hand have all been positively identified as Emelia Ricoletti. When the bride apparently returns to murder other men, he deduces that these are [[copycat crime]]s.\n\nMonths later, Holmes' brother [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] refers a case to him: Lady Carmichael's husband, Sir&nbsp;Eustace Carmichael, received a threatening warning in the form of an envelope full of [[The Five Orange Pips|orange pips]] (seeds). Sir&nbsp;Eustace is unco-operative, describing his wife as \"hysterical\"; Holmes and Watson stake out the house for the evening. A [[ghost]]ly-looking bride appears and disappears in front of them, and the pair hear the sound of breaking glass, followed by screams from both Sir&nbsp;Eustace and Lady&nbsp;Carmichael. They discover Sir Eustace, stabbed to death, by what appears to be Emelia, who then escapes through a broken window. Lestrade arrives and observes a note attached to the dagger, which Holmes says was not there when he found the body. The note reads, \"''Miss me?''\", a phrase used by the modern-day [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|James Moriarty]]. After insisting that the case's solution is so simple that even Lestrade could solve it, Holmes [[Meditation|meditates]]. Moriarty appears and insults Holmes about the mystery of Emelia's apparent post-suicide revival, alluding to his similar apparent death in the present. Moriarty appears to shoot himself in the head but remains alive.\n\nIn the present day, it is revealed that the events of Victorian England are actually occurring within Sherlock's drug-laden [[Method of loci|Mind Palace]]. The plane has returned to England minutes after taking off after Moriarty's broadcast, and Mycroft, John, and Mary enter the plane to find a frustrated Sherlock rambling about the unsolved Ricoletti case. Sherlock explains he had hoped to solve the case, believing it would prove crucial to solving Moriarty's return.\n\nVictorian Holmes awakens, with an awareness of events of the present as a seeming [[hallucination]] induced by [[cocaine]]. He receives a telegram from Mrs Watson saying she has found Emelia's co-conspirators at a desanctified church. There, Holmes and Watson discover and interrupt a secret group of the Women's Rights Movement, whose members include Dr.&nbsp;Hooper, Janine Hawkins, and Watson's maidservant. Holmes explains that they used a double to fake Emelia's death, allowing her to kill her husband and create the persona of the avenging ghost bride. Already dying, she was later killed at her request by being shot through the mouth; the duplicate corpse was replaced by her actual corpse, the one Holmes and Watson saw at the morgue, for a positive identification. Since then, the women have used the persona of the bride to murder men who wronged them. Sherlock surmises that Lady Carmichael, being a member of the society, killed her husband. He makes his accusation to the approaching bride, assuming that it is Lady Carmichael. When he lifts the bride's veil, however, he finds that the \"bride\" is actually Moriarty.\n\nSherlock reawakens in the present, where he insists on finding Emelia's grave to prove that her body-double was buried under the coffin. While digging, he hears Emelia's corpse repeatedly whisper \"Do not forget me\". The corpse moves to attack him, leading Holmes to realize he is not actually awake. He then \"awakens\" in the past on a ledge next to the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Moriarty appears and tells Holmes he is still trapped in his Mind Palace \u2013 Holmes realises that the incident at the grave was just another episode in the same dream. The men fight and Moriarty gains the upper hand, but Watson appears and holds Moriarty at gunpoint. Watson kicks Moriarty off the ledge and then asks Holmes how he can awaken into the present. Holmes decides to fall over the ledge, having confidence he will survive.\n\nSherlock wakes up in the present on the plane. Mycroft asks John to look after Sherlock, hoping he will not use drugs again. After John leaves the plane, Mycroft opens Sherlock's notebook, revealing the word \"Redbeard\". Sherlock concludes that, like Ricoletti, Moriarty did indeed die but arranged with others to carry out plans after his death. The episode ends with Victorian Holmes describing his visions of aeroplanes and mobile telephones to a cynical Watson, before looking out the window onto Baker Street in the present day.\n\n== Filming==\n[[File:Tyntesfield 2.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the entrance area of [[Tyntesfield]]]]\n\nFilming took place at [[Tyntesfield|Tyntesfield House]], a [[National Trust]] property at Wraxall, near Bristol.  Scenes were also shot in the cellars of [[Colston Hall]] and at [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]] in Bristol, and other locations in [[Bath, Somerset]]. Tyntesfield was mainly used as Sir Eustace's house but also the Watsons' London home.<ref name=\"wdp\">{{cite news |url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Sherlock-s-Abominable-Bride-took-Tyntesfield-\u00d7near/story-28446370-detail/story.html |newspaper=[[Western Daily Press]] |title=Revealed: How Sherlock's The Abominable Bride took over Tyntesfield near Bristol |first=Tristan |last=Cork |date=31 December 2015 |access-date=2 January 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe final scene of the episode puts forth a possible concept that all of the series in its modern-day setting are actually playing out from within Victorian Holmes' Mind Palace. [[Mark Gatiss]] stated in ''Sherlock: The Abominable Bride Post-Mortem'':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/sherlock/253100/sherlock-creators-tease-season-4-give-abominable-bride-insight |title=Sherlock Creators Tease Season 4, Give Abominable Bride Insight |last=Burt |first=Kayti |date=19 February 2016 |work=[[Den of Geek]] |access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref><blockquote>By having that scene right at the end, where we go back to Victorian London \u2013 Victorian Baker Street \u2013 and Sherlock explicitly says, \"It's an imagined version of what I think the future might be,\" we have really opened a ridiculous window that the entire series of Sherlock might be the drug-induced ravings of the Victorian Sherlock Holmes.
