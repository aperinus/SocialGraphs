When he arrives, she turns out to be the production designer Arlette, a lesbian. He is taken to see former starlet Marion, who is both owner of the theatre and leading lady. Her Jewish husband, Lucas, is the director of the theater believed to have left Paris but is in fact living in the cellar, from where Marion releases him each evening while delivering food and prospective materials for future productions. Their evenings are spent in the empty theatre making love and discussing the current production alongside plans for Lucas to flee the country. Marion is immediately smitten with the oblivious Bernard, whom Lucas only knows from a headshot and what he can hear through a rigged heating vent. Unknown to anybody at the theatre, Bernard is a member of a [[French Resistance|Resistance]] group and delivers the bomb that kills a German admiral.\n\nThe first night is loved by a full house but one of the newspaper reviews next morning is viciously hostile, damning the show as Jewish. The writer, Daxiat, an anti-semite, hopes to oust Marion and take over her theatre. While cast and crew are celebrating their success in a nightclub, Daxiat is also there with another party. Bernard, furious that the man has insulted the gentile Marion, hustles him out to the street and pushes him around. Furious that Bernard has jeopardised her theatre, Marion refuses all contact with him offstage. One night, pretending to be air raid wardens, two [[Gestapo]] men start searching the theatre and it is Bernard to whom Marion turns in desperation for urgent help in concealing Lucas and his effects. When the Gestapo arrest Bernard's Resistance contact just before they have planned to meet in a church, he decides to devote his life to the cause and give up acting. As he is clearing out his little dressing room, Marion comes in to say goodbye and the two make love on the floor.\n\nAfter the war, Bernard returns to be male lead in a new play that the freed Lucas wrote while hiding. In it, the female lead played by Marion offers to share her life but he claims he never really loved her. At the end of the opening night, Bernard, Marion and Lucas stand hand in hand to receive the applause.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Marion Steiner\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Bernard Granger\n* [[Jean Poiret]] as Jean-Loup Cottins\n* [[Heinz Bennent]] as Lucas Steiner\n* [[Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol]] as Arlette Guillaume, the production designer\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Germaine Fabre, the older woman employed by the theatre\n* [[Sabine Haudepin]] as Nadine Marsac, the young actress\n* [[Jean-Louis Richard]] as Daxiat\n* [[Maurice Risch]] as Raymond Boursier, the technician of the theatre\n* [[Marcel Berbert]] as Merlin\n* [[Richard Bohringer]] as a [[Gestapo]] Officer\n* [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (actor)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3]] as Lieutenant Bergen\n* [[Jean-Pierre Klein (actor)|Jean-Pierre Klein]] as Christian Leglise, a [[French Resistance|resistant]]\n* [[Franck Pasquier]] as Jacquot/Eric\n* [[Rose Thierry]] as Jacquot's mother\n* [[Martine Simonet]] as Martine S\u00e9n\u00e9chal\n* [[Christian Baltauss]] as the actor replacing Bernard\n* [[R\u00e9nata]] as Greta Borg, a singer in a club\n* [[H\u00e9nia Ziv]] as Yvonne\n* [[Jean-Jos\u00e9 Richer]] as Ren\u00e9 Bernardini\n* [[Jessica Zucman]] as Rosette\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9]] as M.
