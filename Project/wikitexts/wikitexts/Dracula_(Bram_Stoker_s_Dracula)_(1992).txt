It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], of which it won three for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] while also being nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. Its score was composed by [[Wojciech Kilar]] and its closing credits theme \"[[Love Song for a Vampire]]\", written and performed by [[Annie Lennox]], became an international success.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1462, [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Dracula]] returns from a victory in [[Night Attack at T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te|his campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] to find his wife Elisabeta committed suicide after his enemies falsely reported his death. A priest tells him that his wife's soul is damned to Hell for committing suicide. Enraged, Vlad desecrates the chapel and renounces God, declaring he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness. He then drives his sword into the chapel's stone cross and drinks the blood that pours from it, becoming a [[vampire]].\n\nIn 1897, [[solicitor]] [[Jonathan Harker]] takes the [[Transylvania]]n [[Count Dracula]] as a client from his colleague [[Renfield|R.M. Renfield]], who has gone insane and is now an inmate in Dr. [[John Seward|Jack Seward]]'s insane asylum. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange Dracula's real estate acquisitions in [[London]]. Jonathan meets Dracula who finds a picture of his fianc\u00e9e [[Mina Harker|Mina Murray]] and believes she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be fed upon by [[Brides of Dracula|his brides]], while he sails to England with Transylvanian soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey.\n\nIn London, Dracula hypnotically seduces, then bites Mina's best friend [[Lucy Westenra]], with whom she is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompt former suitors [[Quincey Morris]] and Dr. Seward, along with her fianc\u00e9 [[Arthur Holmwood]] to summon Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]], Seward's mentor, who recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire. Dracula, appearing young and handsome during daylight, meets and charms Mina. Mina begins to develop feelings for Dracula, accompanying him on several outings. When Mina finally receives word from Jonathan \u2014 who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent \u2014 she travels to Romania to marry him. Upon learning this, a heartbroken Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward and Morris kill and behead the undead Lucy the following night.\n\nAfter he and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum and kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence. He visits Mina, who is staying in Seward's quarters, and confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends. Though furious at first, Mina admits that she still loves him and remembers Elisabeta's previous life; at her insistence, Dracula begins transforming her into a vampire. The hunters burst into the bedroom, and Dracula claims Mina as his bride before escaping. As Mina changes, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The hunters depart for Varna to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The hunters split up; Van Helsing and Mina travel to the Borgo Pass and the castle, while the others try to stop the [[Romani people|gypsies]] transporting Dracula.\n\nAt night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. Mina succumbs to their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood, Van Helsing places a [[communion wafer]] on her forehead, leaving a mark. He surrounds them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides, then kills them the following morning. Dracula's carriage arrives at the castle, pursued by the hunters. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues. Morris is stabbed in the back and Dracula bursts from his coffin at sunset. Jonathan slits his throat with a [[kukri]] knife while Morris stabs him in the heart. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Van Helsing and Jonathan allow her to retreat with the Count. Morris dies from his wound, surrounded by his friends.\n\nIn the chapel where he renounced God, Dracula lies dying in an ancient demonic form; he and Mina share a kiss as the candles adorning the chapel light up and the cross repairs itself. Dracula reverts to his younger self and asks Mina to give him peace. Mina thrusts the knife through his heart and as he dies, the mark on her forehead disappears. She then decapitates him and gazes up at a fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta, finally reunited and ascending to Heaven together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Count Dracula]] / [[Vlad the Impaler]]<ref name=\"http\">{{cite news|title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : QUICK BITES : Bet You Thought Bela Lugosi's Neck Biter Was True to Bram Stoker|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 26, 1992|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|access-date=November 22, 2010|first=Andy|last=Marx|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20101124095127/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-26/entertainment/ca-1125_1_bram-stoker|archive-date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Mina Harker]] (n\u00e9e Murray) / Elisabeta\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]] / Priest / Principal Narrator\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Jonathan Harker]]\n* [[Richard E.

To accomplish this he filmed on sound stages to avoid potential troubles caused by inclement weather.<ref name=\"ET\" /><ref name=\"Mas\" />\n[[File:Dracula armor - Coppola - Sarah Stierch 01.jpg|thumbnail|Dracula's armor on display at Coppola's winery in California]]\nCoppola chose to invest a significant amount of the budget in costumes in order to showcase the actors, whom he considered the \"jewels\" of the feature.<ref name=\"ET\" /><ref name=\"Mas\" /> He had an artist [[storyboard]] the entire film in advance to carefully illustrate each planned shot, a process which created around a thousand images.<ref name=\"ET\" /> He turned the drawings into a choppy animated film and added music, then spliced in scenes from the French version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' that [[Jean Cocteau]] directed in 1946 along with paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]] and other symbolist artists.<ref name=\"ET\" /> He showed the animated film to his designers to give them an idea of the mood and theme he was aiming for. Coppola also asked the set costume designers to simply bring him designs which were \"weird\". \"'Weird' became a code word for 'Let's not do formula,'\" he later recalled. \"'Give me something that either comes from the research or that comes from your own nightmares.' I gave them paintings, and I gave them drawings, and I talked to them about how I thought the imagery could work.\"<ref name=\"ET\" /><br />\nThe film's hair and makeup designer, [[Mich\u00e8le Burke]], recalls: \"Francis didn't want the typical Dracula that had already been done in Hollywood. He wanted something different; a new Dracula without the widow's peak, cape, or pale-white skin.\" Burke says she used her Catholic upbringing and angelic imagery for design inspiration, as well as the 19th-century attire created by costume designer [[Eiko Ishioka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/10/8583410/vampire-halloween-makeup-famous-characters|title=The Sexiest Vampires To Inspire Your Halloween Makeup This Year|first=Samantha|last=Sasso|website=www.refinery29.com}}</ref>\n\nCoppola brought in acting coach Greta Seacat to coach Frost and Ryder for their erotic scenes as he felt uncomfortable discussing sexuality with the young actresses.<ref name=\"ET\" /> However, he did ask Oldman to speak seductively off camera to Frost while they were filming a scene in which she writhed alone in her bed in ecstasy.<ref name=\"Forever.org\" /> She later classified the things Oldman said to her as \"very unrepeatable\".<ref name=\"Forever.org\" /><ref name=\"ET\" /><ref name=\"Frost\">Diamond, Jamie.

He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son [[Roman Coppola]]. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of [[Optical printer|optical]] or computer-generated effects, but were created using [[Practical effect|on-set]] and [[In-camera effect|in-camera]] methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of [[compositing]] were instead achieved by either [[Rear projection effect|rear projection]] with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through [[multiple exposure]] by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using [[Matte (filmmaking)|matting]] techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. [[Forced perspective]]s were often employed to combine [[miniature effect]]s or [[matte painting]]s with full-sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics.<ref name=\"Roman\">{{cite video|people=[[Roman Coppola]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] |title=In Camera: The Na\u00efve Visual Effects of 'Bram Stoker's Dracula |medium=[[Documentary]]|publisher=[[Columbia Pictures|AMC]]|date=2001}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 65 critics with an average rating of 6.80/10.
