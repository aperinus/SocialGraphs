The film was directed, produced, and co-written by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and stars [[Peter Sellers]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Sterling Hayden]], and [[Slim Pickens]]. The film was made in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958).\n\nThe story concerns an unhinged [[United States Air Force]] general who orders a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on the Soviet Union. It separately follows the [[President of the United States]], his advisors, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) exchange officer as they attempt to prevent the crew of a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] plane (who were following orders from the general) from bombing the Soviets and starting a nuclear war.\n\nThe film is often considered one of the best comedies ever made, as well as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films of all time]]. In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it twenty-sixth in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|its list of the best American movies]] (in the 2007 edition, the film ranked thirty-ninth), and in 2000, it was listed as number three on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|its list of the funniest American films]]. In 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] included ''Dr. Strangelove'' as one of the first 25 films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=May 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505082616/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n[[United States Air Force]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Jack D. Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the 843rd Bomb Wing, flying [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]]s armed with [[hydrogen bomb]]s. The planes are on airborne alert two hours from their targets inside the [[USSR]].\n\nGeneral Ripper orders his [[Executive officer#Military|executive officer]], [[Group Captain]] Lionel Mandrake (an [[exchange officer]] from the [[Royal Air Force]]), to put the base on alert, confiscate all privately owned radios from base personnel and issue \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling bombers. All the aircraft commence attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|CRM 114 discriminator]]s, which are designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Happening upon a radio that had been missed earlier and hearing normal civilian broadcasting, Mandrake realizes that no attack order has been issued by [[The Pentagon]] and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the [[Water fluoridation controversy#Communist conspiracy theory (1940s\u20131960s)|Soviets have been fluoridating]] American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has become insane.\n\nIn the [[Joint War Room|War Room]] at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how \"Plan R\" enables a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets if [[decapitation (military strategy)|all superiors have been killed in a first strike]] on the United States. It would take two days to try every CRM code combination to issue a recall order, so Muffley orders the [[U.S. Army]] to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson, noting the slim odds of recalling the planes in time, then proposes that Muffley not only let the attack continue but send reinforcements. According to an unofficial study, this would result in \"modest and acceptable civilian casualties\" from the \"badly damaged and uncoordinated\" Soviet military that would remain after the initial attack. Muffley refuses this plan and instead brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone [[Soviet Premier]] Dimitri Kissov on the \"[[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hotline]].\" Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the targets, flight plans and defensive systems of the [[bomber]]s so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\n\nAfter a heated discussion with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union created a [[Doomsday device|doomsday machine]] as a [[nuclear deterrent]]; it consists of many buried [[cobalt bomb|bombs jacketed with \"cobalt-thorium G\"]], which are set to detonate automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The resulting [[nuclear fallout]] would then engulf the planet for 93 years, rendering the Earth's surface uninhabitable. The device cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. The President's wheelchair-using scientific advisor, former [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi]] Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it; Alexei replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week at the Party Congress.\n\nU.S. Army troops arrive at Burpelson and battle with the garrison. After General Ripper commits suicide, Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, [[Strategic Air Command]] successfully recalls all of the bombers except for one, commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, due to the radio equipment being damaged in a missile attack. The Soviets attempt to find it, but Kong has the bomber attack a closer target due to dwindling fuel. As the plane approaches the new target, a Soviet [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] site, the crew is unable to open the damaged [[bomb bay]] doors. Kong enters the bay and repairs the electrical wiring while straddling an [[H-bomb]], whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. Kong joyfully hoots as he rides the falling bomb until it detonates over the target.\n\nBack in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided, a plan which gathers enthusiastic support from the all-male command staff. Worried that the Soviets will do the same, Turgidson warns about a \"[[missile gap|mineshaft gap]]\" while Alexei secretly photographs the War Room. Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, then suddenly rises from his wheelchair and exclaims, \"Mein F\u00fchrer, I can walk!\" The film cuts to a montage of nuclear explosions, accompanied by [[Vera Lynn]]'s rendition of the song \"[[We'll Meet Again]].\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as:\n** [[Group captain]] Lionel Mandrake, a British [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[exchange officer]]\n** Merkin Muffley, the [[President of the United States]]\n** Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-using [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] expert and former [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] named Merkw\u00fcrdigliebe, who has [[alien hand syndrome]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/who_was_dr_strangelove.html|title=Who Was Dr. Strangelove?|date=March 9, 1999|website=Slate (magazine)|access-date=February 13, 2016|archive-date=February 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203072410/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/03/who_was_dr_strangelove.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=50 Years Later \"Dr. Strangelove\" Remains a Must-See Film and Humorous Reminder of Our Civilization's Fragility |url=https://fas.org/pir-pubs/50-years-later-dr-strangelove-remains-must-see-film-humorous-reminder-civilizations-fragility/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308111157/https://fas.org/pir-pubs/50-years-later-dr-strangelove-remains-must-see-film-humorous-reminder-civilizations-fragility/ |archive-date=2021-03-08 |access-date=2022-08-27 |website=Federation Of American Scientists |language=en-US |quote=(...)

The condition stemmed from the studio's opinion that much of the success of Kubrick's previous film ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962) was based on Sellers's performance in which his single character assumes a number of identities. Sellers had also played three roles in ''[[The Mouse That Roared (film)|The Mouse That Roared]]'' (1959). Kubrick accepted the demand, later saying that \"such crass and grotesque stipulations are the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of the motion-picture business.\"<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2>Lee Hill, [http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html \"Interview with a Grand Guy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180543/http://www.altx.com/int2/terry.southern.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}: interview with Terry Southern</ref>\n\nSellers ended up playing three of the four roles written for him. He had been expected to play Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, the B-52 aircraft commander, but from the beginning Sellers was reluctant. He felt his workload was too heavy and he worried he would not properly portray the character's [[Texan English]] accent. Kubrick pleaded with him and he asked the screenwriter [[Terry Southern]] (who had been raised in Texas) to record a tape with Kong's lines spoken in the correct accent, which he practiced using Southern's tapes. But after the start of shooting in the aircraft Sellers sprained his ankle and could no longer work in the cramped aircraft mockup.<ref name=Southern/><ref name=Southern2/><ref>In the fictionalized [[biopic]] ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', it is suggested that Sellers faked the injury as a way to force Kubrick to release him from the contractual obligation to play this fourth role.</ref>\n\nSellers is said{{bywho|date=October 2022}} to have improvised much of his dialogue, with Kubrick incorporating the [[ad libitum|ad-libs]] into the written screenplay so that the improvised lines became part of the canonical screenplay, a practice known as [[retroscripting]].<ref name=Inside>\"Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove\", a documentary included with the 40th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of the film</ref><!-- 15m 31s Alexander Walker, 17m 50s Pamela Carlton --> <!-- Vincent LoBrutto's book on Stanley Kubrick? -->\n\n==== Group Captain Lionel Mandrake ====\nAccording to film critic [[Alexander Walker (critic)|Alexander Walker]], the author of biographies of both Sellers and Kubrick, the role of Group Captain Lionel Mandrake was the easiest of the three for Sellers to play, since he was aided by his experience of mimicking his superiors while serving in the RAF during [[World War II]].<ref name=Inside/><!-- 15m 58s --> There is also a heavy resemblance to Sellers' friend and occasional co-star [[Terry-Thomas]] and the [[prosthetic]]-limbed RAF flying ace Sir [[Douglas Bader]].\n\n==== President Merkin Muffley ====\nFor his performance as President Merkin Muffley, Sellers assumed a [[Midwestern American English]] accent.

It thus worried Kahn that the military might like the idea of a doomsday machine and build one.<ref>''On Thermonuclear War'' pp. 144\u2013155</ref> Kahn, a leading critic of MAD and the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]]'s doctrine of [[massive retaliation]] upon the slightest provocation by the USSR, considered MAD to be foolish bravado, and urged America to instead plan for [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and thus even a limited nuclear war. With this reasoning, Kahn became one of the architects of the [[flexible response]] doctrine which, while superficially resembling MAD, allowed for the possibility of responding to a limited nuclear strike with a proportional, or calibrated, return of fire (see ''[[Conflict escalation]]'').\n\nKahn educated Kubrick on the concept of the semi-realistic \"cobalt-thorium G\" doomsday machine, and then Kubrick used the concept for the film. Kahn in his writings and talks would often come across as cold and calculating, for example, with his use of the term \"megadeaths\" and in his willingness to estimate how many human lives the United States could lose and still rebuild economically.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, Volume 1 |year=2001 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-80657-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 471] |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam03deco/page/471 |url-access=registration}}</ref> Kahn's dispassionate attitude towards millions of deaths is reflected in Turgidson's remark to the president about the outcome of a preemptive nuclear war: \"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed.
