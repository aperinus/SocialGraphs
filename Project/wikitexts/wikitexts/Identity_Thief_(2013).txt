The film tells the fictional story of Sandy Patterson, whose [[identity theft|identity is stolen]] by an unnamed woman, Diana.\n\nThe film received negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing over $174 million worldwide against a budget of $35 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Denver]], Sandy Patterson buys identity theft protection from Diana, a con artist, over the phone and reveals all of his personal information. At work, after Sandy clashes with his obnoxious boss, Harold Cornish, he receives a phone call that reminds him he has an appointment at a salon in Florida. Confused, he puts it out of his mind when co-worker Daniel Casey suggests they and several others start their own firm; Sandy agrees to join them.\n\nWhen paying for gas, Sandy's card is declined, and the clerk cuts it up. As the credit card company tells him that he has spent much money in Florida, he is arrested for missing a court date there. At the police station, Detective Reilly determines Diana has stolen Sandy's identity. The situation worsens when cops ask Daniel, now his boss, about Sandy's possession of drugs. Reilly says Sandy's name was used to buy drugs from someone named Paolo. When the cops say they can do nothing unless the identity thief is in Denver, Sandy offers to retrieve her and convince her to clear his name despite his wife's concerns.\n\nSandy finds Diana at the salon in [[Winter Park, Florida]], but when he confronts her, she steals his rental car. Finding her address in her abandoned car, he investigates her house, which is full of merchandise and stolen credit cards. The pair scuffle; before Sandy can handcuff her, criminals Marisol and Julian burst in, angry that Diana gave Paolo bad credit cards. After Sandy and Diana escape, Sandy tells her about his plan to restore his reputation, and she agrees to help. Meanwhile, a [[skiptracer]] is dispatched to track down Diana for a substantial bounty. Because their IDs are identical, flight is impossible, and they travel by car.\n\nAfter traveling through several states, the skiptracer catches up to the pair and captures Diana. A chase ensues; she knocks him unconscious, and Sandy rams his van off the road. They take the skiptracer's van and tie him up in back. When it overheats, they continue on foot through a forest. Sandy discards his pants when he finds a snake in them, and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious when another bites his neck. Sandy wakes at a bus station, and Diana says she carried him until she flagged down a truck. As the next bus to Denver leaves in three days, Sandy uses money hidden in his socks to buy a cheap car. For gas money, the pair con an accounts processor and steal Cornish's identity to create new credit cards. Meanwhile, Marisol shoots the skiptracer, and the criminals continue their pursuit of Sandy and Diana.\n\nIn [[St. Louis]], the two share dinner, and Diana admits she does not know her real name. The accounts processor enters with cops, who arrest Sandy and Diana. Diana uncuffs herself in the back of the police car, breaks the back windshield, and escapes with Sandy. The skiptracer shoots Marisol and Julian, finds Diana and Sandy on the highway mid-escape, and hits Diana with his car. Sandy comes to her aid, but Diana revives and defensively strikes Sandy in the throat. Diana and Sandy eventually get home, where Diana has dinner with Sandy's family and reconciles with them. Sandy and Trish have a private conversation that night, agreeing not to turn in Diana even if it means that Sandy will lose his job.\n\nThe next morning, Sandy finds Diana gone and a note that apologizes for the trouble she caused. Sandy prepares to quit his job, but Daniel shows him that Diana is meeting with the police in an office. Detective Reilly tells Sandy he is no longer part of the investigation, and Diana is taken away in cuffs. Before she leaves, Sandy asks her why; Diana says she knew he would not turn her in, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nOne year later, Sandy celebrates another birthday, this time with his third child. The family visits Diana in prison, and Sandy presents her with a birth certificate that reveals her name as Dawn Budgie. Diana hugs Sandy. When a guard antagonizes her, Diana punches the guard, and another guard stuns her with a Taser. As she recovers and walks back to her cell, Sandy watches with a shocked expression.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=400\n| image1            = Jason_Bateman_Deauville_2011.jpg\n| alt1              = Jason Bateman\n| link1             = File:Jason_Bateman_Deauville_2011.jpg\n| image2            = Melissa McCarthy Emmy Week Celebration - 2012.jpg\n| alt2              = Melissa McCarthy \n| link2             = File:Melissa McCarthy Emmy Week Celebration - 2012.jpg\n| footer            = Jason Bateman and Mellisa McCarthy starred as Sandy and Diana respectively\n}}\n\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Sandy Patterson\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Diana / Dawn Budgie\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Trish Patterson\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Harold Cornish\n* [[John Cho]] as Daniel Casey\n* [[G\u00e9nesis Rodr\u00edguez]] as Marisol\n* [[T.I.]] as Julian\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Detective Reilly\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Skiptracer\n* [[Eric Stonestreet]] as Big Chuck\n* Mary-Charles Jones as Franny Patterson\n* [[Maggie Elizabeth Jones]] as Jessie Patterson\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Paolo Gordon\n* [[Carlos Navarro (actor)|Carlos Navarro]] as Luis the Gas Station Attendant\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Tony\n* [[Kevin Covais]] as Kevin\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Flo (uncredited)\n* [[Carmela Zumbado]] as the Salon Saleperson (uncredited){{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Everett (uncredited){{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was first conceived as a project with two male leads, but that changed when Bateman saw McCarthy in ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' and pushed for her to star alongside him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/08/jason-bateman-melissa-mccarthy-team-for-the-id-theft |title=Bateman McCarthy Team for ID Theft |date=2011-08-15}}</ref> Jerry Eeten wrote an early draft, later finished by Craig Mazin with a final rewrite by [[Seth Gordon]].
