The film stars [[Adam Sandler]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and [[Christine Taylor]], and tells the story of a wedding singer in 1985 who falls in love with a waitress. The film was released on February 13, 1998. Produced on a budget of {{US$|18}}{{nbsp}}million, it grossed $123{{nbsp}}million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often ranked as one of Sandler's best comedies.\n\nThe film was later adapted into a stage musical of the [[The Wedding Singer (musical)|same name]], debuting on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in April 2006 and closing on New Year's Eve of that same year. [[Jon Lovitz]] would reprise his role as Jimmie Moore in the [[The Goldbergs (season 6)#ep128|episode of the same name]] of ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', set during the events of ''The Wedding Singer'', with Sandler,  Barrymore and [[Billy Idol]] appearing through the use of archival footage.\n\n==Plot==\nRobbie Hart is a wedding singer in [[Ridgefield, New Jersey]] in 1985, whose own wedding to his fianc\u00e9e Linda is approaching. He meets and befriends Julia Sullivan, a new [[waitress]] at the reception hall where he works, and promises to sing at her wedding, though her fianc\u00e9, businessman and bond investor Glenn Gulia, has yet to set a date.\n\nOn Robbie's wedding day, his sister Kate informs him as he waits at the altar that Linda has changed her mind about the wedding, leaving him humiliated and emotionally devastated. Later that day, Linda visits Robbie and reveals that she fell in love with him for his ambitions of being a rock star, and hates the idea of being married to just a wedding singer. Robbie sinks into depression, causing his friends and family to be concerned. His best friend Sammy convinces him to return to work, but he gives a depressed performance that is panned, and decides to give up wedding gigs and reneges on his promise to sing for Julia when Glenn finally sets a date. However, Julia convinces him to help her with the planning and their friendship blossoms. During a double date with Julia, Glenn, and Julia's cousin Holly, Robbie learns from Glenn that he cheats on Julia frequently and plans to continue after they are married.\n\nJulia and Robbie are increasingly confused by their deepening feelings for each other. When Holly tells Robbie that Julia is marrying Glenn for his money, he unsuccessfully pursues a job at a bank. Julia is dismayed at his materialism, and when he accuses her of the same, she becomes angry with him. Depressed, he decides to follow Sammy's example of only having shallow relationships with women, in response to which Sammy confides that he is unhappy, and encourages Robbie to tell Julia how he feels. Meanwhile, Julia confides in her mother that she has fallen out of love with Glenn and has developed feelings for Robbie, and bursts into tears thinking about becoming \"Mrs. Julia Gulia\". Robbie arrives to declare his feelings, and sees her through her bedroom window in her wedding dress, where she is happily looking in a mirror pretending she has just married Robbie, but Robbie assumes she is thinking of Glenn.\n\nHeartbroken, Robbie leaves to get drunk and finds Glenn in the midst of his pre-wedding bachelor party, arm in arm with another woman. After a heated exchange, Glenn punches Robbie and mocks him. Robbie stumbles home to find Linda waiting for him wanting to reconcile, and passes out. The following morning, she answers the door and introduces herself as his fianc\u00e9e to a crestfallen Julia. She runs to Glenn, who is sleeping off the events of the previous night, and tells him she wants to be married immediately. He half-heartedly offers to take her to [[Las Vegas]].\n\nRobbie awakens and, after shaking off his hangover from the previous night, rejects Linda's reconciliation, having realized how shallow she is during his time with Julia, and kicks her out. At the 50th wedding anniversary party of his neighbor Rosie, to whom he has been giving singing lessons, he realizes he wants to grow old with Julia and, with Rosie's encouragement, he decides to pursue her. Just then, Holly arrives and informs him of Julia's encounter with Linda, so Robbie rushes to the airport and gets a [[First class (aviation)|first class]] ticket to Las Vegas.\n\nAfter telling his story to his empathetic fellow passengers, which include [[Billy Idol]], he learns that Glenn and Julia are on the same flight. With the help of Billy and the flight crew, over the loudspeaker, he sings a song he has written called \"Grow Old With You\", dedicated to Julia. As Robbie enters the main cabin singing, Glenn tries to assault him only to be thwarted and shoved into a lavatory by the flight attendants with assistance from Billy and a large fan. Robbie and Julia admit their love for each other, and share a kiss. Billy, impressed by Robbie's song, offers to tell his record company executives about him. Later, Robbie and Julia are married, and Robbie's bandmates perform at their wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Robbie Hart, a wedding singer\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Julia Sullivan, a waitress and later Robbie's love interest\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Holly Sullivan, Julia's cousin\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Sammy, Robbie's best friend\n* [[Angela Featherstone]] as Linda, Robbie's former fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Matthew Glave]] as Glenn Gulia, a businessman and bond investor who is Julia's former fianc\u00e9<!-- end credits \"Glenn\" dialog and subtitles \"Gulia\" -->\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as George Stitzer, keyboardist and singer in Robbie's band\n* [[Frank Sivero]] as Andy, Kate's husband and Tyler's and Petey's dad as well as Robbie's brother-in-law\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as Angie Sullivan\n* [[Ellen Albertini Dow]] as Rosie\n* [[Jodi Thelen]] as Kate Hart, Robbie's sister and Andy's wife as well as Tyler's and Petey's mom\n* Patrick McTavish as Tyler, Andy's and Kate's son and Petey's brother as well as Robbie's nephew\n* Gemini Barnett as Petey, Andy's and Kate's son and Tyler's brother as well as Robbie's nephew\n* [[Teddy Castellucci]], Randy Razz, and John Vana as the remaining members of Robbie's band\n* [[Billy Idol]] as himself \n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Mr. Simms\n* Marnie Schneider as Joyce, Flight Attendant\n* [[Carmen Filpi]] as Old Man in Bar\n* [[Robert Smigel]] as Andre\n* Todd Hurst as Drunk Teenager\n* [[Peter Dante]] as David's friend [[Jack Nisbet]]\nOther notable appearances include future-Queens of the Stone Age musician [[Michael Shuman]] as The Bar Mitzvah boy, screenwriter [[Steven Brill (filmmaker)|Steven Brill]] as Glenn's buddy, the film's own writer [[Tim Herlihy|Timothy P.

Inspired by the radio show \"Lost in the '80s\" Herlihy decided to set the film in that decade. Herlihy had not set out to do anything different and thought the script was similar to his previous collaborations with Sandler. The changes came naturally, and he attributed the differences to his recently having gotten married, as well as the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore.<ref>{{cite web |date=26 March 2008 |author=Zack Smith |title=The Wedding Singer |url=https://indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=216830 |website=[[Independent Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418082544/https://indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=216830 |archive-date=2008-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Herlihy was aware that Sandler's previous films had lacked a female perspective, and emphasized the importance of Barrymore.
