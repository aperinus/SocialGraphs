The film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], written by [[George Bradshaw (writer)|George Bradshaw]] and [[Charles Schnee]], and starring [[Lana Turner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Barry Sullivan (American actor)|Barry Sullivan]], [[Gloria Grahame]] and [[Gilbert Roland]]. ''The Bad and the Beautiful'' won five [[Academy Awards]] out of six nominations in 1952 (including Gloria Grahame winning Best Supporting Actress), a record for the most awards for a movie that was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] or for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nIn 2002, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The theme song, \"The Bad and the Beautiful\", penned by [[David Raksin]], became a [[jazz standard]] and has been cited as an example of an excellent movie theme.\n\n''The Bad and the Beautiful'' was created by the same team that later worked on another film about the seedy film business, ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962): director (Vincente Minnelli), producer (John Houseman), screenwriter (Charles Schnee), composer (David Raksin), male star (Kirk Douglas), and studio (MGM). Both films also feature performances of the song \"[[Don't Blame Me (Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh song)|Don't Blame Me]]\", by [[Leslie Uggams]] in ''Two Weeks'' and by [[Peggy King]] in ''The Bad and the Beautiful''. In one scene of ''Two Weeks in Another Town'', the cast watches clips from ''The Bad and the Beautiful'' in a screening room, presented as a film that Douglas's character in ''Two Weeks'', Jack Andrus, had starred in. ''Two Weeks'' is not a sequel, however, as the characters in the two stories are unrelated.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], director Fred Amiel, [[movie star]] Georgia Lorrison, and [[screenwriter]] James Lee Bartlow each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields in Paris. [[Movie producer]] Harry Pebbel gathers them in his office and explains that Shields has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project.  Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem.  Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer.\n[[File:Kirk Douglas in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\n[[File:Dick Powell in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\n[[File:Barry Sullivan in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\n[[File:Gloria Grahame in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\n[[File:Gilbert Roland in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\n[[File:Elaine Stewart in The Bad and the Beautiful trailer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|{{center|Trailer image}}]]\nAs they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. Their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire [[Extra (acting)|extras]] to attend his funeral.  Despite the ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood.\n\nShields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at the funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a [[poker]] game to film executive Pebbel so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a [[line producer]]. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making [[B movies]] for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to direct. The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel goes to work for him. Amiel becomes an [[Academy Award for Best Director|Oscar-winning director]].\n\nShields next encounters [[alcoholic]] small-time actress Lorrison, the daughter of a famous actor Shields admired. He builds up her confidence and gives her the leading role in one of his movies over everyone else's objections. When she falls in love with him, he lets her think that he feels the same way so that she does not self-destruct and he gets the performance he needs. After the [[premiere]] makes her a star overnight, she finds him with a bit player named Lila. He tells her that he will never allow anyone to have that much control over him.  Crushed, Lorrison walks out on her contract. Rather than suing her, Shields lets her go to another studio. She becomes a top Hollywood star.\n\nFinally, Bartlow is a contented professor at a small college who has written a bestselling book for which Shields has purchased the film rights. Shields wants Bartlow himself to write the script. Bartlow is not interested, but his shallow Southern belle wife Rosemary is, so he gives in. They go to Hollywood, where her constant distractions keep him from his work. Shields gets his suave actor friend Victor \"Gaucho\" Ribera to keep her occupied. Freed from interruption, Bartlow makes excellent progress on the script. Rosemary, however, runs away with Gaucho; they are killed in a plane crash. When the script is completed, Shields has the distraught Bartlow remain in Hollywood to help with the production, while Shields takes over directing duties.  A first-time director, Shields botches the job, which leads to his bankruptcy. Then Shields lets slip his part in Rosemary's involvement with Gaucho, so Bartlow walks out on him.  Bartlow goes on to write a novel based upon his wife (something Shields had encouraged him to do) and wins a [[Pulitzer Prize]].\n\nAfter each flashback, Pebbel sarcastically agrees that Shields \"ruined\" their lives; each of the three is now at the top of their respective professions, thanks largely to Shields. At last, Shields' call comes through and Pebbel asks the three if they will work with Shields just one more time; all three say no. As they leave, Pebbel is still talking to Shields. The three eavesdrop on an [[extension (telephone)|extension phone]] as Shields describes his new idea; they become more and more interested.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Georgia Lorrison\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Jonathan Shields\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Harry Pebbel\n* [[Dick Powell]] as James Lee Bartlow\n* [[Barry Sullivan (American actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as  Fred Amiel\n* [[Gloria Grahame]] as Rosemary Bartlow\n* [[Gilbert Roland]] as  Victor \"Gaucho\" Ribera\n* [[Leo G.

It concerned the will and testament of a New York theatre producer who tried to explain his bad behavior to three people he had hurt: a writer, actor and director. MGM bought the film rights and originally Dan Hartman was to produce it. Hartman left for Paramount.<ref>{{cite news|title=AVA GARDNER GETS ROLE WITH GABLE: Named for Metro's 'Lone Star,' Story of Texas Annexation Hartman Project Revived|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|work=New York Times |date=23 Apr 1951|page= 21}}</ref>\n\n[[Dore Schary]] offered the project to [[John Houseman]] and was to be called ''Memo to a Bad Man''.

Bushman]], who had a small part. He says Bushman told him his career faded away because \"at the height of his fame, he inadvertently offended the all-powerful Louis B.
