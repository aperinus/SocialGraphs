The plot revolves around a sexually diverse ensemble of colorful characters trying desperately to connect in [[New York City]]. The characters converge in a weekly [[Brooklyn]] artistic/sexual salon loosely inspired by various underground NYC gatherings that took place in the early 2000s. According to Mitchell, the film attempts to \"employ sex in new cinematic ways because it's too interesting to leave to porn.\" ''Shortbus'' includes a variety of explicit scenes containing [[Unsimulated sex|non-simulated]] sexual intercourse with visible penetration and male ejaculation.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nSet in contemporary New York City, ''Shortbus'' revolves around Sofia Lin ([[Sook-Yin Lee]]), who is married to the handsome but unambitious and slightly dim-witted Rob (Raphael Barker). She works as a [[Relationship counseling|couples counselor]]/[[Sex therapy|sex therapist]]. She comes into contact with a couple: A slightly egotistical former child star Jamie ([[PJ DeBoy]]) and former sex worker James ([[Paul Dawson (actor)|Paul Dawson]]), the film's other lead character. At the outset, James suggests to his boyfriend that they open up their relationship to have sex with others. During their first consultation, Sofia snaps, slaps Jamie, and then apologetically reveals her [[Anorgasmia|\"pre-orgasmic\"]] status. The couple suggests she attend a weekly social/artistic/sexual salon in Brooklyn called \"Shortbus\", which is hosted by [[Drag queen|drag]] artist [[Justin Bond]] (playing vself). Sofia slowly opens up to new experiences; this includes a friendship with a [[dominatrix]] who goes by the name Severin ([[Lindsay Beamish]]). Sofia's inability to achieve orgasm begins to cause conflict with Rob, who in turn begins attending Shortbus with Sofia.\n\nJames and Jamie meet a young ex-model and aspiring singer named Ceth (pronounced \"Seth\" and portrayed by [[Jay Brannan]]) and the three begin a sexual relationship. Meanwhile, James and Jamie's life is being closely watched by their across-the-street [[Stalking|stalker]] neighbor, Caleb ([[Peter Stickles]]). Caleb fears the inclusion of Ceth in James and Jamie's relationship might break them up and thus destroy his ability to live vicariously through them, so he attends Shortbus, where he confronts Ceth. Sofia begins to go daily to a spa with a [[sensory deprivation tank]] to meet with Severin, and the two begin to have intense conversations. Severin begins to help Sofia loosen up sexually; Sofia helps Severin achieve a deeper human connection than she had experienced before. One evening at Shortbus, Severin discusses with Sofia the idea of giving up sex work to pursue her dream of being an artist. The two then have an unplanned sexual experience, and once again Sofia is left unsatisfied.\n\nThroughout the film, James is seen making a film about himself and his relationship. It turns out to be a suicide note. He attempts to take his own life and is rescued by Caleb, who calls for help, but is too embarrassed to wait with James for the help to arrive. He writes his phone number and email address on James' face while he is unconscious. When James wakes in the hospital, he calls Caleb. James goes to Caleb's home to be consoled, but does not contact Jamie or Ceth, neither of whom can understand why he would not call them or come home.\n\nThere follows an interlocking trio of scenes showing connections between the characters' emotional problems and their sexual lives.\n* At Caleb's house, he and James have sex, and James allows Caleb to penetrate him, something he has never allowed anyone to do before. Afterward, in a dramatic revelation, James is seen in the window of Caleb's apartment by Jamie, who realizes in that moment that James is alive and okay.\n* Rob and Severin have a paid encounter where Rob asks to be flogged, something he could not ask Sofia to do. As this progresses, Severin loses control and Rob tries to comfort her.\n* Sofia seems to have a dream of struggling through an overgrown, wild forested area to a gentle seashore where she tries to achieve orgasm again. On failing, she screams, and in the real world [[Northeast blackout of 2003|the lights go off]] across the city, seemingly caused by the simultaneous and collective frustration of the characters.\n\nThe film ends with a song by Justin Bond at Shortbus during the blackout. Sofia arrives and finds Rob with Severin and after acknowledging him sits down by herself. James and Jamie also arrive followed by Ceth and Caleb. Justin's song starts on a wistful note, but as it progresses it becomes more energetic and positive thanks to the arrival of the [[Hungry March Band]]. This is mirrored in the actions and emotions of the actors. Jamie and James make out on the floor, and Ceth and Caleb start to hit it off. Rob seems to find a friend, and Severin progresses from nervous anxiety to happy elation upon the arrival of the band. Sofia engages in a threesome with a couple she has seen several times before and who appear to meet her prerequisite of \"just beginning to experiment sexually\" (Nick and Leah, played by Jan Hilmer and Shanti Carson), and finally achieves an orgasm, and the blackout affecting New York ends, as does the film.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy on the Great South Bay.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Dawson (actor)|Paul Dawson]] and [[PJ DeBoy]]]]\n* [[Sook-Yin Lee]] as Sofia Lin\n* [[Paul Dawson (actor)|Paul Dawson]] as James\n* [[Lindsay Beamish]] as Severin \n* [[PJ DeBoy]] as Jamie\n* Raphael Barker as Rob\n* [[Peter Stickles]] as Caleb\n* [[Jay Brannan]] as Ceth\n* [[Alan Mandell]] as [[Ed Koch#Personal life|Mayor Tobias]]\n* Jan Hilmer and Shanti Carson as Nick and Leah\n* [[Justin Vivian Bond]] as vself / Mistress of Shortbus\n* The [[Hungry March Band]] as Themselves\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* Director/writer Mitchell is featured in two shots in the Sex-Not-Bombs Room: the first, kissing a dark-haired man; and the second, performing [[cunnilingus]] on a woman sitting on a couch.\n* [[Jonathan Caouette]], director of ''[[Tarnation (2003 film)|Tarnation]]'', as the man who steals some \"blondies\" off a plate in the Sex-Not-Bombs Room. Mitchell met him when Caouette auditioned for ''Shortbus'' and subsequently became executive producer of ''Tarnation''.\n* [[Mary Beth Peil]], best known as Evelyn \"Grams\" Ryan on ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', as the woman with her hand down the storm drain (Severin takes a [[Instant film|Polaroid]] of her).\n* Singer-songwriter Reginald Vermue (aka [[Gentleman Reg]]) has a song on the soundtrack and appears as \"The Albino\"\n* [[Tristan Taormino]], a sex columnist and porn film director/occasional actress, is one of the participants in the orgy sequence.<ref name=\"Shoot Sex 2007\">\"How to Shoot Sex: A Docu-Primer\" (2007): Shortbus Region 1 DVD release (Th!nk Film)</ref>\n* Comedian [[Bradford Scobie]] (Doctor Donut)\n* Singer-songwriter Jasper James, who also appears on the soundtrack, has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as the woman on whom Mitchell is performing oral sex (on the couch next to Rob).\n* Comedian/bon vivant [[Murray Hill (performer)|Murray Hill]] (on the swing)\n* Acrobat-comedians The Wau Wau Sisters (on the trapeze)\n* Miss Exotic World 2004 [[Dirty Martini (burlesque)|Dirty Martini]] (doing the strip tease)\n* [[Burlesque]] star The World-Famous *Bob* (sitting with the Mayor in the Truth-Or-Dare Room)\n* Ray Rivas, like his character [[Shabbos goy]], is known for his blood-inclusive brand of [[extreme performance art]] which he performed at [[DUMBA]].\n* [[Bitch (performer)|Bitch]], of the bands [[Bitch and Animal]] and \"Bitch and the Exciting Conclusion\", plays herself.\n* [[Daniela Sea]], [[queercore]] musician and former circus juggler of [[Cypher in the Snow]] and cast member of ''[[The L Word]]'', plays themselves as Little Prince, their Radical Faerie nickname.\n* [[JD Samson]] of the band [[Le Tigre]] (who actually played their first show in DUMBA) appears in the \"Bitch's Bedroom\" scene.\n* [[Justin Tranter]], lead singer of the band [[Semi Precious Weapons]], is a spectator in Shortbus.\n\n==Production==\nThe audition website elicited half a million hits and 500 audition tape submissions. Forty people were called in for improv auditions and nine actors were cast, all before there was any story in mind. The film's characters and story were created collaboratively over 2.5 years through [[improvisation]] workshops with the cast. Mitchell wrote the screenplay from the raw material generated by the workshops and rehearsals.\n\nMuch of the sex in the film is unsimulated. Mitchell says:\n\n{{blockquote|In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] had [[metaphor]]s for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you a lot about who they are.  Some people ask me, 'Couldn't you have told the same story without the explicitness?'. They don't ask whether I could've done [[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|''Hedwig'']] without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the paintbox?}}\n\nAs indicated in the DVD special features, Lee and Shanti Carson each suggested they be filmed having real orgasms rather than fake them, specifically for the final scene involving Lee and the orgy sequence involving Carson. [[John Cameron Mitchell|Mitchell]] also participated in the latter scene, performing [[oral sex]] on a woman for the first time \"as a gesture of solidarity\".<ref name=\"Shoot Sex 2007\"/>\n\nThe panoramic cityscape interspersed through the film was completely [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] and designed by John Bair.\n\nIn the opening sequence in which [[Sook-Yin Lee]] and Raphael Barker are engaged in a session of unsimulated vaginal intercourse, the actress wore a female condom. \"They wanted to make sure it was safe sex, and it would look weird if my husband was wearing a condom,\" Lee explained.<ref>{{cite web |title=The real Sook Shocker |work=macleans.ca |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2006/6/5/the-real-sook-shocker |access-date=12 February 2022 }}</ref>\n \nSook-Yin Lee said she had a boyfriend at the time of filming. She revealed he was \"very supportive\" regarding her real sex scenes with her \"dear friend\" Raphael Barker.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virtually speaking, reality is quite a concept |work=www.pressreader.com |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20060926/281590941050293 |access-date=12 February 2022 }}</ref>\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe characters all converge on a weekly underground gathering or salon called Shortbus, inspired by the short yellow school buses for \"challenged\" students. The Shortbus salon was loosely based on a series of New York social/artistic/sexual gatherings. One was the monthly \"Shortbus Sweaty Teenage Dance Party\" organized by Mitchell (2002) as \"DJ Dear Tic\", his [[Radical Faeries|Radical Faerie]] nickname (Mitchell was influenced by annual Radical Faerie counter-cultural gatherings in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Orleans]]). Other influences include the Lusty Loft Parties that took place at a Brooklyn art collective called [[Dumba|DUMBA]] (where the film's salon was actually shot), and the weekly CineSalon film gathering, both of which were organized, in part, by Stephen Kent Jusick who plays Creamy in the film. The still-running underground Rubulad party was also an inspiration.\n\n===Casting===\nSeveral members of the cast previously worked with Mitchell in ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'', including:\n* [[Sook-Yin Lee]] previously played Kwang-Yi, the [[electric guitar]]ist in Hedwig's original band in [[Junction City, Kansas]].\n* Sofia's therapy client, Cheryl, is played by [[Miriam Shor]], who portrayed Yitzhak, Hedwig's back-up singer/lover.\n* Mandell, who played Tobias, appeared as a restaurant customer who receives a \"car wash\" from Hedwig. Mandell met Mitchell when they performed together wearing radiation burn makeup in a 1987 Los Angeles stage production about [[Chernobyl]]. Mandell was a great friend and collaborator of playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] and was directed by him in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' and ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''. They met after Mandell co-founded the [[San Quentin Prison]] Drama Workshop in the mid-60s which produced works of Beckett, among other playwrights. Mandell introduced Mitchell to Beckett in [[Paris]] in 1988, the year before Beckett died.\n* [[PJ DeBoy]] appeared as the Hedhead with dreads in the scene where Hedwig recounts her Tommy Gnosis stories atop a big pile of tires.\n\n===References===\nThere is a [[plot device]] involving a vibrating egg with the brand name \"[[In the Realm of the Senses]]\". This is a wink to the explicit 1976 [[Nagisa Oshima]] film of the same name in which a man urges his lover to insert a hard-boiled egg in her [[vagina]] and \"lay it\".\n\nJustin Bond's line, \"As my dear, departed friend [[Lotus Weinstock]] used to say, 'I used to want to change the world. Now I just want to leave the room with a little dignity',\" refers to a stand-up line from real-life comedian Lotus Weinstock, a Los Angeles-based performer. Mitchell was friendly with Weinstock and her daughter, singer-songwriter [[Lili Haydn]], before Weinstock died in 1997.\n\nThe film playing in the first ''Shortbus'' salon scene is, in effect, an elaborate \"erotic\" joke. It is entitled \"Saverio\" and was directed by Mitchell as a tribute to a 70s-era short film ''Calma''. The score song is \"Kids\" by John LaMonica, which appears on the film soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in [[North America]] on October 13, 2006, distributed by [[THINKFilm]], after [[Film premiere|premiering]] in May at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4308963/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Shortbus |access-date=2009-12-17|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and it played in over 25 countries, winning multiple awards at the [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Zurich]], and [[Gijon]] [[Film Festival|film festivals]]. Howard Gertler and Tim Perell received an [[Independent Spirit Award]] as Producers of the Year.\n\nIn January 2022, [[Oscilloscope Laboratories]] rereleased Shortbus as a 4k restoration. It is now available for the first time as an online rental with a Blu Ray package being released later in the year.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Shortbus'' received mixed to positive reviews, currently holding a 68% positive score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 127 reviews with an average rating of 6.47/10. The consensus states: \"The sex may be explicit, but Mitchell integrates it into the characters' lives and serves the whole story up with a generous dose of sweetness and wit.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|shortbus|Shortbus}}</ref> The film also has a score of 64 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 27 reviews.<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Shortbus}}</ref>\n\nLou Lumenick from the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote \"Mitchell's adventurous, big-hearted, pansexual mosaic of New Yorkers looking for love and orgasms (not necessarily in that order), is a rare example of a nonporn film that doesn\u2019t exploit graphic sex as a gimmick.\"<ref name = \"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web|author=Alexander Ryll |year=2014|title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Shortbus |publisher=Gay Essential |access-date=22 December 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/films-to-watch-shortbus/}}</ref> Peter Travers from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented \"If there is such a thing as hard-core with a soft heart, this is it.\"<ref name=\"Ryll 2014\"/>\n\n===Public reaction===\nSome have branded the film \"[[Pornography|pornographic]]\". In response, Mitchell says that the dictionary defines ''porn'' as \"material created and viewed for the primary purpose of sexual arousal,\" and argues that the sex in ''Shortbus'' is often purposefully \"de-eroticized\" to \"remove the cloud of arousal to reveal emotions and ideas that might have been obscured by it\": \"Sex, like music, is a universal language. We want to use it to introduce character, evoke emotion, propel the plot.\"\n\nDue to her participation in several unsimulated sex scenes in the film, [[Sook-Yin Lee]] was nearly fired by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], for which she hosted the radio program ''[[Definitely Not the Opera]]'' at the time.  Ultimately, she retained her job as the CBC relented in the face of support for Lee from the public,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/arts/story.html?id=9b153b3a-46b2-424f-aea1-ab780e7cfd4d|title=Sook-Yin Lee's film debut definitely not CBC fare|last=Stone|first=Jay|date=22 May 2006|publisher=The Ottawa Citizen (via Canada.com|access-date=2006-07-24}}</ref> as well as from celebrities such as [[Gus Van Sant]], [[Atom Egoyan]], [[David Cronenberg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Michael Stipe]], [[Moby]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Yoko Ono]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/lifestyle/article.jsp?content=20060605_128191_128191|title=Sook-Yin Lee shocker in Cannes|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|date=2 June 2006|publisher=Macleans.com|access-date=2007-04-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530011452/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/lifestyle/article.jsp?content=20060605_128191_128191|archive-date=30 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Korea Media Rating Board]] banned the film from public screenings in [[South Korea]] in 2007 for its sex scenes and gay content, although it still screened at film festivals not subject to the Board's authority.
