At the wedding of Min-Min's brother A-Di, NJ runs into ex-girlfriend Sherry, who gives him her number before leaving. Sherry is married to an American and lives in [[Chicago]]. After the reception, Min-Min's mother, who lives with the family, suffers a stroke that leaves her comatose. She is put on life support and the doctor urges the Jians to talk to her daily.\n\nNJ is dissatisfied with his job and his company is struggling financially. To secure client Mr. Ota, NJ's colleagues ask him to take Ota out for dinner, which he reluctantly agrees. They get along well and NJ takes Ota to a bar, where he sings and plays the piano. That night, NJ phones and leaves a message for Sherry, apologizing for leaving her abruptly 30 years ago. Meanwhile, Min-Min becomes depressed by her mother's condition and leaves for a remote Buddhist retreat.\n\nAfter a failed investment, A-Di is kicked out of the house and asks his ex-girlfriend Yun-Yun for help. A-Di is allowed to return upon the birth of his child but a fight breaks out at the baby shower when Yun-Yun shows up uninvited. A-Di and his wife reconcile after she discovers him passed out due to a gas leak at their house.\n\nTing-Ting feels guilty as her grandmother collapsed when she was taking out the trash Ting-Ting was supposed to take out. She befriends her new neighbor, Lili. After Lili breaks up with her boyfriend Fatty, he begins to relay letters for Lili to Ting-Ting. Fatty soon becomes attracted to Ting-Ting and asks her out. After their second date, the two check into a hotel room but they hesitate and leave. Later, Ting-Ting sees Lili back together with Fatty and is later berated by Fatty himself. Ting-Ting becomes depressed and talks to her grandmother, asking her to wake up. She learns the next day that Fatty has been arrested for killing Lili's teacher, who was in a sexual relationship with both Lili and her mother. At home, Ting-Ting dreams of being comforted by her grandmother.\n\nUnwilling to speak to his grandmother because he feels like she can't hear him, Yang Yang starts taking photographs. To punish him for leaving school to buy film, Yang-Yang is forced to face a wall while his teacher circulates his photographs among the other students. Later, after seeing the girl who torments him because she likes him swimming, Yang-Yang teaches himself how to swim to learn more about his tormenter.\n\nNJ is sent by his company to [[Tokyo]] to continue talks with Ota; Sherry also flies to Japan. The two reunite and recount their past; Sherry remains affected by NJ's abrupt departure and NJ attempts to resolve their tensions. They travel to another city and check into a hotel, but when NJ insists on separate rooms, Sherry berates him and breaks down. They return to Tokyo and check back into their respective rooms; before leaving, NJ tells Sherry that he has never loved anyone else. The next day, NJ is informed by his colleague that they have secured a deal with another client and he is to return to Taipei immediately. In response, NJ berates his colleague for abandoning Ota. Later, NJ goes to check on Sherry's room, learning that she has already checked out.\n\nUpon her mother's death, Min-Min returns home and is reunited with her family. At the funeral, NJ's colleague urges him to come back to work but he refuses. Yang-Yang recites a poem in front of her shrine. He recounts their time together, his hope of finding where she went, and a desire to \"tell people what they don't know, show them what they can't see.\" He concludes his poem by saying how his newborn cousin reminds him of her, always saying she's old, as he always wanted to say along with her, \"I am old too.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Wu Nien-jen]] as NJ\n*[[Elaine Jin]] as Min-Min\n*[[Kelly Lee (actress)|Kelly Lee]] as Ting-Ting\n*[[Jonathan Chang]] as Yang-Yang\n*[[Issey Ogata]] as Mr. Ota \n*Chen Hsi-Sheng as A-Di\n*Su-Yun Ko as Sherry \n*Chang Yu Pang as Fatty\n\n==Production and casting==\n''Yi Yi''{{'}}s filming began on April 8, 1999, and lasted until August 21, 1999.
