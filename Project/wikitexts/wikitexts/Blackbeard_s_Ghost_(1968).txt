It was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]].  It is based upon the 1965 novel of the same name by [[Ben Stahl (artist)|Ben Stahl]] and was shot at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]].\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Walker ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]) arrives in a [[New England]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movies.disney.com/blackbeards-ghost|title=Blackbeard's Ghost|website=Disney|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> seacoast fictional town, called Godolphin, to take the position of track coach at Godolphin College. The night of his arrival coincides with a charity bazaar at the hotel where he will be boarding\u2014Blackbeard's Inn, named after the notorious English [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Blackbeard|Captain Edward Teach]] and now run by the Daughters of the Buccaneers, elderly descendants of the pirate's crew. The inn had been built from timbers of ships that had run aground in the bay. The owners are attempting to pay off their mortgage to keep the inn from being bought by the local crime boss, Silky Seymour ([[Joby Baker]]), who wants to build a casino on the land. Steve quickly discovers his track team's shortcomings and runs afoul of the dean of Godolphin College, its football coach, and Seymour. He also makes the acquaintance of attractive Godolphin professor Jo Anne Baker ([[Suzanne Pleshette]]), who is anxious to help the elderly ladies save Blackbeard's Inn.\n\nAfter a bidding war with the football coach at the charity [[auction]], Steve wins an [[antique]] [[bed warmer]] once owned by Blackbeard's 10th wife, Aldetha Teach, who had a reputation of being a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. Inside the hollow wooden handle of this bed warmer is hidden a [[Grimoire|book of magic spells]] that had once been the property of Aldetha. Steve recites, on a lark, a spell \"to bring to your eyes and ears one who is bound in [[Limbo]]\", unintentionally conjuring up the [[ghost]] of Blackbeard ([[Peter Ustinov]]), who appears as a socially-inappropriate drunkard, [[curse]]d by his wife to an existence in limbo unless he can perform a good deed.\n\nSteve and Blackbeard are bound to one another by the power of the spell, and only the very reluctant Steve can see or hear the ghost. As a result, Steve must deal with the antics of the wayward pirate while attempting to revive Godolphin's track team and form a relationship with Jo Anne. Steve is falsely arrested for drunk driving when Blackbeard attempts to drive Steve's automobile, steering it like a pirate ship. Because the arresting officer can't see Blackbeard, and because Blackbeard crashed the cop's motorcycle into a tree, Steve spends a night in jail. While in jail, Steve reminds Blackbeard that if he does a good deed, his curse will be broken. Steve asks Blackbeard for his treasure to help the Daughters of the Buccaneers save the inn, but Blackbeard admits that he spent all of the money. Steve decides not to trust Blackbeard.\n\nSteve is released from jail the next morning due to lack of evidence but is put on probation with the college, forced to win the big track meet or be fired from his position. The problem is that Steve's team is sorrowfully weak and ordinarily do not stand a chance at winning. Blackbeard is firmly told by Steve, more than once, not to interfere with the boys on his team or the opposing team either. But Blackbeard creates further complications by stealing one of the Inn's mortgage payments and betting it on Steve's track team. Blackbeard's intention is to use his ghostly powers to help Godolphin win the track meet, and then use the winnings to pay the mortgage in full. Steve is at first outraged by the pirate's interference, but he decides the greater good is to win the money for the sake of the Inn. He also accepts the pirate's help in shaking down Silky Seymour and his thugs after Seymour refuses to pay out the winnings from the bet.\n\nWith the mortgage paid, Blackbeard has performed his good deed and is released from the curse. After Steve asks the ladies and Jo Anne to recite the spell, thereby rendering Blackbeard visible to them, Blackbeard bids them all a cordial goodbye and departs to join his former crew, leaving Steve and Jo Anne to pursue their future together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Blackbeard|Captain Blackbeard]]\n*[[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as Steve Walker\n*[[Suzanne Pleshette]] as Jo Anne Baker\n*[[Elsa Lanchester]] as Emily Stowecroft\n*[[Joby Baker]] as Silky Seymour\n*[[Elliott Reid]] as TV commentator\n*[[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Dean Roland Wheaton\n*[[Norman Grabowski]] as Virgil\n*[[Kelly Thordsen]] as Motorcycle Cop\n*[[Michael Conrad]] as Pinetop Purvis\n*[[Herbie Faye]] as Croupier\n*[[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as Head official\n*[[Henry Z Jones, Jr.|Hank Jones]] as Gudger Larkin\n*[[Ned Glass]] as Teller\n*[[Gil Lamb]] as Waiter\n*[[Alan Carney]] as Bartender\n*[[Ted Markland]] as Charles\n*[[Lou Nova]] as Leon\n*[[Charlie Brill]] as Edward\n*[[Herb Vigran]] as Danny Oly\n*[[William Fawcett (actor)|William Fawcett]] as Mr. Ainsworth, Bank Official \n*[[Betty Bronson]] as Old Lady \n*[[Elsie Baker]] as Old Lady\n*[[Kathryn Minner]] as Old Lady\n*Sara Taft as Old Lady\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and called it \"Disney's best since ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and a splendid vehicle for the many talents of Peter Ustinov.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/blackbeards-ghost-1968 |title=Blackbeard's Ghost |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=April 17, 1968 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=April 14, 2019 }}</ref> [[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The Walt Disney people have delivered a delightful seasonal goody for the young and young-hearted, called ''Blackbeard's Ghost''.
