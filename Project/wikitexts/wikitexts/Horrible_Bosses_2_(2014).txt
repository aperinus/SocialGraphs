A sequel to 2011's ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'', the film stars [[Jason Bateman]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Chris Pine]], and [[Christoph Waltz]]. The plot follows Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis), and Dale (Day) as they kidnap the son (Pine) of a millionaire investor (Waltz) in order to blackmail him out of revenge after he screws them over on a business deal. It was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on November 26, 2014, received mixed reviews and grossed $107 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the [[Horrible Bosses|first film]], Nick, Dale, and Kurt invent a car wash-inspired shower head, the \"Shower Buddy\". They are approached by Bert Hanson and his son Rex, and Bert agrees to invest if they can make 100,000 units.\n\nWith a business loan, the trio outfit a warehouse, producing the quota. However, Bert backs out, as he never signed an agreement, and tells them that he plans to take their inventory in [[foreclosure]] and sell them (renamed as the \"Shower Pal\") himself, leaving them in debt $500,000 with their outstanding loan.\n\nSeeking financial advice, the three visit Nick's imprisoned former boss, Dave Harken, who says they have no feasible legal way to recover their losses. They then resolve to kidnap Rex for [[ransom]]. Seeking \"Motherfucker\" Jones' help, he suggests keeping the victim unconscious the entire kidnapping. Their ransom note asks for $500,000. They go to the office of Dale's former boss, Dr. Julia Harris, to steal [[nitrous oxide]]. While there, Kurt and Dale are almost caught by members of Julia's [[sex addiction]] [[support group]]; once they leave, Nick distracts Julia, allowing Dale and Kurt to escape.\n\nAt Rex's, while hiding in the closet, Dale accidentally knocks them out with the gas. Waking up in the morning, Rex is gone. Returning to the warehouse, they find him tied up in their trunk. Getting out, he reveals he found them in his closet, but stages his own kidnapping. Rex sent the ransom note to Bert, increasing the ransom to $5 million. The three doubt Rex's plan, but he threatens to go to the police if they back out. They call Bert to inform him of Rex's kidnapping, threatening to kill him if the police are summoned. However the police, led by Detective Hatcher, subsequently arrive at the warehouse to question the suspects.\n\nWhen the police leave, Rex breaks down, as Bert cares more about his money than him. Now sympathetic, the trio agrees to do the fake kidnapping together. They form a plan to outsmart the police and get the ransom money. Using untraceable phones, a basement garage to block out any tracking signal, and Kurt disguised as Bert. While the plan is in motion, the trio realize Kurt left Bert his own phone instead of the untraceable one. Nevertheless they use Kurt's phone to give Bert the instructions. Before leaving, Julia arrives, demanding Dale sleep with or she will report them for breaking into her office. Dale's wife Stacy, with their three daughters, unexpectedly arrives. Believing he is cheating with Julia, she storms off. Dale angrily locks Julia in the bathroom so they can leave.\n\nIn the basement garage, they demand Bert give them the money and the cell phone. However, Bert is [[Patricide|killed by Rex]], who reveals that, when his father did not care about him, he decided to kill him, framing them to inherit everything. As they are pursued by the police, Jones arrives. Anticipating they would be killed, he was going to take the ransom money himself.\n\nJones drives them to the warehouse so they can prove their innocence. Upon arrival, he escapes with the money and the police find Rex tied up. Before they arrest the trio, Kurt's phone rings in Rex's pocket; the police recognize the [[ringtone]] as that left to Bert by the kidnappers. When Rex claims the phone is his, Hatcher asks why he did not call the police if he had a phone, so he takes him hostage. When Dale attempts to attack Rex, Rex shoots him. Hatcher subdues and arrests him, thanks to the distraction.\n\nDale wakes up in the hospital. As Dale helped save Hatcher's life, the charges were dropped. Julia helped with Stacy, although hints at having [[rape]]d him during his coma and promises to have sex with his wife as well. In the end, their business goes into foreclosure but Harken buys it, allowing the trio to stay employed. Jones, meanwhile, uses the ransom money to invest in [[Pinkberry]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Nick Hendricks\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Kurt Buckman\n* [[Charlie Day]] as Dale Arbus\n* [[Chris Pine]] as Rex Hanson\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Dr. Julia Harris\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Dean \"Motherfucker\" Jones\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as David Harken\n* [[Christoph Waltz]] as Bert Hanson\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Detective Hatcher\n* [[Lindsay Sloane]] as Stacy Arbus\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Mike\n* [[Kelly Stables]] as Rachel\n* [[Jerry Lambert (actor)|Jerry Lambert]] as Skip\n* [[Brianne Howey]] as Candy\n* [[Lennon Parham]] as Roz\n* [[Suzy Nakamura]] as Kim\n* Brandon Richardson as Blake\n* [[Keeley Hazell]] as Miss Lang\n* Bruno Amato as Sex Addict Police Officer\n* [[Sam Richardson (actor)|Sam Richardson]] as Producer\n* [[Andy Buckley]] as Surveillance Audio Agent\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as [[Pinkberry]] Executive\n* [[Brendan E.
