Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 11th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Written and directed by [[Joss Whedon]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Elizabeth Olsen]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Cobie Smulders]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Hayley Atwell]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[James Spader]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]].<!--Order is based on the billing block from the film's official poster --> In the film, the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] fight [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]], an [[artificial intelligence]] accidentally created by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] (Downey) and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] (Ruffalo) with the goal of causing [[human extinction]].\n\nThe sequel was announced in May 2012 after the successful release of ''The Avengers'', with Whedon set to return as writer and director in August. Whedon updated Ultron's origin for the film to involve the MCU's Avengers team, and introduced the characters [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] to whom Marvel shared the rights with [[20th Century Fox]]. Casting began in June 2013 with the re-signing of Downey. [[Second unit]] filming began in February 2014 in South Africa with [[principal photography]] taking place between March and August, primarily at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey, England]]. Additional footage was filmed in Italy, South Korea, Bangladesh, the state of New York, and around England. With an estimated net production budget of $365&nbsp;million, the film is the [[List of most expensive films|second most expensive film ever made]].\n\n''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 13, 2015, and was released in the United States on May 1, 2015, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, becoming the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

Two sequels have been released: ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<!-- Please note! Current consensus is to NOT include Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars here because, while they are Avengers franchise films, given the nature of the MCU, they have less correlation to the Avengers films that have released to date.

They meet two of Strucker's test subjects\u2014twins [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro]] (who has superhuman speed) and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] (who has telepathic and telekinetic abilities)\u2014and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.\n\nStark and Banner discover an [[artificial intelligence]] within the [[Infinity Stones|scepter's gem]], and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at [[Avengers Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|their headquarters]]. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] in [[Johannesburg]] to get [[vibranium]]. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to turn into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.<!-- Please note the term \"Hulkbuster\" is not used in the film -->{{refn|name=Hulkbuster|group=N|While the name of the anti-Hulk armor, usually referred to as the \"[[Hulkbuster armor|Hulkbuster]]\" in comic books, is not spoken in the film, its deployment system and containment cell are code-named \"Veronica\".<ref name=HulkbusterOfficial /><ref name=\"Veronica\" /> Director Joss Whedon said the name alludes to the character [[Veronica Lodge]] from [[Archie Comics]]: \"I just decided to call it Veronica because [Bruce Banner] used to be in love with a girl named [[Betty Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty]] and Veronica is the opposite of that,\" making the connection to [[Archie Andrews|Archie]]'s love interest, [[Betty Cooper]].<ref name=\"Veronica\" />}}\n\nA worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse. Thor departs to consult with Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend [[Helen Cho]]. They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.\n\nThe Avengers fight among themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still working after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, based on his vision that the gem on its brow is the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. This \"[[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]]\" earns their trust by being worthy of lifting Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. Vision and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a [[Helicarrier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarrier]] with [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]], [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]], while Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body.\n\nLater, with the Avengers having established [[New Avengers Facility|a new base]] run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]] to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated major events. As Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and Wanda.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] dons a gauntlet<!-- Note: the gauntlet is not named in the film -->{{refn|name=Gauntlet|group=N|The Infinity Gauntlet seen at the end of the film is not the same as the one seen in [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]]'s vault in [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]] in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"Gauntlet\" /> The Asgard Gauntlet is revealed to be a fake in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"FakeGauntlet\" />}} and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Avengers Age of Ultron SDCC 2014 panel.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />The [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]<ref name=\"MTV3\" /><ref name=\"StarkBankroll\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with [[Iron Man's armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|electromechanical suits of armor]] of his own invention.<ref name=\"Downey2\" /> On how his character evolves after the events of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), Downey said, \"I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the world\u2014which is what he has been doing\u2014still didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little [[PTSD]].

You want it vice versa [...] So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" />\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: <br />The leader of the Avengers<ref name=\"MTV3\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> and a [[World War II]] veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.<ref name=\"Evans\" /><ref name=\"Evans2\" /> Evans stated that since the fall of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now \"looking to understand where he belongs, not just as a soldier, as Captain America, but as Steve Rogers, as a person.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeed\" /> Evans said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' by working out up to an hour a day.<ref name=\"Evans3\" /> Regarding Captain America's fighting style, Evans felt he did not want to take a step back from the skills shown in ''The Winter Soldier'', making sure Rogers' fight style advanced, showing \"a consistent display of strength\", and having Rogers utilizing his environment.<ref name=\"Fandango\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: <br />An Avenger who formerly worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. as a highly trained spy.<ref name=\"Johansson\" /> Producer [[Kevin Feige]] stated that more of the character's backstory is explored in the film.<ref name=\"BlackWidowBackstory\" /> Johansson elaborated, \"In ''Avengers 2'' we go back [...] we definitely learn more about Widow's backstory, and we get to find out how she became the person you see. All of these characters have deep, dark pasts, and I think that the past catches up to some of us a little bit.\"<ref name=\"Johansson2\" /> Regarding where the film picks up Widow's story, Johansson felt it was a continuation of what was seen for her character in ''The Winter Soldier'', with the fact that \"'[Widow] never made an active choice. [She's] a product of other people's imposition.' That's going to catch up with her. That's bound to have a huge effect. There's got to be a result of that realization [...] You'll see her actively making some choices in her life, for better or worse.\"<ref name=\"Johansson3\" /> A mixture of close-ups, concealing costumes, stunt doubles, and visual effects were used to help hide Johansson's pregnancy during filming.<ref name=\"JohanssonPregnancyEW\" />\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]]: <br />An Avenger and master [[Archery|archer]] who previously worked as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Renner\" /> Whedon said that Hawkeye interacts more with the other characters in the film, as opposed to the first film where the character had been \"possessed pretty early by a bad guy and had to walk around all scowly.\"<ref name=\"MTV2\" /> As the character did not appear in any other of Marvel's [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] films, Whedon stated ''Age of Ultron'' sheds light on to what the character was doing since the end of ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> Renner described the character as \"kind of a loner\" and \"a team player only 'cause he sort of has to be. He's not really a company man. Captain America can be that guy.

Taylor-Johnson also said that Quicksilver was \"very overprotective\" of Scarlet Witch and has \"real anger frustration\", which results in him being easily bored because of a short attention span.<ref name=\"Quicksilver4\" /> Feige stated exploring Quicksilver's relationship with his sister and his backstory growing up in Eastern Europe would help differentiate the character from [[Evan Peters]]' version in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014).<ref name=\"QuicksilverXMen\" /> Taylor-Johnson stated that the running style for Quicksilver went through multiple iterations.<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Much of Taylor-Johnson's scenes were filmed outdoors to give \"life\" to his running, as opposed to running indoors in front of a green screen.<ref name=\"WhedonTwins\" />\n* [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]:<br />The twin sister of Pietro and Avenger who can engage in [[hypnosis]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]].<ref name=\"Olsen/TJConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"TeamUltron\" /> Olsen felt Wanda was \"overly stimulated\" rather than \"mentally insane\" because \"she has such a vast amount of knowledge that she's unable to learn how to control it. No one taught her how to control it properly [...] she can connect to this world and parallel worlds at the same time, and parallel times.\"<ref name=\"TeamUltron\" /> Describing her character's mind control powers, Olsen said that the character is able to do more than manipulating someone's mind, with Wanda Maximoff able to \"feel and see what they feel and see\" by projecting visions that they have never seen.<ref name=\"OlsenIGN\" /> Olsen drew on her relationship with her older brother and her [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen|sisters]] to prepare for the role,<ref name=\"TeamUltron\" /> as well as looking to the comics for inspiration.<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Olsen revealed that Whedon was inspired by dancers as a way to visually represent how the character moves.

They've really managed to maintain all of that\".<ref name=\"BettanySuperHeroHype\" /> Bettany also stated that the Vision feels paternal and protective to a number of people in the film, particularly Scarlet Witch, and has the ability to change his density. Bettany did wire work for the part.<ref name=\"BettanySuperHeroHype\" /> Whedon stated he wanted to include the Vision in a second ''Avengers'' film before he signed onto the first film.<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> Bettany's make-up, which consisted of a mix of [[face paint]] and prosthetics, took two hours to apply with make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead and Nik Williams citing the correct hue of the Vision's skin as the hardest thing to figure out.<ref name=\"MakeUpMag\" /> The prosthetics were ultimately replaced in post-production with CGI elements.<ref name=\"VisionBeforeAfter\" />\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]]: <br />A former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who now works for Stark.<ref name=\"Smulders\" /><ref name=\"SmuldersStark\" /> Describing Hill's situation in the film, Smulders said that after ''The Winter Soldier'', Hill does not \"really know who's a good guy and who's a bad guy and she's trying to figure out that throughout this film.\" She added, \"She's not getting any sleep. She's doing all the work. She doesn't have the kind of manpower that she had in S.H.I.E.L.D.,\"<ref name=\"SmuldersComicCon\" /> instead working for Tony Stark at the Avenger's headquarters \"trying to keep everything running as smoothly as possible [...] it's an entirely different vibe for her.\"<ref name=\"SmuldersEW\" />\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]]: <br />A former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack and a friend of Steve Rogers.<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> Discussing the relationship between Wilson and Rogers, Mackie said that the two characters have a mutual \"soldier respect\", which is explored in the film and in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"Mackie2\" /> Feige said that it was decided to reshoot the final scene of the film to incorporate the new Falcon suit designed for ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), which was released after ''Age of Ultron'', as Falcon was originally shot in his original suit from ''The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"NewFalcon\" /> Mackie stated he did not realize Wilson had become an Avenger until he watched the film at the premiere, as he was only given the script for the scenes he worked on.<ref name=\"MackieAvenger\" />\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peggy Carter]]: A retired officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve and co-founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. who is a former love interest of Steve Rogers.<ref name=\"Atwell\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]]: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]], based on the mythological deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]].<ref name=\"Elba\" />\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />An astrophysicist and friend of Thor.<ref name=\"Skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd said he was originally not supposed to appear in the film, but received a call because \"they'd written a couple of scenes, and I went and did them,\" not knowing if the scenes would appear in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"SkarsgardNov2015\" />\n* [[James Spader]] as [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]: <br />An [[artificial intelligence]] repurposed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner for a pilot peace program that is overwhelmed with a [[god complex]] and now desires to pacify the Earth by eradicating humanity.<ref name=\"Vision2\" /><ref name=\"Spader\" /><ref name=\"EWUltron2\" /><ref name=\"CharacterDescriptions\" /> Director Joss Whedon stated that Spader was his \"first and only choice\" for the role, because of his \"hypnotic voice that can be eerily calm and compelling\" while also being very human and humorous.<ref name=\"Spader3\" /> Feige clarified that Spader's face and body were [[motion capture]]d \"to create a whole performance [...] We did not hire James Spader to do a robot voice.\"<ref name=\"Spader4\" /> Extensive scans were taken of Spader's head and body in preparation for the role.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter3\" /> About the character Whedon said, \"He's always trying to destroy the Avengers, goddamn it, he's got a bee in his bonnet. He's not a happy guy, which means he's an interesting guy. He's got pain. And the way that manifests is not going to be standard robot stuff.\"<ref name=\"EWUltron\" /> Whedon added that Ultron is \"not a creature of logic\u2014he's a robot who's genuinely disturbed. We're finding out what makes him menacing and at the same time endearing and funny and strange and unexpected, and everything a robot never is.\"<ref name=\"EmpireApril2014\" /> Whedon compared Ultron to [[Frankenstein's monster]], saying, \"It's our new ''[[Frankenstein]]'' myth [...] We create something in our own image and the thing turns on us. It has that pain of 'Well, why was I made?

Feige explained that they simply liked the title ''Age of Ultron'' but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs.<ref name=\"Empire\" /> Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that [[Edgar Wright]] had rights to the character first through his inclusion in ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not make sense to bring in a third scientist.<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2015\" /> Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.<ref name=\"MTV\" />\n\nThe title of the film came as a surprise to many fans who were expecting [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], the mastermind behind the events of the first film, to be the main villain in the sequel, with Whedon saying, \"Thanos was never meant to be the next villain. He's always been the overlord of villainy and darkness.\"<ref name=\"Thanos\" /> Commenting on finding the right balance between technology- and fantasy-based heroes in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Feige explained that Iron Man is a technology-based hero, and his films are always based on those; Thor is a fantasy-based hero introduced in the 2011 film [[Thor (film)|of the same name]], which also introduces [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], a fantastical realm in \"the more reality-based MCU\"; and finally, Ultron is \"clearly [...] come[s] out of technology,\" using tools that established in the franchise to construct ''Age of Ultron'' storyline.<ref name=\"ScreenRant\" />\n\nCasting continued into August 2013, with the announcement that [[James Spader]] would play Ultron.<ref name=\"Spader\" /> In November, Marvel confirmed that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] would play the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, respectively.<ref name=\"Olsen/TJConfirmed\" /> Taylor-Johnson had been in negotiations since as early as June,<ref name=\"Quicksilver\" /><ref name=\"Quicksilver2\" /><ref name=\"Quicksilver3\" /> while Olsen's potential involvement was first reported in August.<ref name=\"Olsen\" /><ref name=\"Jackson2\" /> By the end of the year, [[Mark Ruffalo]],<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]],<ref name=\"Evans\" /> [[Samuel L.

What wasn't negotiable was the fact that we were shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films.\" Davis also used [[Blackmagic Design]]'s [[Blackmagic Design#Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera|Pocket Cinema Cameras]] to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, \"The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that we throw at them.\"<ref name=\"BenDavis\" /> About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using many long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary.<ref name=\"WhedonTHRMar2015\" /> To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.<ref name=\"WhedonTwins\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n[[File:Avengers training facility VFX in Avengers Age of Ultron.jpg|thumb|left|The original shot (top) of the new Avengers training facility and the completed shot (bottom) with CG interiors added by [[Method Studios]]<ref name=\"Method\" />]]\nIn June 2014, the [[IMAX Corporation]] announced that the IMAX release of the film would be converted to [[IMAX 3D]].<ref name=\"IMAX3D\" /> Following the completion of principal photography several more cast members were revealed including [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]],<ref name=\"Skarsgard\" /> [[Anthony Mackie]],<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> [[Idris Elba]], and [[Tom Hiddleston]], reprising their roles from previous MCU films.<ref name=\"Elba\" /> However, Hiddleston's scenes did not make the theatrical cut of the film, with Whedon saying what was shot \"didn't play\" and he did not want the film to feel \"overstuffed\".<ref name=\"LokiCut\" /> According to Hiddleston, \"In [[test screening]]s, audiences had overemphasized Loki's role, so they thought that because I was in it, I was controlling Ultron, and it was actually imbalancing people's expectations.\"<ref name=\"HiddlestonReason\" /> Whedon later explained that Elba and Atwell appear in the film because of exploring the psyches of the Avengers from Scarlet Witch's power.<ref name=\"WhedonTwins\" /> In December 2014, Kim's role was revealed as Dr. Helen Cho.<ref name=\"HelenCho\" /><ref name=\"ClaudiaKim\" /> Additional scenes were scheduled to be filmed in January 2015 at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref name=\"Pickup\" /> In February 2015, Marvel confirmed through promotional material that Serkis portrays [[Ulysses Klaue (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ulysses Klaue]] in the film.<ref name=\"SerkisKlaw\" /><ref name=\"CharacterDescriptions\" /> In early April 2015, [[Linda Cardellini]] and [[Julie Delpy]] were confirmed to be part of the film's cast.<ref name=\"Cardellini\" /><ref name=\"Delpy\" /> At the same time, Whedon stated that the film would not contain a [[post-credits scene]], which had become customary for MCU films. Whedon tried to come up with a post-credit scene but felt that he could not top the \"Shawarma scene\" in ''The Avengers'', explaining, \"It didn't seem to lend itself in the same way, and we wanted to be true to what felt right. The first rule of making a sequel is take the best moments and do something else. Don't do the [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] gun trick again differently. Just go somewhere else.

But there's not a post\u2013{{em|post}}\u2013credit scene.\"<ref name=\"Cardellini\" />\n\nIn May 2015, Whedon revealed he was in conflict with Marvel executives and the film's editors about certain scenes in the film. The executives were not \"thrilled\" with the scenes at Hawkeye's farm or the dream sequences the Avengers experience because of Scarlet Witch. Also, Whedon had originally shot a much longer scene with Thor and Selvig in the cave but the final version is shorter as test audiences did not respond well to the original cut.<ref name=\"WhedonMay2015\" /> In the scene, Thor would be possessed by a Norn, a goddess of destiny, while Selvig would quiz her about Thor's hallucination.<ref name=\"EmpirePodcast\" /><ref name=\"ColliderWhedon\" /><ref name=\"ThorPolygon\" /> Additionally, Whedon reiterated he had wanted to include [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]] at the end, but deals for each character (signing of an actress and a deal with [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], respectively) were not completed in time for their inclusion.<ref name=\"WhedonMay2015\" />\n\nThe film contains 3,000 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> completed by ten different visual effects studios, including [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Trixter, [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Animal Logic]], [[Framestore]], [[Lola VFX]], [[Territory Studio|Territory]], Perception, [[Method Studios]], [[Luma Pictures]], and [[The Third Floor, Inc.|The Third Floor]].<ref name=\"Fxguide\" /> ILM opened a facility in London, citing ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' as a catalyst for the expansion,<ref name=\"ILM\" /> and developed a new [[motion capture]] system for the film called Muse, which can better capture an actor's performance and combine different takes.<ref name=\"ILM2\" /> About the motion capture process, Ruffalo called it \"more of a collaboration\" since the technology is advancing, with \"the face capture and the motion capture can now [being] put together, [allowing] you [to] get a lot more latitude as a performer [...] you're no longer constricted by the attributes that you have as a person: your age, or weight, or size.

London-based Territory Studio delivered the screen visuals filled with unique imagery and animations that matched the character using them.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" /> [[Perception (visual effects company)|Perception]] worked on the main-on-end and main titles for the film. Before settling on the marble monument depiction for the main-on-end titles, Perception created three other versions, which were based on Ultron's hive mind ability from the film, \"renderings of power and pure energy\" inspired by classic comic panels, and classic moments for each character. The final design was inspired by war monuments such as the [[Marine Corps War Memorial|Iwo Jima memorial]]. For the main titles, Marvel wanted the typeface to be a direct continuation of the first film.

Graeme McMillan of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' criticized it for its lack of originality, calling it \"pretty much the poster for the first ''Avengers'' movie, except with added flying robots in the background\" and the fact that it incorporated many of the same tropes the other MCU Phase Two film posters did. These included the hero(es) staring off camera; destruction in the background as well as something occurring in the sky; and poor [[Photoshop]] on the poster, highlighting the fact that each of the actors were obviously photographed separately and were later composited together into the poster.<ref name=\"McMillanPoster\" /> Mendelson agreed with many of McMillan's observations, and called the poster \"hilariously photoshopped\".<ref name=\"MendelsonPoster\" />\n\nThe final trailer was \"unlocked\" by fans on March 4, 2015, via the use of hashtags on Twitter, ahead of its broadcast debut during the series premiere of ''[[American Crime (TV series)|American Crime]]'' on March 5.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" /> Mendelson felt \"this [was] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know\" adding, \"Here we have the fourth and final ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final ''Avengers 2'' trailer, then at least on the trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled.\"<ref name=\"ForbesMarTrailer\" /> A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had \"smashed records\" with over 35 million views.<ref name=\"BloombergBoxOffice\" />\n\nIn April 2015, members of the cast presented Downey with the MTV Generation Award at the [[2015 MTV Movie Awards]], along with debuting an exclusive clip from the film.<ref name=\"DowneyMTVGeneration\" /> On April 27, Downey and Renner along with executives from Marvel Entertainment rang the opening bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in celebration of the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"NYSE\" /> Disney spent a total of $26.9 million on television advertisements for the film,<ref name=\"TVMoney\" /> from an estimated total marketing budget of $180 million.<ref name=\"MarketingBudget\" />\n\n===Merchandise===\nIn January 2015, [[Warner Bros.
