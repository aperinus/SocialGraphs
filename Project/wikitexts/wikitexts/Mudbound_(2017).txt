When the Jacksons, a [[African-American|black]] [[sharecropper]] family pass by in a wagon, Henry asks the father, Hap, for help. Henry seems uncomfortable asking and Hap hesitates to reply.\n\nA few years prior, Henry is conned out of renting a home and is forced to live near sharecroppers on a farm outside the town of Marietta, [[Mississippi]] and moves there with his wife Laura, their daughters, and his virulently [[White supremacy|racist]] father, Pappy. The Jackson family, led by tenant farmer Hap and his wife Florence, work the farm's cotton field and dream of owning their own land one day. As World War II begins, Jamie and the Jacksons' eldest son, Ronsel, join the [[United States Army Air Corps]] and [[U.S. Army]], respectively. Both men experience severe war trauma in the [[Western Front (World War II)|European theater]] as Jamie flies [[B-25 bomber]]s and Ronsel commands [[M4 Sherman|tanks]]. Ronsel also falls in love with a white German woman. Meanwhile, in Mississippi both families continue to live in poverty and support each other out of necessity. When the Jacksons' [[mule]] has to be euthanized, Henry offers to rent out his mule but exacts half of the Jacksons' crop in payment; leaving the Jacksons no choice but to accept. Florence also helps the McAllan family when their two young daughters fall ill with [[whooping cough]]; and then Laura offers Florence work helping care for her daughters permanently. Hap, who serves as the preacher for the local black community, falls while helping to build a church, breaking his leg and rendering him unable to work his fields. Laura sneaks money from her husband's safe so Hap can be properly treated by a doctor, much to Henry's disapproval and causing their passionless marriage to worsen.\n\nWhen the war ends, Ronsel and Jamie return home and realize that they have changed but the Mississippi Delta has not. Jamie becomes an alcoholic and suffers from [[PTSD]]. Ronsel, accustomed to the relative lack of racism among Europeans, struggles with racism in Mississippi. They become aware of each other's difficulties and bond over their war experiences. Ronsel questions why Jamie treats him with respect, and Jamie recounts that on a bomber mission a [[Tuskegee Airmen|black fighter pilot]] saved his life. Jamie grows close to Laura but his alcoholism worsens and he drunkenly crashes his truck. Henry leaves on a trip and tells Jamie to depart from the farm before he returns. Ronsel receives a letter and photo from the German woman with whom he had been romantically involved and learns that they had a [[War children|child]] together and she wants him to come to Europe. The photo is of her and, (obviously their,) child. Ronsel shares this with Jamie while driving together when their truck passes Pappy, and Ronsel is forced to duck down to hide. Pappy confronts Jamie about him socializing with Ronsel and scolds him for his drunken behavior and sneers at Laura, claiming she has romantic feelings for Jamie. Later, Ronsel realizes that he lost the photograph which Pappy finds in the truck. Laura confronts Jamie as he prepares to leave and they have sex.\n\nAs Ronsel frantically searches for his photograph, he is ambushed and beaten by Pappy and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Pappy brings Jamie to a barn where the Klan is preparing to kill Ronsel for fathering a child with a white woman. Jamie points a gun at his father in an effort to save his friend and is also beaten by the Klan. As Jamie is restrained, he is told to choose Ronsel's punishment for his crime \u2014 to lose his eyes, tongue or testicles; or death. Through the pain, Jamie whispers \"tongue\" and Ronsel's tongue is cut out. Ronsel is left bound and wounded for his family to find. Later that night, Jamie wakes Pappy who had previously belittled Jamie's war experience because he had not looked into the eyes of the people he killed during the war. Jamie looks Pappy in the eye and smothers him with a pillow.\n\nThe following day, the Jacksons appear to be leaving with their meager belongings in the wagon when they pass Henry and Jamie who are struggling to bury Pappy. Hap accedes to Henry's request to help with the coffin and says a prayer over the grave. In a rebuke to Pappy's wickedness, Hap recites from the [[Book of Job]], verses 14:2\u201312. Jamie approaches the Jacksons' wagon and gives the German woman's letter to Florence, asking her to give it to Ronsel.\n\nMuch later, Jamie moves to the city. Ronsel returns to Europe and reunites with his German lover and their son.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n<!--- Per end credits --->\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Laura McAllan (n\u00e9e Chappell), wife of Henry\n* [[Garrett Hedlund]] as Jamie McAllan, brother of Henry\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Henry McAllan, brother of Jamie\n* [[Mary J.
