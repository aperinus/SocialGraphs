Ip wins and experiences flashbacks of his life, from his early training at the age of seven, to his induction into Wing Chun by his master, [[Chan Wah-shun]] (Yuen Woo-Ping), and his marriage to [[Cheung Wing-sing]] (Song Hye-Kyo).\n\nIp Man's peaceful existence is threatened by the arrival of Gong Yutian (Wang Qing Xiang), the [[Wudang chuan|Wudangquan]] martial arts grandmaster from northern China, who announces that he has already retired and appointed Ma San (Zhang Jin) as his heir in the North. He then concedes that the South should have its own heir. A fight erupts as various masters attempt to challenge Gong, but they are deterred by Ma San. As the Southern masters deliberate on a representative, Gong Yutian's daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) arrives and tries to convince her father not to continue the fight, as she feels the Southern masters are unworthy. Meanwhile, the Southern masters decide on Ip Man to represent them, and Ip proceeds to be tested by three Southern masters before he challenges Gong Yutian.\n\nThe \"fight\" between Ip Man and Gong Yutian turns out to be an exchange of philosophical ideas using a crumbled flat-cake as a metaphor for Chinese unity. Gong proclaims that Ip has shown him the limits of his knowledge and declares Ip the winner. As Gong returns to the North, Gong Er sets out to regain her family's honor by challenging Ip Man. As they agree that \"Kung Fu is about precision,\" whoever breaks a piece of furniture during the fight will be the loser. An intense fight breaks out between Ip Man and Gong Er, which concludes with victory for her after Ip breaks a stairstep while saving her from falling. Ip and Gong Er part on friendly terms, with Ip saying he wants a rematch in the future. They keep in contact by exchanging letters, and Ip intends to bring his family with him to northern China. His plans are soon disrupted by the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937.\n\nDuring the war, Ip Man and his family descend into poverty and he loses his two daughters to starvation. Meanwhile, in northern China, Ma San betrays China in favor of the puppet government in [[Manchukuo|Manchuria]] and kills Gong Yutian as a ''[[hanjian]]''. When Gong Er returns, Mr. Jiang (Shang Tie Long), the family servant, tells her Gong Yutian's final wish was for her to be happy and not to seek vengeance. Gong Er refuses to accept this, and instead makes a vow to [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddha]] to never teach, marry, or have children, devoting her life to vengeance against Ma San.\n\nIp Man moves to [[Hong Kong]] in 1950 in the hope of starting a career as a martial arts teacher. He spars with and defeats other martial artists, soundly earning a reputation. The Chinese government [[Frontier Closed Area|closes the border with Hong Kong]] in 1951 and Ip never sees his wife again. He meets Gong Er again on [[Chinese New Year's Eve]] 1950 and asks her for one more contest while implying that she should rebuild her martial art school. Gong Er refuses, stating that many martial arts have disappeared throughout the course of history, and that her family's would not be the only one. A flashback 10 years earlier shows a confrontation between Gong Er and Ma San at a train station on Chinese New Year's Eve 1940, in which Gong Er defeats Ma San using one of her father's special moves that Ma San had failed to learn. Gong Er loses her desire to use martial arts and moves to Hong Kong with Mr. Jiang to open a clinic.\n\nIn 1952, Ip Man and Gong Er meet each other for the last time. Gong confesses to Ip that she has harbored romantic feelings for him since their first fight. She dies in 1953, taking her father's secrets of the [[Baguazhang]] to the grave. A voice-over from Ip reveals that the fight with Ma San left Gong badly injured, and she turned to opium to help with the pain. Ip Man's Wing Chun school flourishes, and he is able to popularize the once secretive and elitist martial art on a worldwide scale. Ip trains a young boy who grows up to be his most famous student: [[Bruce Lee]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}{{div col end}}\n\n'''Main Characters'''\n\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as [[Ip Man]] (Ye Wen), disciple of Chan Wah-shun and a grandmaster of the Foshan [[Wing Chun]] martial art style from Southern China.

It reached Number 1 in Hong Kong's iTunes Original Score.\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 78% of 138 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Though its storytelling is a tad muddled, Wong Kar Wai's ''The Grandmaster'' still exhibits the auteur's stylistic flourishes in gorgeous cinematography and explosive action set pieces.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_grandmaster |title=The Grandmaster (2013) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grandmaster |title=The Grandmaster Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Variety'' gave the film a positive review, stating Wong \"exceeds expectations with 'The Grandmaster,' fashioning a 1930s action saga into a refined piece of commercial filmmaking\". The review also says, \"Boasting one of the most propulsive yet ethereal realizations of authentic martial arts onscreen, as well as a merging of physicality and philosophy not attained in Chinese cinema since [[King Hu]]'s masterpieces, the hotly anticipated pic is sure to win new converts from the genre camp.\"<ref name=\"Variety_review\"/>\n\nWhile praising Tony Leung's Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi's Gong Er, calling the latter \"more or less complete and coherent\", ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' lamented some of the more underdeveloped characters stating that \"the same can't be said of some of the other characters, such as Chang Chen\u2019s Razor, an expert of the Bajiquan school who is supposed to be another of the grandmasters.
