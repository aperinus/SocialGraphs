It is the second installment in the [[Has Fallen|''Has Fallen'' film series]], the sequel to [[Antoine Fuqua]]'s 2013 film ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'' and stars [[Gerard Butler]], [[Aaron Eckhart]] and [[Morgan Freeman]], with [[Alon Abutbul|Alon Moni Aboutboul]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Melissa Leo]], [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Sean O'Bryan]], [[Waleed Zuaiter]] and [[Charlotte Riley]] in supporting roles. The film follows a plot to assassinate the world leaders of the [[G7]] as they attend the [[British Prime Minister]]'s funeral in London and Secret Service agent Mike Banning's efforts to protect United States President Benjamin Asher from being killed by terrorists.\n\nFilming began in London on October 24, 2014. A Christmas break started in November with filming resuming in February 2015. The film was released by [[Focus Features]] under their recently revived [[Gramercy Pictures]] label on March 4, 2016, and grossed $205 million worldwide.\n\nA third film, titled ''[[Angel Has Fallen]]'', was released on August 23, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n[[G7]] intelligence services locate Pakistani arms trafficker and terrorist mastermind Aamir Barkawi at his compound, and authorize a [[US Air Force]] drone strike during his daughter's wedding, killing Barkawi's family and seemingly Barkawi himself.\n\nTwo years later, British Prime Minister James Wilson suddenly dies, and the G7 prepare to attend his funeral in [[London]]. [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Secret Service Director]] Lynne Jacobs assigns agent Mike Banning to lead [[American President]] Benjamin Asher's overseas security detail, even though Banning's wife Leah is due to give birth in a few weeks. The entourage arrives via [[Air Force One]] at [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted Airport]], and Banning arranges an earlier arrival at [[Somerset House]] in London via [[Marine One]].\n\nAs Asher's [[Presidential State Car (United States)|Presidential State Car]] arrives at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a large army of [[mercenaries]] led by Barkawi's son Kamran launch coordinated attacks on the city disguised as [[Metropolitan Police]], the [[Queen's Guard]]smen, and other [[first responder]]s, killing five world leaders, damaging major landmarks and generating mass panic. Asher's early arrival throws off the St. Paul's attack, and Banning returns him and Jacobs to Marine One. The terrorists destroy the helicopter's escorts with [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]], forcing the damaged helicopter to crash-land in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Fatally injured, Jacobs makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child, and to punish those responsible for the attack. Banning escorts Asher into the [[London Underground]] as the city's power is lost and residents shelter indoors.\n\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], [[American Vice President]] Allan Trumbull investigates the incident with British authorities while trying to track down the President. He receives a call from Barkawi, still alive and operating in [[Sanaa]]. Seeking revenge for the drone strike that killed his daughter, and having poisoned Wilson to lure the G7 to London, Barkawi promises to broadcast Asher's execution online if Kamran captures him. Trumbull orders his staff to locate Barkawi's known terrorist operatives and find any connection to the attack, while British authorities stand down all first responders so any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.\n\nAfter leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite, Banning leads Asher to an MI6 safe-house, where agent Jacquelin \"Jax\" Marshall briefs them. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that they saw Banning's sign and an extraction team is en route. Security monitors display an approaching [[Delta Force]] team, but Banning realizes they have arrived too soon and are actually Barkawi's mercenaries. He fights and kills all of them and drives away with Asher, but their car is struck before they can reach the [[Embassy of the United States, London|United States Embassy]], and Asher is taken. Banning is rescued by the combined Delta/[[Special Air Service|SAS]] extraction team, who suspect a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] in the British government.\n\nTrumbull's staff identify a building owned by one of Barkawi's front companies, drawing massive power despite being unoccupied, and realize it is Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building, arriving seconds before Kamran can decapitate Asher on camera. Kamran escapes when his hacker Sultan Mansoor drops a grenade with his dying breath, forcing Banning to protect Asher from the blast. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad using an explosive that Mike had planted earlier, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall helps British authorities restore London's security system and confronts [[MI5]] Intelligence Chief John Lancaster, learning that he was Barkawi's mole, having left his security fingerprints in the system. Lancaster claims his motive was to prove that the current military budget left the country vulnerable to terrorism and attempts to convince Marshall to join his cause, but she kills him. Trumbull tells Barkawi that his plan failed, moments before [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal authorities]] attack his base with another [[drone strike]], killing Barkawi and every other member of his terrorist group.\n\nTwo weeks later, as London recovers, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child Lynne, named after Jacobs. As Banning contemplates sending a letter of resignation, he watches Trumbull speak on television regarding the recent events, with a message that the U.S. will prevail. Inspired, Banning deletes the letter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[United States Secret Service]] Agent and former [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] Mike Banning\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as [[List of fictional presidents of the United States (A\u2013B)#President Benjamin Asher|President Benjamin Asher]]\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Vice President Allan Trumbull, the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and acting president, now Vice President of the United States after the death of Charlie Rodriguez\n* [[Alon Abutbul|Alon Moni Aboutboul]] as Aamir Barkawi, a Pakistani international [[arms trafficking|arms trafficker]] and terrorist mastermind who is No. 6 on the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|FBI's 10 Most Wanted]] list\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as [[Director of the United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service Director]] Lynne Jacobs\n* [[Robert Forster]] as [[United States Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] Edward Clegg, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[White House Deputy Chief of Staff]] DC Mason\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] Ruth Macmillan\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Leah Banning, Mike's wife\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as [[Deputy Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Deputy Director]] Ray Monroe\n* [[Waleed Zuaiter]] as Kamran Barkawi, Aamir Barkawi's son and sub-commander\n* [[Charlotte Riley]] as [[MI6]] Agent Jacquelin Marshall\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as Sir Kevin Hazard, Commissioner (credited as Chief) of the [[Metropolitan Police]]\n* [[Bryan Larkin]] as [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Commander Will Davies\n* [[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]] as [[MI5]] Counter-Intelligence Chief John Lancaster\n* [[Mehdi Dehbi]] as Sultan Mansoor, the terrorist hacker\n* [[Adel Bencherif]] as Raza Mansoor, Sultan's brother and a terrorist\n* [[Michael Wildman]] as [[United States Secret Service]] Agent Voight\n* [[Andrew Pleavin]] as United States Secret Service Agent Bronson\n* [[Deborah Grant]] as Doris, Leah's mother\n* Clarkson Guy Williams as [[British Prime Minister]] Leighton Clarkson, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after Wilson's death.\n* [[Penny Downie]] as [[Home Secretary]] Rose Kenter\n* Philip Delancy as [[French President]] Jacques Mainard, the President of France who is killed by a cargo ship planted with explosives, making him the final world leader to die.\n* [[Alex Giannini]] as [[Italian Prime Minister]] Antonio Gusto, the Prime Minister of Italy who is the fourth world leader to be killed by an explosion caused by terrorists at Westminster Abbey.
