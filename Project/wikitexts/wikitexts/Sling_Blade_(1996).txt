He has been in the custody of the state [[mental hospital]] since the age of 12 after having murdered his mother and her lover with a [[sling blade]]. As a passive person, Karl is often forced by serial rapist Charles to listen to stories of his criminal history as a convicted sexual predator. In the mid-1990s, the state determines Karl is no longer dangerous and releases him to his small home town, where he finds work at a small engine repair shop.\n\nKarl befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley and shares details of his past, including the killings. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda, and her friend and boss, Vaughan. Vaughan is concerned about Karl's history, but Linda asks him to move into her garage, angering her abusive and alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle. Vaughan tells Karl that he fears Doyle could hurt or kill Linda and Frank one day.\n\nKarl becomes a role model to Frank, who misses his real father who died, and despises Doyle. As they grow closer, Karl tells Frank that he is haunted by an incident that happened when he was six or eight years old. His parents performed an abortion of his unwanted baby brother and gave him the body to dispose of. Karl found the infant still moving and buried him alive. Karl later visits his father, who has become a sickly and spiteful hermit. Karl scolds him for his cruelty, and tells him that he had thought about killing him. But now that he sees him, Karl thinks it is better to let him live in his squalor, and that he will be dead soon enough.\n\nDuring Doyle's latest drunken outburst, refusing to leave Linda's house, Frank fights back. Linda later reconciles with Doyle, who announces that he will move in. He tells Karl that he is no longer welcome. When Frank protests, Doyle grabs him, but Karl intervenes and warns him never to touch Frank again.\n\nRealizing that an unhappy childhood or worse awaits Frank, Karl persuades him and Linda to spend the night at Vaughan's house. Later that evening, he returns to the Wheatley home carrying a lawn mower blade, and finds Doyle drunk and alone in the living room. Doyle asks Karl what he is doing with the lawn mower blade, and Karl says he intends to kill Doyle with it. Karl then asks Doyle how to telephone the police, and Doyle tells him to dial 9-1-1 and ask for the police, or a hearse. Karl then kills Doyle with the lawn mower blade. He dials 911, and then sits down at the kitchen table, eating biscuits and mustard as he waits for the authorities. \n\nReturned to the state hospital, Karl is more assertive. Charles tells him more stories about his sex crimes, and then questions Karl about his relationship with Frank. This angers Karl, and he tells Charles to never speak to him again. As Charles walks away, Karl turns and looks out of a window toward an open field.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Karl Childers<ref name=\"miramax\" />\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as Doyle Hargraves<ref name=\"miramax\" />\n* [[J.
