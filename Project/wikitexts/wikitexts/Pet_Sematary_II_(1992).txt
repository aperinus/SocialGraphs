The screenplay was written by [[Richard Outten]]. It is the sequel to the film ''[[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|Pet Sematary]]'' (1989) which was based on [[Stephen King]]'s 1983 novel [[Pet Sematary|of the same name]]. The film stars [[Edward Furlong]], [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]], and [[Clancy Brown]]. ''Pet Sematary Two'' was theatrically released in the United States on August 28, 1992, by [[Paramount Pictures]] and grossed $17.1 million worldwide. It received negative reviews from critics, but [[Clancy Brown]]'s performance received critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nA few years after the events of the first film and following the accidental death of his mother Renee, 13-year-old Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father, Chase, move to [[Ludlow, Maine]], his mother's hometown. He's introduced to the belligerent town sheriff, Gus Gilbert, and his stepson, Drew, whom Gus abuses relentlessly. Jeff also draws the ire of local bully Clyde Parker, who tells him the story of the Creed family and the legend of the [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] burial ground.\n\nOne night, Gus shoots and kills Drew's beloved dog Zowie after the dog disturbs him during sex. Drew asks Jeff to help him bury the dog in the Mi\ua78ckmaq burial ground to see if the rumors are true that it can resurrect the dead. Zowie does indeed return from the dead but is uncharacteristically fierce. Chase treats Zowie for his gunshot wound, which refuses to heal; even more bizarre is the fact that Zowie has no heartbeat. Chase sends a sample of Zowie's blood to a lab. It turns out that Zowie's cells have completely deteriorated and are no different from those of a dead canine.\n\nJeff and Drew go to the Pet Semetery on Halloween for a night of horror stories with local boys. When Gus finds out that Drew's mother allowed him to go despite being grounded, he rushes to the cemetery and breaks up the party. He attacks his stepson, but just as he is about to hit him with a grave marker, Zowie appears. The dog fatally mauls Gus, whom the boys subsequently bury at the Indian burial ground. Gus returns to life; he now moves stiffly and rarely speaks, but treats Drew better. Over time, Gus becomes increasingly crude and sadistic, [[sexually assaulting]] Drew's mother and brutally skinning the pet rabbits for supper.\n\nZowie breaks out of the veterinary clinic and kills three cats before entering Chase's home and attacking him. A day later, Jeff encounters Clyde, who is about to sever Jeff's nose using the wheel spokes of his own bicycle when Gus shows up. He sends Jeff home, then murders Clyde as Drew looks on. Gus then pursues Drew to their house, where the boy is trapped with the savage Zowie. He escapes through a window just as his mother arrives home in her car, and the two take off. Gus pursues them at high speed in his squad car, eventually killing them both by ramming their car into an oncoming potato truck. Gus then returns to Clyde's body and puts it in a body bag, intending to take it to the burial ground as well.\n\nAfter Drew's funeral, Jeff decides to reanimate his mother by using the Indian burial ground's power. Gus exhumes her corpse and brings it to Jeff at the burial ground. When Chase hears that his wife's grave has been robbed, he rushes to the Gilbert house. There, he is attacked by Zowie and Gus, and he shoots and kills them both.\n\nUpon coming back to life, Renee stabs and kills Marjorie Hargrove, the Matthews' housekeeper. Jeff confronts his undead mother in the attic, and they embrace. Chase arrives home and urges Jeff to get away from Renee, who says she wants to spend quality time with her husband. An undead Clyde arrives and, after knocking Chase out, tries to kill Jeff \u2014 first with an axe and then with an ice skate. Renee locks Chase and both boys in the attic, which she then sets on fire.\n\nJeff kills Clyde with a severed [[Live wire (electricity)|livewire]] and then breaks down the attic door to escape. Not letting both Jeff and Chase leave, Renee says that she wants the three of them to work things out. Renee wants Jeff to stay and join her in death, saying she loves him. But Jeff drags his father out of the house as Renee is destroyed by the flames while shrieking \"Dead is better!\" In the final scene, a recovering Chase locks up his veterinary clinic before he and his son leave Ludlow behind.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Edward Furlong]] as Jeff Matthews\n*Jason McGuire as Drew Gilbert\n*[[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Dr. Chase Matthews\n*[[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Renee Hallow-Matthews\n*[[Jared Rushton]] as Clyde Parker\n*Sarah Trigger as Marjorie Hargrove\n*[[Lisa Waltz]] as Amanda Gilbert\n*[[Clancy Brown]] as Gus Gilbert\n\n==Production==\nParamount was anxious to follow up on the success of ''Pet Sematary'' with a sequel and invited Mary Lambert to return and direct. She has stated that her original concept for the film would have involved Ellie Creed as the central character, the only survivor from the first film. However, Paramount was not confident in making the film's lead a teenage girl, so the story was written with completely new characters and a male protagonist.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgF7VnuIlXg&t=1854s  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/bgF7VnuIlXg |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live| title=Pet Sematary Panel with Mary Lambert & Denise Crosby | publisher=Youtube.com | date=2013-05-07 | access-date=2017-06-12 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> Thirteen-year-old Furlong was cast in the lead role, capitalizing on his rise to fame in the previous year's blockbuster ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/1994/04/15/edward-furlongs-rocky-career/|title=Edward Furlong's rocky career|last=Karlin|first=Susan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1994-04-15|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>  Shooting took place in [[Coweta County, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Explorer's Guide Georgia|last1=Thalimer|first1=Carol|last2=Thalimer|first2=Dan|publisher=[[The Countryman Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9781581571448|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KVBZ8PigSkC&pg=PA99}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[Stephen King]], who wrote the novel upon which the first film was based, had his name removed from the film prior to its release.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-14/entertainment/ca-973_1_stephen-king|title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies. : KING'S KINGDOM : We Get It All the Way Up to the Mercedes Part|last=Marx|first=Andy|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1992-06-14|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> The film debuted at #3.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Honeymoon' Is Unforgiving|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-01/entertainment/ca-6948_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2012-06-03}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n[[Paramount Home Video]] released ''Pet Sematary Two'' on VHS in April 1993,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-23/entertainment/ca-26239_1_gay-theme|title=Gay Theme Not Lost in 'Cranes' Marketing|last=Hunt|first=Dennis|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-04-23|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> and on DVD in September 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2001/Future/ThisWeek0924.html|title=What's Happening This Week|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]|date=2001-09-24|access-date=2015-02-08}}</ref> [[Shout Factory]] released it on Blu-ray on February 25, 2020.\n\nThe original score / soundtrack album was released on CD as a limited edition from La-La Land Records on August 29, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmusicreporter.com/2019/08/28/pet-sematary-two-soundtrack-album-announced/|title='Pet Sematary Two' Soundtrack Album Announced|date=August 28, 2019|website=Film Music Reporter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref> and on limited-edition vinyl (October 11, 2019) and audio cassette (September 3, 2019) from Terror Vision Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/316447/pet-sematary-two-soundtrack-now-on-vinyl-cassette/|title=PET SEMATARY TWO Soundtrack Now on Vinyl & Cassette|last=Sprague|first=Mike|date=January 8, 2020|website=Dread Central|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 22% of 23 critics gave the film a positive review and the average rating was 3.70/10.
