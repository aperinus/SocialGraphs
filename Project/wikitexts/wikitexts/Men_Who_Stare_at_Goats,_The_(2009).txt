It was produced by Clooney's and Heslov's production company [[Smokehouse Pictures]]. The film is a fictionalized version of [[Jon Ronson]]'s [[The Men Who Stare at Goats|2004 book of the same title]] of an investigation into attempts by the U.S. military to employ psychic powers as a weapon \u2014 which, in turn, is a companion to a British miniseries ''Crazy Rulers of the World''.<ref name=\"hr\" /><ref name=\"huffingtonpost1\">{{cite news | last=Sergeant | first=John | title=How My Involvement with The Men Who Stare at Goats Was Erased Entirely | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-sergeant/how-i-was-airbrushed-out_b_362356.html | publisher=[[Huffington Post]] | date=November 18, 2009 | access-date=2010-01-30}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2009, and went on general release in the United States and the United Kingdom on November 6, 2009. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn a short prelude, U.S. Army General Dean Hopgood is painfully thwarted in an attempt to pass paranormally through a solid wall by simply running into it.\n\n''[[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] Daily Telegram'' reporter Bob Wilton's wife leaves him for the editor. To prove himself, Bob flies to Kuwait to report on the Iraq War. He stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when he meets retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] operator Lyn Cassady, who reveals he was part of a unit training psychic spies to develop [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] skills including invisibility, remote viewing, and phasing.\n\nIn 1972, Army officer Bill Django, after falling out of a helicopter in Vietnam, found his newly recruited men unable or unwilling to fire on a Viet Cong soldier before being shot in the chest. He then underwent a fact-finding mission prompted by a vision of a female Viet Cong soldier who says \"their gentleness is their strength.\" Django's mission immersed him in the New Age movement so that, when he returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 1980, he had long braided hair and a tattoo of an [[All-seeing Eye]] surmounting a pyramid on his chest.\n\nFacilitated by the credulous General Hopgood, Django led the training of a [[New Earth Army]], with Lyn Cassady and Larry Hooper as his top students. The two developed a rivalry over their opposing views on implementing the New Earth Army's philosophy. Lyn wanted to emphasize the teachings' positive side, such as resolving conflict peacefully, whereas Larry was interested in the \"dark side\" of its military application.\n\nLyn takes Bob into Iraq. Kidnapped by criminals who want to sell them to insurgents, they escape with fellow hostage Mahmud Daash and are rescued by a private security detail led by Todd Nixon. Fleeing when the detail is caught in a firefight fiasco with another American security detail, Bob and Lyn continue on Lyn's mission prompted by Lyn's vision of Bill Django.\n\nAfter their car is disabled by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] Bob and Lyn wander in the desert. Lyn reveals that he had stopped a goat's heart to test the limit of his mental abilities, and believes this evil deed has cursed him and the New Earth Army. It's also revealed that Hooper conducted an unauthorized [[LSD]] experiment in which a soldier killed himself, forcing Django out of the Army.\n\nBob and Lyn are rescued at a camp run by PSIC, a private research firm engaged in psychic and psychological experiments on a herd of goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob learns the ways of the New Earth Army and they spike the base's food and water with LSD and free the goats and captured locals, in an attempt to remove the curse. Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, disappearing into the sky \"like all [[shaman]]s\".\n\nBob returns to work as a reporter and writes an article about his experience with Lyn. He is frustrated that the story's only portion to be aired is how the captives were forced to listen to the ''[[Barney & Friends]]'' theme song for 24 hours, which dilutes his story to the level of a joke. Bob vows to continue trying to get the bigger story out. He exercises his own psychic abilities and, following some intense concentration, seemingly runs through a solid wall in his office.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Men Who Stare at Goats cast TIFF09-crop.jpg|thumb|350px|From left to right: cast members [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[George Clooney]], and director [[Grant Heslov]] attending the film's premiere at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]\n* [[George Clooney]] as Lyn Cassady, a combination of several real-life psychic spies. Elements of his character are primarily based on Glenn Wheaton and his name resembles that of Lyn Buchanan. His background details match those of [[Guy Savelli]], the man who claims to have killed a goat by staring it down and now runs a dance studio as Lyn does in the film. Also, some of Lyn's actions in the film mimic Peter Brusso's interactions with Ronson, particularly the \"Predator\" scene, and the \"attack me\" scene.<ref name=\"empire2\" />\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Bob Wilton, apparently inspired by Ronson, a mild-mannered investigative journalist who uncovers the bizarre truth.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Bill Django, based on Lt. Col. [[Jim Channon]] who spent two years in the 1970s investigating new age movements, and subsequently wrote an operations manual for a [[First Earth Battalion]]. Also says \"like a boy in a desert planet\" (a reference to [[Luke Skywalker]]) and an \"albatross around his neck\" a reference to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797\u201398 and published in 1798.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Larry Hooper. An apparent original creation for the film, Larry represents the New Earth Army's dark side and wishes to use the non-lethal technologies in harmful ways and is the film's main antagonist.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Todd Nixon, an original character heading up a private security firm in post-invasion Iraq.\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Major General Dean Hopgood, who is based on [[Major General]] [[Albert Stubblebine|Albert Stubblebine III]], and firmly believes people can walk through walls.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" />\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Gus Lacey, who introduces Bob to the New Earth Army's concepts; also somewhat based on Guy Savelli and Lyn Buchanan.\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Major Jim Holtz, a more by-the-book soldier.\n* [[Waleed Zuaiter]] as Mahmud Dash, an Iraqi who gets captured with Cassady and Wilton.\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Scotty Mercer\n* [[Rebecca Mader]] as Debora Wilton\n\nThe film's end titles expand on the characters' factual links with this proviso:\n{{Quotation|Although this film is inspired by John [''sic''] Ronson's book ''The Men Who Stare At Goats'', it is fiction, and while the characters Lynn [''sic''] Cassady and Bill Django are based on actual persons, Sergeant Glenn Wheaton and Colonel [''sic''] Jim Channon, all other characters are invented or are composites, and not portrayals of actual persons. The filmmakers ask that no one attempt walking through walls, cloudbursting while driving, or staring for hours at goats with the intent of harming them...invisibility is fine.|}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Though ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' is a mostly entertaining, farcical glimpse of men at war, some may find its satire and dark humor less than edgy.\"<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/men_who_stare_at_goats/| title=The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Fandango Media]] | access-date = June 3, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-men-who-stare-at-goats| title=The Men Who Stare at Goats Reviews | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | access-date = 10 April 2018}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type \"Men Who Stare at Goats\" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|access-date=February 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nGeorge Clooney's performance was very positively received. Mike Sheridan of [[entertainment.ie]] wrote, \"Clooney shines in this remarkable story, based on actual events...Clooney is now pretty much the sole bearer of the 'classic movie star' tag, and once again, he injects a performance with a [[Coen brothers]] level of quirky.

In turn, Ronson had dedicated his book to journalist and filmmaker [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]], who worked intensely through 2003 and 2004 on the documentary.
