Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nNelson Wright, a medical student, walks onto a beach one day and proclaims \u201ctoday is a good day to die\u201d. He later convinces four of his medical school classmates\u2014Joe Hurley, David Labraccio, Rachel Manus, and Randy Steckle\u2014to help him discover what lies beyond death. Nelson flatlines for one minute before his classmates resuscitate him. While \"dead\", he experiences a sort of afterlife. He sees a vision of a boy he bullied as a child, Billy Mahoney. He merely tells his friends that he cannot describe what he saw, but something is there. The others follow Nelson's daring feat.\n\nJoe flatlines next, and he experiences an erotic afterlife sequence linked to his sexually promiscuous lifestyle. He agrees with Nelson's claim that something indeed exists. After arguing with Rachel and out-bidding her on the length of time that they are willing to remain \u201cdead\u201d David is third to flatline on Halloween, and he sees a vision of a girl, Winnie Hicks, whom he bullied in grade school. The three men start to experience hallucinations related to their afterlife visions. Nelson gets physically assaulted by Billy Mahoney twice. Joe, engaged to be married, is haunted by the women that he surreptitiously videotaped during his sexual dalliances, the women taunting Joe with the same come-ons, lines and false promises he used on them. David is confronted by the 8 year old Winnie Hicks on a train, and she verbally taunts him the way he taunted her.\n\nRachel decides to flatline next. David rushes in, intending to stop the others from giving Rachel their same fate, but she is already \"dead\" when he arrives. Rachel nearly dies permanently when the power goes out and the men are unable to shock her with the [[defibrillator]] paddles. She survives, but she too is haunted by the memory of her father committing suicide when she was young.\n\nThe three men finally reveal their harrowing experiences to one another, and David decides to put his visions to a stop. Meanwhile, Joe's fianc\u00e9e, Anne, comes to his apartment and, having discovered his collection of videos, ends their relationship. Joe's visions cease after Anne leaves him.\n\nDavid goes to visit a now adult Winnie Hicks and apologizes to her. Winnie accepts his apology and thanks him. David immediately feels a weight lifted off his shoulders. David then finds Nelson, who accompanied David to visit Winnie, beating himself with a climbing axe. In Nelson's mind, however, Billy Mahoney is again attempting to beat him to death. David stops him, and they return to town. David later instructs Joe and Steckle to help Nelson find Billy Mahoney and that under no uncertain terms is Nelson to be left alone.\n\nHaving an idea of what Rachel has experienced, David offers to stay with Rachel and they make love. While Rachel and David are together, Nelson takes Steckle and Joe to a graveyard. He reveals that he killed Billy Mahoney as a kid by throwing rocks at him until he fell out of a tree. The two try to tell Nelson that what he did was not intentional, but Nelson makes a cryptic choice about making amends. Confused and worried they ask but Nelson in his furor storms off, leaving Joe and Steckle stranded.\n\nDavid leaves Rachel alone in order to rescue Joe and Steckle at the cemetery. While alone, Rachel goes to the bathroom and finds her father. He apologizes to his daughter and her guilt over his death is lifted when she discovers that he was addicted to morphine and that his suicide was related to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] stemming from his service in the [[Vietnam War]]. Nelson calls Rachel, and he tells her that he needs to flatline again in order to make amends. He apologizes for involving her and their friends in his reckless plan. Rachel tries to tell Nelson that it doesn't matter, but Nelson counters with the belief that everything that they say and do matters.\n\nThe three men realize to their shock what he intends and race to stop Nelson, who has been dead for an estimated nine minutes already. Rachel soon finds them, and the four friends work feverishly to save Nelson. In the afterlife, Nelson is experiencing himself as a young boy being stoned by Billy Mahoney from the tree. Nelson dies in the afterlife from the fall, and his friends cannot revive him. When they are about to give up, Mahoney forgives Nelson, and David gives Nelson one last shock. This brings him back, and Nelson tells them, \"It wasn't such a good day to die.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Nelson Wright\n** Aeryk Egan as Young Nelson\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Rachel Manus\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as David Labraccio\n** John Duda as Young David \n* [[William Baldwin]] as Joe Hurley\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Randy Steckle\n* [[Kimberly Scott]] as Winnie Hicks\n** Kesha Reed as Young Winnie\n* Joshua Rudoy as Billy Mahoney\n* [[Benjamin Mouton (actor)|Benjamin Mouton]] as Jack Manus\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Anne Coldren\n* [[Patricia Belcher]] as Edna\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Housewife\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released ''Flatliners'' theatrically  on August 10, 1990.
