The film is about mistaken identity getting in the way of recovering a stash of diamonds that was stolen and subsequently hidden more than 20 years earlier.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is told primarily in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], as the film first follows a hitman, Critical Jim, who follows and holds at gunpoint a man he believes is Cletis Tout - but who actually is Finch. Because Critical Jim is so fond of [[film noir]] and other classic films (such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''), he's willing to listen to Finch as he tells his story, imagining it as a film in progress. Finch obliges, explaining how he got to be mistaken for Cletis Tout.\n\nFinch happened to be in the same jail with Micah, who stole diamonds more than 20 years before, then hid the diamonds and soon landed in prison. With Finch's help, Micah manages to break out, and the two get new identities for themselves, courtesy of a coroner who owes Finch a favor.\n\nThe problem is that Finch's new identity is that of Cletis Tout, a photojournalist who managed to film a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figure's son strangling a woman. The head of the Mafia gets his men to kill Tout (which is how the coroner got the identity for Finch), but when Finch goes to Tout's apartment to look for his passport, a neighbor calls the police, who inform the mafia head that Cletis Tout is still alive.\n\nAfter Micah meets up with his now grown-up daughter, Tess, he's accidentally shot by the men sent to kill Cletis. Just before dying, Micah gets Finch to promise to watch after his daughter, and thus Tess and Finch begin an uneasy relationship as they look for the diamonds. Meanwhile, the Mafia head decides to bring in a professional hit man, so he contacts Critical Jim to finish the job. Critical Jim is more interested in where Finch's story will end - specifically, if he'll be able to reconcile with Tess in the end, giving the story a perfect Hollywood ending.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Trevor Allen Finch\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Micah Tobias\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Critical Jim\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Tess Donnelly\n* [[RuPaul]] as Ginger Markum\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as Dr. Savian\n* [[Peter MacNeill|Peter MacNeil]] as Detective Tripp\n* Bill MacDonald as Detective Delaney\n* [[Tim Progosh]] as the Young Micah Tobias\n* [[Richard Chevolleau]] as Detective Horst\n* Elias Zarou as Detective Rafferty\n* [[Shawn Doyle]] as Crow Gollotti\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Fife\n* Danny Lima as Cletis Tout\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film was scheduled to debut at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in mid-September 2001,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/toronto-sets-lantana-to-close-1117851571/ |title=Toronto sets 'Lantana' to close |last=Tillson |first=Tamsen |date=August 21, 2001 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=May 1, 2021}}</ref> but the showing was canceled because of the [[September 11 attacks]].
