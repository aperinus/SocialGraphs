His right-hand man is Killer No. 2, a cold-hearted, smooth-talking murderer with a red hat and a deadly blade. Along with his killers is Nicola's love, Alexandra, a femme fatale with a secret past. The citizens live in fear of Nicola's gang and wait for the hero who can overthrow them.\n\nOne night, a mysterious Drifter enters the Horseless Horseman Saloon and talks to the Bartender. He wants two things: a shot of whisky and a game of cards, but the only place in town, the Russian Roulette, controlled by Nicola, only accepts very rich players. Later, another stranger enters; a samurai named Yoshi. Yoshi wants to fulfill his dying father's wish by recovering a medallion that was stolen from their village. Armed with crossed destinies and incredible fighting skills and guided by the Bartender's wisdom, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt reign of Nicola.\n\nAfter a string of altercations leading the Drifter and Yoshi to injure police officers and Nicola's goons, Killer No. 2 slays Yoshi's uncle  and kidnaps his cousin Momoko to send her to Nicola's brothel. In retaliation, the Drifter, Yoshi, the Bartender and an army of freedom fighters invade Nicola's palace. As the Bartender rescues Momoko, he sees his long-lost love Alexandra, but she disappears amidst the debris of the burning brothel. Meanwhile, after defeating Nicola's top killers, Yoshi faces Killer No. 2 and fatally stabs him while the Drifter advances toward Nicola, who injures him in the chest with a thrown axehead. Despite his injury, the Drifter slashes Nicola's throat with an arrowhead taken from Yoshi while revealing his true motive of avenging his father's death. With Nicola's reign brought to an end and Yoshi recovering his clan's medallion, the heroes part ways, hoping to meet each other again.<ref name=\"Theatrical Titles, Bunraku\"/><ref>[http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2010/bunraku/ Bunraku, Guy Moshe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822011315/http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2010/bunraku/ |date=August 22, 2010 }}, TIFF 2010 Films</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as The Drifter (fighter)\n* [[Gackt]] as Yoshi, a swordsman from Japan who speaks a little english\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as The Bartender\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Killer No. 2, lieutenant to Nicola\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Nicola \"the Woodcutter\", crime boss and the most powerful man \"east of the Atlantic\"\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Alexandra, a courtesan and Nicola's lover\n* [[Jordi Molla]] as Valentine\n* [[Shun Sugata]] as Uncle, Yoshi's Uncle\n* [[Mike Patton]] as The Narrator\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Eddie\n* [[Emily Kaiho]] as Momoko\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nFollowing the completion of his first feature film, ''[[Holly (film)|Holly]]'', Moshe started working on the initial concept art for ''Bunraku'' in 2006.

Like ''Holly'', it also aspires to go a little beyond the pure entertainment factor, but I think that, all in all, I would like to be the kind of filmmaker who can tell and make more than one story or one type of genre. I feel like in the past an auteur was a person who constantly challenged himself, where, today, because of the fierce competition and growing difficulty of making different and unique films, filmmakers can get stuck in a certain style and movie genre and keep recreating the same films. It takes two years of your life to make a movie, and to me that's priceless.
