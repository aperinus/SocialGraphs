The film is also known as '''''The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings''''', a literal translation of its original French title, '''''Le battement d'ailes du papillon'''''.  The title references the [[butterfly effect]] from [[chaos theory]] which is quoted at greater length by one of the characters in the film.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Audrey Tautou]] plays shop assistant Ir\u00e8ne, who on the way to work takes a seat on the Paris metro opposite an older woman who tries to interview her for a marketing survey.  On hearing that Ir\u00e8ne's birthdate is 11 March 1977, the woman reads her horoscope: today she'll meet her true love, but she must be patient.  After she leaves the metro, a young man sitting alongside ([[Faudel]]) tells the older woman he was born on the same day and asks her to read the rest of the horoscope.\n\nThe film then traces a range of characters of diverse ages, ethnicities and social status whose daily lives intersect with Ir\u00e8ne and Faudel's in a variety of ways and come together at the end of the day. Seemingly trivial events\u2014such as the throwing of stones or a shoe, the theft of a coffeemaker, a pigeon's consumption of a macaroon\u2014determine the decisions and lives of the many characters.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] : Ir\u00e8ne\n* [[Faudel]] : Youn\u00e8s\n* [[\u00c9ric Savin]] : Richard\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bouraly]] : Bobby\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bertin]] : Luc's Grandmother\n* [[Pierre Bellemare]] : Taxi Driver\n\n==Commentary==\nThe film relies heavily on the notion of chance and happenstance interacting in unpredictable ways on people's lives.  It is a film whose action/plot appears heavily driven by the underlying chaos theory that gives the French film its title.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243135/ ''Happenstance''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n* [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/happenstance/ ''Happenstance''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:French comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Laurent Firode]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-France-film-stub}}\n{{2000s-comedy-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
