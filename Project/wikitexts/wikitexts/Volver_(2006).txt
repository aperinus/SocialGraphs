The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Carmen Maura]], [[Lola Due\u00f1as]], [[Blanca Portillo]], [[Yohana Cobo]], and [[Chus Lampreave]]. Revolving around an eccentric family of women from a wind-swept region south of [[Madrid]], Cruz stars as Raimunda, a working-class woman forced to go to great lengths to protect her 14-year-old daughter Paula. To top off the family crisis, her mother Irene returns from the dead to tie up loose ends.\n\nThe plot originates in Almod\u00f3var's earlier film ''[[The Flower of My Secret]]'' (1995), where it features as a novel which is rejected for publication but is stolen to form the screenplay of a film named ''The Freezer''. Drawing inspiration from the [[Italian neorealism]] of the late 1940s to early 1950s and the work of pioneering directors such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], ''Volver'' addresses themes like sexual abuse, loneliness and death, mixing the genres of [[farce]], [[tragedy]], [[melodrama]], and [[magic realism]]. Set in the [[La Mancha]] region, Almod\u00f3var's place of birth, the filmmaker cited his upbringing as a major influence on many aspects of the plot and the characters.\n\n''Volver'' premiered at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]]. It received critical acclaim and ultimately won two awards at the festival, for Best Actress (shared by the six main actresses) and [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4332959/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Volver |access-date=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> The film's Spanish premiere was held on 10 March 2006 in [[Puertollano]], where the filming had taken place. Cruz was nominated for the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], making her the first Spanish woman ever to be nominated in that category.<ref>{{Cite magazine|first=Missy|last=Schwartz|url=http://ew.com/article/2006/11/03/penelope-cruzs-return-greatness/|title=Penelope Cruz's return to greatness|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|location=New York City|date=November 3, 2006|access-date=January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRaimunda ([[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]) and Sole ([[Lola Due\u00f1as]]) are sisters who grew up in Alcanfor de las Infantas, a small village in [[La Mancha]], but now both live in [[Madrid]]. Their parents had died in a fire three years before.\n\nRaimunda and her daughter Paula ([[Yohana Cobo]]) live with Paula's father Paco ([[Antonio de la Torre (actor)|Antonio de la Torre]]). When he attempts to [[rape]] Paula, claiming that he is not really her father, Paula stabs him to death in self-defense. Raimunda hides the corpse in the deep-freezer of a nearby restaurant with an absent owner, Emilio (Carlos Blanco). When members of a film crew happen upon the restaurant, Raimunda strikes a deal to cater for them, and finds herself back in the restaurant business.\n\nMeanwhile, Sole returns for the funeral of her elderly and [[dementia]]-stricken Aunt Paula ([[Chus Lampreave]]). Aunt Paula's neighbour Agustina ([[Blanca Portillo]]) confesses to Sole that she has heard Paula talking to the ghost of their mother Irene ([[Carmen Maura]]). Sole encounters her mother's ghost herself, and when she returns to [[Madrid]], she discovers that the ghost has stowed away in the trunk of her car. Sole agrees to let Irene stay with her and assist her with clients for her illicit hair salon, which she operates out of her apartment. Irene agrees to pose as a Russian immigrant who doesn't speak any Spanish. Irene questions why Raimunda hates her and is fearful of revealing her presence to Raimunda.\n\nRaimunda reveals to Paula that Paco was not her biological father, promising to tell her the whole story later. Agustina is diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]] and goes to Madrid for treatment. Raimunda visits her in the hospital. Agustina asks Raimunda if she has seen her mother's ghost. Agustina hopes that the ghost will be able to tell her about her own mother, who disappeared three years before. Raimunda leaves Paula with Sole, rents a van and transports the freezer to a convenient spot by the river [[J\u00facar]]. While staying in Sole's apartment, Paula meets her grandmother's ghost and grows close to her. The next night, Agustina comes to the restaurant, and reveals two startling secrets: her mother and Raimunda's father were having an affair, and her mother disappeared on the same day that Raimunda's parents died.\n\nSole reveals to Raimunda that she has seen their mother's ghost, who is in the next room with Paula. Irene admits that she did not, in fact, die in the fire, and reveals the whole truth. The reason for Raimunda and Irene's estrangement is that Raimunda's father [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her, resulting in the birth of Paula; thus, Paula is Raimunda's daughter and her sister. Irene tells Raimunda that she did not know about the abuse until Aunt Paula told her about it, and never forgave herself for not noticing it.\n\nIrene explains that she found her husband in bed with another woman and started the fire that killed them both. The ashes that had been presumed to be Irene's were, in fact, the ashes of Agustina's mother, the woman with whom Irene's husband was having an affair. After the fire, Irene wandered for several days in the countryside, until she decided that she wanted to turn herself in. But first, she wanted to say goodbye to Aunt Paula, who had lost the ability to look after herself and with whom Irene had been living prior to setting the fire. Paula welcomed Irene home as if nothing had happened, and Irene stayed, caring for her sister and expecting that the police would come soon to arrest her. Due to the superstitious and closed nature of the community, however, the police never came and the residents, accustomed to tales of the dead returning, explained the rare sightings of Irene as a ghost.\n\nThe family reunites at Aunt Paula's house. Irene reveals her presence to Agustina, who believes her to be a ghost. Irene pledges to stay in the village and care for Agustina as her cancer worsens, saying to Raimunda that it was the least that she could do after killing Agustina's mother. Raimunda visits her mother at Agustina's house, and the two embrace and promise to repair their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 150\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Blanca Portillo]] and [[Lola Due\u00f1as]] star in the film.\n   | image1    = Premios Goya 2018 - Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    =\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = \n   | image3    = Blanca Portillo en Almagro (cropped).jpg\n   | alt3      = \n   | caption3  = \n   | image4    = Lola Duenas Cabourg 2013.jpg\n   | alt4      = \n   | caption4  = \n}}\n\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Raimunda, a mother living in [[Madrid]]'s suburbs\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Irene Trujillo, the mother of Raimunda and Sole\n* [[Yohana Cobo]] as Paula\n* [[Blanca Portillo]] as Agustina\n* [[Lola Due\u00f1as]] as Soledad (\"Sole\")\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Aunt Paula\n* [[Antonio de la Torre (actor)|Antonio de la Torre]] as Paco\n* Mar\u00eda Isabel D\u00edaz as Regina\n* Carlos Blanco as Emilio\n* Neus Sanz as In\u00e9s\n* Leandro Rivera as Auxiliar Producci\u00f3n\n* [[Yolanda Ramos]] as Presentadora TV\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\n''Volver'' was first developed by Pedro Almod\u00f3var, based on a story actress [[Marisa Paredes]] told him during the production of their 1995 film ''[[The Flower of My Secret]]'', another film set in the [[La Mancha]] region.<ref name=\"cineuropa-pa\">{{cite web|first=Carlo|last=D'Ursi|title=Interview with Pedro Almod\u00f3var, Director| website=Cineuropa| url=http://cineuropa.org/ffocusinterview.aspx?lang=en&treeID=1205&documentID=62911|date=March 14, 2006| access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref> The story revolved around a heartbroken [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] man who opts to kill his mother-in-law in hopes of reuniting with his beloved wife, who left him and broke off contact, at her mother's funeral.

Very few filmmakers have managed to smile so convincingly in the face of misery and fatality: Jean Renoir and Billy Wilder come immediately to mind, and Mr. Almod\u00f3var, if he is not yet their equal, surely belongs in their company.
