The film stars [[Jet Li]] and [[Aaliyah]] in her feature film debut, her only film before [[2001 Marsh Harbour Cessna 402 crash|her death]] a year later on August 25, 2001. It follows a Chinese former police officer travelling to the United States in order to avenge his brother's death. He falls in love with a rival mobster's daughter as they struggle against both the Chinese and the American mobs. The plot is loosely related to [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' transplanted to contemporary [[Oakland, California]], with [[African-American]] and [[Chinese-American]] gangs representing the feuding families.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of originality in Hollywood action films, producer [[Joel Silver]] built the film around Hong Kong action films. He cast established Hong Kong actor Jet Li following his role in ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]''. [[R&B]] singer Aaliyah was cast, and sung the soundtrack's lead single \"[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]\" which topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\n''Romeo Must Die'' was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on March 24, 2000. Despite mixed critical reviews, it was a box office success, grossing $91 million against a production budget of $25 million.

He is rescued and then admonished by Kai, Ch'u's chief lieutenant. Po leaves the club, but he is found murdered the next day by a bicycle kid.\n\nHan Sing, a skilled martial artist and former police officer who has been imprisoned in [[Hong Kong]], learns of his brother's death and escapes. He travels to Oakland to investigate, where Ch'u is engaged in a joint business venture with Isaak O'Day, a black real estate developer and gang leader. The two have been acquiring [[deed]]s to properties along the waterfront to sell to Vincent Roth, a business magnate who plans to buy a new [[National Football League|NFL]] franchise and build a stadium. Despite Ch'u's assurances that their partnership remains intact, Isaak fears retribution following Po's death and has his chief lieutenant, Mac, place security details on his son Colin and his daughter Trish, the latter of whom refuses to be involved in her father's illegal enterprises.\n\nIn a chance encounter, Han befriends Trish by helping her ditch her assigned security, and then discovers Po called Trish's clothing store the day before he was killed. At his brother's funeral, Han confronts his estranged father, blaming him for failing to protect Po after Han helped them both flee to America to escape Chinese authorities, which resulted in Han's imprisonment. Kai informs Han that Po's death has been the result of the escalating gang war between the Chinese and African-Americans. Meanwhile, Colin tells his father that he was supposed to meet someone at the club to discuss information that could end the war. That night, Colin and his girlfriend are murdered by an unseen assailant.\n\nTrish and Han team up, and realize that Po wanted to show Colin a list of businesses that were either destroyed or being threatened for failing to sell their properties. The two visit one of the remaining businesses on Po's list, but the Chinese owner and his employees have been killed. After killing the Chinese [[hitmen]] responsible, Han questions his father, who deflects suspicion by suggesting Isaak may have used outside contractors. Later, Ch'u is shown ordering the death of several other Triad bosses to acquire their territories. Trish and Han visit the last holdout on Po's list: the nightclub where Po was last seen. The duo meet with the owner, but Mac arrives and kills him for his deed, and then abducts Trish and Han. At a remote location, Han defeats Mac's henchmen and goes to rescue Trish.\n\nIsaak and Ch\u2019u meet with Roth to sell him the deeds for the properties they now control. After Ch\u2019u takes a multimillion-dollar payment and departs, Isaak refuses his payment, stating that ''his'' compensation will be in the form of an ownership share of the new franchise. An enraged Mac threatens Isaak to take the deal, using Trish as a hostage. He also reveals that the \"gang war\" was a ruse he and Ch'u concocted to cover their murder and intimidation of businessmen who refused to sign away their properties, and admits to killing Colin. In the ensuing shootout, Isaak is wounded while Roth escapes via helicopter, but Mac shoots Roth's briefcase out of his hand and the deeds scatter into the wind. Han arrives and confronts Mac about his brother, who reveals that it was the Chinese who killed Po, and is about to shoot Han when Trish shoots and kills Mac first. Trish waits with her father for an ambulance while Han leaves to find Ch'u.\n\nAt the Sing compound, Kai admits he personally killed Po for interfering with Ch'u's dealings with Roth. Han engages Kai in a fist fight, and eventually kills him. Han berates his father for killing Po out of greed, and declares that he will leave him to be punished by either the police or the other Triad families. As Han walks away, Ch'u picks up his gun and shoots himself. Han finds Trish waiting for him outside, and the two walk away together as the police arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jet Li]] as Han Sing\n** Jonross Fong as Young Han Sing\n* [[Aaliyah]] as Trish O'Day\n* [[Isaiah Washington]] as Mac\n* [[Russell Wong]] as Kai\n* [[DMX]] as \"Silk\"\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Isaak O'Day\n* [[D.

For inspiration, he turned to [[Hong Kong action cinema]], where Jet Li was an established [[movie star]]. In addition to the influence of Hong Kong [[martial arts films]], the production team also introduced a new [[visual effect]] technique: the presentation of martial arts fighting in [[X-ray]] vision. They initially experimented with it for a single fight scene with Jet Li and tested it in front of an American audience, which gave an overwhelmingly positive response, before using it in more action scenes throughout the film.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yu |first1=Sabrina Q. |title=Jet Li: Chinese Masculinity and Transnational Film Stardom |date=2012 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |isbn=978-0-7486-8955-2 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdhvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA119}}</ref>\n\nThe film's setting is [[Oakland, California]], but other than a few establishing shots, film production was entirely in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].
