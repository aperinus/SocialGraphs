The film tells the story of three friends who have one passion: living the ultimate dream of surfing on Hawaii's famed [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnne Marie ([[Kate Bosworth]]) and her fourteen-year-old sister, Penny ([[Mika Boorem]]), along with good friends Eden ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]) and Lena ([[Sanoe Lake]]), live in a small house on the North Shore. They all have been helping raise Penny, since her mother moved to Las Vegas with her boyfriend.\n\nWhile Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden, and Lena work as maids in a super-luxury resort hotel, but more important than that, they are surfers. Anne Marie rises every morning before dawn to train for a possible surfing comeback. As a child, she had been a rising star in women's surfing, until she suffered a near-fatal wipeout. This has temporarily halted her progress; now when she is in really big powerful surf, she has deep-seated fears of dying. Her friends, especially Eden, are encouraging her to try once again to become a professional surfer.\n\nAnne Marie is invited to join the surfing competition at the famed [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] surf spot, the very challenging [[Banzai Pipeline]]. If she can do well enough to gain the attention of a sponsor, it would lift her and her friends out of the near-poverty in which they live. As the Pipeline competition gets closer, Anne Marie struggles to keep her young sister Penny from running wild and tries to deal with her own personal issues.\n\nAnne Marie meets Matt Tollman ([[Matthew Davis]]), a [[National Football League]] [[quarterback]] who is in Hawaii for the [[Pro Bowl]] (it is hinted that he plays for the [[Minnesota Vikings]]). Matt is instantly attracted to the surfer. After a few encounters, Matt says he wants to learn to surf, and Anne Marie agrees to teach him, and several of his rowdy teammates, to surf for $150 per hour, with Lena, Eden and Penny acting as coaches. When Anne Marie goes to the hotel room to get the money, she sees Matt, but a call comes in. Anne Marie asks if it is Matt's wife, but he explains it is his niece. Later, they sleep together.\n\nAnne Marie's acceptance of an outsider as her boyfriend causes friction between her and some of the young male surfers on the North Shore. Eden points out to Anne Marie that her current interest in Matt has weakened her commitment to training for the Pipeline contest. Anne Marie overhears very demeaning comments about herself from some of the other football players' wives and girlfriends, who are staying at the hotel.\n\nAnne Marie confronts Matt about their situation. She soon resolves to step up her game, as she fully commits herself to the Pipeline Masters. On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but she advances to the next heat after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt. She is shaken, but Matt tells her how he failed in his first game as an NFL quarterback, and this helps her get control of her wavering confidence.\n\nDetermined, although still apprehensive, Anne Marie returns to the water. Competing in the same heat is [[Keala Kennelly]], one of the first professional female surfers. While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves well, Anne Marie is still reluctant to try one, visions of her near-drowning incident holding her back. Keala finishes her turn, then paddles back out to take Anne Marie under her wing. Keala encourages her to ride the best wave of the day, and Anne Marie rides it perfectly, managing to score a perfect ten. Although Anne Marie cannot advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence and attracted the attention of sponsors, one of whom immediately offers to have her join the [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]] women's surf team.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Anne Marie Chadwick\n** [[Coco Ho]] as Young Anne Marie\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Matt Tollman\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Eden\n* [[Sanoe Lake]] as Lena Olin\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Penny Chadwick\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Leslie\n\n===Appearances from real-life surfers===\n* [[Keala Kennelly]]\n* [[Carol Philips|Carol Anne Philips]]\n* [[Coco Ho]]\n* [[Rochelle Ballard]]\n* [[Layne Beachley]]\n* [[Megan Abubo]]\n* [[Brian Keaulana]]\n* [[Tom Carroll (surfer)|Tom Carroll]]\n* [[Jamie O'Brien (surfer)|Jamie O'Brien]]\n* [[Bruce Irons (surfer)|Bruce Irons]]\n* [[Makua Rothman]]\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Music from the Motion Picture Blue Crush\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = August 16, 2002\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 47:09\n| label      = [[Virgin Records]]\n| producer   = Steven Marley, Josh Debear, Moby, Don Great, Pharrell Williams, Lenny Kravitz, Justin Stanley\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n# \"[[If I Could Fall in Love]]\" (4:23)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lenny Kravitz]]\n# \"[[Rock Star (N.E.R.D song)|Rock Star]] (Jason Nevins Remix Edit)\" (3:50)&nbsp;\u2013 [[N.E.R.D]]\n# \"Party Hard\" (4:00)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Beenie Man]]\n# \"[[Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)|Cruel Summer]] (Blestenation Mix)\" (5:13)&nbsp;\u2013 Blestenation\n# \"Big Love\" (3:48)&nbsp;\u2013 Chicken Josh Debear (rap/vocals)\n# \"Daybreaker\" (3:54)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Beth Orton]]\n# \"Everybody Got Their Something\" (4:22)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Nikka Costa]]\n# \"Front To Back (Fatboy Slim Remix)\" (3:53)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Playgroup (band)|Playgroup]]\n# \"And Be Loved\" (3:02)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Damian Marley]]\n# \"[[Destiny (Zero 7 song)|Destiny]]\" (5:40)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zero 7]]\n# \"Firesuite\" (4:37)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Doves (band)|Doves]]\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] rated 61% of reviews from 142 critics as positive, with an average rating of 5.81/10.
