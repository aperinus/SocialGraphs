It is the second installment in the [[Scooby-Doo in film|''Scooby-Doo'' live-action film series]] and the sequel to 2002's ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', and was directed by [[Raja Gosnell]], written by [[James Gunn]], and released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film stars [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Linda Cardellini]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Seth Green]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Peter Boyle]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]], with [[Neil Fanning]] reprising his role as the voice of [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]].\n\nThe film was released on March 26, 2004. Like the first film, it received generally negative reviews from critics and although financially successful it wound up grossing considerably less at the box office than its predecessor. The reception resulted in a third film, set to be written and directed by Gunn, being cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/matthew-lillard-says-no-scooby-doo-3/ |title= Matthew Lillard says no Scooby Doo 3 |date= August 4, 2004 |access-date=January 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102073413/https://movieweb.com/matthew-lillard-says-no-scooby-doo-3/ |archive-date=January 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, two live-action [[Television film|telefilm]]s featuring a new cast and taking place in a different continuity aired on [[Cartoon Network]] in [[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins|2009]] and [[Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster|2010]], both directed by [[Brian Levant]].{{Not verified in body|date=October 2022}}\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] attend the opening of an exhibition at the Coolsonian Criminology Museum commemorating their past solved cases with monster costumes on display. However, the celebrations are interrupted by a masked man known as the Evil Masked Figure who steals two costumes using the reanimated Pterodactyl Ghost. The gang are ridiculed by journalist Heather Jasper Howe, who starts a [[smear campaign]] against them. Shaggy and Scooby, after overhearing the rest of the gang criticizing their tendency to bumble every operation, and especially their most recent offense in failing to secure the Pterodactyl Ghost at the museum, resolve to better themselves and become real detectives. Concluding an old enemy is the mastermind, the gang revisit old cases. They dismiss the former Pterodactyl Ghost, Jonathan Jacobo, as the culprit due to his apparent death during a failed [[prison escape]]. They guess that Jeremiah Wickles, the Black Knight Ghost's portrayer and Jacobo's cell mate in prison, is the culprit.\n\nGoing to Wickles' manor, the group find a book that serves as an instruction manual on how to create monsters. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo find a note inviting Wickles to visit the Faux Ghost nightclub. They are attacked by the Black Knight Ghost, but escape when Daphne fights him off while Velma discovers its weak spot and disables it. Before fleeing, the rest of the gang discover through the book that the key ingredient to creating the monsters is \"randomonium\", a substance that can be found at the old silver [[mining town]]. Daphne, Velma and Fred go to the museum accompanied by the curator Patrick Wisely, but discover that the rest of the costumes have been stolen. Heather Jasper Howe turns the city against them. \n\nFollowing the lead from Wickles' note, their first clue ever, they sneak into the Faux Ghost, where the criminals whom the gang had unmasked hang out. Wearing disguises to try and solve the mystery, they speak to Wickles and hear how he has mended his evil ways. Scooby causes a scene and his disguise falls off, and the two escape through a trash chute. On their way out, they spot Patrick uncharacteristically assaulting someone who appears to be a member of his staff, ordering him to find answers to who vandalized his museum. Shaggy and Scooby then spot Wickles leaving the club and follow him. Fred, Velma, and Daphne go to the mines, finding Wickles' plans to turn it into an [[amusement park]]. They confront Wickles, who states that he and Jacobo were cell mates that hated each other and denies having any connection to the museum robberies.\n\nThe gang then find the Monster Hive where the costumes are brought to life as real monsters. Shaggy and Scooby play around with the machine's control panel, accidentally bringing several costumes to life, and the gang flees with the panel as the Evil Masked Figure terrorizes the city. Escaping to their old high school clubhouse, the gang realizes they can reverse the control panel's power by altering its wiring. Captain Cutler's Ghost emerges from the [[bayou]], forcing the gang to head back to the mines, encountering the various monsters along the way. In the mines, Velma finds a shrine dedicated to Jacobo built by Patrick. However, Patrick proves his innocence by helping Velma after a catwalk unexpectedly gives way under her.\n\nThe gang confront the Evil Masked Figure as the Tar Monster captures all of them but Scooby, who uses a [[fire extinguisher]] to freeze the Tar Monster's body. He reactivates the control panel, turning the costumes back to normal. The gang takes the Evil Masked Figure to the authorities, unmasking him as Heather. Velma then peels Heather's face off, revealing she is actually Jacobo in disguise. He had survived the fall from the prison wall, sought to get revenge on the sleuths by discrediting them and turn the press against them, and also framed Wickles by putting the instruction manual and the Black Knight Ghost in his mansion. His cameraman Ned is also arrested as an accomplice.\n\nThe sleuths are praised as heroes in Coolsville. In the Faux Ghost, they celebrate their victory with the reformed criminals.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Live action ===\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]]\n** Ryan Vrba as Young Fred\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n** [[Emily Tennant]] as Young Daphne\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]]\n** Cascy Beddow as Young Shaggy\n** [[Nazanin Afshin-Jam]] as Shaggy Chick\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n** Lauren Kennedy as Young Velma\n* [[Seth Green]] as Patrick Wisely\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Jeremiah Wickles\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Dr. Jonathan Jacobo\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Heather Jasper Howe\n* [[Karin Konoval]] as Aggie Wilkins\n* [[Joe MacLeod]] as Skater Dude No. 1\n* [[Brandon Jay McLaren]] as Skater Dude No. 2\n* [[Rasmus N\u00f8hr]] as Skater Dude No. 3\n* [[Calum Worthy]] as Kid on Bike\n* Stephen E.
