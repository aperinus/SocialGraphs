The plot follows a mother who, after her [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] son is accused of the murder of a young girl, attempts to find the true killer in order to get her son freed.\n\nThe film premiered on 16 May 2009 at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section, and was released in South Korea on 28 May 2009. It received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Kim's performance, the direction and screenplay, and the film's uniqueness.\n\n==Plot==\nAn unnamed widow lives alone with her only son, selling medicinal herbs in a small town in southern [[South Korea]] while conducting unlicensed [[acupuncture]] treatments for the town's women on the side. Her son, Yoon Do-joon, is shy, but prone to attacking anyone who mocks his [[intellectual disability]]. She dotes on him and scolds him for hanging out with Jin-tae, a local thug. When Do-joon is nearly hit by a car, he and Jin-tae vandalize the car and attack the driver and passengers as revenge. Jin-tae blames Do-joon for the damage done to the car, and Do-joon is sued. His mother struggles with the burden of the debt.\n\nOn his way home from a bar late at night, Do-joon sees a high school girl named Moon Ah-jung walking alone and follows her to an abandoned building. The next morning, she is discovered dead on the rooftop, shocking the town and pressuring the incompetent police to find the killer. Only circumstantial evidence places Do-joon near the scene of the crime, but the police arrest the boy anyway. He is tricked into signing a confession and faces a long prison sentence. His mother, believing him innocent, tries to prove he is not the murderer. However, she is unsuccessful, as the lawyer she hires is self-absorbed and unhelpful and the community unanimously blames Do-joon for the crime.\n\nThe mother suspects Jin-tae of committing the murder and breaks into his house to look for evidence. She takes a golf club, which she believes has blood on it, but when she turns it over to the police and Jin-tae is confronted about it, it becomes clear that the \"blood\" is just smeared lipstick. Despite her accusation, Jin-tae agrees to help the mother solve the case{{--}}for a fee.\n\nThe mother fires her lawyer and questions the people in town about Ah-jung. They tell her the girl was sexually promiscuous and in a relationship with a boy known as Jong-pal, who had escaped a [[sanatorium]].\n\nDo-joon attacks another prisoner who calls him \"retard\". On one of his mother's prison visits, Do-joon recalls a memory of her attempt to [[murder-suicide|kill him and then herself]] when he was five by lacing their drinks with a [[pesticide]]. She tries to apologize, saying she wanted to [[euthanasia|free them both from hardship]]. She offers to remove his pain by using her unique knowledge of an acupuncture point that erases bad memories, but he tells her he never wants to see her again.\n\nThe mother learns from a camera-shop worker that Ah-jung had frequent nosebleeds and had pictures on her cellphone that she wanted to have printed. Ah-jung's friend is attacked by two young men who are looking for the phone, but the mother rescues her and then pays Jin-tae to interrogate the men, who claim that Ah-jung accepted rice in exchange for sex (and was nicknamed \"the rice cake girl\"). They say she used her phone to secretly take pictures of her partners, thus making it a potential tool for blackmailing. The mother tracks down the phone, which is hidden at Ah-jung's grandmother's house.\n\nDo-joon remembers seeing an elderly man in the abandoned building on the night of Ah-jung's death and identifies him in one of the pictures on Ah-jung's phone. The mother recognizes the man as a junk collector she once bought an umbrella from and goes to his home to find out what he saw, on the pretense of offering him charity medical services. The junk collector reveals that he has been troubled since he saw Do-joon kill Ah-jung. He witnessed the two have a short conversation, during which Ah-jung called Do-joon a \"retard\", and Do-joon then threw a large rock into the shadows in which Ah-jung was standing, hitting her in the head and inadvertently killing her. Do-joon then dragged her to the rooftop.\n\nThe mother is unable to accept the truth. She frantically tells the junk collector that he is wrong and the case is going to be reopened and Do-joon will be released, which prompts him to pick up the phone to finally report what he had seen to the police. Fearing for her son, the mother bludgeons the junk collector with a wrench and sets fire to his house.\n\nLater, the police tell the mother that they have found the \"real\" killer: Jong-pal, who is being presumed guilty after Ah-jung's blood was found on his shirt. The police assume it got there during the murder, but the mother knows Jong-pal's story, that the blood is the result of Ah-jung's nose bleeding during consensual sex, is true. Feeling guilty, she visits Jong-pal, who is even more intellectually disabled than her son, and cries for him when she hears he does not have a mother to fight for him, knowing he is going to jail for a crime he did not commit.\n\nDo-joon is freed from prison and Jin-tae picks him up. They pass the junk collector's burned-down house on the way home and stop to pick through the rubble. During dinner, Do-joon muses to his mother that Jong-pal probably dragged Ah-jung up to the roof so that someone would see she was hurt and help her.\n\nAs the mother is about to depart from a bus station on a \"Thank-You Parents\" tour, Do-joon returns her acupuncture kit, which he found in the remains of the junk collector's house, and tells her to be more careful. She tearfully walks away, jarred by his discovery. On the bus, she sits in shock before placing one of the acupuncture needles in the point that erases bad memories. She stands up and dances with the other passengers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kim Hye-ja]] as Mother, an unnamed widow who is extremely protective of her son and attempts to free him from a murder charge\n* [[Won Bin]] as Yoon Do-joon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/korean_Won_Bin-filmography.html|title=Won Bin's Filmography, Credits (\uc6d0\ube48, Korean actor)|website=HanCinema|language=en-US|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> the adult son of Mother, who has an intellectual disability and is accused of the murder of a local girl\n* [[Jin Goo]] as Jin-tae, a local [[ne'er do well]] and one of Do-joon's friends.
