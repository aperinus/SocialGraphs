Set in medieval Sweden, it is a tale about a father's merciless response to the rape and murder of his young daughter. The story was adapted by screenwriter [[Ulla Isaksson]] from a 13th-century Swedish ballad, \"[[T\u00f6res d\u00f6ttrar i W\u00e4nge]]\" (\"T\u00f6re's daughters in V\u00e4nge\"). Bergman researched the legend of Per T\u00f6re with an eye to an adaptation, considering an opera before deciding on a film version. Given criticism of the historical accuracy of his 1957 film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', he also invited Isaksson to write the screenplay. Other influences included the 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon]]''. [[Max von Sydow]] played T\u00f6re.\n\nIsaksson and Bergman explored a number of themes in ''The Virgin Spring'', questioning morals, vengeance, and religious beliefs. The rape scene was also subject to censorship in screenings in the United States.\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[33rd Academy Awards|1961 Academy Awards]] and other honours. It was also the basis for the 1972 [[exploitation film|exploitation]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Last House on the Left]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[History of Sweden (800\u20131521)#13th century|medieval Sweden]], prosperous Christian Per T\u00f6re sends his daughter, Karin, to take candles to the church, a [[day's journey]] away. Karin is accompanied by a servant Ingeri, pregnant with an out-of-wedlock child, who secretly worships the [[Norse mythology|Norse deity]] [[Odin]]. Along their way through the forest on horseback, Ingeri becomes frightened when they come to a stream-side mill and admonishes Karin; but Karin chooses to proceed on her own leaving Ingeri at the mill.\n\nIngeri encounters a one-eyed man at the stream-side mill. When Ingeri asks about his name he enigmatically responds he has none \"in these days\". The man tells Ingeri that he can see and hear things others can not. When the man makes sexual advances towards her and promises her power, Ingeri flees in terror. Meanwhile, Karin meets three herdsmen, two men and a boy, and invites them to eat her lunch with her. Eventually, the two older men rape and murder Karin. Ingeri, after having caught up to the group, witnesses the whole ordeal hidden from a distance. The two older men then prepare to leave the scene with Karin's clothing. The younger boy is left with the body, but he takes the situation poorly, and is racked with guilt. He even tries to bury the body by sprinkling dirt but stops midway, and runs along with the older men.\n\nThe herders then, unknowingly, seek shelter at the home of the murdered girl. During the night, one of the goat herders offers to sell Karin's clothes to her mother, and she suspects the worst. After they fall asleep, the mother locks the trio in the dining chamber and reveals her suspicions to T\u00f6re. T\u00f6re prepares to discover the truth about the situation and encounters Ingeri, who has also returned. She breaks down in front of T\u00f6re and tells him about the rape and murder. She confesses that she secretly wished for Karin's death out of jealousy. In a fit of rage, T\u00f6re decides to murder the herdsmen at the crack of dawn. He stabs one of the older men to death with a butcher knife and throws the other into the fire. He kills the boy too, lifting and hurling him against the wall, while his wife watches horrified.\n\nSoon after, Karin's parents, along with the members of their household, set out to find their daughter's body with Ingeri leading the way. T\u00f6re breaks down on seeing Karin's body and calls upon God. He vows that, although he cannot understand why God would allow such a thing to happen, he will build a church at the site of his daughter's death. As her parents lift Karin's body from the ground, a spring emerges from the spot where her head rested. Ingeri proceeds to wash herself with the water while Karin's mother cleans the dirt from her daughter's face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Max von Sydow]] \u2013 T\u00f6re\n* [[Birgitta Valberg]] \u2013 M\u00e4reta\n* [[Gunnel Lindblom]] \u2013 Ingeri\n* [[Birgitta Pettersson]] \u2013 Karin\n* [[Axel D\u00fcberg]] \u2013 Thin Herdsman\n* [[Tor Isedal]] \u2013 Mute Herdsman\n* [[Allan Edwall]] \u2013 Beggar\n* Ove Porath \u2013 Boy\n* Axel Slangus \u2013 Bridge Keeper\n* [[Gudrun Brost]] \u2013 Frida\n* [[Oscar Ljung]] \u2013 Simon\n}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[Image:Odin disguised as a Traveller.jpg|thumb|upright|The Norse god [[Odin]] is prominent in the film's themes.]]\nA variety of themes explored in the film include Christianity, [[Paganism]], [[Norse mythology]], feelings of guilt, vengeance, the questioning of religious faith and sexual innocence. All of the characters struggle with feelings of guilt: Ingeri for praying to Odin and standing by during the murder, M\u00e4reta for disliking T\u00f6re and wanting to be Karin's favourite parent, and T\u00f6re for killing the boy and possible feelings of [[incest]] towards Karin.{{sfn|Young|2015|p=83}}\n\nMuch of the religious themes centre on conflict between paganism and Christianity, recalling the misery Sweden experienced as the two religions struggled for predominance.{{sfn|James|2011|p=127}} In the film, paganism is associated with [[Spell (paranormal)|magic spells]], envy and revenge.{{sfn|James|2011|p=127}} In a possible interpretation, Odin in this film becomes synonymous with the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]].{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=247}} As with ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', Bergman relies on the emotions and inner conflicts of his characters to represent spiritual crisis.{{sfn|Sultanik|1986|p=243}} T\u00f6re, played by [[Max von Sydow]], loses his Christian values to commit the act of [[revenge]], and offers to build a church as [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=246}} Film scholar [[Marc Gervais]] elaborated that T\u00f6re's revenge is \"ritualized pagan vengeance\", adding \"T\u00f6re is torn between two ritualized imperatives: pagan vengeance, Christian repentance and forgiveness\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=66}} Gervais commented on how it compared to [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' in its themes of \"embracing the dark forces, succumbing to evil, and being overwhelmed by conscience\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=65}}\n\nConsistent with [[fairy tale]]s, Karin and Ingeri are presented as opposites, Karin as an innocent [[virgin]] who always appears clean and in fine clothing.{{sfn|James|2011|p=127-128}} In contrast, Ingeri is dirty, dark in complexion, rides a darker horse, and her pregnancy indicates compromised innocence.{{sfn|James|2011|p=128}} The rape scene represents Karin losing her innocence, with her appearance afterward being disordered.{{sfn|James|2011|p=129}}\n\nScreenwriter [[Ulla Isaksson]] viewed the spring as symbolizing Karin's innocence.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=247}} Ingeri uses it to wash her head, which she used to plan the spell, and her eyes, which she used to watch the rape, and drinks the water, symbolizing [[absolution]].{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=246}} Critic [[Peter Cowie]] tied the spring in with Ingeri's fire in the opening and streams seen throughout the film as representing \"The pagan significance of fire, earth, and water\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/410-the-virgin-spring-bergman-in-transition |title=The Virgin Spring: Bergman in Transition |last=Cowie |first=Peter |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Ulla Isaksson.jpg|thumb|Novelist [[Ulla Isaksson]] wrote the screenplay, particularly interested in questions of faith.]]\nDirector [[Ingmar Bergman]] first read about the legend of Per T\u00f6re, who had seven daughters who fell victim to seven rapists, as a student, and felt it was ideal for adaptation. He had proposed it as a ballet for the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] or as a play, but decided a film would be most suitable while making ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=242}} For adaptation, Bergman chose \"[[T\u00f6res d\u00f6ttrar i W\u00e4nge]]\" as among the simplest of the ballads about T\u00f6re.{{sfn|Gado|1986|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nNew influences came from [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], with Bergman particularly being a fan of ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950). He later referred to ''The Virgin Spring'' as \"a wretched imitation of [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]]\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=241}} For a screenwriter, Bergman chose novelist [[Ulla Isaksson]]. Isaksson had written a novel set in Medieval times and was acclaimed for its realism, which Bergman felt might prevent repeat of some criticisms of his 1957 film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=242}} In writing the screenplay, Isaksson was most interested in exploring conflicts between Christianity and paganism, while Bergman wanted to dissect guilt.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=243}}\n\n[[SF Studios]] required Bergman to make a comedy before agreeing to produce ''The Virgin Spring''. The comedy became ''[[The Devil's Eye]]''.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=253}}\n\n===Filming===\nBy the time ''The Virgin Spring'' began production, Bergman's relationship with his usual cinematographer [[Gunnar Fischer]] was strained, due to Bergman's abrasiveness. When Fischer found another project to work on, Bergman replaced him with [[Sven Nykvist]], who became his regular collaborator.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=241}} In shooting ''The Virgin Spring'', Nykvist favoured more natural lighting than Fischer had.{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=64}}\n\nBergman said that in filming the rape scene: \n:It shows the crime in its naked atrocity, forcing us, in shocked desperation, to leave aesthetic enjoyment of a work of art for passionate involvement in a human drama of crime that breeds new crime, of guilt and grace ... We must not hesitate in our portrayal of human degradation, even if, in our demand for truth, we must violate certain taboos.{{sfn|James|2011|p=129}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in [[Stockholm]] on 8 February 1960, where 15 audience members walked out during the screening, and several left weeping.{{sfn|Balio|2010|p=139}} Although [[SF Studios]] accountants previously often faulted Bergman films as unprofitable, they acknowledged ''The Virgin Spring'' was a success.{{sfn|Macnab|2009|p=110}} The film was also screened at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1960.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3334/year/1960.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Virgin Spring |access-date=15 February 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''The Virgin Spring'' opened in [[New York City]] on 14 November 1960, censored to remove shots taken of Karin's naked legs around the body of the rapist.{{sfn|Balio|2010|p=140}} In [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the film was [[List of banned films#United States|banned]] as obscene, and the [[Texas Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case.<ref>{{cite news|title=Austin, Tex |newspaper=[[Valley Morning Star]] |date=19 July 1962 |p=4 }}</ref><ref>''Janus Films v.

In a 1960 review, [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote, \"Mr. Bergman has stocked it with scenes of brutality that, for sheer unrestrained realism, may leave one sickened and stunned. As much as they may contribute to the forcefulness of the theme, they tend to disturb the senses out of proportion to the dramatic good they do\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01E4DC1431EF3ABC4D52DFB767838B679EDE |title=The Screen; Ingmar Bergman's Study in Brutality:'The Virgin Spring' in Premiere at Beekman Von Sydow Starred in Ulla Isaksson Script |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 November 1960 |access-date=27 May 2016}}</ref> [[Stanley Kauffmann]] wrote that \"The vengeance scene is so long that it verges on the ridiculous\".{{sfn|Balio|2010|p=140}} [[Dwight Macdonald]] questioned why God would create a spring instead of [[resurrection|resurrecting]] Karin.{{sfn|Balio|2010|p=140}} The film was included in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s \"Hot 100 Films From the Past\" in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot 100 Films From the Past by ''San Francisco Chronicle'' Film Critics|publisher=[[Filmsite.org]]|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sfchron2.html|access-date=19 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, author Alexandra Heller-Nicholas wrote ''The Virgin Spring'' gave \"a relatively auspicious heritage\" to [[rape and revenge film]]s, and was \"an art classic\" with \"sumptuous black and white cinematography\", and that the reuse of the story in ''[[The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972) indicated \"remarkable longevity\" for the plot.{{sfn|Heller-Nicholas|2011|p=22}}  Robin Wood wrote, \"''The Virgin Spring'' is Art; ''Last House'' is [[exploitation film|Exploitation]]\".{{sfn|Wood|2003|p=110}} [[Leonard Maltin]], giving ''The Virgin Spring'' three stars in his ''2013 Movie Guide'' and calling it \"Fascinating, beautifully made\", felt it was more proper to say ''The Last House on the Left'' \"ripped off\" Bergman's film than remade it.{{sfn|Maltin|2012}} The film was a major influence on Taiwanese director [[Ang Lee]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Film-makers on Film:Ang Lee|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/3654276/Film-makers-on-film-Ang-Lee.html|website=telegraph.co}}</ref> and American film maker [[Wes Craven]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wes Craven: the mainstream horror maestro inspired by Ingmar Bergman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/aug/31/wes-craven-the-mainstream-horror-maestro-inspired-by-ingmar-bergman|website=The Guardian|date=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe aggregation site ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'' has found it to be the 639th most acclaimed film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php |title=TSPDT - 1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) |work=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |date=7 February 2016 |access-date=27 May 2016}}</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], also reports 87% approval among 23 surveyed critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/virgin_spring/|title=Jungfruk\u00e4llan (The Virgin Spring) (1959)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2014-01-17}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1961\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1961 |title=The 33rd Academy Awards (1961) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-10-29|work=oscars.org}}</ref> marking the first time Bergman won the award.{{sfn|Dixon|Foster|2008|p=208}} The film was also entered into competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1960 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!
