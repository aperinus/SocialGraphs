The film is written by [[David Loughery]] and directed by [[Franco Amurri]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=June 2015}}\nHuey Walker ([[Dennis Hopper]]) is a [[hippie]] and a former [[New Left]] radical (in the vein of [[Abbie Hoffman]]<ref>[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2010/feature-articles/a-legacy-went-searching-for-a-film%E2%80%A6-dennis-hopper-and-easy-rider/ Senses of Cinema]</ref>) who has been on the run from the law for 20 years for something he did not do, disconnecting [[Spiro Agnew]]'s train car in [[Spokane, Washington]]. John Buckner ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) is an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who is set to transport Walker back to Spokane for trial.\n\nTheir journey forces them to cross paths with a corrupt Sheriff Hightower and the two end up fleeing for their lives. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Buckner was raised on a [[Intentional community|communal]] [[farm]] and that his [[given name]] is Free. As Buckner learns to reconcile his past with his present, Walker does as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Huey Walker\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Free \"John\" Buckner\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Maggie\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Stark\n* [[Cliff DeYoung|Cliff De Young]] as Sheriff Rand Hightower\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Barry\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Hal Cresciman\n* [[Kathleen York]] as Sparkle\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews.\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated,\n<blockquote>About 30 minutes before it's over, ''Flashback'' begins to go to pieces, like someone who has overdosed on carrot juice and organic marzipan. The movie becomes woozy and sort of distraught. Until then, it's an engaging comedy about the confrontation of a superannuated flower child of the 1960s and a 26-year-old representative of the clean-shaven, cholesterol-conscious, fiercely conservative 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|title= Review/Film;Liberal Old vs. Conservative Young in 'Flashback'|work= [[The New York Times]]|date= 2 February 1990|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEFDA123FF931A35751C0A966958260|access-date=2012-06-10|last1= Canby|first1= Vincent}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Peter Rainer]] stated: \n<blockquote>In \"Flashback\" (citywide), the casting of Dennis Hopper as an [[Abbie Hoffman]]-like radical prankster is weirdly dislocating. Still primarily identified with \"[[Easy Rider]],\" Hopper is the shaggy archetype of '60s hippie anomie. [...] Despite his scraggly derelict's appearance and screw-loose antics, he is wised-up and politically right on. He is, God help us, the conscience of the '60s. And that's where the dislocation comes in. Hopper represents the fringes of hippiedom for us, yet his character here is also being promoted as a robust politico\u2014an Abbie Hoffman in Rip Van Winkle drag.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : Hopper as a Hippie Icon in Familiar 'Flashback'|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-02/entertainment/ca-1006_1_flashback-movie-hopper|access-date=2012-06-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRemarked [[Roger Ebert]], \n<blockquote>I've heard people complaining recently that once you've seen the coming attractions trailer for a movie, you've seen the movie. That's the way I felt after seeing the trailer for Franco Amurri's ''Flashback'', but the film itself is a pleasant surprise - deeper and more original than the formula that the trailer seems to promise.<ref>{{cite news|title= Flashback|publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]]|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900202/REVIEWS/2020301/1023|access-date=2012-06-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe then-new ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine gave the film a B+, stating: \n<blockquote>Ever since the mythic \u201960s ended, countercultural idealists have been grappling with the loss of what they believed would be their eternal youth. Considering how many serious books and movies have addressed the aging of the Woodstock generation, it\u2019s surprising to find Flashback, a seemingly insubstantial film that has something important to say on the subject. [...] Screenwriter David Loughery cleverly builds this simple role reversal into an affecting vehicle for exploring identity and growth. Against all odds, the movie manages to avoid easy caricatures. [...] Unlike many such voyages through the past, this is one \u201960s trip that\u2019s worth repeating.<ref>{{cite news|title= Flashback|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317885,00.html|access-date=2012-06-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBased on 15 reviews, the film has a score of 40% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Flashback (1990)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007522_flashback|access-date=August 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number 5.<ref>{{cite news|title= WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : 'Driving Miss Daisy' Gets the Checkered Flag|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-06/entertainment/ca-1_1_miss-daisy|access-date=2012-06-10}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film produced a fairly popular soundtrack made up of a mix of 1960s and 1980s alternative music. The highlight is the theme song \"Free\" by the band [[Big Audio Dynamite]], which is only available on this soundtrack; it was never included in any Big Audio Dynamite album, although the single edit appears on their compilation ''[[Planet B.A.D.]]'' . A remake of the song, titled \"Kickin' In\", was later recorded by [[Big Audio Dynamite II]] and included on the ''[[Kool-Aid (album)|Kool-Aid]]'' album. Bob Dylan's version of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s \"''People Get Ready''\" is also only available on this soundtrack, as it hasn't yet been released on any Dylan album or any of his many box sets or ''Bootleg Series'' releases, although a different version that Dylan recorded in 1975 is available on iTunes as a bonus track on ''[[Bob Dylan: The Collection]]''.\n\n'''Track Listing'''\n# \"Free\" \u2013 [[Big Audio Dynamite]]\n# \"Fatal Attraction (And It's So Strange...)\" \u2013 The Ultraviolets\n# \"Next Time (I'll Dream of You)\" \u2013 [[Flesh for Lulu]]\n# \"[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]\" \u2013 [[Edie Brickell & New Bohemians]]\n# \"[[It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)]]\" \u2013 [[R.E.M.]]\n# \"[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]\" \u2013 [[Bob Dylan]]\n# \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\" \u2013 [[Canned Heat]]\n# \"[[Born to Be Wild]]\" \u2013 [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]\n# \"[[Comin' Back to Me]]\" \u2013 [[Jefferson Airplane]]\n# \"[[All Along the Watchtower]]\" \u2013 [[Jimi Hendrix]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0099581|Flashback}}\n* {{AllMovie title|17746|Flashback}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1007522_flashback}}\n\n{{Franco Amurri}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s chase films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hippie films]]\n[[Category:Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n[[Category:Films about friendship]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Amurri]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1989]]\n[[Category:Films set on trains]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Loughery]]\n[[Category:1990 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Barry Goldberg]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
