It is a continuing [[film adaptation]] based on the [[Veronica Mars|television series of the same name]] created by Thomas. The film stars [[Kristen Bell]] as the [[Veronica Mars (character)|title character]], alongside a [[ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] that includes [[Jason Dohring]], [[Francis Capra]], [[Krysten Ritter]], [[Percy Daggs III]], [[Tina Majorino]], [[Ryan Hansen]], [[Chris Lowell]], [[Max Greenfield]] and [[Enrico Colantoni]], each reprising their roles. Set nine years after the events of the [[The Bitch Is Back (Veronica Mars)|series finale]], the plot follows Veronica Mars returning to her hometown in Neptune to investigate the death of a former classmate allegedly murdered by Mars' ex-boyfriend, [[Logan Echolls]].\n\nAfter the series' cancellation in 2007, Thomas wrote a feature film script, continuing the story. However, [[Warner Bros.]] declined to fund the project. On March 13, 2013, Thomas and Bell launched a fundraising campaign on [[Kickstarter]] to produce the film. It attained its goal of $2 million in eleven hours, breaking several Kickstarter records, including being the largest successful film project on the website. After raising a budget of $5 million by the end of its run, [[principal photography]] began in June 2013 in [[Los Angeles]], and concluded in July 2013. An additional day of shooting took place in December 2013.\n\n''Veronica Mars'' held its [[world premiere]] at [[South by Southwest]] on March 8, 2014, and was released in the United States in a [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] and through [[video on demand]] on March 14, 2014 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131206005856/en/Warner-Bros.%E2%80%99-%E2%80%9CVeronica-Mars%E2%80%9D-Movie-Opens-March|title=Warner Bros.' \"Veronica Mars\" Movie Opens on March 14, 2014|work=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=December 6, 2013|access-date=December 9, 2013}}</ref> The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, with many praising the writing and Bell's performance. It earned $3.5 million worldwide against a $6 million budget. The revival of the series has also sparked continuations through different media, including two novels, co-written by Thomas and Jennifer Graham, and a [[web series]] centered on Hansen, titled ''[[Play It Again, Dick]]'', released on [[CW Seed]]. In 2019, [[Hulu]] revived the original series for a [[Veronica Mars (season 4)|fourth season]].\n\n==Plot==\nNine years after the events of the [[The Bitch Is Back (Veronica Mars)|series finale]], former teenage sleuth [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] has left Neptune, California, and moved to [[New York City]], where she is in a relationship with [[Stosh \"Piz\" Piznarski]] and has a job offer from the prestigious law firm Truman-Mann and Associates. \n\nVeronica is contacted by her ex-boyfriend [[Logan Echolls]], now a Lieutenant in the [[United States Navy]], who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend Carrie Bishop. She was a fellow Neptune High graduate who became the self-destructive pop star, \"Bonnie DeVille\". He is being bombarded for help from lawyers, and Veronica agrees to return to Neptune to aid Logan find one who will best represent him. She reunites with her father [[Keith Mars]], Neptune's former sheriff-turned-private investigator, who shows her that corruption and classism are rife under Sheriff Dan Lamb.\n\nVeronica investigates the circumstances of Carrie's death. During her investigation, she attends her ten-year [[high school reunion]] with [[Wallace Fennell]] and [[Cindy \"Mac\" MacKenzie]]. There, she learns that former outlaw biker [[Eli \"Weevil\" Navarro]] is now a reformed family man. During the reunion, Veronica realizes Carrie's murder is connected to that of Carrie's best friend, Susan Knight, who disappeared off a boat nine years earlier. \n\nAfter Veronica's nemesis [[Madison Sinclair]] projects a copy of Veronica's college sex tape with Piz, a fight breaks out. The reunion comes to an abrupt end as she sets the sprinklers off. Attending an after party, she speaks with [[Dick Casablancas]], Luke Haldeman and his fianc\u00e9e [[Gia Goodman]], and Stu \"Cobb\" Cobbler, all of whom were with Susan and Carrie on the boat the night Susan disappeared. Meanwhile, while driving home from the reunion, Weevil stops to help a driver being harassed by bikers, only to be shot by her, Celeste Kane. The sheriff's department plants a gun so she can claim self-defense, and Keith agrees to prove Weevil's innocence.\n\nVeronica concludes that those on Susan's boat years ago covered up the circumstances of her death and Carrie was killed because she threatened to confess. As compromising videos of Carrie are posted online, Veronica traces them back to Vinnie Van Lowe, who has been planting spyware on celebrities and selling the footage. \n\nVeronica uses Vinnie's footage to prove Gia lured Logan to Carrie's the night of her murder, suggesting that she and Luke killed Carrie, framing Logan. Lamb ignores her evidence and refuses to follow up, but unbeknownst to him Veronica records the conversation. Having stayed in Neptune longer than planned, Veronica calls Piz in New York to explain that she cannot return yet, and he breaks it off. Truman-Mann rescinds their job offer, resulting in an argument between Keith and Veronica.\n\nKeith meets with Deputy Sacks about Weevil's case, but they are attacked by someone in a truck who slams into Sacks' car, killing him and leaving Keith in critical condition. Veronica and Logan sleep together, establishing a relationship. She sends bugged flowers to Gia's and calls her with recordings of Carrie's voice, hoping to scare her into confessing to being behind her death. Gia panics and calls Cobb, revealing his involvement. Veronica goes to Gia's apartment to confront her, where Gia reveals that Cobb is the mastermind of Carrie's death and framing Logan: Susan overdosed, and he took photos of a panicked Carrie, Gia, and Luke dumping Susan's body and has been [[blackmailing]] them. \n\nVeronica's bug broadcasts this via a radio frequency which she believed to be unused but is actually that of a local radio station. Cobb hears their conversation over the radio from his apartment in the building opposite, then shoots and kills Gia through the window before coming after Veronica. She calls the police and lures Cobb to the basement, beating him unconscious.\n\nLogan returns to active duty in the Navy but promises to come back to Veronica. Cobb's photo and the secret recording of Lamb refusing to investigate Veronica's claims leak online, forcing Lamb to arrest Cobb, with calls to oust Lamb from office. Keith and Weevil recover from their injuries, but Weevil returns to the criminal lifestyle. Veronica takes over her father's private investigator business with Mac as her assistant, resolved to help fight Neptune's corruption.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Do not add to this list unless you can provide a reliable source.-->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]]<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite news|title='Veronica Mars' Begins Filming|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1709261/veronica-mars-movie-kristen-bell-filming.jhtml|access-date=June 19, 2013|publisher=MTV|first=Todd|last=Gilchrist|date=June 18, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Dohring]] as [[Logan Echolls]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as Gia Goodman<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/veronica-mars-movie-krysten-ritter-interview/ |title=Krysten Ritter Talks VERONICA MARS Movie, Returning to the Character, DON'T TRUST THE B\u2014-, Her Top 5 Films of 2013, and More |website=Collider |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=March 11, 2014 |access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Ryan Hansen]] as [[Dick Casablancas]]<ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/veronica-mars-movie-starts-filming_n_3460461.html |title='Veronica Mars' Movie Starts Filming In Los Angeles (PHOTOS) |work=The Huffington Post |first=Jaimie |last=Etkin |date=June 18, 2013 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Francis Capra]] as [[Eli \"Weevil\" Navarro]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Percy Daggs III]] as [[Wallace Fennel]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Chris Lowell]] as [[Stosh \"Piz\" Piznarski]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Tina Majorino]] as [[Cindy \"Mac\" Mackenzie]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Enrico Colantoni]] as [[Keith Mars]]<ref name=\"mtv\"/>\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Ruby Jetson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/07/veronica-mars-movie-casts-gaby-hoffmann-as.html |title='Veronica Mars' movie casts Gaby Hoffmann as ... |publisher=Zap2it |first=Andrea |last=Reiher |date=July 11, 2013 |access-date=July 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714234202/http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2013/07/veronica-mars-movie-casts-gaby-hoffmann-as.html |archive-date=July 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Sheriff Dan Lamb, brother of the late [[Don Lamb|Sheriff Don Lamb]] from the series.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvline.com/2013/07/17/veronica-mars-movie-jerry-oconnell-sheriff-lamb/ |title=The ''Veronica Mars'' Movie Adds Sheriff Lamb &ndash;
