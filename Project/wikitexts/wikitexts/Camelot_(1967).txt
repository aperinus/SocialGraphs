It stars [[Richard Harris]] as [[King Arthur]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Guinevere|Guenevere]], and [[Franco Nero]] as [[Lancelot]]. The cast also features [[David Hemmings]], [[Lionel Jeffries]], and [[Laurence Naismith]].\n\nIn April 1961, the rights to produce a film adaptation of ''Camelot'' were obtained by [[Warner Bros.]] with Lerner attached to write the screenplay. However, the film was temporarily shelved as the studio decided to adapt ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' into a [[My Fair Lady (film)|feature film]] first. In 1966, development resumed with Joshua Logan hired as director. Original cast members [[Richard Burton]] and [[Julie Andrews]] were approached to reprise their roles from the stage musical, but both declined and were replaced with Harris and Redgrave. Filming took place on location in [[Spain]] and on the Warner Bros. studio lot in [[Burbank, California]].\n\n''Camelot'' was released on October 25, 1967, to mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $31.5 million against a $13 million budget, becoming the [[1967 in film|tenth highest-grossing film of 1967]]. The film received five nominations at the [[40th Academy Awards]] and won three; [[Academy Award for Best Score - Adaptation or Treatment|Best Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It also won three [[Golden Globe Awards]]; [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] (Richard Harris), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (for \"[[If Ever I Would Leave You]]\"), and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs [[King Arthur]] prepares for battle against his former friend, [[Sir Lancelot]], he reflects on the sad circumstances which have led him to this situation.\n\nArthur thinks back to the night of his marriage to [[Guenevere]]. It is an arranged marriage, and he is afraid of what lies ahead (\"I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight\"). Guenevere herself is worried about marrying a man she has never met and longs for the romantic life of a fought-over maiden (\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\"). They converse, and as she does not know his true identity, she fantasizes about escaping with him. Arthur tells her what a wonderful place his kingdom is (\"Camelot\"). She finds herself drawn to him, but they are interrupted by his men and her entourage. Arthur's identity is revealed, and Guenevere gladly goes with him to be married.\n\nFour years later, Arthur explores with Guenevere his idea for a \"Round Table\" that would seat all the noble knights of the realm, reflecting not only a crude type of democratic ideal, but also the political unification of England. Inspired by Arthur's ideas, the French Knight Lancelot makes his way to England with his squire Dap, boasting of his superior virtues (\"C'est Moi\"). Lancelot's prowess impresses Arthur, and they become friends; however, many of the knights instantly despise Lancelot for his self-righteousness and boasting manner. Back in Camelot, Guinevere and the women frolic and gather flowers to celebrate the coming of spring (\"The Lusty Month of May\").\n\nGuenevere, who initially dislikes Lancelot, incites three of the best knights to challenge him to a joust (\"Then You May Take Me To The Fair\"). Arthur ponders how distant Guenevere has become recently (\"How to Handle a Woman\"). Guenevere's plan goes awry as Lancelot easily defeats all three, critically wounding Sir [[Dinadan]]. A horrified Lancelot pleads for Sir Dinadan to live, and as he lays hands on him, Dinadan miraculously recovers. Guenevere is so overwhelmed and humbled that her feelings for Lancelot begin to change. Despite his vows of celibacy, Lancelot falls in love with Guenevere. \n \nGuinevere and Lancelot meet in secret to discuss their future. Lancelot vows that he should leave and never come back, but finds it impossible to consider leaving Guenevere (\"If Ever I Would Leave You\"). Arthur decides to rise above the scandal. [[Mordred]], Arthur's illegitimate son, arrives at Camelot determined to bring down the fellowship of the Round Table by stirring up trouble. All this takes its toll on Arthur's disposition, and Guenevere tries to cheer him up (\"What Do the Simple Folk Do?\") despite her conflicted emotions.\n\nMordred persuades Arthur to stay out hunting all night as a test, knowing that Lancelot will visit Guenevere in her bedchamber. Lancelot and Guenevere sing of their forbidden love and how wrong it has all gone (\"I Loved You Once In Silence\"). Mordred and several knights catch the lovers together. Lancelot escapes, but Guenevere is arrested. Thanks to Arthur's new civil court and trial by jury, she is sentenced to die by burning at the stake. Bound by his own law, Arthur cannot spare her. Preparations are made for Guenevere's burning (\"Guenevere\"), but Lancelot rescues her at the last minute, much to Arthur's relief.\n\nOn the battlefield, Arthur receives a surprise visit from Lancelot and Guenevere, at the edge of the woods, where she has taken residence at a convent. The three share an emotional farewell.\n\nPrior to the battle, Arthur stumbles across a young boy named Tom, who espouses his commitment to Arthur's original ideal of \"Not might 'makes' right, but might 'for' right.\" Arthur realizes that, although most of his plans have fallen through, the ideals of Camelot still live on in this simple boy. Arthur knights Tom and gives him his orders\u2014run behind the lines and survive the battle, so that he can tell future generations about the legend of Camelot. Watching Tom leave, Arthur regains his hope for the future (\"Camelot (reprise)\").\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn April 1961, it was reported that [[Warner Bros.]] had purchased the rights to produce a [[film adaptation]] of the stage musical with [[Alan Jay Lerner]] hired to pen the screenplay.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=WB's 'Camelot' Buy: $1,500,000 plus 25% of Net|magazine=Variety|date=April 12, 1961|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/605716569/|title=Warner Buys Camelot Rights|url-access=subscription|newspaper=San Pedro News-Pilot|date=April 12, 1961|page=13|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> That same month, it was reported that [[Rock Hudson]] had signed on to portray King Arthur.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopper|first=Hedda|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/385636824/|title=Rock Hudson Will Star in 'Camelot'|url-access=subscription|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=April 28, 1961|access-date=January 28, 2020|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> In May 1961, [[Shirley Jones]] was reportedly in talks to portray Guenevere.<ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Mike|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/580787912|title=Shirley Jones Up for 'Camelot'|url-access=subscription|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 25, 1961|access-date=January 27, 2020|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> However, development was placed on hold when Warner Bros. fast-tracked a [[My Fair Lady (film)|film adaptation]] of the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', for which they acquired the screen rights from [[CBS]] for $5.5 million.

In his place, [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Marlon Brando]] were considered. While filming ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]'' (1966), [[Richard Harris]] learned of ''Camelot'' and actively sought for the role.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=27}} For four months, Harris sent complimentary letters, cables and offers for a screen test to Lerner, Logan and Jack Warner indicating his interest in the role. Logan refused his offer due to his lack of singing abilities. When Logan returned to the [[The Dorchester|Dorchester]] after having his morning jog, Harris ambushed him about the role, in which Logan finally relented as he offered to pay for his own screen test. Harris later hired cinematographer [[Nicolas Roeg]] to direct his screen test, which impressed Logan and Warner, who both agreed to hire him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=Richard|title=The Life and Inebriated Times of Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Peter O'Toole, and Oliver Reed|location=New York|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312553999/page/122 122]|isbn=978-0-312-55399-9|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312553999/|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=29}}\n\nFor the role of Guenevere, [[Julie Andrews]], [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Julie Christie]] were on the studio's shortlist while Jack Warner separately considered [[Polly Bergen]], [[Ann-Margret]] and [[Mitzi Gaynor]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=28}} Andrews had learned of the movie adaptation while filming ''Hawaii'', but she declined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stirling|first=Richard|title=Julie Andrews: An Intimate Biography|year=2009|pages=165\u2013166|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-56498-8}}</ref> However, Logan desperately wanted to cast [[Vanessa Redgrave]] after watching her performance in ''[[Morgan \u2013 A Suitable Case for Treatment]]'' (1966). At the time, Redgrave was performing in the stage play ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)#Stage|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' so Logan had to wait several months for her availability.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=28\u201329}} Despite Redgrave not being a traditional singer, Logan was impressed by her renditions of folk songs that he listened to. The studio was initially reluctant due to her left-wing activism, but Logan negotiated for her casting until after she fulfilled her stage commitments. Redgrave was signed in November 1966 for $200,000 and permitted to do her own singing.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nAlthough the studio initially sought a Frenchman, Italian actor [[Franco Nero]] was cast as Lancelot based on the recommendation from Harris and [[John Huston]] who worked with Nero on ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' (1966). Although Logan was aware of Nero's thick Italian accent, he initially permitted him to do his own singing.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=30}} The first scene shot was his performance of the musical number \"C'est Moi\", by which Logan found Nero's singing voice incompatible with the song's musical arrangement. His singing voice was dubbed by [[Gene Merlino]] while Nero was given a speech coach to help improve his English.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=34}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Segovia_-_Alc\u00e1zar_de_Segovia_22_2017-10-24.jpg|330px|thumb|left|The medieval fortress [[Alc\u00e1zar of Segovia]] in Spain (pictured here) was used as the exterior castle for [[Lancelot du Lac]]'s castle.]]\n[[Richard H.

Impressed, Logan hired Kline as cinematographer. For ''Camelot'', Kline wanted to shoot the film in a more authentically textured style rather than the polished look of Hollywood musicals.<ref>{{cite book|last=C.

In total, the shoot yielded half an hour of usable footage.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=33\u201334}} With production underway, Jack Warner decided that ''Camelot'' would be his last film he would produce for the studio. On November 14, 1966, he sold a substantial share of studio stock to [[Seven Arts Productions]]. The sale was finalized on November 27, which totaled to approximately $32 million in cash.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/11/28/archives/warner-completes-sale-of-film-stock.html|title=Warner Completes Sale of Film Stock|newspaper=The New York Times|page=65|date=November 28, 1966|access-date=January 28, 2020}}</ref>{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=35}}\n\nFollowing the location shoot in Spain, the filming unit took a hiatus until Redgrave finished her stage duties.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=35}} By then, fifteen of the studio's twenty-three stage sets were occupied for ''Camelot''.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=31}} Filming was further complicated when Harris required 12 facial stitches after he fell down in his shower. The stitches reopened when Harris went out to party (against the doctor's orders), and this further delayed his recovery.
