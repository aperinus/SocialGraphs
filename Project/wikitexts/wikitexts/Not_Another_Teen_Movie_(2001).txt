While the general plot is based on ''[[She's All That]]'',<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> as well as ''[[Varsity Blues (film)|Varsity Blues]]'',<ref name=\"variety\" /> ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'',<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]''<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> and  ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'', the film is also filled with [[allusion]]s to teenage and college-age films from the 1980s and 1990s, such as ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'',<ref name=\"latimes\" /> ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'',<ref name=\"variety\" /> ''[[Never Been Kissed]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'', ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]'', ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]'', ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', and ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', while [[Paul Gleason]] reprises his role as Vice Principal Vernon from [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes']] [[1985 in film|1985]] [[teen film|teen]] [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] [[Comedy drama|comedy-drama film]] ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the stereotypical high school community of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] High in [[Southern California]], Priscilla, head [[cheerleader]], separates from her [[American football|football]] star but [[slacker]] boyfriend, Jake Wyler. Discovering she is now dating timid and weird Les to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin, makes a bet with him to turn nerdy Janey Briggs, a \"uniquely rebellious girl,\" into the [[prom queen]]. Janey resists his efforts because she is not insecure enough to feel any need to change anything about herself, nor does she feel anything for him at first, but that does not stop him from trying.\n\nAs Jake attempts to court Janey, he faces adversity from his own sister, Catherine, who is sexually attracted to him; Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend, Ricky Lipman; and memories from his past football career. Catherine eventually assists him by \"drastically\" altering Janey's appearance (simply removing her glasses and ponytail), instantly making her drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nMeanwhile, Janey's younger brother, Mitch, and his friends Ox and Bruce, make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation despite still being freshmen. Mitch tries to impress his longtime crush, Amanda Becker with a [[love letter]]. Bruce says that he does not have a chance with her, saying, \"Keep dreaming!\"\n\nAs the prom draws near, Jake becomes known for failing to lead the football team to victory at last year's state championship game. Austin then tricks Jake into telling Janey about his bet to spite Priscilla, pretending to whisper the secret bet in Janey's ear, causing her to immediately leave upset. On prom night, Austin and Janey go together; a jealous Jake and Catherine have a dance-off with Austin and Janey, with Catherine dancing in a sexual manner. Janey runs off crying.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch and his friends are having a lousy time until Amanda arrives and Mitch gives her the letter (to which she responds she does not have sex with every loser who does such, but gives them [[handjob]]s), horny Bruce hooks up with the equally horny international exchange student Areola, and Ox later hooks up with Catherine after sharing a romantic and rather odd connection.\n\nJake is awarded prom king and the votes for prom queen are tied. Everyone thinks that it is between Janey and Priscilla, but they are shocked to find that [[conjoined twins]] Kara and Sara Fratelli win prom queen. During the traditional prom king and queen dance, Janey supposedly left with Austin to go to a hotel.\n\nJake goes to the hotel room where he finds Austin having wild sex with a girl, but is shocked to find that it is Priscilla and not Janey, while Les videotapes them with his pants down.  Austin tells Jake that Janey \"ran home to her daddy.\" Jake coldly punches Austin and Priscilla, knocking them unconscious for humiliating Janey. He then punches Les for \"being really weird\" (and punches a plastic bag floating next to Les); afterwards he runs to Janey's only be told she is on her way to Paris to [[art school]].\n\nJake arrives at the airport and confronts her before she boards the plane, but uses a plethora of [[clich\u00e9]]d lines from other films (such as ''[[She's All That]]'', ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', and ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'') to convince her to not go. His final (and only original) speech suggests they would be better off separated, but Janey mistakenly believes he is quoting ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and she decides to stay with him.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Janey's father Mr. Briggs drunkenly assaults himself with pies in his kitchen. In a [[post-credits scene]], a previously seen [[albino]] folk singer, an [[afro]]ed student with a guitar, reveals that she has become [[Visual impairment|blind]] and calls out for assistance upon completing her song, while an audience member calls for another to assist in stealing her guitar.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Actor\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" | Stereotype\n! scope=\"col\" | Based on\n|-\n| [[Chyler Leigh]] || Janey Briggs || \"The Pretty Ugly Girl\" || Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]) from ''[[She's All That]]''<br />Katerina Stratford ([[Julia Stiles]]) from ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''<br />Andie Walsh ([[Molly Ringwald]]) from ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''\n|-\n| [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] || Jake Wyler || \"The Popular Jock\" || Zack Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) from ''She's All That''<br /> Jake Ryan ([[Michael Schoeffling]]) from ''[[Sixteen Candles]]''<br/>Jonathan Moxon ([[James Van Der Beek]]) from ''[[Varsity Blues (film)|Varsity Blues]]''\n|-\n| [[Jaime Pressly]] || Priscilla || \"The Nasty Cheerleader\" || Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]) from ''She's All That''<br />Big Red ([[Lindsay Sloane]]) and Torrance ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) from ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]''<br />Angela Hayes ([[Mena Suvari]]) from ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''\n|-\n| [[Eric Christian Olsen]] || Austin || \"The Cocky Blond Guy\" || Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]) from ''She's All That''<br />Steff McKee ([[James Spader]]) from ''Pretty in Pink''\n|-\n| [[Mia Kirshner]] || Catherine Wyler || \"The Cruelest Girl\" || Kathryn Merteuil ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) from ''[[Cruel Intentions]]''<br />Mackenzie Siler ([[Anna Paquin]]) from ''She's All That''\n|-\n| [[Deon Richmond]] || Malik Token || \"The [[Tokenism|Token]] Black Guy\" || Preston ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) from ''She's All That''\n|-\n| [[Eric Jungmann]] || Ricky Lipman || \"The Obsessed Best Friend\" || Duckie Dale ([[Jon Cryer]]) from ''Pretty in Pink''\n|-\n| [[Ron Lester]] || Reggie Ray || \"The Stupid Fat Guy\" || Billy Bob (Lester) from ''Varsity Blues''\n|-\n| [[Cody McMains]] || Mitch Briggs || \"The Desperate Virgin\" || Kevin Myers ([[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]) from ''American Pie''<br />Preston Meyers ([[Ethan Embry]]) from ''Can't Hardly Wait''<br />Simon Boggs ([[Kieran Culkin]]) from ''She's All That''<br />John Bender ([[Judd Nelson]]) from ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''\n|-\n| [[Sam Huntington]] || Ox || \"The Sensitive Guy\" || Oz ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]) from ''American Pie''<br />Andrew Clark ([[Emilio Estevez]]) from ''The Breakfast Club''\n|-\n| [[Samm Levine]] || Bruce || \"The Wannabe\" || Daniel LaRusso ([[Ralph Macchio]]) from ''[[The Karate Kid]]''<br />Jim Levenstein ([[Jason Biggs]]) from ''American Pie''<br />Kenny Fisher ([[Seth Green]]) from ''Can't Hardly Wait''\n|-\n| [[Lacey Chabert]] || Amanda Becker || \"The Perfect Girl\" || Amanda Beckett ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) from ''Can't Hardly Wait''\n|-\n| [[Cerina Vincent]] || Areola || \"The Foreign Exchange Student\" || Nadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) from [[American Pie (film)|''American Pie'']]\n|-\n| [[Riley Smith]] || Les || \"The Beautiful Weirdo\" || Ricky Fitts ([[Wes Bentley]]) from [[American Beauty (1999 film)|''American Beauty'']] \n|-\n| [[Julie Welch]] || Mrs. Wyler || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| [[Samaire Armstrong]] || Kara Fratelli || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| [[Nectar Rose]] || Sara Fratelli || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| [[Ed Lauter]] || The Coach || \"Win-at-all-cost Jerk Coach\"|| Coach Bud Kilmer ([[Jon Voight]]) from ''Varsity Blues''\n|-\n| [[Randy Quaid]] || Mr. Briggs || \"Dead Beat Alcoholic Father\" || Wayne Boggs ([[Kevin Pollak]]) from ''She's All That''<br />Jack Walsh ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) from ''Pretty in Pink''\n|-\n| [[Joanna Garcia]] || Sandy Sue || \"The New Girl in School\" || Sandy Olsson ([[Olivia Newton-John]]) from ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''\n|-\n| [[Beverly Polcyn]] || Sadie Agatha Johnson || N/A || Josie Geller ([[Drew Barrymore]]) from ''[[Never Been Kissed]]''\n|-\n| [[Rob Benedict]] || Preston Wasserstein || N/A || Ferris Bueller ([[Matthew Broderick]]) from ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''\n|-\n| [[Patrick St. Esprit]] || Austin's father || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| [[Josh Radnor]] || Tour Guide || N/A || Michael Eckman ([[David Krumholtz]]) from ''10 Things I Hate About You''<br />Barry Manilow ([[Tom Green]]) from ''Road Trip''\n|-\n| [[Paul Goebel (television personality)|Paul Goebel]] || The Chef Who Ejaculated Into Mitch's French Toast || N/A || Horatio Sanz (Road Trip)\n|-\n| [[George Wyner]] || Principal Cornish || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| [[H.
