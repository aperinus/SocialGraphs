Each part begins with a number appearing on screen and falling down flat. The film makes use of many [[film editing|editing techniques]], such as superimposition, slow motion, fast motion, rapid cross-cutting, and montage.\n\nThe film has an unabashedly [[avant-garde]] style, and the subject matter varies greatly. The titular man with the movie camera ([[Mikhail Kaufman]], Vertov's brother) travels to diverse locations to capture a variety of shots. He appears in artistic images such as a superimposed shot of the cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, and another superimposed shot of the cameraman inside a beer glass. General images include laborers at work, sporting events, couples getting married and divorced, a woman giving birth, and a funeral procession. Much of the film is concerned with people of varying economic classes navigating urban environments. On occasion, the film's editor (Svilova) is shown working with strips of film and various pieces of editing equipment.\n\nDespite claiming to be without actors, the film features a few staged situations. This includes some of the cameraman's actions, the scene of a woman getting dressed, and chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). Stop-motion is used for several shots, including an unmanned camera on a tripod standing up, showing off its mechanical parts, and then walking off screen.\n\n==Vertov's intentions==\n[[Image:Mikhail kaufman on train.jpg|thumb|In this shot, Mikhail Kaufman acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot]]\nVertov was an early pioneer in documentary film-making during the late 1920s. He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the [[kinoks]], or kino-oki (kino-[[eye]]s). Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making, a radical approach to movie making. Most of Vertov's films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers.\n\nVertov's crowning achievement, ''Man with a Movie Camera'', was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, ''[[A Sixth Part of the World]]''. Critics had declared that Vertov's overuse of \"[[intertitle]]s\" was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the \"kinoks\" subscribed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Working within that context, Vertov dealt with a lot of fear in anticipation of the film's release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central [[Communist]] newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', which spoke directly of the film's experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Upon the official release of ''Man with a Movie Camera'', Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:\n<blockquote>\nThe film ''Man with a Movie Camera'' represents<br />\nAN EXPERIMENTATION IN THE CINEMATIC COMMUNICATION<br />\nOf visual phenomena<br />\nWITHOUT THE USE OF INTERTITLES<br />\n(a film without intertitles)<br />\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCENARIO<br />\n(a film without a scenario)<br />\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF THEATRE<br />\n(a film without actors, without sets, etc.)<br />\nThis new experimentation work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature.\n</blockquote>\n\nThis manifesto echoes an earlier one that Vertov wrote in 1922, in which he disavowed popular films he felt were indebted to literature and theater.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/reviews/vertov.htm |title=Images \u2013 ''Man With a Movie Camera'' by Grant Tracey |work=imagesjournal.com |access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Stylistic aspects==\nWorking within a [[Marxist]] ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city's purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino's aesthetic shone through in his portrayal of electrification, [[industrialization]], and the achievements of workers through hard labour. This could also be viewed as early [[modernism]] in film.\n\nSome have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from [[Walter Ruttmann]]'s ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Great City]]'' (1927), which predates ''Man with a Movie Camera'' by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929,{{sfn|Michelson|1995|loc=ch. \"Dziga Vertov. Letter from Berlin\", p. 101}} these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries for previous ten years, all of which predate ''Berlin''. Vertov's pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na'ou (1905\u20131940), whose ''The Man Who Has a Camera'' (1933) pays explicit homage to Vertov's ''Man with a Movie Camera''.<ref>\"Rhythmic movement, the city symphony and transcultural transmediality: Liu Na'ou and ''The Man Who Has a Camera'' (1933)\", Ling Zhang a Department of Cinema and Media Studies, The University of Chicago, Classics 305, ''Journal of Chinese Cinemas'', vol. 9, iss. 1, 2015, pp. 42\u201361. Published online: 11 March 2015. {{doi|10.1080/17508061.2015.1010303}}.</ref>\n\n''Man with a Movie Camera''{{'}}s usage of double exposure and seemingly \"hidden\" cameras made the movie come across as a surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, which change size or appear underneath other objects ([[Multiple exposure#Double exposure|double exposure]]). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities that could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film's lack of \"actors\" and \"sets\" makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is \"[separated] from the language of theatre and literature\".\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=August 2012}}\nIt was filmed over a period of about 3 years.
