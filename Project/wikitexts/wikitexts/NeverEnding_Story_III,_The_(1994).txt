This film primarily used the characters from [[Michael Ende]]'s novel ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' (1979), with the exception of Atreyu, who is absent from the film, and introduced a new storyline. It was an international co-production between the United States and Germany.\n\nThe special creature effects were provided by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a prologue, the Old Man of Wandering Mountain reads from a large book, begins to record a prophecy of a day when \"The Nasty\" will arrive in Fantasia, and describes the savior of \"Extraordinary Courage\".\n\n[[Bastian Balthazar Bux]] is now 13 years old, and his father Barney has married a woman named Jane, and moved into her house in a new neighborhood. Jane's daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become a victim of the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. Bastian arranges for them to be expelled with the help of the janitor after the Nasties trap him in the boiler room.\n\nHe later flees to the library, where he is surprised to find [[Carl Conrad Coreander]] and the ''Neverending Story''. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia, where he is reunited with [[Falkor]], [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Engywook and Urgl|Engywook and Urgl]]. On Earth, the Nasties find the ''Neverending Story'' and use it to bombard Fantasia with fireballs and a storm. With wooden Bark Troll, Bastian and his friends head for the Wandering Mountains to speak with the [[List of The Neverending Story characters#The Childlike Empress|Childlike Empress]], who asks Bastian to find the ''Neverending Story'' using the [[AURYN|Auryn]]. Falkor, Barky, the [[gnome]]s, and Rockbiter's son, Junior, help him, but a \"wish overload\" scatters them all across Earth, where Barky ends up in a conifer forest, Falkor saves Junior from falling to his death near [[Mount Rushmore]], and the gnomes arrive in [[Nome, Alaska]]. Bastian locates Falkor and Junior, and Falkor flies off to find the others while Junior stays at Bastian's house. Rockbiter sadly informs his wife that Junior is gone, and the Nasties provoke them to quarrel.\n\nNicole takes the Auryn from Bastian's room, discovers its wishing abilities, and takes it on a shopping trip to the local mall. Bark Troll arrives at Bastian's house disguised as a garden plant, while the Gnomes are mailed to him in a box. The reunited group go in search of Nicole, but the Nasties find the Auryn first, whereupon giant crustacean creatures appear in Fantasia to kill the Empress and her advisors. Everyone in the mall turns evil, including Mr. Coreander and Bastian and Nicole\u2019s parents. Bastian is struck by lightning, and begins to succumb to the wills of the Nasties, but Nicole saves him, and Bastian recovers the Auryn and the book in a fight. The Fantasians return to Fantasia, which is restored to its former magnificence. Bastian and Nicole manage to keep their parents from divorcing, and Junior is reunited with his parents. Nicole and Bastian return to school the next day and find that Bastian has changed Slip and the Nasties into friendly classmates, and Bastian returns the ''Neverending Story'' to Mr. Coreander.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason James Richter]] as [[Bastian Balthazar Bux]]\n* [[Melody Kay]] as Nicole Baxter, Bastian's stepsister\n* [[Jack Black]] as Slip (\"The Nasty\"), the leader of the Nasties\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as [[Carl Conrad Coreander]], a former local librarian; Old Man of Wandering Mountain\n* [[Julie Cox]] as The [[Childlike Empress]]\n* [[Moya Brady]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Engywook and Urgl|Urgl]]\n* [[Tony Robinson]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Engywook and Urgl|Engywook]]\n* [[Tracey Ellis]] as Jane Bux, Bastian's stepmother\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Barney Bux, Bastian's father\n* Frederick Warder as Mr. Rockbiter Sr.\n* [[William Todd-Jones]] as Mrs. Rockbiter\n* [[Dave Forman]] as Mr. Rockbiter Jr.\n* Gordon Robertson as [[Falkor]]\n* Kaefan Shaw as Bark Troll\n* [[Mark Acheson]] as the Janitor\n* [[Ryan Bollman]] as Dog, a member of the Nasties\n* Carole Finn as Marcia/Mookie, a member of the Nasties and Slip's girlfriend\n* Nicole Parker as Coil, a member of the Nasties\n* Adrien Dorval as Rage, a member of the Nasties\n\n=== Voices ===\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Bark Troll; [[Falkor]]\n* [[Mac McDonald]] as Mrs. Rockbiter\n* [[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]] as Rockbiter; Mr. Rockchewer; Junior Rockchewer\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Music From & Inspired By The Neverending Story III: Here Come The Fantasians\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1994\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length     = 01:17:53\n| label      = WEA\n| producer   =\n| chronology = ''The Neverending Story'' soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter#Soundtrack|The Neverending Story II - The Next Chapter: Original Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year  = 1990\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 01:17:53\n| extra_column = Performer(s)\n| extra1 = Real Im-Pact\n| title1 = [[The NeverEnding Story (song)|The Neverending Story]]\n| writer1 = [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Keith Forsey]]\n| length1 = 3:36\n| extra2 = [[Intermission (band)|Intermission]]\n| title2 = Give Peace A Chance (Single Mix)\n| writer2 = Attack II, Buzz Gardner, Tom Jaques G.
