It stars [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[John Proctor (Salem witch trials)|John Proctor]], [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Abigail Williams]], [[Paul Scofield]] as Judge [[Thomas Danforth]], [[Joan Allen]] as [[Elizabeth Proctor]] and [[Bruce Davison]] as Reverend [[Samuel Parris]]. Set during the [[Salem witch trials]], the film chronicles a group of teenage girls who, after getting caught conjuring love spells in the woods, are forced to lie that\u00a0[[Satan]]\u00a0had \"invaded\" them, and subsequently accuse several innocent people of witchcraft.\n\nDespite [[Box-office bomb|underperforming commercially]], grossing only $7 million on a $25 million budget, the film received positive reviews, with Day-Lewis, Ryder, Scofield, and Allen earning widespread acclaim for their performances.\n\nThe film was screened at the\u00a0[[47th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it competed for the\u00a0[[Golden Bear]]. At the\u00a0[[54th Golden Globe Awards]], Scofield and Allen were nominated for\u00a0[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]\u00a0respectively, while Allen received a\u00a0[[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]\u00a0nomination at the\u00a0[[69th Academy Awards]], and Scofield won\u00a0[[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]]\u00a0at the\u00a0[[50th British Academy Film Awards]]. Arthur Miller received nominations for the\u00a0[[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]\u00a0and the\u00a0[[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1692, a group of village girls meet in the woods with slave [[Tituba]], attempting to conjure love spells. [[Abigail Williams]] kills a chicken and drinks its blood, wishing for [[John Proctor (Salem witch trials)|John Proctor]]'s wife [[Elizabeth Proctor|Elizabeth]] to die. When Abigail's uncle, Reverend [[Samuel Parris]], discovers them, the girls run away, but his daughter [[Betty Parris|Betty]] collapses unconscious.\n\nBetty will not awaken, nor will [[Thomas Putnam|Thomas]] and [[Ann Putnam]]'s daughter Ruth, who was also conjuring. [[Giles Corey]], who suspects that the children are just acting out, and John Proctor, with whom Abigail had an affair, visit the Parris household. Believing Betty and Ruth to be [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]], Parris and the Putnams call [[John Hale (minister)|Reverend John Hale]] from nearby Beverly to examine Betty. To save herself and the other girls from punishment, Abigail accuses Tituba of witchcraft. After being whipped, Tituba confesses to seeing [[the devil]] and is saved from being hanged. Struck by their new power, the girls begin naming numerous other women, including Elizabeth, whom they \"saw\" with the devil.\n\nJohn wants to forget about his affair with Abigail and get back with Elizabeth. He decides to stop Abigail's accusations, telling his servant, [[Mary Warren (Salem witch trials)|Mary Warren]], who is one of the \"afflicted\" girls, to testify [[Salem witch trials|at the trial]] that the [[witchcraft]] was faked. In court, Francis Nurse gives a list of people vouching for the accused; the judges order that all on the list be arrested and brought in for questioning. Giles insists that when Ruth accused [[Rebecca Nurse]], Mr. Putnam was heard to tell Ruth that she had won him a \"fine gift of land\". Giles refuses to identify who heard this remark, and the judges order his arrest. Mary Warren insists she only thought she saw spirits but the other girls later cow her into recanting. Elizabeth says she is pregnant and will be spared from death until the baby is born, but John insists that the girls be charged with [[false witness]].\n\nThe girls are called in and asked if they were lying about the witchcraft, but they start screaming that Mary Warren is bewitching them. To demonstrate Abigail's complicity, John confesses to having sex with her, claiming that she accused Elizabeth in order to get rid of her so that she could marry him. Abigail denies the affair, so Elizabeth is called in to verify it. Unaware that John confessed and wanting to save his reputation, she lies. As Reverend Hale tries to persuade the court of John's honesty, the girls turn the court further against the Proctors by screaming that Mary Warren is attacking them as a \"yellow bird\". John repeats his accusation that the girls are merely pretending, but they run outside from the \"bird\" into a nearby lake. To save herself from being hanged, Mary Warren accuses John of witchcraft. When asked if he will return to God, John despairingly yells \"I say God is dead!\" and is arrested as a witch.\n\nOn the day before John is to be hanged, Reverend Hale confronts Abigail at the now-abandoned homes of the victims whom she testified against. Because Hale was the lone official in the court to doubt her claims, Abigail attempts to convince the court that Hale's wife is also a witch; however, this backfires as the judges doubt her, as they consider a minister's wife to be pure. Eventually, the girls become outcasts and Abigail steals Parris' money to flee to [[Barbados]], but not before asking John to go with her, telling him she never wished any of this on him. He refuses, stating \"It's not on a ship we'll meet again, but in Hell\".\n\nParris fears that John's hanging will cause riots directed at him, so he allows Elizabeth to meet with John to convince him to \"confess\" and save his life. John agrees and writes the confession. The judges insist that he sign the confession and publicly display it to prove his guilt and to convince others to confess, but John, determined to keep his name pure for his sons, angrily shouts \"Leave me my name!\", and tears it up.\n\nOn the gallows, John, Rebecca Nurse and [[Martha Corey]]'s recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] is cut short when they are hanged.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[John Proctor (Salem witch trials)|John Proctor]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Abigail Williams]]\n* [[Paul Scofield]] as Judge [[Thomas Danforth]]\n* [[Joan Allen]] as [[Elizabeth Proctor]]\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Reverend [[Samuel Parris]]\n* [[Rob Campbell]] as Reverend [[John Hale (minister)|John Hale]]\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as [[Thomas Putnam]]\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as [[Giles Corey]]\n* [[Karron Graves]] as [[Mary Warren (Salem witch trials)|Mary Warren]]\n* [[Charlayne Woodard]] as [[Tituba]]\n* [[Kali Rocha]] as [[Mercy Lewis]]\n* [[Rachael Bella]] as [[Betty Parris]]\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as [[Ann Putnam]]\n* [[Ashley Peldon]] as Ruth Putnam\n* [[Elizabeth Lawrence (actress)|Elizabeth Lawrence]] as [[Rebecca Nurse]]\n* Tom McDermott  as Francis Nurse\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Judge [[Samuel Sewall]]\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as [[Martha Corey]]\n* [[Robert Breuler]] as Judge [[John Hathorne]]\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Marshal [[George Herrick]]\n* [[Ruth Maleczech]] as [[Sarah Osborne|Goody Osbourne]]\n* [[William Preston (actor)|William Preston]] as [[George Jacobs (Salem witch trials)|George Jacobs, Sr.]]\n}}\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\nIn 1952, Miller's friend [[Elia Kazan]] appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC); fearful of being blacklisted from Hollywood, Kazan named eight members of the Group Theatre, including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Paula Strasberg]], [[Lillian Hellman]], and [[John Garfield]], who in recent years had been fellow members of the Communist Party. After speaking with Kazan about his testimony, Miller traveled to [[Salem, Massachusetts]] to research the witch trials of 1692. ''The Crucible'', in which Miller likened the situation with the House Un-American Activities Committee to the witch hunt in Salem in 1692, opened at the Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953.\n\nMiller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s (the latter had directed the original production of Miller's ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''), but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, and they did not speak to each other for the next ten years. The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after ''The Crucible'' opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954. Later Miller was further checked out: when testimony came out that he misled the HUAC, he was sentenced to a $500 fine and a 30-day stay in jail. It was overturned on appeal. Kazan defended his own actions through his film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.\n\nThough the play was widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its first production, today ''The Crucible'' is Miller's most frequently produced work throughout the world. It was adapted as an opera by [[Robert Ward (composer)|Robert Ward]], which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] in 1962.\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie was not a box office success,<ref>{{cite news|title= The First of '101' Paydays Is a Big One|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-03/entertainment/ca-5121_1_box-office-grosses|access-date=2012-06-03}}</ref> making only $7,343,114 in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Crucible (1996)|publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]]|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=crucible.htm|access-date=2016-02-24}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film has an overall score of 69% on the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 62 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The critics consensus states, \"This staid adaptation of&nbsp;''The Crucible''&nbsp;dutifully renders Arthur Miller's landmark play on the screen with handsome production design and sturdy performances, if not with the political anger and thematic depth that earned the drama its reputation.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|1074978-crucible|The Crucible}}</ref> [[Victor Saul Navasky|Victor
