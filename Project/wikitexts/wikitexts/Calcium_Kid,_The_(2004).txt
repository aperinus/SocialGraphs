It stars [[Orlando Bloom]] as a milkman and amateur boxer. [[Billie Piper]] and [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] are also featured. It is directed by Alex De Rakoff and produced by [[Working Title Films]].\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy Connelly is a milkman who is thrust into the spotlight after a brutal fighter, Pete Wright, gets injured. Under manager Herbie Bush, Jimmy must fight the middleweight champion of the world, Jose Mendez.\n\nWithin the lead up to the fight with Mendez, Jimmy has to take part in a press conference, in which Bush recommends him to give Mendez fighting talk. However, this leads to Jimmy being seen as a [[fascist]] and a disgrace to England after being seen as racist.\n\nAfter Jimmy realises the harm Bush has caused, he calls off the fight. As Bush and the training team look for Jimmy, they find him cleaning his old milk cart. In a negotiation to help the town in order to fight, Jimmy is persuaded to participate.\n\nIn the locker room, minutes before the fight, as Jimmy and his crew walk backstage, Wright holds a shotgun to them, whilst the camera crew is also held hostage, filming the event. Wright leads them to a room where Jimmy is forced to fight Mendez, who is also held hostage. After getting substantially battered by Mendez, Jimmy manages to fight back, but then Wright smacks his head with the gun. As Wright goes to shoot Mendez, who is praying for his life, Jimmy [[Knockout|knocks out]] Wright with a single punch.\n\nWith the film crew recording the event, Jimmy becomes a hero across Britain.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as Jimmy Connelly\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Jos\u00e9 Mendez\n* [[Billie Piper]] as Angel\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as Stan Parlour\n* [[Tamer Hassan]] as Pete Wright\n* [[Omid Djalili]] as Herbie Bush\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Paddy O'Flanagan\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Sebastian Gore-Brown\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Artie Cohen\n* John Joyce as Jon Wright\n* [[Cathy Dunning]] as Joyce Wright\n* [[Frank Harper]] as Clive Connelly\n* [[Ronni Ancona]] as Pat Connelly\n* [[Peter Serafinowicz]] as Radio DJ\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics.
