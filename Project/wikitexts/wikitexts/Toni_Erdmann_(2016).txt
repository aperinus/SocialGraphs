Following the death of his beloved dog, he decides to reconnect with his daughter, Ines, who is pursuing a career in business consulting. Ines is working in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], on an outsourcing project in the oil industry. Consumed by her work, she seems to have little time for her family.\n\nWinfried spontaneously travels to Bucharest and waits for Ines in the lobby of an office complex. After several hours, she finally appears, accompanied by several of her client's board members and on the way to a meeting. Winfried puts on sunglasses and fake teeth as a playful disguise, and approaches the group from the side while hiding behind a newspaper. Ines ignores him, but meets with him briefly after work and invites him to a business reception at the US Embassy.\n\nIn the evening, Winfried and Ines attend the reception, where they meet Henneberg, a German oil company CEO with whom Ines wishes to secure a consulting contract. Ines tries to gain Henneberg's attention, but Henneberg seems more interested in her father. Winfried tells Henneberg that he has hired a replacement daughter because Ines is always busy. To Ines's surprise, Henneberg invites Winfried and Ines for drinks, along with his entourage. At the bar, Henneberg once again brushes Ines aside and makes fun of Winfried.\n\nAfter several days, Ines and Winfried are struggling to get along. Stressed out from work, Ines oversleeps, missing a planned rendezvous with clients, and blames her father for not waking her up. Feeling alienated and unwanted, he leaves in a taxi for the airport. Ines continues with her work as normal, and several days later arranges to meet two female friends at a bar. While Ines and her friends are chatting, a man approaches and introduces himself as \"Toni Erdmann\". The man is clearly Winfried in a wig and false teeth, but Ines does not let on. Her two friends politely engage \"Erdmann\" in conversation; he explains that he is a \"life coach\" and consultant visiting Bucharest to attend the funeral of his friend's turtle.\n\nInes is increasingly frustrated and unfulfilled in her work and personal life, but continues to encounter \"Erdmann\" sporadically at parties or outside her office. At first Ines is angry with her father, and accuses him of trying to \"ruin\" her, but as time goes on she comes to see the value of her father's interventions in her life, and plays along with the ruse. \"Erdmann\" accompanies her on a night out with her work friends, and eventually even accompanies her to a business meeting. In turn, \"Erdmann\" takes Ines to a Romanian family's Easter party, where he forces her into a reluctant performance of [[Whitney Houston]]'s \"[[The Greatest Love of All#Whitney Houston version|Greatest Love of All]]\". After singing, Ines promptly rushes off.\n\nBack at her flat, Ines is preparing to host a business team-building brunch to celebrate her birthday. She struggles to zip up her tight dress, realizes her shoes don't match, and attempts to change clothes. The doorbell rings. Instead of redressing, or changing her outfit, she opens the door wearing only her underpants. The first guest is her friend Steph, who offers to help her get dressed. Ines refuses, and when the next guest arrives she spontaneously removes her underpants and answers the door naked, telling her guests that her birthday brunch is a \"naked party\". Each of them reacts differently, with some leaving in disgust while others self-consciously strip. As the party becomes increasingly awkward, Winfried arrives dressed in a full-body Bulgarian [[kukeri]] costume. The costume first scares, then amuses, the partygoers, and Winfried soon leaves. Ines follows him. Outside in a public park, they hug, Winfried still in costume.\n\nMonths later, Ines returns to Germany for her grandmother's funeral. She has quit her job in Bucharest and will shortly begin a new one in [[Singapore]]. While talking with Winfried in the garden, Ines grabs the fake teeth from his shirt pocket and puts them on. Winfried says he wants to take a photo and goes to get his camera, leaving Ines alone in the garden.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Simonischek]] as Winfried Conradi / Toni Erdmann\n* [[Sandra H\u00fcller]] as Ines Conradi\n* [[Ingrid Bisu]] as Anca\n* [[Lucy Russell (actress)|Lucy Russell]] as Steph\n* Michael Wittenborn as Henneberg\n* Thomas Loibl as Gerald\n* Trystan P\u00fctter as Tim\n* [[Hadewych Minis]] as Tatjana\n* [[Vlad Ivanov]] as Iliescu\n* Victoria Cocias as Flavia\n* Ingrid Burkhard as Grandma Annegret\n* [[Klara H\u00f6fels]] as Irma\n\n==Production==\nThe character of Winfried was loosely based on Ade's own father, who wore a pair of fake teeth she gave him as a gag gift to play practical jokes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roxborough|first1=Scott|title=Cannes: 'Toni Erdmann' Director Maren Ade Wants a Subsidy Quota for Women Filmmakers (Q&A)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/maren-ade-directing-toni-erdmann-893318|access-date=18 May 2016 |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=12 May 2016 }}</ref> She was also influenced by the comedian [[Andy Kaufman]]'s alter ego [[Tony Clifton]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/toni-erdmann-maren-ade-sandra-h-ller-interview-oscar-foreign-language-film-bafta-golden-globes-a7554586.html|title=Toni Erdmann's Maren Ade interview: Tarantino makes long films too|last=Mottram|first=James|date=2017-01-31|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAde set the film in [[Bucharest]] in part because many German companies had begun to do business there at the end of the Communist era, with many foreign consultants sent to \"change the system\" and help businesses turn a profit. \"And I like the new wave of Romanian films right now, too.
