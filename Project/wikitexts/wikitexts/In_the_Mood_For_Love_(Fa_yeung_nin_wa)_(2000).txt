She has kept her head lowered... to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away. (Translation)\n\n===Summary===\n\nIn 1962 [[British Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]] expatriates Chow Mo-wan, a journalist, and Su Li-shen, a secretary at a shipping company, rent rooms in adjacent apartments. Each has a spouse who works and often leaves them alone on overtime shifts. Due to the friendly but overbearing presence of a Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and their bustling, [[mahjong]]-playing neighbours, Chow and Su are often alone in their rooms. Although they initially are friendly to each other only as need be, they grow closer as they realize that their spouses are having an affair.\n\nChow invites Su to help him write a [[wuxia|martial arts serial]]. Their increased time together draws the attention of their neighbors, leading Chow to rent a hotel room where they can work together undistracted. As time passes, they acknowledge that they have developed feelings for each other. When Chow takes a job in [[Singapore]], he asks Su to go with him. She agrees but arrives too late at the hotel to accompany him.\n\nThe next year, in Singapore, Chow relays a story to his friend about how in older times, when a person had a secret, they could go atop a mountain, make a hollow in a tree, and whisper it into the hollow and cover it with mud. Su arrives at Singapore and visits Chow's apartment. She calls Chow but remains silent when Chow picks up the phone. Later, Chow realizes she had visited his apartment after seeing a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his ashtray.\n\nThree years later, Su visits Mrs. Suen, who is about to emigrate to the United States, and inquires about whether her apartment is available for rent. Sometime later, Chow returns to Hong Kong to visit his former landlords the Koos, who have emigrated to the Philippines. He asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner tells him a woman and her son are now living there. He leaves without realizing Su is the lady living there.\n\nChow travels to [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia, and visits [[Angkor Wat]]. He whispers something unheard into a hollow in a wall there and plugs the hollow with mud.\n\n===Closing Intertitle===\n\nAfter Chow leaves Angkor Wat, the following intertitle appears and concludes the film:\n\n\u90a3\u4e9b\u6d88\u901d\u4e86\u7684\u6b72\u6708\uff0c\u5f77\u5f7f\u9694\u8457\u4e00\u584a\u7a4d\u8457\u7070\u5875\u7684\u73bb\u7483\uff0c\u770b\u5f97\u5230\uff0c\u6293\u4e0d\u8457\u3002\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u61f7\u5ff5\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u80fd\u885d\u7834\u90a3\u584a\u7a4d\u8457\u7070\u5875\u7684\u73bb\u7483\uff0c\u4ed6\u6703\u8d70\u56de\u65e9\u5df2\u6d88\u901d\u7684\u6b72\u6708\u3002(As it appears on screen)\n\nHe remembers those vanished years.

Had he shattered through that dust-laden glass, he would have walked back into those long-vanished years.

The English title derives from the song \"[[I'm in the Mood for Love]]\". Director Wong had planned to name the film ''Secrets'' until listening to the song late in post-production.\n\n== Development and pre-production ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n\n''In the Mood for Love'' went through a long gestation period. In the 1990s, Wong Kar-wai found some commercial success, much critical acclaim, and wide influence on other filmmakers throughout Asia and the world with films such as ''[[Chungking Express]]'' and ''[[Fallen Angels (1995 film)|Fallen Angels]]'', both set in present-day Hong Kong. His 1997 film ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' was also successful internationally, winning him [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and surprising many. It was even popular with mainstream audiences in Hong Kong, despite its then-unusual focus on a gay love story and its having been largely improvised in Argentina, a landscape unfamiliar to Wong. By the end of the decade, with sovereignty of Hong Kong transferred from Britain to the People's Republic of China, Wong was eager to work once more in the mainland, where he had been born. He had been dissatisfied with the final result of his 1994 [[wuxia]] epic ''[[Ashes of Time]]'', which was set in ancient times and filmed in remote desert regions, and decided to deal with a more 20th-century, urban setting.\n\nBy 1998, Wong had developed a concept for his next film ''Summer in Beijing''. Although no script was finalized, he and cameraman [[Christopher Doyle]] had been to [[Tiananmen Square]] and other areas of the city to do a small amount of unauthorized shooting. Wong told journalists the film was to be a musical and a love story. Wong secured the participation of [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] and [[Maggie Cheung]] to star, and with his background in graphic design, had even made posters for the film. He had begun work on script treatments, which since ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'', he tended to treat as only a very loose basis for his work to secure financing, preferring to leave things open to change during the shoot.\n\nIt transpired that there would be difficulties securing permission to shoot in Beijing with Wong's spontaneous methods of working and potential political sensitivities in setting his film in mid-20th century China. Wong had come to think of ''Summer in Beijing'' as a triptych of stories, much like his original concept of ''Chungking Express'' (in which the third story had been spun off into the film ''Fallen Angels''). Quickly, Wong decided to jettison this structure, saving only one of the three planned stories, which had been titled provisionally, ''A Story of Food'', and dealt with a woman and a man who shared noodles and secrets. As he reunited with his actors and production team, most of whom had collaborated several times before, Wong decided ''A Story of Food'' would be the heart of his next film. The story would slowly evolve into ''In the Mood for Love'', after transposing its setting away from mainland China and back to 1960s Hong Kong.\n\nWong had set his breakthrough ''Days of Being Wild'' in that time in Hong Kong, when mainland-born Chinese and their memories, including those of Wong, then a young child, had a strong presence in the territory. Still saturated with the sounds of 1930s and 1940s Shanghai singing stars and the ideals they represented, the time also reminded him of the wide array of vibrant dance music floating in over the Pacific from the Philippines, Hawaii, Latin America and the United States, which Wong had used as a backdrop in ''Days of Being Wild''. Wong had regarded ''Days of Being Wild'' upon its release in 1990 as an artistic success, and had planned a sequel to it. However, his producers had been disappointed by its box-office returns, particularly given that its shoot had been prolonged and expensive, with Wong, who had come out of the Hong Kong industry, first attempting to work more independently, including collaborating for the first time with cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who favored jazz-like spontaneity in his shooting methods. Despite involving many of Hong Kong's top stars, the film's profits had been modest, so Wong was not given the opportunity to follow it up. Yet as he moved on to other films, he had always retained the dream of doing so. With the impossibility of the original idea of ''Summer in Beijing'', he was now able to pursue it.\n\nThe cast of Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung in ''A Story of Food'' (soon to become ''In the Mood for Love'') provided an opportunity to pick up a loose thread of ''Days of Being Wild'', as the actors had appeared in that film, although never together. Leung's few scenes had been left incomplete, awaiting Wong's planned sequel that was never made. ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'', a sequel in its plot to ''In the Mood for Love'', would later serve for Wong as a sequel in spirit to ''Days of Being Wild'', connecting the story of Leung's character in ''Days'' and ''In the Mood''. The writing of ''2046'' essentially began at the same time as that of ''In the Mood for Love''. Because neither film had its plot, structure, or even all its characters, scripted in advance, Wong began working on the ideas that eventually made it into ''2046'' during the shoot of ''In the Mood for Love''. As he and his collaborators made the film in a variety of settings, its story took shape. Eventually, these constantly developing ideas, taken from one of the remnants of ''Summer in Beijing'', were developed too much to fit into one film. Wong discarded most of the footage and story before arriving at ''In the Mood'', later reshooting and reimagining the rest as ''2046''.\n\n==Production==\nWong's plan to make a film set primarily in Hong Kong did not simplify matters when it came to the shoot. The city's appearance was much changed since the 1960s, and Wong's personal nostalgia for the time added to his desire for historical accuracy. Wong had little taste for working in studio settings, let alone using special effects to imitate the look of past times. Christopher Doyle later discussed the necessity of filming where the streets, the buildings, and even the sight of clothes hanging on lines (as in 1960s Hong Kong) could give a real energy to the actors and the story, whose outlines were constantly open to revision as shooting progressed. While set in Hong Kong, a portion of the filming (like outdoor and hotel scenes) was shot in less modernized neighborhoods of Bangkok, Thailand. Further, a brief portion later in the film is set in Singapore (one of Wong's initial inspirations on the story had been a short story set in Hong Kong, ''Intersection'', by the Hong Kong writer Liu Yichang). In its final sequences, the film also incorporates footage of [[Angkor Wat]], Cambodia, where Leung's character is working as a journalist.\n\nThe film took 15 months to shoot.<ref name=\"David Ng\"/> The actors found the process inspiring but demanding. They required a lot of work to understand the times, being slightly younger than Wong and having grown up in a rapidly changing Hong Kong or, in Maggie Cheung's case, partly in the United Kingdom.\n\nCheung portrayed 1930s Chinese screen icon [[Ruan Lingyu]] in [[Stanley Kwan]]'s 1992 film ''[[Center Stage (1991 film)|Center Stage]]'', for which she wore [[qipao]], the dresses worn by stylish Chinese women throughout much of the first half of the 20th century. It had been Cheung's most recognized performance to date and her hardest, partly due to the clothing, which restricted her freedom of movement. For Wong's film, Cheung, playing a married woman in her thirties who had carried over the elegance of her younger years in the pre-revolutionary mainland, would again wear qipao, known in Cantonese as cheongsam, and spoke of it as the way of understanding her character Su Li-zhen, whose quiet strength Cheung felt was unlike her own more spontaneous spirit.\n\nThe cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]], for whom the film was the sixth collaboration with Wong Kar-wai,<ref>{{cite web|title=Christopher Doyle (Cinematographer) |url=http://www.wkw-inthemoodforlove.com/eng/prop_agency/chris.asp |work=In the Mood for Love official website |access-date=7 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623193531/http://www.wkw-inthemoodforlove.com/eng/prop_agency/chris.asp |archivedate=23 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> had to leave when production went over schedule and was replaced by [[Mark Lee Ping Bin]], renowned for his work with Taiwanese filmmaker [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]].<ref name=\"David Ng\"/> Both DPs are credited equally for the final film. Some scenes in the final cut are thought to have been shot by each, with some critics noting differences between Doyle's more kinetic style as seen in earlier Wong movies, and the more subtle long shots of Lee framing key parts of ''In the Mood for Love''.\n\nCritic Tony Rayns, on the other hand, noted in a commentary on another Wong film that the differing styles of the two cinematographers were blended seamlessly by Wong's own fluid aesthetic. Like all of Wong's previous work, this one was shot on film, not digitally.\n\nDoyle's departure did not result from major artistic arguments with Wong. However, despite his agreement with Wong's spontaneous approach to scripting, he found it frustrating to reshoot many of the key moments over and over in environments throughout Southeast Asia until they felt right to the director. He had to turn down many other projects due to the total commitment, without a clear time limit, required by Wong. Several years later Doyle initially signed on to work on the sequel ''2046'', but he also abandoned that project halfway through for similar reasons (being replaced by a range of DPs) and has not worked with Wong since. Tony Leung, on the other hand, returned to work on ''2046'', in which he starred without Maggie Cheung, who made only a brief appearance in already shot footage from ''In the Mood for Love''. Leung also starred in Wong's 2013 film, ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]''. Cheung felt ''In the Mood for Love'' was the high point of her career, and she has worked much more infrequently since, starring in several films soon after but within four years, all but retired from acting, despite winning a Best Actress Award at Cannes for 2004's ''Clean''.\n\nThe final months of production and post-production on ''In the Mood for Love'', a submission to the Cannes Film Festival in May 2000, were notorious for their confusion. The film was barely finished in time for the festival, as would occur again four years later when Wong submitted ''2046''. Wong continued shooting more and more of ''In the Mood for Love'' with the cast and crew as he worked furiously to edit the massive amounts of footage he had shot over the past year. He removed large chunks of the story to strip it down to its most basic element, the relationship between these characters in the 1960s, with brief allusions to earlier and later times. In the meantime, Wong screened brief segments before the festival for journalists and distributors. Despite the general lack of commercial interest in Chinese cinema at the time by North American media corporations, Wong was given a distribution deal for a limited theatrical release in North America on USA Films, based only on a few minutes of footage.\n\nBy early 2000, with the deadline for Cannes approaching, Wong was contacted by the director of Cannes, who encouraged him to quickly complete a final cut, and offered a constructive criticism about the title. Although the title in Cantonese and Mandarin is based on a Zhou Xuan song whose English title is translated \"Age of Bloom\", the international title proved more complex. After discarding ''Summer in Beijing'' and ''A Story of Food'', Wong had provisionally settled on ''Secrets'', but Cannes felt this title was not as distinctive as the film Wong was preparing and suggested he should change it.\n\nFinally having completed the cut, but at a loss for titles, Wong was listening to a then-recent album by [[Bryan Ferry]] and [[Roxy Music]] titled ''Slave to Love: The Very Best of the Ballads'', and noticed a resonance in the song \"I'm in the Mood for Love\", which shared its title with a popular jazz standard of the mid-20th century. Many of Wong's previous English-language titles had come from pop songs, so he found this title particularly appropriate.\n\nWong states he was influenced by Hitchcock's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' while making this film and compares Tony Leung's character to [[James Stewart]]'s:\n\n{{blockquote|[T]he role of Tony in the film reminds me of Jimmy Stewart's in ''Vertigo''. There is a dark side to this character. I think it's very interesting that most of the audience prefers to think that this is a very innocent relationship. These are the good guys, because their spouses are the first ones to be unfaithful and they refuse to be. Nobody sees any darkness in these characters\u2014and yet they are meeting in secret to act out fictitious scenarios of confronting their spouses and of having an affair. I think this happens because the face of Tony Leung is so sympathetic. Just imagine if it was [[John Malkovich]] playing this role. You would think, 'This guy is really weird.' It's the same in ''Vertigo''. Everybody thinks James Stewart is a nice guy, so nobody thinks that his character is actually very sick.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Unforgettable |first=David |last=Chute |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2001-02-15/film-tv/unforgettable/2/ |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]] |date=15 February 2001 |access-date=7 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629135828/http://www.laweekly.com/2001-02-15/film-tv/unforgettable/2/ |archivedate=29 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n==Title song==\nThe title track \"Hua Yang De Nian Hua\" is a song by famous singer [[Zhou Xuan]] from the Solitary Island period.
