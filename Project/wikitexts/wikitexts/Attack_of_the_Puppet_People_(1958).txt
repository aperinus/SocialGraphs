Gordon]]. It stars [[John Agar]], [[John Hoyt]] and [[June Kenney]]. Gordon also supervised the film's [[special effects]].

Gordon to capitalize on the popular success of [[Universal Pictures|Universal-International]]'s ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', released the previous year in 1957.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/attack-of-the-puppet-people \"Attack of the Puppet People\"].

Sally Reynolds answers a newspaper advertisement for a secretary position. Although unnerved by Franz\u2019s extremely friendly and pushy manner, she is ultimately moved to take the job by his appeals over how short-handed the company is.\n\nA traveling salesman, Bob Westley, comes to the office, and he and Sally develop a relationship. After working at the doll factory for several weeks, Bob makes a marriage proposal to Sally. He persuades her to quit her job, promising to break the news to Franz.<ref name=\"WarrenThomas2009\">{{cite book|author1=Bill Warren|author2=Bill Thomas|title=Keep Watching the Skies!: American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties, The 21st Century Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0r8UCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA80|date=16 November 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4230-0|pages=80\u201382}}</ref>\n\nThe next day, however, Franz tells Sally that Bob has returned home to take care of extended business. She finds it completely implausible that Bob would abandon her in such a manner, and notices a new doll in Franz\u2019s collection that looks just like Bob. She goes to the police, claiming that Franz has shrunken Bob and added him to his doll collection. Sergeant Paterson is skeptical until Sally names the secretary who preceded her and a postman she heard vanished after a visit to Dolls, Inc.; both are listed as missing persons. Confronted by Paterson, Franz says his dolls are all modeled on people he knows and shows him a complete run of Bob dolls to prove the resemblance to a shrunken Bob is meaningless.\n\nFranz implores Sally to stay at Dolls, Inc. despite her reporting him to the police. When she refuses, he uses a machine to shrink her down to doll size.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim |last=Gross|title=Gross Movie Reviews: The Wrath of Gross|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajp2CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA47|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-312-79288-3|page=47}}</ref> He uses the shrinking machine on anyone who tries to leave him. All the \"dolls\" in his glass case are friends put in [[suspended animation]]. He revives Bob and four others as company for Sally.\n\nDuring a welcoming party for the two newcomers, Franz is visited by his friend Emil, who wants Franz to repair his [[marionette]]s for an upcoming production. Franz mentions to Emil that he has been afraid of being abandoned ever since his wife left him, unconsciously explaining his \u201cdoll\u201d abductions. The small prisoners have access to a phone, but their voices are too small to be heard over the phone lines, and loud music on a record player is drowning out their voices. Sergeant Paterson continues investigating Franz, with Sally and Bob now confirmed as missing. After Franz is questioned again by Paterson, he decides to kill his prisoners and himself before he is caught. He takes his \"collection\" to an old theater, supposedly to test his repairs made on Emil's marionette. There, he throws one final party, forcing his captives to act-out ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1887 play)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.\n\nThe prisoners drug Franz\u2019s coffee with one of the capsules used to keep them in suspended animation and escape while Franz is occupied with a theater worker. Separated from the others, Bob and Sally head to Franz's workshop, planning to go back for the others after using Franz\u2019s device to restore themselves. Franz returns to his workshop, but not before they have returned to normal size. They go to the police, leaving a despondent Franz behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Agar]] as Bob Westley\n* [[John Hoyt]] as Mr. Franz\n* [[June Kenney]] as Sally Reynolds\n* [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]] as Emil \n* Jack Kosslyn as Sergeant Paterson\n* [[Marlene Willis]] as Laurie/Theme song vocalist\n* Ken Miller as Stan\n* [[Laurie Mitchell]] as Georgia Lane\n* Scott Peters as Mac\n* [[Susan Gordon]] as Agnes\n* June Jocelyn as Brownie Leader\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot under the title ''The Fantastic Puppet People''.<ref name=\"gary\">Gary A.

Gordon]]'s daughter, [[Susan Gordon]], was a last-minute substitute for another child actress who was ill and unable to perform.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\n\nBecause of the size-changing aspects of the plot, the film made extensive use of special effects and over-sized props.<ref name=Willis1985>{{cite book|author=Donald C.
