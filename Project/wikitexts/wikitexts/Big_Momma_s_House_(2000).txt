The film stars [[Martin Lawrence]] as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who is tasked with tracking down an escaped convict and his loot, by going [[Disguise|undercover]] as the estranged grandmother of his former girlfriend, unaware of the bond he will form with her. The film also stars [[Nia Long]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Terrence Howard]].\n\n''Big Momma's House'' received negative reviews from critics, but grossed over $117 million, leading to it receiving two sequels - ''[[Big Momma's House 2]]'' in 2006, and ''[[Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nUndercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, Malcolm Turner and John Maxwell, find themselves assigned by their bosses into tracking down escaped convict Lester Vesco, who was serving a life sentence for murder and the armed robbery of a bank. Malcolm and John learn that Lester may be seeking to find his ex-girlfriend, Sherry Pierce, an employee of the bank who is suspected of supplying him with a key to the vault, as the money that was stolen was never recovered. Malcolm and John find themselves staking out the home of Sherry's estranged grandmother, Hattie Mae Pierce {{snd}} an overweight, elderly [[African American]] woman, whom her friends affectionately call Big Momma {{snd}} in [[Cartersville, Georgia]], and soon find that she is about to leave for two weeks to visit her ill friend. Malcolm takes advantage of this by posing as her in order to bring Sherry to her house to get her to confess to her involvement in the bank robbery.\n\nTo maintain his disguise as Big Momma, Malcolm is forced to maintain the real Big Momma's lifestyle. This includes him dealing with her lecherous boyfriend, assuming her occupation as a midwife, and attending self-defense classes led by dim-witted security guard Nolan, whom the agents are later forced to recruit when he stumbles onto their operation. During this time, Malcolm bonds with Sherry and her ten-year-old son Trent, both in disguise and as himself {{snd}} posing as Big Momma's handyman {{snd}} but finds nothing to link her to the robbery, nor to the missing money's location. After attending a church service with them, where he compels in his disguise for Sherry to not hold any secrets, Malcolm finds the missing money in Trent's footlocker after returning home to a surprise birthday party for the real Big Momma. His discovery is witnessed by Sherry, who confess to him that she had no idea what Lester was planning, and didn't report her key was stolen out of fear of being fired.\n\nMatters soon become complicated when John discovers that the real Big Momma has returned home prematurely. In his efforts to stop her re-entering the house, he instructs Nolan to lock her out, only for the dim-witted guard to lock out Malcolm by mistake. Lester eventually arrives on the scene, having tracked down Sherry, and soon puts her in danger. Malcolm swiftly breaks into the house, whereupon he tackles Lester and subdues him after John is shot, but at the cost of his disguise being dropped in front of Sherry and Trent. Although Lester is arrested and the money recovered, Malcolm finds that Sherry and Trent refuse to speak to him, being heartbroken by his deception. Seeking forgiveness, Malcolm attends a Sunday morning church service and confesses in a heartfelt speech to Sherry and Trent that he genuinely loves them. Big Momma forgives Malcolm for his actions, and the church crowd cheers as Malcolm and Sherry kiss, before Big Momma and the choir sing \"[[Oh Happy Day]]\" during the film's closing credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Malcolm Turner, an undercover [[FBI]] agent posing as Hattie Mae 'Big Momma' Pierce. \n* [[Nia Long]] as Sherry Pierce, Hattie Mae Pierce's granddaughter, Lester's ex-girlfriend, Trent's mother as well as Malcolm's suspect-turned-love interest.\n* [[Jascha Washington]] as Trent Pierce, Sherry's 10-year-old son.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Agent Jonathan \"John\" Maxwell, Malcolm's rookie undercover partner who is highly intelligent. \n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Lester Vesco, Sherry's criminal ex-boyfriend.\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Nolan, a dim-witted security guard.\n* [[Ella Mitchell]] as Hattie Mae \u2018Big Momma\u2019 Pierce, Sherry's long lost Southern grandmother.\n* Phyllis Applegate as Sadie, Big Momma's nosy and jealous neighbor.\n* Starletta DuPois as Miss Patterson, a neighbor and friend of Big Momma.\n* Jessie Mae Holmes as Miss Other Patterson, another friend and neighbor with the same surname as Miss Patterson. \n* [[Tichina Arnold]] as Ritha, a pregnant woman and Nolan's younger sister.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Twila, Big Momma's neighbor and friend of Ritha and Sherry.\n* Nicole Prescott as Lena, Big Momma's neighbor and friend of Ritha and Sherry\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as the Reverend.\n* [[Carl Wright (actor)|Carl Wright]] as Ben Rawley, Big Momma's lecherous boyfriend.\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as teen playing basketball.\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was set in Georgia but filmed in Southern California.<ref name=\"variety\" />\n\nThe prosthetic makeup was created by [[Greg Cannom]] and Captive Audience.
