It is based on the novel ''[[Le Colonel Chabert (novel)|Le Colonel Chabert]]'' by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]. [[Colonel Chabert (1943 film)|Another film adaptation]] of the novel starring [[Raimu]] had been released 50 years earlier, during the German occupation of France.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn [[Paris]], in February 1817, three years after the fall of the Empire, the lawyer Derville receives a visit from a shabbily dressed man. He claims to be Colonel Chabert, believed dead at the [[Battle of Eylau]] in 1807. He had contributed to the victory by leading a famous cavalry charge against the Russians.\n\nThe man tells how, waking in a mass grave surrounded by corpses, he survived his wounds.\n\nHe has returned ten years later and wishes to claim his title, to assert his rights and to live again with his wife, who has greatly increased the fortune she inherited from him. She, during his absence, has married Count Ferraud and had children.\n\nShe refuses to recognise her first husband. Derville agrees to help the colonel by proposing a settlement in which she will make a large settlement on Chabert if he agrees to divorce her and give up his claims. She refuses the proposed terms and tries to manipulate her ex-husband, asking him to declare his claim is fraudulent. Chabert, disgusted by her deceitfulness and the idea of him renouncing his name, abandons his claim.\n\nColonel Chabert finishes his life penniless and in an asylum, reminiscing on his last battle.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] : Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Chabert\n* [[Fabrice Luchini]] : Ma\u00eetre Derville\n* [[Fanny Ardant]] : Countess Ferraud\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] : Count Ferraud\n* [[Daniel Pr\u00e9vost]] : Boucard\n* [[Olivier Saladin]] : Hur\u00e9\n* [[Maxime Leroux]] : Godeschal\n* [[\u00c9ric Elmosnino]] : Ma\u00eetre Desroches\n* [[Guillaume Romain]] : Simonin\n* [[Patrick Bordier]] : Boutin\n* [[Claude Rich]] : Chamblin\n* [[Jean Cosmos]] : Costaz\n* [[Jacky Nercessian]] : Delbecq\n* [[Albert Delpy]] : Ma\u00eetre Roguin\n* [[Romane Bohringer]] : Sophie\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Bettencourt]] : Julie\n* [[Julie Depardieu]] : A maid\n\n== Production ==\n* Direction : [[Yves Angelo]], assisted by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Blum]]\n* Script : Yves Angelo, [[Jean Cosmos]] and [[V\u00e9ronique Lagrange]], from the novel by [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]\n* Production : [[Jean-Louis Livi]] and [[Bernard Marescot]]\n* Music : [[R\u00e9gis Pasquier]]\n* Photography : [[Bernard Lutic]]\n* Editing : [[Thierry Derocles]]\n* Scenery : [[Bernard V\u00e9zat]] (certain interior scenes filmed at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bizy]] in [[Vernon, Eure]])\n* Costumes : [[Franca Squarciapino]]\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n*'''[[Cairo International Film Festival|Cairo Film Festival]]''' (Egypt)\n**'''Won''': [[Golden Pyramid]] (Yves Angelo)\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**Nominated: Best Actor &ndash; Leading Role (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) \n**Nominated: Best Actor &ndash; Supporting Role (Fabrice Luchini)\n**Nominated: Best Cinematography (Bernard Lutic) \n**Nominated: Best Costume Design (Franca Squarciapino) \n**Nominated: Best First Work (Yves Angelo) \n**Nominated: Best Production Design (Bernard V\u00e9zat)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0109454}}\n\n{{Yves Angelo}}\n{{Colonel Chabert}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Colonel Chabert 1994}}\n[[Category:French war films]]\n[[Category:French historical films]]\n[[Category:1990s war films]]\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1810s]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yves Angelo]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-France-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
