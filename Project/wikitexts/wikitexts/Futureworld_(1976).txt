Heffron]] and written by [[Mayo Simon]] and [[George Schenck]]. It is a [[sequel]] to the 1973 [[Michael Crichton]] film ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'', and is the second installment in the [[Westworld|''Westworld'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Peter Fonda]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]], [[Stuart Margolin]], [[John P. Ryan|John Ryan]], and [[Yul Brynner]], who makes an appearance in a [[dream sequence]]; no other cast member from the original film appears. ''Westworld's'' writer-director, Michael Crichton, and the original studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] were not involved in this production.\n\nThe film attempted to take the plot in a different direction from ''Westworld'', but it was not well received by critics. It was made by [[American International Pictures]] (its predecessor was made by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which later bought AIP's successor [[Orion Pictures]]). A short-lived television series titled ''[[Beyond Westworld]]'' followed.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, two years after the Westworld tragedy, the Delos Corporation owners have reopened the park after spending $1.5 billion in safety improvements, and also shutting down Westworld. For publicity purposes, [[Journalist|newspaper reporter]] Chuck Browning and [[Broadcast journalism|TV reporter]] Tracy Ballard are invited to review the park.\n\nJust before the [[Film promotion|junket]] is announced, Browning arranges to meet with a Delos employee who promises he has dirt on the corporation. During the meeting, the tipster is shot in the back and dies after giving Browning an envelope.\n\nAt the resort, guests choose from four theme parks: Spaworld (\"where old age and pain have been eliminated\"), Medievalworld, Romanworld and Futureworld. Browning and Ballard choose Futureworld, which simulates an orbiting space station. [[Sex robot|Robots are available for sex]] as well as amusements like boxing. They are guided through the resort by Dr. Duffy, who shows them the marvels of Delos, demonstrating that all the problems have been fixed.\n\nThe reporters are stunned to find that the Control Center is staffed entirely by robots. That night, their dinners are drugged, and while they sleep, medical tests are conducted so Delos can make [[Human cloning|clones]] of them. A visiting [[Soviet Army|Russian general]] and a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[politician]] are also tested for cloning. Back in her room a few hours later, Ballard wakes in a fright, remembering the experience as a nightmare.\n\nBallard and Browning sneak out to explore the resort's underground areas. They end up triggering a cloning machine, which generates three [[samurai]]. Just as they are about to be captured by the samurai, a mechanic named Harry saves them. He takes them back to his quarters, where he [[Cohabitation|cohabits]] with a mechanic robot he has named Clark after [[Superman]]'s [[Clark Kent|alter-ego]]. The reporters interview Harry, but they are interrupted and returned to their rooms.\n\nThe following day, while Ballard is testing out a Delos dream-recording device (which includes a dream sequence of being saved by, dancing with and making love to Yul Brynner's Gunslinger), Browning slips out to see Harry. Harry takes him to a locked door that he has never been able to enter, although robots routinely enter. Realizing the key is in the robot's eyes, Harry destroys a robot and steals its face. They return with Ballard and open the door. Inside, they find clones of themselves, as well as clones of the Russian and Japanese leaders. The clones are instructed always to work for the good of Delos and to destroy their originals. Browning explains that his tipster's envelope was filled with clippings about leaders from around the world, realizing that Delos must be cloning the rich and powerful.\n\nThe trio decides to flee the resort on the next plane. The reporters return to their apartment where Duffy is waiting for them; he explains that, by cloning world leaders, they can ensure that nothing harms Delos' interests, and that without \"proper\" guidance, humans will eventually destroy the planet.\n\nCloning the reporters would ensure favorable coverage, letting people forget about the Westworld tragedy. Browning attacks Duffy but is easily overpowered with unnatural strength. Ballard shoots the doctor twice, and Browning peels back Duffy's face to reveal that he is a robot. As Harry races to meet up with the reporters, he runs into Browning's clone, who kills him. Ballard and Browning are then chased by their own duplicates, all the while taunting them with details about their lives. Eventually, one of each pair is killed, though which one is left unclear. When they find each other, Browning seizes and kisses Ballard.\n\nIn the end, as they leave the resort with the other guests, Dr. Schneider meets them to make sure they are the clones. The reporters confirm that they will be writing positive reviews for Delos, but, just as they reach the exit, Ballard's badly injured clone stumbles towards him and Schneider realizes too late that he has been fooled. On the jetway, Browning tells Ballard that his editor is running the expos\u00e9 on Delos, that the whole world will know what they are up to, and that kissing her was his idea to figure out whether or not she was a duplicate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Chuck Browning\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Tracy Ballard\n* [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]] as Dr. Duffy\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as the Gunslinger\n* [[John P.

[[Michael Crichton]] did not wish to be involved in a sequel, so they approached the original producer [[Paul Lazarus III]]. He developed an idea set in a successor world to Westworld where robots are cloning world leaders. He found a writer and developed a script; MGM decided to only make one science fiction film that year, ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''. ''Futureworld'' was put into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. Lazarus had trouble finding production and distribution for the film elsewhere, because other studios were confused and wary after MGM passed on it, especially since the original film had been a financial success for MGM.<ref name=\"pod\">{{cite podcast |url= http://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/paul-lazarus-legends-of-film/|title=Legends of Film: Paul Lazarus |date= 27 December 2004}}</ref> Lazarus was approached by former MGM president [[James T.

The film includes a chase scene through the underground pedestrian [[Houston tunnel system]] running under the city.\n\n==Release==\nLazarus admits the film \"wasn't a very good picture\" but put its poor commercial performance down to the fact that AIP was focusing on its prestige film ''[[A Matter of Time (film)|A Matter of Time]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"pod\"/>\n\nIn 1979, ''Futureworld'' became the first modern American film to achieve general theatrical release in China.<ref>{{cite news| title= American International Epic: Chinese Book U.S. Film 'Futureworld'| last= Bry| first= Barbara| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]| place= Los Angeles| date= January 5, 1979| page= D16}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Richard Eder]] panned the film in ''[[The New York Times]]'', quoting Ballard's line from the movie, \"This is about as exciting as a visit to the water works.\" Coining his own variation on the phrase, Eder also claimed the film is \"as much fun as running barefoot on [[AstroTurf|Astroturf]].\" He added, \"It is all the most ordinary kind of hardware science fiction, full of computers and empty of thought.\" Writing that Danner and Fonda have \"absolutely nothing to do\" in the film, he concluded that \"starring in ''Futureworld'' must be the actor's equivalent of going on welfare.\"<ref>{{cite news| last= Eder| first= Richard| date= August 14, 1976| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE4D9123CE334BC4C52DFBE66838D669EDE |title= 'Futureworld': Science-Fiction Robots in Dominant Roles| work= [[The New York Times]]| access-date= August 19, 2019 | url-access = limited}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two stars out of four and criticized the \"dumb story,\" although he did think it had \"some of the best gadgets since the early [[James Bond pictures]] ...
