It portrays the founding of [[Social network service|social networking]] website [[Facebook]] and the resulting lawsuits. It stars [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]], along with [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Justin Timberlake]] as [[Sean Parker]], [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Max Minghella]] as [[Divya Narendra]].

[[Principal photography]] began that same year in October in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and lasted until November. Additional scenes were shot in California, in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], as a portion of the film was set in [[Silicon Valley]]. In 2010, it was announced that [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] would create the film's [[The Social Network (soundtrack)|score]], which released on September 28, 2010.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on September 24, 2010, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 1, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. A major critical and commercial success, the film grossed $224 million on a $40 million budget and was widely acclaimed by critics. It was named one of the best films of the year by 78 critics, and named the best by 22 critics, the most of any film that year. It was also chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|best film of 2010]]. At the [[83rd Academy Awards]], it received eight nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eisenberg, and won for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

The word count for a plot is usually 400-700 words. -->\nOn October 28, 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] sophomore [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about Albright on his [[Live Journal|LiveJournal]] blog. He creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[disciplinary probation|academic probation]]. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Zuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for ''The Facebook''<!--the original name and spelling-->, a [[Social networking service|social networking]] website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of The Facebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on The Facebook or Zuckerberg.\n\nSaverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me,\" a phrase that impresses them. As The Facebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Stanford University]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company. Zuckerberg is impressed, but Saverin dismisses him as paranoid and delusional. Parker also suggests renaming the site to ''Facebook.'' Later, Zuckerberg relocates the company to [[Palo Alto]] on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on business development. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin's annoyance.\n\nWhile competing in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property theft]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]]. Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03% while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being ejected from the building. Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO. Later, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession at a party celebrating 1 million users. He attempts to blame Saverin, so Zuckerberg cuts ties with him, telling him to \"go home.\"\n\nIn separate [[Deposition (law)|depositions]], the Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page.\n\nA series of [[title card]]s reveal that the Winklevoss twins received a settlement of 65 million dollars, signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]], and rowed for the [[United States at the Olympics|U.S. Olympic team]] in [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], placing sixth. Saverin received an unknown settlement, and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead. Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries, is currently valued at $25 billion, and Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as [[Mark Zuckerberg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-trouble-timeline-443898|title=How Facebook grew into trouble|date=December 9, 2020|first=Leah|last=Nylen|website=[[Politico]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212040556/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-trouble-timeline-443898|archive-date=December 12, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=December 14, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Andrew Garfield]] as [[Eduardo Saverin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anharkarim/2020/11/16/the-social-networks-denise-grayson-on-being-a-lawyer-then-playing-one/|title='The Social Network's' Denise Grayson On Being A Lawyer, Then Playing One|date=November 16, 2020|first=Anhar|last=Karim|website=[[Forbes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117062918/https://www.forbes.com/sites/anharkarim/2020/11/16/the-social-networks-denise-grayson-on-being-a-lawyer-then-playing-one/|archive-date=November 17, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=December 14, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as [[Sean Parker]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1194057/justin-timberlake-shares-a-blast-from-the-past-in-the-social-network-tribute|title=Justin Timberlake Shares A Blast From The Past In The Social Network Tribute|date=October 1, 2020|first=Mona|last=Thomas|website=E!

I'd go to [[Boston]], or we'd meet in [[New York City|New York]] and kind of compare notes and share information, but I didn't see the book until he was done with it.
