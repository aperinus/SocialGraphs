Fox]] and [[Helen Slater]]. The screenplay was written by [[AJ Carothers|A.J. Carothers]], [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]] from a story written by Carothers. It was filmed on location in [[Manhattan]].<ref>http://onthesetofnewyork.com/thesecretofmysuccess.html</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBrantley Foster is a recent graduate of [[Kansas State University]] who moves to [[New York City]], where he has accepted an [[entry-level job]] as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is made [[Layoff|redundant]] before even starting work.\n\nAfter several interviews for another job, he is unsuccessful due to over- or underqualification, or having no experience. Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, directed by his \"uncle\" Howard Prescott, a distant relative he's never met. Pemrose was founded by Howard's father-in-law. Howard achieved the presidency by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose.\n\nAfter inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Howard and most of his fellow \"suits\" (executives) are making pointless or damaging decisions. He notices an empty office in the building due to one of Howard's frequent firings. Using his access to the mailroom and his understanding of the company, he creates and assumes the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive.\n\nWhile handling two jobs (switching between casual apparel and business suits in the elevator), Brantley sparks romantic interest from Christy Wills, a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He meets Vera by driving her home in a company limo at his employer's request. She persuades him to stay for a swim and seduces him. \n\nSeeing Howard arrive, Brantley and Vera realize they are related by marriage. She had seduced him out of revenge against her husband for having an affair with a woman at the office. Brantley changes as fast as he can and narrowly escapes the mansion without being spotted by Howard.\n\nHoward, unbeknownst to Brantley, is having an affair with Christy. When Howard asks her to spy on Carlton Whitfield he suspects as a corporate spy for Donald Davenport, she falls in love with \"Whitfield\", not knowing he is actually Brantley. The Pemrose Corporation is preparing for its impending [[takeover]] by the Davenport Corporation. If Davenport Corporation absorbs Pemrose, all workers get fired. Howard, unaware that Whitfield and Brantley are the same person, suspects \"Whitfield\" is a spy for [[corporate raid]]er Davenport. \n\nBrantley's double identity is discovered when he, Christy, Vera and Howard end up in the same bedroom after a party at Howard's home that all four are attending. Brantley and Christy end their blossoming relationship. He gets sacked from his job as Whitfield, as does Christy for refusing to continue her affair with Howard. Vera is divorcing Howard, since she found out about his affair with Christy and his plan to propose to her.\n\nWhile both Christy and Brantley are moving out of their offices, they end up in the same elevator and reconcile, conceiving a revenge plan together with Vera. They raise enough cash, bonds, and stocks to take control of the Pemrose Corporation, and to proceed with a hostile takeover bid of Davenport's corporation. \n\nVera, already hating Howard for his inept business practices which were driving her father's empire into the ground, tells the board about his affair with Christy. Vera promptly replaces him with Brantley, with Jean (Carlton's secretary), Christy and Melrose (Brantley's mailroom colleague) at his side. While security guards escort Howard and his aide, Art Thomas, from the Pemrose Building, Brantley and Christy start planning their future together, personal as well as professional.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Michael J.
