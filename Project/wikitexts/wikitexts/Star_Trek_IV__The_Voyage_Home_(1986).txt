It is the fourth feature installment in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, and is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' (1984); it completes the story arc begun in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' (1982) and continued in ''The Search for Spock''. Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their actions in the previous film, the former crew of the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|6}} finds the planet in grave danger from an alien probe attempting to contact now-extinct [[humpback whale]]s. The crew travel to Earth's past to find whales who can answer the probe's call.\n\nAfter directing ''The Search for Spock'', Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer [[Harve Bennett]] conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired ''The Wrath of Khan'' writer and director [[Nicholas Meyer]]. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote different parts of the script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor [[William Shatner]], and executives at [[Paramount Pictures]]. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous ''Star Trek'' films, ''The Voyage Home'' was shot extensively [[location shooting|on location]]; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm [[Industrial Light & Magic]] assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures. The film was dedicated to the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']], which [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|broke up 73 seconds after takeoff]] on the morning of January 28, 1986.\n\n''The Voyage Home'' was released on November 26, 1986, in North America by Paramount Pictures, and became the top-grossing film at the weekend box office. The film's humor, acting, direction, special effects and unconventional story were well received by critics, fans of the series, and the general audience. It was financially successful, earning $133 million worldwide, and earned several awards and four [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for cinematography and sound.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2286, an enormous cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of every ship it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. [[Starfleet]] Command sends out a planetary [[distress call]] and warns all space-faring vessels not to approach Earth.\n\nOn the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], the former officers of the late {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|6}} are living in exile after the events of ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''. Accompanied by the Vulcan [[Spock]], still recovering from his resurrection, the crew take their captured Klingon Bird of Prey (renamed the ''Bounty'', after [[HMS Bounty|the Royal Navy ship]]) and return to Earth to face trial for their actions. Receiving Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the [[whale sound|song]] of extinct [[humpback whale]]s, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to [[time travel in fiction|travel back in time]] via a [[Gravity assist|slingshot maneuver around the Sun]], planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal.\n\nArriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained by the time travel maneuver. Hiding the ''Bounty'' in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] using its [[cloaking device]], the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while [[Montgomery Scott]], [[Leonard McCoy]], and [[Hikaru Sulu]] construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century. [[Uhura]] and [[Pavel Chekov]] are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage can be collected and used to re-power the Klingon vessel.\n\nKirk and Spock discover a pair of humpback whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a [[Sausalito]] aquarium, and learn they will soon be released into the wild. Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Scott and McCoy trade the formula of [[list of Star Trek materials#Transparent aluminium|transparent aluminium]] for the materials needed for the whale tank, while Sulu secures the use of a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|\"Huey\" helicopter]] to transport them. Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear powered ship, the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}}. They collect the power they need, but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed out, but Chekov is captured and subsequently severely injured in an escape attempt.\n\nGillian learns the whales have been released early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Gillian, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov from a nearby hospital and return to the now recharged Bird of Prey. After saving the whales from whalers and transporting them aboard, the crew returns with Gillian to their own time. On approaching Earth, the ''Bounty'' loses power due to the alien probe and crash-lands into the waters of [[San Francisco Bay]]. Once released from near-drowning, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space.\n\nLater, the ''Enterprise'' crew stand judgment before the Federation Council. The Council acknowledges their part in saving the planet and drops all charges, save one against Kirk for disobeying a superior officer. Kirk is demoted to the rank of Captain and returned to the command of a starship. Kirk and Gillian part ways, as she has been assigned to a science vessel by Starfleet, while Spock's father Sarek finally accepts his son's earlier choice to enter Starfleet. The crew discovers they have been awarded the newly christened {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-A}}, and leaves on a [[shakedown cruise|shakedown]] mission.\n\n==Cast==\n[[William Shatner]] portrays Admiral [[James T. Kirk]], former captain of the ''Enterprise''. Shatner was unwilling to reprise the role of Kirk until he received a salary of $2&nbsp;million and the promise of directing the next film.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/> Shatner described ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s comic quality as one \"that verges on tongue-in-cheek but isn't; it's as though the characters within the play have a great deal of joy about themselves, a joy of living [and] you play it with the reality you would in a kitchen-sink drama written for today's life\".<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/>{{rp|83}}\n\n[[Leonard Nimoy]] plays [[Spock]], who was resurrected by the effects of the Genesis planet and had his \"living spirit\" restored to his body in the previous film. [[DeForest Kelley]] portrays Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]], who is given many of the film's comedic lines; Kelley's biographer Terry Lee Rioux wrote that in the film \"he seemed to be playing straight man to himself.\" On Earth McCoy was paired with engineer [[Montgomery Scott]] ([[James Doohan]]), as producer Harve Bennett felt that Kelley worked well with Doohan's \"old vaudeville comic\".<ref name=\"rioux_2005\">{{cite book|author=Rioux, Terry Lee|year=2005|title=From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|isbn=0-7434-5762-5}}</ref>{{rp|265}} The other members of the ''Enterprise'' crew include [[George Takei]] as helmsman [[Hikaru Sulu]], [[Walter Koenig]] as Commander [[Pavel Chekov]], and [[Nichelle Nichols]] as [[Uhura]]. Koenig commented that Chekov was a \"delight\" to play in this film because he worked best in comedic situations.<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/>\n\n[[Catherine Hicks]] plays Dr. Gillian Taylor, a [[cetologist]] on 20th-century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part had been created after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer [[Nicholas Meyer]] denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a biologist featured in a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' documentary about whales.<ref name=\"Fischer_1987\"/>{{rp|37}} Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> The role was originally written for [[Eddie Murphy]] as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.<ref>{{cite news|last=Couch|first=Aaron|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-iv-voyage-home-writer-eddie-murphys-lost-role-950551|title='Star Trek IV' Writer on Eddie Murphy's Lost Role and Film's Rewrite Drama|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 26, 2016|access-date=December 23, 2019|archive-date=December 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223065056/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-iv-voyage-home-writer-eddie-murphys-lost-role-950551|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Majel Barrett]] reprises her role as [[Christine Chapel]], the director of Starfleet Command's medical services. Many of her scenes\u2014some reportedly very large\u2014were omitted in the final cut, angering the actress. Her final role in the film consists of one line of dialogue and a reaction shot.<ref name=\"Gire_1987\"/>{{rp|4}} [[Mark Lenard]] and [[Jane Wyatt]] play Spock's parents, Ambassador [[Sarek]] and [[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#G|Amanda Grayson]], respectively, with both reprising the roles they had previously played in the 1967 episode \"[[Journey to Babel]]\".<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Wyatt commented that although she generally disliked working with actors who were directing, she found Nimoy an exception because he could concentrate on being part of the cast as well as setting up the crew.<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/> [[Robin Curtis]] reprises the role of [[Saavik]], a Starfleet lieutenant. Saavik's role is minimal in the film\u2014originally, she was intended to remain behind on Vulcan because she was pregnant after she had mated with the younger Spock in ''Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''. In the final cut of the film, all references to her condition were dropped.<ref name=\"Gire_1987\"/>{{rp|4}}\n\nThe film contains several cameos and smaller roles. [[Alex Henteloff]] plays Dr. Nichols, plant manager of Plexicorp. [[Madge Sinclair]] makes an uncredited appearance as captain of the USS ''Saratoga'' (the first female Federation starship captain to appear in ''Star Trek''). Musician [[Jane Wiedlin]] and tennis player [[Vijay Amritraj]] appear as Starfleet officers seen briefly on video screens at Starfleet Command.<ref name=\"okuda\"/><ref>{{cite web|date=May 30, 2013|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/looking-for-a-role-where-makers-dont-kill-me-vijay-amritraj/#sthash.XMu4WBGT.dpuf|title=Looking for a role where makers don't kill me: Vijay Amritraj|work=[[Indian Express]]|publisher=Press Trust of India|access-date=February 15, 2016|archive-date=May 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513174621/https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-others/looking-for-a-role-where-makers-dont-kill-me-vijay-amritraj/#sthash.XMu4WBGT.dpuf|url-status=live}}</ref> [[John Schuck]] appears as a Klingon ambassador, [[Robert Ellenstein]] as the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation President]], [[Michael Berryman]] as an alien display officer at Starfleet Command, and [[Brock Peters]] as [[List of Star Trek characters (A\u2013F)#C|Fleet Admiral Cartwright]].<ref name=\"okuda\"/> [[Grace Lee Whitney]] reprises her role as [[Janice Rand]] from the original television series.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|date=September 7, 1986|title=20 Year Trek; Why 'Star Trek' Boldly Went Where No Series has Gone Since|work=[[Miami Herald]]|page=1K}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nBefore ''The Search for Spock'' was released, its director Leonard Nimoy was asked to return to direct the next film in the franchise. Whereas Nimoy had been under certain constraints in filming the previous picture, Paramount gave the director greater freedom for the sequel. \"[Paramount] said flat out that they wanted my vision,\" Nimoy recalled.<ref name=\"Lee_1986\"/>{{rp|43}} In contrast to the drama-heavy and operatic events of the three previous ''Star Trek'' features, Nimoy and producer [[Harve Bennett]] wanted a lighter movie that did not have a clear-cut villain.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> As William Shatner was unwilling to return, Nimoy and Bennett spent eight months considering a [[prequel]] concept by [[Ralph Winter (producer)|Ralph Winter]] about the characters at [[Starfleet Academy]], before Shatner received a pay increase and signed on to star.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/> Nimoy and Shatner each received $2.5 million for the film, less than their original demands, but the film cast's rising salaries caused Paramount to create a new television series, ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987), with less-expensive, lesser-known actors.<ref name=\"harmetz19861102\">{{cite news | title=New 'Star Trek' Plan Reflects Symbiosis of TV and Movies | work=The New York Times | date=November 2, 1986 | author=Harmetz, Aljean | pages=31 |id = {{ProQuest|426349379}}}}</ref>\n\nDespite Shatner's doubts,<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> Nimoy and Bennett selected a [[time travel]] story in which the ''Enterprise'' crew encounters a problem that could only be fixed by something only available in the present day (the ''Star Trek'' characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the [[rainforest]]s. \"But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, and the thought of our crew taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a [[snail darter]] wasn't all that thrilling,\" explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/> Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend\u2014their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.<ref name=\"special features-pastandpresent\"/>\n\nNimoy approached ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' writer [[Daniel Petrie Jr.]] to write the screenplay when a concept that executive producer [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] described as \"either the best or worst idea in the world\" arose\u2014''Star Trek'' fan [[Eddie Murphy]] wanted a starring role. Nimoy and Murphy acknowledged his part would attract non-''Star Trek'' fans to the franchise following the rising popularity of Murphy, but it also meant the film might be ridiculed. Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes were hired to write a script with Murphy as a college professor who believes in aliens and likes to play [[Whale vocalization|whale songs]].<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/> Murphy disliked the part,<ref>{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Pascale|title=Exclusive Interview: Leonard Nimoy \u2013 Part 2|publisher=TrekMovie|date=July 27, 2008|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/07/27/exclusive-interview-leonard-nimoy-part-2/|access-date=January 5, 2009|archive-date=April 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430091106/http://trekmovie.com/2008/07/27/exclusive-interview-leonard-nimoy-part-2/|url-status=live}}</ref> and chose to make ''[[The Golden Child]]''. The character intended for Murphy was combined with those of a marine biologist and a female reporter to become Gillian Taylor.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/>\n\nParamount was dissatisfied with the script, so its head of production [[Dawn Steel]] asked [[Nicholas Meyer]], the writer and director of ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', to help rewrite it. Meyer never read the earlier script, reasoning it pointless to do so since the content had no appeal to the studio. He and Bennett split the task of conceiving the plot between them. Bennett wrote the first quarter of the story, up to the point where the crew goes back in time. Meyer wrote the story's middle portion, taking place on 20th-century Earth, and Bennett handled the ending.<ref name=\"Fischer_1987\"/>{{rp|36}} After 12&nbsp;days of writing, Meyer and Bennett combined their separate portions.<ref name=\"special features-pastandpresent\"/> In this version, Gillian Taylor stays on 1986's Earth and vows to ensure the survival of the humpback whale despite the paradox it could create. Meyer preferred this \"righter ending\"<ref name=\"Fischer_1987\"/>{{rp|37}} to the film version, explaining \"the end in the movie detracts from the importance of people in the present taking the responsibility for the ecology and preventing problems of the future by doing something today, rather than catering to the fantasy desires of being able to be transported in time to the near-utopian future.\" Meyer and Bennett cut out Krikes and Meerson's idea of having the Klingon Bird-of-Prey fly over the [[Super Bowl]] and the hint that Saavik remained on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child.<ref name=\"Hughes_2008\"/>\n\nNimoy said Meyer gave the script \"the kind of humor and social comment, gadfly attitude I very much wanted\".<ref name=\"Dillard_1994\"/> He added that his vision was for \"no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really have a great time watching this film [and] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, then that would be even better.\"<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/>{{rp|233}} One of Meyer's earlier films, ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)|Time After Time]]'', was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that ''The Voyage Home'' had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as [[punk rock]]\u2014''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from ''Time After Time''.<ref name=\"Fischer_1987\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\nMeyer found writing the script a smooth process. He would write a few pages, show it to Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the script to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites.<ref name=\"Fischer_1987\"/>{{rp|38}} The completed script was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.<ref name=\"special features-pastandpresent\"/>\n\n===Design===\n[[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) was responsible for ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s model design and optical effects.<ref name=\"Lee_1986\"/>{{rp|46}} The alien probe was the responsibility of ILM's model shop, which brought in outside help like illustrator [[Ralph McQuarrie]] for concept art. The modelmakers started with art director [[Nilo Rodis]]' basic design, a simple cylinder with whalelike qualities. The prototype was covered with barnacles and colored. The ball-shaped antenna that juts out from the bottom of the probe was created out of a piece of irrigation pipe; internal machinery turned the device. Three sizes of the \"whale probe\" were created; the primary {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} probe model was supplemented by a smaller model for wide shots and a large {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} model that used [[forced perspective]] to give the probe the illusion of massive dimensions.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|4}}\n\nThe effects crew focused on using in-camera tricks to realize the probe; post-production effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}}\n\nAside from the probe, ''The Voyage Home'' required no new starship designs. The USS ''Saratoga'', the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS ''Reliant'' model from ''The Wrath of Khan''. The Bird-of-Prey model from ''The Search for Spock'' was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s action sequences. The inside of the Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than ''The Search for Spock'', but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, rather than relying on ambient or rigged lighting.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}} While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large [[Earth Spacedock|Spacedock]] model created for ''The Search for Spock'', the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When ''The Voyage Home'' called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\n[[Robert Fletcher (costume designer)|Robert Fletcher]] served as costume designer for the film. During the Earth-based scenes, Kirk and his crew continue to wear their 23rd-century clothing. Nimoy debated whether the crew should change costumes, but after seeing how people in San Francisco are dressed, he decided they would still fit in.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nNimoy chose [[Donald Peterman]], [[American Society of Cinematographers|ASC]], as [[director of photography]].<ref name=\"Lee_1986\"/>{{rp|45}} Nimoy said he regarded the cinematographer as a fellow artist, and that it was important for them to agree on \"a certain look\" that Peterman was committed to delivering. Nimoy had seen Peterman's work and felt it was more nuanced than simply lighting a scene and capturing an image.<ref name=\"Lee_1986\"/>{{rp|46}}\n\nThe film's opening scenes aboard the starship ''Saratoga'' were the first to be shot; principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The set was a redress of the science vessel ''Grissom''{{'}}s bridge from ''The Search for Spock'', in turn a redress of the ''Enterprise'' bridge created for ''The Motion Picture''. The scenes were filmed first to allow time for the set to be revamped as the bridge of the new ''Enterprise''-A at the end of filming.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nAs with previous ''Star Trek'' films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though ''The Voyage Home'' required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from ''The Search for Spock'', although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics\u2014the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock footage of the destruction of the ''Enterprise'' and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in ''The Wrath of Khan''. After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a [[dream sequence]] during the time travel.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\n''The Voyage Home'' was the first ''Star Trek'' film to extensively film on location\u2014only one day was spent doing so in ''The Search for Spock''.<ref name=\"special features-pastandpresent\">Special features: \"Future's Past: A Look Back\".</ref> Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\">Special features: \"On Location\".</ref> The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; a scene in which Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12\u201315&nbsp;cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in [[Golden Gate Park]], surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for ''The Wrath of Khan'', but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it\u2014the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. [[Will Rogers State Historic Park|Will Rogers Park]] in western Los Angeles was used instead.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/>\n\n{{Anchor|punk on the bus}}\nWhen Kirk and Spock are traveling on a public bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters into his own hands and performs a [[Vulcan nerve pinch]]. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; \"[I was struck] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!\"<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> On learning about the scene, [[Kirk Thatcher]], an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as \"punk on bus\", Thatcher (along with sound designer [[Mark Mangini]]) also wrote and recorded \"I Hate You\", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk\u2014rendered unconscious by the pinch\u2014hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/><ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\">{{cite web|author=Plume, Kenneth|date=February 10, 2000|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-kirk-thatcher-part-1-of-2|title=Interview with Kirk Thatcher (Part 1 of 2)|website=[[IGN]]|access-date=December 8, 2009|archive-date=May 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505003226/http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-kirk-thatcher-part-1-of-2|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MontereyBayAquariumBackview.jpg|thumb|left|The Monterey Bay Aquarium, viewed from the back.

A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> For close-ups of the characters as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales\u2014and Spock's initiation of a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]]\u2014underwater. Footage of the actors shot in front of them as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/>\n\nIn the film, Uhura and Chekov visit the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. The real ''Enterprise'', out at sea at the time, was unavailable for filming, so the non-nuclear-powered carrier [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger'' (CV-61)]] was used.<ref name=\"Okuda Okuda_1997\"/>{{rp|137}} [[Oakland International Airport]] was used for the foreground element of [[Starfleet]] Headquarters.

However, the people with whom Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with ''StarTrek.com'', Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, \"I don't know if I know the answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]],\" stated that after her car was impounded because she missed the warnings to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.<ref>{{cite web|date=October 27, 2005|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/14344.html|title=Visions of Layla: Taking the Voyage Home|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=CBS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519051542/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/14344.html|archive-date=May 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vasquez Rocks 2.jpg|thumb|right|Vasquez Rocks was used as a stand-in for the alien world of Vulcan. The rocks had also appeared in ''TOS'' and many other TV shows and movies.]]\nVulcan and the Bird-of-Prey exterior was created with a combination of matte paintings and a soundstage. Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the ''Enterprise'' crew's preparations to return to Earth, but various locations did not work, so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot. The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were {{convert|30|ft|m}} away.<ref name=\"nimoy\"/> A wide-angle shot of Spock on the edge of a cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at [[Vasquez Rocks]], a park north of Los Angeles.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races. Production manager [[Jack T. Collis]] economized by building the set with only one end; reverse angle shots used the same piece of wall. The positions of the Federation President's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot. Since ''The Voyage Home'' was the first ''Star Trek'' film to show the operations at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate. Among the resulting set's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed \"the pool table\"; the prop later became a fixture in USS ''Enterprise''-D's engine room on the television series ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\n===Effects===\nNimoy approached ILM early in development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences.<ref name=\"Lee_1986\"/>{{rp|46}} Many shots used [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]] to extend backgrounds and create [[establishing shot]]s without the cost of building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real\u2014while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would \"shoot things that [...] are odd in some way\" and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor [[Craig Barron]] believed that there were too many elements in the scene.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\nThe scenes of the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were combinations of live-action footage\u2014actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops\u2014and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to be integrated into the shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|5\u20139}}\n\nThe script called for the probe to vaporize the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow wanted to go to sea and record plumes of water created by exploding [[detonating cord]]s in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and [[cloud tank]] effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nThe Bird-of-Prey's travel through time was one of the most difficult effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a [[moire pattern]] as its position shifted. Animator [[John Knoll]] added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|13\u20134}}\n\nTraveling through time, Kirk and crew experience what author Jody Duncan Shay termed a \"dreamlike state\". The script's only direction for the effect was \"now [they] go through time\"; Nimoy and McQuarrie envisioned Kirk's dream as a montage of bizarre images. The filmmakers decided early on that part of the dream sequence would use computer-generated animation to give it an unreal quality divorced from the rest of the film. ILM worked from McQuarrie's storyboards and created a rough mock-up or [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]] to show Nimoy and hone the direction of the sequence.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/>{{rp|240}}<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|14}} For the very beginning of the dream, the inside of the Bird-of-Prey bridge was painted stark white.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Part of the final sequence involved morphing the heads of the ''Enterprise'' crew into one another; ILM digitized the cast members' heads using a 3-D scanning technology developed by [[Cyberware (company)|Cyberware]] and used the resulting data for the computer models.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|14}} Because each head model had the same number of key points of reference, transforming one character into another was simple; more difficult, the animators recalled, was ensuring that the transformation looked \"pleasing\" and not \"grotesque\". The resulting thirty seconds of footage took weeks to render; the department used every spare computer they could find to help in the processing chores. ILM's stage, optical, and matte departments collaborated to complete other shots for the dream sequence. The shot of a man's fall to Earth was created by filming a small puppet on bluescreen. Shots of liquid nitrogen composited behind the puppet gave the impression of smoke. The background plate of the planet was a large matte that allowed the camera to zoom in very close. The final shot of marshy terrain was practical and required no effects.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|15\u20137}}\n\nThe filmmakers knew from the beginning of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When [[Humphrey the Whale]] wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|18}} Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35&nbsp;mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired [[robotics]] expert [[Walt Conti]]. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nAfter watching footage of whale movement, Conti determined that the models could be simplified by making the front of the whale entirely rigid, relying on the tail and fins for movement. Conti showed footage of the operation of a {{convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} prototype to Paramount executives, who according to Conti, \"''loved'' it... It really knocked them out.\" With Paramount's approval, ILM hired marine author, conservationist and illustrator Pieter Folkens to sculpt a realistic whale exterior.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|19}}> ILM decided on a finished model size of {{convert|4|ft|m|spell=in}}\u2014the size prevented delicate components like the tail from buckling under stress\u2014and fitted it with mechanics and radio equipment required for control and operation. To prevent water from ruining the whale's electronics, the modelmakers sealed every individual mechanical component rather than attempting to waterproof the entire whale. Balloons and lead weights were added to achieve the proper balance and buoyancy. The finished models were put in the swimming pool of [[Jun\u00edpero Serra High School (San Mateo, California)|Serra High School]] in San Mateo, California, for two weeks of shooting; the operation of the whales required four handlers and divers with video cameras to help set up the shots. Accurately controlling the whales was difficult because of the murky water\u2014ILM added [[diatomaceous earth]] to the water to match realistic ocean visibility.<ref name=\"Shay_1987\"/>{{rp|21\u201322}} For a few shots, such as the whales' breaching the water towards the end of the film, the creatures were represented by life-size animatronics shot at Paramount.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/>{{rp|233}}\n\nModels of the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] were destroyed in the previous film partly because visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston wanted to build a \"more state-of-the-art ship for the next film\", but the filmmakers made the less costly decision to have the crew return to serve on the duplicate [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise'' A]], and six weeks were spent repairing and repainting the old model. A travel pod from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' was also reused for the ending, although the {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} interior set had to be rebuilt. Graphic designer [[Michael Okuda]] designed smooth controls with backlit displays for the Federation. Dubbed \"[[LCARS|Okudagrams]]\", the system was also used for displays on the Klingon ship, though the buttons were larger.<ref name=\"Reeves-Stevens_1995\"/>{{rp|236\u20137}}\n\n===Sound===\n[[James Horner]], composer for ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock'', declined to return for ''The Voyage Home''. Nimoy turned to his friend [[Leonard Rosenman]], who had written the music to ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'', [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and two ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' sequels.<ref name=\"Breyer_1995\"/><ref name=\"Bond_1999\"/>{{rp|119}} Rosenman wrote an arrangement of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme as the title music for ''The Voyage Home'', but Nimoy requested an original composition. Music critic Jeff Bond writes, \"The final result was one of the most unusual ''Star Trek'' movie themes,\" consisting of a six-note theme and variations set against a repetitious four-note brass motif; the theme's bridge borrows content from Rosenman's \"Frodo March\" for ''The Lord of the Rings''. The melody is played in the beginning of the film on Vulcan and the scenes of Taylor's search for Kirk to help find her whales.<ref name=\"Bond_1999\"/>{{rp|119\u201320}}\n\nThe Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of [[George Gershwin]], but Rosenman changed the director's mind,<ref name=\"Bond_1999\"/>{{rp|131}} and the scene was scored with a contemporary [[jazz fusion]] piece by [[Yellowjackets (band)|Yellowjackets]]. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporates classical Russian compositions. The music for the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions include the action music for the face off between the Bird-of-Prey and a whaling ship in open water, and the atmospheric music (reminiscent of the composer's work in ''Fantastic Voyage'') during the probe's communication. After the probe leaves, a [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldiesque]] \"whale fugue\" begins. The first sighting of the ''Enterprise''-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end titles.<ref name=\"Bond_1999\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nMark Mangini served as ''The Voyage Home''{{'}}s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to ''Star Trek'' had been established\u2014the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, ''et al.''\u2014Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist [[Roger Payne]], who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a [[Puppetry|puppet show]] to explain.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\"/>\n\nIt was at Bennett's suggestion that Paramount studio heads asked Nimoy to create subtitles for the probe's transmission at the start of the film and for the climactic dialogue with the whales. Both Nimoy and Meyer were adamantly against using any subtitles, and they eventually prevailed.<ref>Special features: \"Futures Past: A Look Back\". 23:54\u201325:29. \"[Nimoy (on the opening sequence):] And the suggestion was that the subtitle should read something like, 'Where are you?'\" \"[Meyer:] I was fighting any explanation of what the probe wanted or what the whales were saying, that was ridiculous.\"{{indent|2}}{{cite book|last=Nimoy|first=Leonard|author-link=Leonard Nimoy|url=https://epdf.pub/i-am-spock2db009bf1cfe957fc286dbe6839ef94921251.html|title=I Am Spock|edition=Reprint|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=June 23, 2015|format=PDF|page=143|isbn=9780316388375|quote=[Nimoy:] Because I felt so strongly on the subject, this led to friction between us, especially when Harve sent the studio heads a memo, suggesting some possible 'dialog' between the probe and the whales ...

Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural \"wub-wub-wub\" response, distorted it with \"just the tiniest bit of dressing\", and used it as the final sound.<ref name=\"special features-abovetheline\">Special features: \"Below-the-Line: Sound Design\". 4:58\u20137:03.</ref>\n\nThe punk music during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the sound for the scene would be by \"[[Duran Duran]], or whoever\" and not \"raw\" and authentic punk.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/> Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two sound editors who were in punk bands to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of \"I hate you\", and wrote a song centered on the theme. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the song in one take using cheap microphones to create a distorted sound.<ref name=\"special features-onlocation\"/> The song was also used in Paramount's ''[[Back to the Beach]]''.<ref name=\"ign-kirk thatcher\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Release===\n''The Voyage Home'' opened theatrically in North America on [[Thanksgiving]] weekend, November 26, 1986.<ref name=\"globe and mail-back to the future\">{{cite news|author=Thompson, Anne|date=October 17, 1986|title=Back to the future for Star Trek fans|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=D3}}</ref><ref name=\"washington post-hohoho\"/> Since ''Star Trek'' had traditionally performed poorly internationally, the producers created a special trailer for foreign markets that de-emphasized the ''Star Trek'' part of the title,<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=November 6, 2008|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/11/06/st09-trailer-countdown-taking-a-look-at-the-voyage-homes-trailer/|title=ST09 Trailer Countdown: Taking A Look At The Voyage Home's Trailer|publisher=TrekMovie|access-date=April 17, 2010|archive-date=December 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210142216/http://trekmovie.com/2008/11/06/st09-trailer-countdown-taking-a-look-at-the-voyage-homes-trailer/|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as retelling the events of ''The Wrath of Khan'' and ''The Search for Spock''.

Attending the screening with Nimoy, Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences; he said \"the single most rewarding moment of my ''Star Trek'' life\" was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy's line, \"The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe.
