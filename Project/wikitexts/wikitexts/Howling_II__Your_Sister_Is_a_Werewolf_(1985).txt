Although [[Gary Brandner]], author of ''[[The Howling]]'' novels, co-wrote the screenplay, the ''Howling II: Your Sister Is a Werewolf'' is largely unrelated to his 1979 novel ''[[The Howling II (novel)|The Howling II]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nBen White ([[Reb Brown]]) attends the funeral of his sister, journalist Karen White, the heroine of [[The Howling (film)|the previous film]]. Following her interment in a mausoleum, Ben meets both Jenny Templeton ([[Annie McEnroe]]), one of Karen's colleagues, and Stefan Crosscoe ([[Christopher Lee]]), a mysterious interloper who tells him Karen was a werewolf. Providing videotaped evidence of the transformation \u2013 and turning up to destroy Karen as her undead body rises from the grave \u2013 Crosscoe convinces Ben and Jenny to accompany him to [[Transylvania]] to battle Stirba ([[Sybil Danning]]), an immortal werewolf queen. Along the way, the trio encounter Mariana ([[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]]), another lusty werewolf siren, and her minion, Erle ([[Ferdy Mayne]]).\n\nArriving in the [[Balkans]], Ben and company wander through an ethnic folk festival, unaware that Stirba is off in her nearby castle already plotting their downfall. Stirba seems to have powers of witchcraft, as well as being a werewolf, for she intones the [[Wicca]]n chant ''[[Eko Eko Azarak]]''. Eventually, the adventurers battle with Stirba in an assault that involves disguised dwarfs, mutilated priests, and supernatural parasites, before Stirba is destroyed by Stefan at the cost of his own life. Ben and Jenny return home, where they become a couple and are greeted by a werewolf disguised as their neighbor's child. They go to the neighbor's house and ask about the child, to which the neighbor replies that he has no child, confirming their suspicions that the child was, in fact, a werewolf.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Stefan Crosscoe\n* [[Annie McEnroe]] as Jenny Templeton\n* [[Reb Brown]] as Ben White\n* [[Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)|Marsha Hunt]] as Mariana\n* [[Sybil Danning]] as Stirba\n** Valerie Kaplanov\u00e1 as old Stirba\n* Judd Omen as Vlad\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as Erle\n* [[Jimmy Nail]] as Dom\n* Patrick Field as Deacon\n* Ladislav Kre\u010dmer as Father Florin\n* [[Ivo Niederle]] as Grigorie \n* [[Jan Kraus (actor)|Jan Kraus]] as Tondo\n\n== Production ==\nThis film is the only [[The Howling (franchise)|''Howling'' sequel]] that directly follows the original film's events, and is also the only ''Howling'' film to feature the input of the original novelist, [[Gary Brandner]]. Brandner was critical of the [[The Howling (film)|original 1981 film]], which was only a loose adaptation of [[The Howling|his 1977 novel]], and some elements of this sequel may have been deliberately divergent from the previous film, though some (such as this film's [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning of the worldwide revelation of the existence of werewolves) seem to be accidental.<ref>Documentary on ''The Howling'' DVD, Regions 1 and 2</ref>\n\nThe film features a sequence in which new wave band Babel play their song \"The Howling\". Babel were: [[Stephen W. Parsons]] (lead singer); Chris Pye (guitar); Simon Etchell (keyboard); Steve Young (drums). Three of these musicians later played in another band, State Project. Parsons composed the soundtrack of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://burningtheground.net/2017/10/steve-parsons-babel-the-howling-germany-12/|title=Steve Parsons & Babel \u2013 The Howling |publisher= [[burning the ground]] |access-date=21 January 2021}}</ref>\n\nDirector Philippe Mora related how the film was set to celebrate the 10,000th birthday of bi-curious werewolf queen Stirba and was inspired by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] eroticism. He revealed that actors Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe were so bad in their roles that veteran Christopher Lee acted off-set in a manner as if \"wishing himself away\".<ref name=\"Book1\"/> Also revealed was that the scene with Sybil Danning revealing her bare breasts was repeated 17 times during the end credits screen crawl.<ref name=\"Book1\"/> For most other scenes in the movie, Danning was either covered with hair or wearing a metallic armoured outfit and sunglasses.\n\nWhile most of the film was shot on locations in what was, at the time, the country of [[Czechoslovakia]]\u2013for example, in the ossuary in [[M\u011bln\u00edk]], a town in [[Central Bohemia]], as well as at [[Barrandov Studios]], [[Prague, Czech Republic|Prague]]\u2013some scenes were shot in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Variety\"/>\n\nShooting in communist Prague offered difficulties: Mora's government-assigned assistant director knew nothing of filmmaking. Mora had to \"literally import trash from America to clutter the clean communist streets\".<ref name=\"Book1\"/> When a local casting call went out looking for \"punks\", 1,000 individuals arrived, resulting in the local authorities calling in both the police and military. Mora was advised by an army colonel, \"you can finish shooting the scene, but they'll have to leave in groups of no more than three\".<ref name=\"Book1\">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Michael|title=Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061806292|pages=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AeL09OCjLEC&q=%22Howling+II:+Stirba+-+Werewolf+Bitch%22&pg=PA17}}</ref>\n\nCo-stars Marsha Hunt and Christopher Lee previously together appeared in ''[[Dracula A.D. 1972]]''.

The re-edited TV version ran at 91 minutes, and included a new scene before the end credits, plus a brand-new end credits sequence in order to replace the topless shots of Sybil Danning in the original's R-rated end sequence. The TV end credits also include music, whereas the theatrical version is silent.\n\nThe film failed to garner as much attention or commercial success as the original film.
