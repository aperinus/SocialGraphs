As an adult, Noah lives with his wife, [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]], and their sons [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], and [[Japheth]]. He witnesses a flower grow instantly from the ground and dreams of a [[great flood]], so he takes his family to consult his grandfather, [[Methuselah]]. On the way, they come across a group of recently killed people and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. She is treated for an abdominal wound, but Naameh determines she will be unable to bear children. The group is chased by the murderers and escapes into the land of [[Watcher (angel)|the Watchers]], [[fallen angel]]s that were left stranded on Earth as stone creatures after they descended from [[Heaven]] to help [[Adam and Eve]] when the pair was banished from the [[Garden of Eden]].\n\nMethuselah helps Noah understand his visions and gives him a seed from Eden, which he plants nearby. The Watchers arrive the next morning, and, while they debate whether to help Noah build [[Noah's Ark|his ark]], water spouts from where Noah planted the seed and a mature forest pops up around them. The Watchers are convinced Noah is serving the Creator.\n\nYears later, Tubal-cain notices a huge flock of birds flying to the almost-completed ark and leads his followers to confront Noah, who defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]]. When the Watchers form a defensive circle, Tubal-cain retreats and begins to build weapons to take the ark. More species of animals come to the ark and are sedated with [[incense]].\n\nWith Ila in love with Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but, after witnessing the settlers' cruel and shameless behavior, he abandons his effort, as he now believes the Creator does not want humans to be part of the world once he and his family get the animals reestablished after the flood. Devastated by the idea of being alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider and, when he will not, goes to Methuselah for help. The old man cures Ila's infertility, while Ham befriends a refugee named Na'el.\n\nWhen the rain begins, Tubal-cain incites his followers to storm the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest, but leaves Na'el, who is stuck in a foothold trap, to be trampled to death. His family enters the ark, except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers hold off Tubal-cain's army, sacrificing themselves and ascending back to heaven. Tubal-cain slips onto the ark and solicits help from Ham, playing on the boy's anger toward Noah.\n\nIla discovers she is pregnant and tells Noah. He pleads with God not to make him kill the child. The rains stop, indicating that God wants the child to die, so Noah tells his family that, if the baby is a girl, he will kill her to ensure the future will be uncorrupted by humans.\n\nNine months later, Ila goes into labor as she and Shem are about to leave the ark on a raft. Naameh begs Noah to spare the child so they will stay, but, instead, he burns the raft. Ham interrupts to tell Noah the beasts are awake and eating each other, which is a ruse so Tubal-cain can attack Noah. While they fight, Ila gives birth to female twins and the ark hits [[Mountains of Ararat|a mountaintop]]. Shem attacks his father and Tubal-cain is about to strike Noah with a rock, but Ham kills Tubal-cain with a dagger. With his dying breath, Tubal-cain tells Ham, \"Now... You are a man\". Noah finds Ila, intending to kill the babies, but spares them because he finds nothing but love in his heart when he sees his newborn granddaughters.\n\nUpon exiting the ark, a shameful Noah, thinking he has failed the Creator and deeming himself a monster, goes into isolation in a cave and [[Noah's wine|makes wine]] to drown his sorrows. Ham, after witnessing his father's unseemly and naked drunkenness, leaves to travel alone. Reconciling with his remaining family at Ila's behest, Noah charges his progeny with caring for the world and tells them \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,\" after which they witness intense waves of rainbows.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Noah]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Philiana|title=It's Official: Russell Crowe to Star in Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/russell-crowe-noah-darren-aronofsky-314892|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 25, 2012|date=April 22, 2012}}</ref>\n** [[Dakota Goyo]] as young Noah<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Kevin Durand, Marton Csokas & Dakota Goyo Book Passage On Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin-durand-marton-csokas-dakota-goyo-book-passage-on-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120719|publisher=indiewire.com|access-date=July 25, 2012|date=July 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722035655/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kevin-durand-marton-csokas-dakota-goyo-book-passage-on-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120719|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]], Noah's wife<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Jennifer Connelly Officially In Talks For Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/jennifer-connelly-officially-in-talks-for-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120618|publisher=indiewire.com|access-date=July 25, 2012|date=June 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622015049/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/jennifer-connelly-officially-in-talks-for-darren-aronofskys-noah-20120618|archive-date=June 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> (in the Bible, there is a \"Naamah\" who is Tubal-cain's sister)\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as [[Tubal-cain]], a descendant of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] and Noah's nemesis<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web |last= Child |first= Ben|title=Ray Winstone set to star opposite Russell Crowe in Noah's ark epic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/12/ray-winstone-russell-crowe-noahs-ark|work=The Guardian|access-date=July 25, 2012|date=June 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/story/2012-08-09/noah-crowe-aronofsky/56922916/1|title='Noah' director Aronofsky tweets up a storm |last=Truitt |first=Brian |work= [[USA Today]]|date=August 10, 2012|access-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/58454/emma-watson-shares-updates-on-bling-ring-noah-and-50-shades|title=Emma Watson shares updates on 'Bling Ring,' 'Noah' and '50 Shades'|last=Nepales|first=Ruben V|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=September 15, 2012|access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>\n** [[Finn Wittrock]] as young Tubal-cain<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/movies/russell-crowe-confronts-lifes-nasty-weather-in-noah.html|title=Russell Crowe Confronts Life's Nasty Weather in 'Noah'|first=A.

Work on the draft resumed sometime later, and a first draft was completed in 2003.<ref name=\"Conversation\" />\n\nAronofsky struggled with how to adapt the story as a feature-length film, since, in the Bible, it is only four chapters long.
