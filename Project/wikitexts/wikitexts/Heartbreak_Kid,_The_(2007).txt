It is a remake of [[The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)|the 1972 film of the same name]] and stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Carlos Mencia]], [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]], and [[Danny McBride]]. It tells the story of a sports shop owner who ends up in a rushed marriage with a shrewish woman and meets a true love interest during a trip to Mexico.\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nEddie Cantrow, owner of a [[San Francisco]] sports shop, is [[Single person|single]] but ambivalent about relationships. One day, seeing a purse-snatching, he tries unsuccessfully to recover it. He and its owner Lila exchange pleasantries, and Eddie finds her attractive.\n\nThey begin dating and get serious quickly. Suddenly, her company requires Lila to move to Holland, but her company does not deploy married employees abroad. At the urging of both his father Doc and best friend Mac, Eddie marries her after only dating a few months.\n\nBefore their wedding night, Eddie and Lila have never been sexually intimate nor spent much time getting to know each other. During the drive to their [[honeymoon]] in [[Los Cabos Municipality|Los Cabos]], [[Mexico]], Eddie learns things about Lila he finds annoying, such as incessant singing.\n\nArriving to their room, they have sex for the first time and Eddie learns that Lila is aggressive in bed. His disaffection deepens when she divulges her history of substance abuse which resulted in a [[Nasal septum deviation|deviated septum]], so she sprays drinks out of her nose. He learns she was only a volunteer, and the \"thief\" was an ex that she owed money to. Eddie realizes he made a mistake marrying Lila as he rushed into it. Not in love with her, he can't stand some of her newly discovered behavior and bad habits.\n\nOn the beach, Lila insists on using mineral oil, refusing sunblock. She then blames Eddie for her second-degree sunburn. As the enormity of his mistake sinks in, he meets Miranda, a vacationer with her family from Mississippi. Immediately attracted, Eddie spend most of his honeymoon with Miranda and her family while the sunburn confines Lila to their room.  Miranda's family all like Eddie except for her cousin, Martin, who senses he is hiding something. Confiding in Mac, he states he made a mistake marrying Lila and he is falling for Miranda.\n\nLater that same evening, there is a misunderstanding between Eddie and Miranda's family because they hear he came to Mexico to mourn his wife who was killed by a maniac with an ice pick.\n\nLater on, Eddie decides to propose divorce to Lila at lunch, but then Martin and his brother Buzz confront him. When Miranda learns about Lila, she and Eddie fall into the ocean and Eddie is stung by a jellyfish where Lila treats the stings by urinating on him. After the chaos, Lila and Miranda both abandon him (Miranda for his lies and Lila for his wish for a divorce). Lila even destroys Eddie's [[passport]] stranding him in Mexico.\n\nEddie sinks into depression, annoying Mexican Manuel with his problems. Coerced by Uncle Tito, he decides to go to Mississippi to make amends with Miranda. Border patrol agents repeatedly catch Eddie attempting to cross the U.S. border illegally with help from Tito, but he finally gets to [[Oxford, Mississippi]].\n\nUpon meeting Miranda's family, he learns that she has married her previous boyfriend. Despite promising to leave Miranda alone, Eddie sneaks in and awakens Miranda as her husband sleeps. Her husband wakes up when Martin bursts in and attacks Eddie with a baseball bat until Doc intervenes. Eddie agrees to leave if Miranda says she truly loves her new husband, which she does. Eddie leaves with Doc, without knowing that Miranda looks longingly from her balcony as he walks away.\n\nEighteen months later, Eddie is divorced from Lila (who got his sports store) and he moves permanently to Mexico to sell sporting goods on the beach. Some time later, Miranda arrives in Mexico and finds Eddie. She has left her husband, is single, and still in love with him. Eddie is thrilled. In a twist ending, Miranda is unaware that Eddie had remarried to a woman named Consuela causing Eddie to go through the same predicament again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Edward \"Eddie\" Cantrow, a sports store owner who marries too soon and goes through turmoil.\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Miranda, a woman in Mexico who Eddie believes is his true soulmate.\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Lila Cantrow, Eddie's wife who at first is everything Eddie wants, but later turns out to be a total nightmare due to her bad habits.\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Doc Cantrow, Eddie's father who often visits Las Vegas and gives Eddie rather vulgar tips on women.\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Mac, Eddie's best friend who is in a struggling marriage himself.\n* [[Carlos Mencia]] as Uncle Tito, the owner of the hotel in Los Cabos that Eddie and Lila stay in on their honeymoon.\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Boo, Miranda's uncle and Martin and Buzz's dad.\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Martin, Miranda's cousin who is suspicious of Eddie and treats him coldly.\n* Roy Jenkins as Buzz, Martin's brother who treats Eddie more fairly.\n* [[Ali Hillis]] as Jodi, Eddie's ex-girlfriend who gets married at the start of the film.\n* [[Amy Sloan]] as Deborah, Martin's wife.\n* Kayla Kleevage as Doc's Vegas Companion, a huge-chested woman who is in the scene with Doc during his phone conversation with Eddie.\n* [[Stephanie Courtney]] as Gayla, Buzz's wife.\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Beryll, Boo's wife, Miranda's aunt, and Martin and Buzz's mom.\n* [[Eva Longoria]] as Consuela Cantrow, a Mexican woman who became Eddie's second wife at the end of the film sometime during the 18 month gap.\n* [[Lauren Bowles]] as Tammy, Mac's wife who ends up in a dysfunctional marriage with him.\n* Luis Accinelli as Manuel, an elderly Mexican who Eddie annoys after being stranded in Mexico.\n* Jerry Sherman as Anderson, Miranda's granddad.\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Jodi's father.\n\n==Promotion==\nDuring the film's preview at the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], a sex scene from the film was cut due to backlash for the nudity in prior films at the convention such as ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and ''[[Borat]]''.<ref name=\"MalaysiaNews\">{{cite web\n|title=Malaysia Sun\n|work=Stiller's S and M sex scene axed\n| url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/f825b92e19df636a/id/269270/cs/1\n| access-date=September 3, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed {{US$|14022105|2007}} in 3,219 theaters in its opening weekend, putting it in second place at the box office in North America.
