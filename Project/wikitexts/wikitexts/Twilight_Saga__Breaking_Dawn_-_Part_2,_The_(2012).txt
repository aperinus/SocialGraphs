[[Kristen Stewart]], [[Robert Pattinson]], and [[Taylor Lautner]] reprise their roles, with [[Mackenzie Foy]] portraying [[List of Twilight characters#Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee Cullen]]. Alongside Pattinson, Lautner, Stewart, and Foy, the film also stars an ensemble cast including [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]], [[Peter Facinelli]], [[Elizabeth Reaser]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Nikki Reed]], [[Jackson Rathbone]], [[Ashley Greene]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Dakota Fanning]].\n\n''Part 2'' was released on November 16, 2012.<ref name=\"Collider\">{{cite web |author=Steve Weintraub |title=The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 Gets Released November 16, 2012 |url=https://www.collider.com/2010/08/03/the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2-release-date-november-16-2012-release-date |work=Collider.com |date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> The film, despite mixed critical reception, was a box office success, grossing nearly $830 million worldwide against a production budget of $136 million, becoming the [[2012 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2012]] and the highest-grossing film of ''The Twilight Saga'' series. It was the first film in the franchise to release by [[Lionsgate]] after its acquisition with Summit Entertainment ten months prior to its release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nThe movie continues from the events of the [[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1#| previous film]], as [[Bella Swan|Bella]], who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation. After Edward helps her satisfy her initial thirst, Bella is introduced to her daughter [[List of Twilight characters#Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee]]. The rest of the Cullens and Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has imprinted on her, making her furious until he explains he has no ill intentions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bella's father, [[List of Twilight characters#Charlie Swan|Charlie]], has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle announces that they have to leave [[Forks, Washington]], to protect their identities - especially because of Charlie. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and well, but that she had to change in order to get better. Jacob also tells him he doesn't live in the world he thinks he does, and then reveals his wolf form to him. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered and this is her chosen life, but he does not know what has changed her or where Renesmee came from, but she's 'adopted'.\n\nSeveral months pass with [[List of Twilight characters#Carlisle Cullen|Carlisle]] monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter [[List of Twilight characters#Denali coven|Irina]] sees Renesmee from a distance and assumes she's an [[Immortality|immortal]] child without asking any questions. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they slaughtered entire villages. The creation of such children is outlawed by [[the Volturi]] and anyone caught with one is to be executed.\n\nIrina goes to [[the Volturi]], reporting what she has seen. Alice gets a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Alice and Jasper then leave to gather evidence of this. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denalis, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire powers.\n\nThe Volturi, led by Aro, arrive in Forks prepared for battle. Seeing the large group of 27 vampires (the Cullens and their witnesses) and wolves, they stop their procession. They are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child, however, the Volturi are eager to add the gifted members of the Cullen coven to the guard, so they execute Irina in an attempt to provoke a battle. Before a fight breaks out Alice and Jasper return and Alice shows Aro her visions of the future.\n\nIn this violent vision, she and Jasper are arrested for attacking Aro after Alice finds out he will not change his decision and kicks him in the face. Carlisle tries to save them but is murdered by Aro. Jasper is beheaded by Demetri and Jane. Alice and [[List of Twilight characters#Sam Uley|Sam]] together avenge Jasper by killing Jane. Caius is partially beheaded by Tanya (a member of the Denalis) as revenge for Irina's execution. Seth is killed by Felix. Leah saves Esme's life but loses hers in the process. Marcus welcomes his death as he is torn to pieces by Vladimir and Stefan. Aro tries to kill Edward but a joint effort from Bella and Edward kills him. The vision ends with Bella burning Aro's detached head as other Volturi members try to grab her from behind.\n\nAro, despite being afraid of the vision future, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might become savage. Alice and Jasper reveal their final witness, Nahuel (a half-human half-vampire just like Renesmee). He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro fearfully explaining that there will be no battle today.\n\nBack at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment they have shared together. They kiss after Bella tells him, \"nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you\", and he says \"with one exception,\" affirming they will be together forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Twilight cast members|List of Twilight characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Bella Cullen]]\n*[[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]]\n*[[Taylor Lautner]] as [[Jacob Black]]\n*[[Mackenzie Foy]] as Renesmee Cullen\n*[[Ashley Greene]] as Alice Cullen\n*[[Jackson Rathbone]] as Jasper Hale\n*[[Peter Facinelli]] as Carlisle Cullen\n*[[Elizabeth Reaser]] as Esme Cullen\n*[[Kellan Lutz]] as Emmett Cullen\n*[[Nikki Reed]] as Rosalie Hale\n*[[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Charlie Swan\n*[[Maggie Grace]] as Irina\n*[[Michael Sheen]] as Aro\n*[[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as Caius\n*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Jane\n*[[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Marcus\n*[[Casey LaBow]] as Kate\n*[[MyAnna Buring]] as Tanya\n*[[Lee Pace]] as Garrett\n*[[Christian Camargo]] as Eleazar\n*[[M\u00eda Maestro]] as Carmen\n*[[Noel Fisher]] as Vladimir\n*[[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Alistair\n*[[Cameron Bright]] as Alec\n*[[Angela Sarafyan]] as Tia\n*[[Rami Malek]] as Benjamin\n*[[Booboo Stewart]] as Seth Clearwater\n*[[Daniel Cudmore]] as Felix\n*[[Judith Shekoni]] as Zafrina\n*[[Charlie Bewley]] as Demetri\n*[[J.

If the actors holding Summit back from making an official announcement did not reach an agreement with them, the studio would not have minded recasting their roles, as was done in ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]'' with [[Bryce Dallas Howard]]'s character, Victoria. However, in June 2010, Summit officially confirmed that a two-part adaptation of the fourth book would start production and it was made clear that all major actors, including the three lead roles, the Cullen family, and [[Charlie Swan (Twilight)|Charlie Swan]], would return for both parts.\n\n===Pre-production===\nBy August 2009, Rosenberg said that the scripts for ''Part 1'' and ''2'' were 75 to 85 percent completed. She found the greatest challenge in writing the scripts to be the final sequence of ''Part 2'': \"The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages\", she said. \"It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [keep it all in one setting] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [Condon] to choreograph on the stage.\" She had written various drafts of the scene but, at that, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, \"That's the next big hurdle to sit down with the stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet.\" Godfrey called ''Part 2'' \"an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes\" and said that in ''Part 1'' \"there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was.\" Condon thought of ''Part 1'' \"as a real companion piece to [[Twilight (2008 film)|Catherine Hardwicke's movie]]\". Condon explains, \"Like, everything that got set up there gets resolved here. I think you'll find that there are stylistic and other nods to that film.\"\n\nGodfrey considered releasing the second film in [[3D film|3D]] to differentiate between the time before and after Bella becomes a vampire, an idea originally proposed for ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse|Eclipse]]'', but said that the decision is up to Condon. However, he said that if the second film were to be released in 3D, he would like to shoot it with the proper equipment in \"real\" 3D as was done with ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), not convert it into 3D in post-production as was done with ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://collider.com/twilight-producer-wyck-godfrey-interview-the-twilight-saga-eclipse-breaking-dawn-ultimate-twilight-dvd-blu-ray-box-set/35096/\u20a0|title=Exclusive: Producer Wyck Godfrey on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, Other Projects, Ultimate Twilight DVD Box Set|publisher=Collider|date=July 1, 2010|access-date=July 31, 2011}}</ref> On February 12, 2012 it was confirmed that ''Part 2'' would not be filmed in 3D.<ref>{{cite web|last=Girls|first=Gossip|title=Breaking Dawn: Part 2 will NOT be filmed in 3D!|url=http://www.breakingdawnmovie.org/breaking-dawn-will-not-be-filmed-in-3d/|publisher=Gossip Girls Inc.|access-date=August 29, 2012|archive-date=November 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125050109/http://www.breakingdawnmovie.org/breaking-dawn-will-not-be-filmed-in-3d/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] started on November 1, 2010 and wrapped, for most of the cast, on April 15, 2011, ending the franchise's three years of production since March 2008. Filming was shot on location in [[Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]; [[Vancouver]], British Columbia; and [[New York City]], New York. Filming also occurred at [[Famous Players Film Company|Raleigh Studios]] in Baton Rouge.\n\nOn the subject of the final day and her final moment as Bella, Stewart stated, \"After that scene, my true final scene, I felt like I could shoot up into the night sky and every pore of my body would shoot light. I felt lighter than I've ever felt in my life.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/kristen-stewart-twilight-breaking-dawn-cover-story|title=Woman on the Verge|author=Lynn Hirschberg|work=[[W (magazine)|W]]|access-date=October 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2012, the crew and cast, including Pattinson and Stewart, returned for reshoots to pick up some additional shots for technical work with some of the cast and stunt actors.

Finding that balance of how much of a human performance versus an animal performance was important for Bill.\"\n\nLeven adds, \"Bill has always treated the wolves as characters and never as computer-generated things, and directs them in the same way he'd direct any actor. He would always give us direction like Sam should be angrier. It's the best way to work. His treating these creatures as characters, instead of just computer bits, was really great.\"\n\n\"Because we've been working on this franchise for such a prolonged period of time, we've been able to improve the look from show to show,\" comments Phil Tippett. \"Wolves generally are pretty darn clean and since Bill wanted the wolves rangier, that means a lot more fur matting and clumping, like they've lived out in the woods. We edged towards something a bit more feral.\"\n\n\"However, there is also a balance between look and technology,\" adds Tippett. \"The body count of the wolves escalates and because we're adding a great deal more hair to get the right texture, that fur really ups the rendering time. We've gone from four wolves to eight to twelve, to sixteen in ''Part 2''. So we have to be very careful about that balance because it takes hundreds of hours to render each wolf.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenslam.com/blog/learn-about-all-the-special-effects-that-went-into-the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2/|title=Learn About All the Special Effects that went into THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN \u2013 PART 2|author=Shawn Cauthen|date=November 2012|access-date=November 2, 2012|archive-date=January 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129000243/http://www.screenslam.com/blog/learn-about-all-the-special-effects-that-went-into-the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2 (soundtrack)}}\nIt was revealed in January 2012 that the soundtrack for ''Part 2'' had already started production.<ref name=\"Breaking Dawn Part 2 Soundtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/01/30/breaking-dawn-part-2-soundtrack-started/|title='Breaking Dawn: Part 2\u2032 Soundtrack Started, Says Insider|last=Benson|first=Kirstin|date=January 30, 2012|publisher=Hollywood Life|access-date=January 31, 2012|location=www.hollywoodlife.com|archive-date=February 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205000054/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/01/30/breaking-dawn-part-2-soundtrack-started/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Confirmed for the soundtrack in advance were \"Heart of Stone\" by [[Iko (band)|Iko]], which plays when Edward and Bella are talking in the cottage after finding Alice's note and \"Where I Come From\" by [[Passion Pit]], which will play when Bella wakes up from her transformation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sims|first=Andrew|title=Passion Pit is first artist announced for 'Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2\u2032 soundtrack|url=http://www.hypable.com/2012/07/12/passion-pit-is-first-artist-announced-for-breaking-dawn-part-2-soundtrack/|publisher=Hypable|date=July 12, 2012}}</ref> The lead single from the soundtrack is \"[[The Forgotten (Green Day song)|The Forgotten]]\", performed by the American rock band [[Green Day]]. \"A Thousand Years, Pt. 2\" by the American singer [[Christina Perri]] is also featured on the soundtrack album.\n\n[[Carter Burwell]], the composer of ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1|Breaking Dawn: Part 1]]'', returned to score the final installment of the series.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2'' has earned $292,324,737 in North America and $537,360,640 in other territories for a worldwide total of $829,685,377.<ref name=\"bom\"/> The film is the [[2012 in film|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2012]], and the highest-grossing film of the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|''Twilight'' series]].
