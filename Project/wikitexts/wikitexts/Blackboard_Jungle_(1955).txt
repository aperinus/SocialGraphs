Led by student Gregory Miller, most engage in anti-social behavior. The school principal, Mr. Warneke, denies there are discipline issues, but the school faculty, particularly Mr. Murdock, warn Dadier otherwise. Dadier befriends two other new teachers, Joshua Edwards and Lois Hammond.\n\nDadier's class includes Miller and Artie West, a rebellious bully and gang leader. The class shows no respect for Dadier.  Dadier encourages Miller to lead the class in the right direction.  After Dadier subdues a student who attacks Miss Hammond, the class gives Dadier the silent treatment and are even more uncooperative. Dadier and Edwards are mugged by a gang that includes West.\n\nReluctant to quit, Dadier seeks advice from his former teacher, Professor Kraal, the principal of an academically superior school with disciplined students. Kraal offers Dadier a job, but he declines. After chastising his class for calling each other racially divisive names, Dadier is himself falsely accused by Mr. Warneke of using racial epithets in the classroom. West encounters Dadier during his gang's robbery of a newspaper truck. West tells Dadier his classroom is on the streets and to leave him alone. Several students, led by West, assault Edwards in his classroom and destroy his music record collection.\n\nDadier's wife, Anne, who is pregnant, begins receiving anonymous letters and phone calls telling her Dadier and Miss Hammond are having an affair. Dadier discovers Miller can play piano and sing, and wonders why Miller can show such talent but also be so rebellious. Dadier shows his class an animated film about \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\" which sparks discussion about moral choices. Anne goes into premature labor caused by the stress of the phone calls about Dadier's alleged affair. When a neighbor shows Dadier the anonymous letters, he angrily decides to quit. Mr. Murdock encourages him to stay telling Dadier he is making progress and has inspired him too. Anne apologizes for doubting Dadier's loyalty in their marriage and says she was wrong for telling him to quit. Their premature baby boy, though weak, eventually thrives.\n\nWhen Dadier observes West openly copying from another student, he demands that West bring his paper to the front to have it docked five points. West rebuffs his repeated request, but Dadier is unrelenting.  The conflict quickly escalates, and West pulls out a switchblade.  Dadier does not back down.  Miller stops another of the gang from jumping Dadier from behind.  The rest of West's gang fails to assist.\n\nDadier accuses West of the false allegations made to both Mr. Warneke and Anne. Dadier subdues West, and the other students join in to subdue classmate Belazi, who has picked up the knife to escape. Miller then leads the class in helping Dadier take West and Belazi to the principal's office. In the final scene, Miller and Dadier ask if the other is quitting at the end of the school year. Miller said no, because the two of them had a deal that neither would quit if the other stayed, and Dadier's expression makes clear he has no intention of breaking the agreement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as Richard Dadier\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Gregory Miller\n* [[Vic Morrow]] as Artie West\n* [[Anne Francis]] as Anne Dadier\n* [[Louis Calhern]] as Jim Murdock\n* [[Margaret Hayes]] as Lois Hammond\n* [[John Hoyt]] as Mr. Warneke\n* [[Richard Kiley]] as Joshua Edwards\n* [[Emile Meyer]] as Mr. Halloran\n* [[Warner Anderson]] as Dr. Bradley\n* [[Basil Ruysdael]] as Professor A.
