Fox]] and [[James Woods]]. [[Stephen Lang]], [[Annabella Sciorra]], [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Delroy Lindo]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Mos Def]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Michael Badalucco]], [[Lewis Black]], and [[Penny Marshall]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \n\n[[Serial killer]], the \"Party Crasher\" notifies the police before he kills another person at a night club, daring them to stop him. Converging on the club, the officers, including cynical [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant John Moss, can't stop the murder of a local drug dealer. The perp flees in the chaos, and Moss narrowly misses catching him. As Moss's injuries are tended, he mouths off on camera.\n\nNick Lang is an entitled [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movie star, known as \"Smoking\" Joe Gunn, the [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones-like]] title character in a series of highly popular [[action film]]s. Vying for the lead in the cop drama ''Blood on the Asphalt'', he vows to \"prepare\" for the role by posing as a police officer with the [[NYPD]]. \n\nImpressed by Moss's outburst on television, Nick pulls strings with [[New York City|NYC]] Mayor [[David Dinkins]] to be assigned as Moss's new partner. Moss is forced to comply by his captain, a Nick Lang fan. Doing so, he is off the Party Crasher case at risk of being fired if he disobeys.\n\nMoss defies orders, continuing the investigation and repeatedly trying to ditch Nick, who annoys him with constant questions and attempts to mimic him. Wanting to understand what it's like to be a cop, Moss reminds him this is not a movie. \n\nMeanwhile, Moss is also trying to juggle a new romance with single mother Susan. Divorced, he has difficulty opening up, so Nick offers him advice. Moss is embarrassed even further when Nick, as Ray Casanov, appears at a pizza parlor and is a hit.\n\nMoss tries to have a Nick-free day by handcuffing him to his bed with a note, ordering him to stay. When Susan invites Nick by phone to eat out, he somehow unshackles himself. Riding the subway Nick mistakenly believes Susan is infatuated with him. He later stands up to a group of delinquent juveniles, as a cop. Moss, goes to the subway station and arrests the perps. \n\nAs Moss has decided that he no longer cares about the consequences, increasingly frustrated with Nick\u2019s presence in his life, he takes Nick to a dark building to catch a perp. He orders him to stay put and gives him a real gun in case. Nick, however, enters the building and shoots a man who he believes is a criminal chasing Moss. Apparently only a bystander, Nick is terrified. Moss agrees to cover up the act, and urges him to leave town immediately. \n\nFeeling guilty, Nick returns to the police station to confess, only to see that the \"dead man\" is actually a cop, laughing at him with everyone. Nick confronts Moss, who admits he choreographed the stunt to get him out of town, stating that Nick's panic, self-doubt, guilt, and anger are all part of being a \"real\" cop. Enraged with Moss, Nick punches him and furiously leaves.\n\nNick later stumbles into a confrontation between Moss and The Party Crasher, during which he saves Moss's life. The Party Crasher is wounded, taken to an ambulance, but he kills several people and escapes. Nick briefly captures him, radioing their location before he is knocked out. Susan visits Moss, stating that being a cop will never allow them to have a secure relationship, so she breaks up with him. \n\nMoss is then visited by Nick, who predicts that The Party Crasher will follow typical revenge plot and will seek out Moss's loved ones in the third act of their story together. Nick is right, and Susan is abducted. Moss and Nick confront him on the billboard advertising Nick's latest movie ''Smoking Gunn II'', and a brawl ensues. Nick saves Susan and Moss from being shot, but is himself shot in the chest. Moss pushes the Party Crasher off to his death, and tries to comfort Nick as he is taken to the hospital.\n\nMonths later, Nick has recovered and filmed ''The Good, the Badge and the Ugly''. Moss, now married to Susan, attends the movie's premiere with the rest of the department as honored guests. He is annoyed to discover that Nick's best lines in the film are his, while he gets no credit.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael J.
