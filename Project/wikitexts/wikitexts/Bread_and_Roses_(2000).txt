The plot deals with the struggle of poorly paid janitorial workers in [[Los Angeles]] and their fight for better working conditions and the right to [[Industrial unionism|unionize]]. It is based on the \"[[Justice for Janitors]]\" campaign of the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927184203/http://student.ccbcmd.edu/~wbarry/laborinmovies/Bread%20and%20Roses%20Foreword.doc '' Bread and Roses Foreword''], SEIU President Andrew L. Stern</ref>\n\nThe film is critical of inequalities in the United States. [[Health insurance]] in particular is highlighted and it is also stated in the film that the pay of cleaners and other low paying jobs has declined in recent years.\n\nThe film's name, \"[[Bread and Roses]]\", derives from the [[Lawrence textile strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]]. Though the phrase comes from a 1911 poem by [[James Oppenheim]] (which was, in turn, based on a speech given by [[Rose Schneiderman]]), it is commonly associated with the Lawrence strike, which united dozens of immigrant communities, led to a large extent by women, under the leadership of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Pilar Padilla]] as Maya\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Sam Shapiro\n* [[Elpidia Carrillo]] as Rosa\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Bert\n* Monica Rivas as Simona\n* Frank Davila as Luis\n* [[Lillian Hurst]] as Anna\n* Mayron Payes as Ben\n* Maria Orellana as Berta\n* Elena Antonenko as Maria\n* Olga Gorelik as Olga\n* [[George Lopez]] as Perez\n}}\n\n;Uncredited party guests\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tim Roth]]\n* [[Ron Perlman]]\n* [[William Atherton]]\n* [[Vanessa Angel (English actress)|Vanessa Angel]]\n* [[Benicio del Toro]]\n* [[Oded Fehr]]\n* [[Chris Penn]]\n* [[Robin Tunney]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n<!--linked from infobox-->\nThe following companies produced the film:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/bread-and-roses-v201717 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723125515/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/bread-and-roses-v201717 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=Bred and Roses |work=[[Allrovi]] |accessdate=5 July 2011 }}</ref>\n*British Screen\n*[[BSkyB]]\n*Cineart\n*Filmcooperative Z\u00fcrich\n*Parallax Pictures\n*BiM Distribution\n*Alta Films\n*[[BAC Films]]\n*Road Movies Filmproduktion\n*Tornasol Films\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] (Golden Palm) at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5155/year/2000.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bread and Roses |accessdate=2009-10-11 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308101709/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5155/year/2000.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}</ref> and won the Jury Award at the [[Temecula Valley International Film Festival]] in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, it was nominated for the Artios award of the [[Casting Society of America]], for the [[British Independent Film Awards]] for Best British Independent Film, Best Director and Best Screenplay, and won the Phoenix Prize at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]].\n\nIn 2002, it was nominated for four [[ALMA Awards]], of which it won the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Elpidia Carrillo) and also won the [[Imagen Award]] for Best Theatrical Feature Film of the [[Imagen Foundation Awards]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45b/073.html The Bread-and-Roses-strike]\n* {{IMDb title|0212826}}\n* {{mojo title|breadandroses}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bread_and_roses}}\n* {{Screenonline title|557094}}\n\n{{Ken Loach}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bread And Roses (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 drama films]]\n[[Category:African-American drama films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Fenton]]\n[[Category:Films about the labor movement]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ken Loach]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Diego]]\n[[Category:German drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Spanish films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Swiss drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Swiss films]]\n[[Category:German independent films]]\n[[Category:Spanish independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
