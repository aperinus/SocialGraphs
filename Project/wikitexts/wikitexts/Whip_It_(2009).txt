''Whip It'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 26, 2010 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nBliss Cavendar is a teenager in the small town of Bodeen, [[Texas]]. She has lost interest in the beauty pageants her mother, former beauty queen Brooke, pressures her to win.\n\nWhile shopping in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] with her mother, Bliss is intrigued by three [[roller derby]] team members she encounters. She and her friend Pash attend a roller derby bout where they see the \"Holy Rollers\" defeat the \"Hurl Scouts\". Bliss lies about her age and tries out for the Hurl Scouts, who give her the [[derby name]] \"Babe Ruthless,\" and she becomes friendly with teammates \"Maggie Mayhem\", \"Bloody Holly\" and Smashley Simpson. The Hurl Scouts, while enthusiastic and close knit, rarely win, but chant, \"We're number two!\" after losing a match, to the frustration of their coach, Razor.\n\n\"Iron Maven\" of the Holy Rollers resents Bliss's talent and youth. Bliss soon realizes she needs to be merciless in roller derby, which also changes other aspects of her life. She stands up to a bully at school and starts dating a lanky musician named Oliver, to whom she loses her virginity before he leaves on a tour, taking a T-shirt Bliss gave him to remember her by, in exchange for his jacket.\n\nThe Hurl Scouts continue to lose. Razor convinces them to change their ways after paying their rivals to use one of his plays against them, showing them how much better they could be. The team begins rising in the ranks, soon heading for a championship match against the Holy Rollers.\n\nBliss's parents discover her involvement in roller derby when Pash is arrested at the arena for underage drinking. Pash is furious with Bliss for leaving her alone, which led to her arrest. When Bliss's parents demand she give up roller derby, she runs away from home and stays with Maggie, discovering she has a young son. Maggie gives Bliss perspective on the difficulties of being a parent.\n\nBliss sees a picture of Oliver on social media with another girl, who is wearing her t-shirt. Heartbroken, she goes home to her mother, who comforts her. Bliss gives up roller derby and resumes her pageant career so as not to hurt her family or friends any further, and reconciles with Pash.\n\nOn the day of the pageant, which is the same day as the roller derby championship, Bliss's father convinces his wife to let Bliss abandon the pageant and go join the Hurl Scouts in their championship game.\n\nThe Hurl Scouts narrowly lose the championship match to the Holy Rollers, but they still happily come together and chant, \"We're number two!\" Afterward, she is approached by Oliver, who denies cheating on Bliss, but she dumps him anyway for never calling her while he was away. She and Iron Maven come to a mutual respect. Bliss's mother is still not entirely supportive of roller derby, but accepts that Bliss now knows what makes her happy and is charting her own course in life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} as Bliss Cavendar (Babe Ruthless)\n* [[Alia Shawkat]] as Pash\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Brooke Cavendar\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Earl Cavendar\n* [[Carlo Alban]] as Dwayne (Birdman)\n* [[Landon Pigg]] as Oliver\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Maggie Mayhem\n* [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] as Bloody Holly\n* [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] as Rosa Sparks\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Smashley Simpson\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Razor\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Iron Maven\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as Eva Destruction\n* [[Har Mar Superstar]] as Fight Attendants Coach\n\n==Production==\n\n===Production and filming===\nScreenwriter [[Shauna Cross]] [[film adaptation|adapted]] her 2007 [[young adult fiction|young adult novel]] ''[[Derby Girl]]'' for the screen and pitched the script to different production companies while simultaneously pitching its source material to various publishers.
