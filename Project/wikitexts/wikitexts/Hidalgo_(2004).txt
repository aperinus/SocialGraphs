It recounts Hopkins' racing his horse in Arabia in 1891 against [[Bedouin]]s riding pure-blooded [[Arabian horse]]s. The movie was written by [[John Fusco]] and directed by [[Joe Johnston]]. It stars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Zuleikha Robinson]], and [[Omar Sharif]].\n\n''Hidalgo'' was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] on  March 5, 2004. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and was a [[box office disappointment]], grossing $108 million against a budget of $100 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1890, Frank T. Hopkins and his mustang, Hidalgo, are part of [[Buffalo Bill]]'s [[Wild West]] show, advertised as \"the world's greatest endurance horse and rider.\" A famous long-distance racer, cowboy, and dispatch rider for the United States government, Hopkins is plagued by guilt for having carried a message to the [[7th Cavalry Regiment]] authorizing the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of [[Lakota Sioux]]. He translates a futile request from another performer, Chief Eagle Horn, for Bill to help his nation\u2019s mustangs that have been rounded up by the government to be eradicated.\n\nWealthy [[Sheikh]] Riyadh sends his attach\u00e9 Aziz, accompanied by Rau Rasmussen, to challenge Hopkins and Hidalgo to enter the \"Ocean of Fire\": an annual 3,000-mile race across the [[Najd]] desert region for a $100,000 prize. The Sheikh is custodian of the ''[[al Khamsa|al-Khamsa]]'' line, considered the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred [[Arabian horse]]s and [[Bedouin]] or [[Arab]] riders. Hopkins\u2019 fellow performers raise his entrance fee, and he encounters unscrupulous English horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport. He meets Sheikh Riyadh, an admirer of the Wild West, who has promised his daughter Jazira as the fifth wife to the prince riding the Sheikh's horse Al-Hattal, should he win.\n \nThe race begins, and Hopkins and Hidalgo face grueling conditions and contempt for an \"[[infidel]]\" riding an \"impure\" horse, and survive sabotage and a sandstorm. Determined to live her own life, Jazira advises Hopkins on surviving in the desert, but they are discovered together in his tent. The Sheikh prepares to have Hopkins [[gelding|gelded]] as punishment, but his outcast nephew Katib raids the camp, seeking control of the al-Khamsa line. The prince flees on Al-Hattal, but Aziz steals the Sheikh\u2019s family journal of horse breeding for Katib, who kidnaps Jazira and demands Al-Hattal as ransom.\n\nHopkins rescues Jazira, who recovers the journal. Journeying back to camp, Hopkins reveals that his mother was Lakota Sioux, deepening his guilt over his role at Wounded Knee. Jazira compares his relationship to his heritage with her desire to avoid wearing the [[sartorial hijab|veil]], urging him not to \"go through life hiding what God made you.\" Davenport bribes Hopkins to drop out of the race, but he declines her offer and her advances toward him. Unbeknownst to him, Davenport is in league with Katib; they plan to kill Hidalgo and steal Al-Hattal, allowing her mare to win the race and breed with the Sheikh\u2019s horse.\n\nEnduring a swarm of locusts, Hopkins remembers Jazira\u2019s advice and he and Hidalgo resort to eating them. Although it is forbidden to help other riders, he saves his opponent Sakr from quicksand. Hopkins is ambushed by Katib and falls into a trap, severely injuring Hidalgo, and is rescued by Sakr. They fight off Katib's men but Sakr is shot, and Hopkins kills Katib in one of his own traps. Hidalgo collapses, and Hopkins considers shooting him in mercy, but a vision of Lakota elders and his mother appears to him as he chants a prayer to ''[[Wakan Tanka]].''\n\nThe prince arrives and taunts Hopkins that the end of the race is in sight, and Hidalgo suddenly struggles upright. Riding bareback, Hopkins comes from behind to surpass Davenport's mare and the prince, winning the race. He befriends the Sheikh, giving him his [[Colt Single Action Army|revolver]], and bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, who calls him by his Lakota name, ''Blue Child.'' Returning to the United States, Frank uses his winnings to buy the mustangs from the government, releasing them into the wild and freeing Hidalgo to join them. An epilogue reveals that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo's descendants live free in the wilderness of Oklahoma.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Frank Hopkins]], a noted long-distance rider.\n* [[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Jazira, determined daughter of the Sheikh.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sheikh Riyadh, an insightful leader.

Try this on for size \u2013 Hopkins claimed to be the grandson of [[Geronimo]] who, he confided, was really a Sioux and not an [[Apache]] at all.  Hopkins, according to himself and wife, was very popular with the Indians because he was half Sioux himself, his mother being a lady called Nah-Kwa \u2013 her more formal name was Valley Naw-Kwa or \"Valley of Silence\" \u2013 hardly fitting for a woman who had such illustrious relatives. Hopkins spoke \"the Indian language\" so he was a natural interpreter for the Army \u2013 although his name does not appear on any treaty documents where the interpreters are listed or in any correspondence in government files wherein interpreters were needed. \n}}</ref>\n\nBut, [[Nakota]] filmmaker [[Angelique Midthunder]] said during the controversy that \"the story of the half Indian who took his pinto mustang across the sea to race in the big desert has been told to children of the northern plains tribes for generations.\"<ref name=\"hopkins\">[http://www.frankhopkins.com/articles.html \"Frank Hopkins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612194625/http://www.frankhopkins.com/articles.html |date=June 12, 2007 }}, Official Website</ref> Lakota elder Sonny Richards writes, \"Kaiyuzeya Sunkanyanke (Frank Hopkins) was a South Dakota native and Lakota half-breed.\"<ref name=\"hopkins\"/>\n\nBased on Hopkins' account of his mixed-race ancestry, the movie production employed Lakota historians, medicine men, and tribal leaders as consultants to advise during every scene that represented their culture. Many of the Ghost Dancers who reenact the sacred ceremony of 1890 in ''Hidalgo'' had participated in the film ''[[Thunderheart]]'' (1992) and the mini-series ''[[Dreamkeeper]]'', both written by Fusco. The screenwriter was adopted as an honorary relative of the Oglala Nation in a ''Hunkyapi'' ceremony (Making of Relatives) on September 3, 1989, on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nBecause the Disney Corporation marketed the movie as a true story, some historians criticized the film both because of the legendary status of Hopkins' claims and for the film's divergence from his accounts.<ref name=hoax>[http://www.thelongridersguild.com/hopkins.htm \"The Frank Hopkins Hoax\"], The Longriders Guild</ref> They contend that many of the events, especially the featured race, never took place.<ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/3881.html Anthony B. Toth, \"Disney's 'Hidalgo': A New Hollywood Low\"], History News Network, February 28, 2004</ref> Historians of distance riding said that most of Hopkins' claims as depicted in the film, including the race, have been '[[tall tale]]s' or [[hoax]]es.<ref name=basha>[http://www.thelongridersguild.com/myth.pdf Basha O'Reilly, \"Hidalgo \u2013 from myth to movie\"], The Longriders Guild</ref>\n\nThe film says that descendants of the horse Hidalgo, for which the movie was named, live among the Gilbert Jones herd of [[Spanish Mustangs]] on [[Blackjack Mountain (Oklahoma)|Blackjack Mountain]] in [[Oklahoma]]. By Hopkins' original account, he decided to leave his horse in Arabia after the race.<ref name=basha/>\n\nIn 2006, [[John Fusco]], the screenwriter of ''Hidalgo'', responded to criticism about the historical basis of the film. He had done research on Hopkins for years. He said that he used parts of Hopkins' 1891 desert memoirs (unpublished during the rider's lifetime) and \"heightened the 'Based On' story to create an entertaining theatrical film.\"  He held that the story of the man and his horse is true. Fusco offered quotes from surviving friends of Hopkins, notably former distance riders Walt and Edith Pyle, and Lt Col William Zimmerman, along with information found in horse history texts, as verification.<ref name=basha/>\n\nAccording to the Longriders Guild, the Saudi Arabian Government say officially that there has never been an \"Ocean of Fire\" race. Hopkins never named the event; he referred to it in his writings as an annual ceremonial ride in the region.<ref name=basha/>  According to the Arab historian Dr. Awad al-Badi, such a lengthy race was impossible. He said,\n\n<blockquote>There is no record or reference to Hopkins with or without his mustangs ever having set foot on Arabian soil. The idea of a historic long-distance Arab horse race is pure nonsense and flies against all reason. Such an event in Arabia any time in the past is impossible simply from a technical, logistical, cultural and geopolitical point of view. It has never been part of our rich traditions and equestrian heritage.<ref name=harrigan>[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=26134&d=13&m=5& Peter Harrigan, \"Hidalgo: A Film or Flimflam?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111142157/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7 |date=2011-11-11 }}, ''Arab News,'' 13 May 2003, accessed 2010-12-28</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Horses==\nSeveral [[American Paint Horse|American Paint horses]] were used to portray Hidalgo. The actor [[Viggo Mortensen]] later bought RH Tecontender, one of the horses used in the film. The screenwriter John Fusco bought Oscar, the main stunt horse, and retired him at Red Road Farm, his American Indian horse conservancy. Another one was bought by a ranch near Steamboat, Colorado.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe movie received mixed reviews from mainstream critics.
