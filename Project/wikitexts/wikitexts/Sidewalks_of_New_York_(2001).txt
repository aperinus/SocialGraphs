The plot follows eight cycles in the lives of six [[Manhattan]] residents whose inter-connections form a circle that places each of them less than the proverbial [[six degrees of separation]] from the others.\n\n==Plot ==\nThe circle begins with Tommy Reilly, a onetime wannabe writer who became the [[television producer|producer]] of a weekly [[television]] entertainment news show by design rather than choice, and has stayed with it for the money rather than any professional satisfaction. Dumped by his live-in girlfriend without warning, he temporarily moves in with colleague Carpo, an aging [[Lothario]] ready to offer unlimited &mdash; and sometimes useless &mdash; romantic advice.\n\nAt a video store, Tommy meets grammar school teacher Maria Tedesko. The two flirt, meet for coffee and begin to date. Maria, recently divorced, finds it difficult to commit to a new relationship and stops taking Tommy's calls. When she discovers she's pregnant, she attempts to reconnect with him, but at the last moment opts to lie and tell him she's leaving town and chooses to raise the child on her own.\n\nMaria's ex-husband, who longs to reconcile with her, is Benjamin Bazler, an apartment house doorman and aspiring songwriter whose obsession is 1960s/1970s [[rock music]]. He shares his dream of becoming a full-time musician with Iowa transplant Ashley, an [[New York University|NYU]] student working as a coffee shop waitress to support herself.\n\nAshley is involved in an affair with considerably older married dentist Griffin Ritso. Although he professes to love his mistress, the once divorced Griffin shies away from leaving his wife Annie Matthews for fear of being a two-time loser at matrimony. Eventually, Griffin's inability to commit to their relationship causes Ashley to dump him and reject his advances to get her back as she becomes involved in a relationship with Benjamin.\n\n[[Real estate broker]] Annie is unhappy with her marriage but too moral to consider having an affair. She finds herself confiding in and flirting with one of her house-hunting clients &mdash; Tommy Reilly. Thus the circle is complete. She finally leaves Griffin.\n\nThe narrative segments are intermingled with [[documentary film|documentary]]-like interviews in which of the characters address the camera with their thoughts about sex, love, and relationships.\n\n==Production notes==\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2001. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] three days later, [[Paramount Vantage|Paramount Classics]] withheld its release until late November. Although the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] looms behind Tommy during his interviews, the image of the twin towers in the original promotional poster was later deleted.\n\nIn an episode of the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] series ''[[Anatomy of a Scene]]'' that focused on the film, Burns revealed he shot the film in only seventeen days, working with a budget of $1 million. Many of the locations used were within the same neighborhood in order to facilitate a quick move from one to the other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Burns]] as Tommy Reilly\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Maria Tedesko\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Benjamin Bazler\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Ashley\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Griffin Ritso\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Annie Matthews\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Carpo\n\n==Release==\nThe film played on 224 screens and grossed $2,402,459 in the United States.  The international box office accounted for another $1.1 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | title= Sidewalks of New York (2001) | url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sidewalksofnewyork.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=IMDB |access-date = 2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 56% based of 94 reviews with an average rating of 5.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Though well-acted, Sidewalks of New York generally comes off as a second-rate Woody Allen film.

Scott]] said, \"Though it fails to be very interesting, ''Sidewalks of New York'', like the people who populate Mr. Burns's New York, is impossible to dislike. If it's not especially funny, it is appealingly good-humored, and the actors perform well within the limitations of the script ... [Burns] deserves credit for avoiding the sudsy happily-ever-after [[clich\u00e9]]s that deform so many contemporary romantic comedies. The view of love that emerges from ''Sidewalks'', while it is not particularly deep or insightful, is refreshingly hard-headed without being altogether cynical.\"<ref>{{cite news |first= A.

This may be the way very young adults think, but as a presentation of grown-ups, ''Sidewalks of New York'' is just weird. It's also, scene by scene, well acted and well written. Burns writes clever dialogue, and he knows how to work with actors.\"<ref>{{cite news |first= Mick|last=LaSalle |authorlink=Mick LaSalle|url= https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/N-Y-tale-is-warmed-over-Woody-Sidewalks-a-2853205.php |title=N.Y. tale is warmed-over Woody / 'Sidewalks' a trite Manhattan sex story |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 21, 2001 |access-date=April 2, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[USA Today]]'', Mike Clark rated the film two out of a possible four stars and commented, \"Any goodwill the performers build up is quickly shot down by the incessant interviews, which restate the obvious when they're not showing how self-delusional some of these characters are. Those who teach public speaking sometimes advocate telling your audience what you're going to tell them, then actually telling them, then telling them what you've told them.
