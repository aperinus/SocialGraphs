The film is loosely based on two works by [[Luigi Pirandello]]. It was screened in the main competition section of the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"InComp\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/07/venice-film-festival-lineup-2015-full-list-1201486791/|title=Venice Film Festival: Lido Lineup Builds Awards Season Buzz \u2013 Full List |accessdate=29 July 2015 |work=Deadline}}</ref><ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/venice-fest-reveals-robust-lineup-featuring-hollywood-stars-and-international-auteurs-1201551960/|title=Venice Fest Reveals Robust Lineup Featuring Hollywood Stars and International Auteurs |accessdate=29 July 2015 |work=Variety}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA Sicilian mother's son dies unexpectedly, just before his girlfriend comes to visit for the Easter holiday. The grief-stricken mother cannot bring herself to tell the young woman, and the film is about their interaction over a few days.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:L'attesa Binoche Laage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Juliette Binoche]], [[Lou de La\u00e2ge]] and Festival director Alberto Barbera at the film [[premi\u00e8re]] during the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival]] in 2015]]\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Anna\n* [[Lou de La\u00e2ge]] as Jeanne\n* [[Giorgio Colangeli]] as Pietro \n* [[Domenico Diele]] as Giorgio\n* [[Giovanni Anzaldo]] as Giuseppe\n* [[Antonio Folletto]] as Paolo\n* [[Corinna Locastro]] as Rosa\n\n==Production==\nThe film was inspired by a story [[Piero Messina]] heard from a friend, about a father who had lost his son, and when the father refused to talk about it, people around him began to act as if it had never happened. While writing the screenplay, Messina was recommended two works by [[Luigi Pirandello]], the tragedy ''The Life I Gave You'' (''La vita che ti diedi'') and the short story \"La camera in attesa\", and used those to tie the story together. Production was led by Indigo Film in collaboration with Barbary Films and [[Path\u00e9]]. [[Juliette Binoche]] was cast early on, while [[Lou de La\u00e2ge]] was found late in the casting process through an audition.<ref>{{Cite web|last=De Marco|first=Camillo|date=7 September 2015|url=http://www.cineuropa.org/it.aspx?t=interview&l=en&did=298242|title=Piero Messina \u2022 Director|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nPeter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote:\n<blockquote>A clear disciple of Italian master [[Paolo Sorrentino]], the film-school-trained Messina served as assistant director on ''[[The Great Beauty]]'', and he adopts many of his mentor's stylistic predilections on his first feature.<ref name=\"Debruge\">{{Cite web|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=5 September 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/the-wait-review-juliette-binoche-venice-film-festival-1201581339/|title=Venice Film Review: ''The Wait''|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\nDebruge continued:\n<blockquote>Watching ''The Wait'', there can be little doubt that this first-time helmer has the potential to become one of Italy's most prominent new voices (the signs were there as early as his Cannes-selected 2011 student film, ''Terra'', another abstractly stylized exercise in psychological identification featuring Colangeli). From Sorrentino, Messina has further developed his ability to deliver a stunning sensory experience, though the treatment feels inadequate for such lean material. If anything, his aesthetic choices are too impressive, calling attention to themselves, rather than discreetly enabling the appropriate emotional reaction.<ref name=\"Debruge\" /></blockquote>Mick LaSalle (''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'') praised the 2 leads, saying of Juliette Binoche, \"If you want to see great acting \u2014 or more to the point, if you want to see an illustration of the human soul\u2019s complexity \u2014 watch Juliette Binoche in this film\" and adding of Lou de [[Lou de La\u00e2ge|La\u00e2ge]], she \"has the poise, intelligence and precision to match Binoche.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Binoche-gives-a-great-performance-in-7391322.php|title = Binoche gives a great performance in 'L'Attesa'|website = SFGate|access-date =10 June 2016}}</ref>  [[A.
