The film stars [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Judith Anderson]], [[Jack Carson]] and [[Madeleine Sherwood]].\n\nWell-received by both critics and audiences, ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' was MGM's most successful release of 1958, and became [[1958 in film|the third highest-grossing film of that year]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:ActTaylorCatThinRoof.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Paul Newman (Brick) and Elizabeth Taylor (Maggie) in an early scene from the film]]\n[[File:Cat on a Hot Tin Roof11.jpg|thumb|right|265px|[[Madeleine Sherwood]] and [[Jack Carson]]  ]]\nLate one night, a drunken Brick Pollitt ([[Paul Newman]]) is out trying to recapture his glory days of high school sports by leaping hurdles on a track field, dreaming about his moments as a youthful athlete. Unexpectedly, he falls and breaks his ankle, leaving him dependent on a crutch. Brick, along with his wife, Maggie \"the Cat\" ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]), are seen the next day visiting his family's estate in eastern [[Mississippi]], there to celebrate Big Daddy's ([[Burl Ives]]) 65th birthday.\n\nDepressed, Brick has spent the last few years drinking, while resisting the affections of his wife, who taunts him about the inheritance of Big Daddy's wealth. This has resulted in an obviously tempestuous marriage\u2014there are speculations as to why Maggie does not yet have a child while Brick's brother Gooper ([[Jack Carson]]) and his wife Mae ([[Madeleine Sherwood]]) have five children.\n\nBig Daddy and Big Mama ([[Judith Anderson]]) arrive home from the hospital via their private airplane and are greeted by Gooper and his wife\u2014and all their kids\u2014along with Maggie. Annoyed by the rehearsed welcoming display his grandchildren put on for him, Big Daddy ignores them in favour of driving home with Maggie. The news is that Big Daddy is not dying from [[cancer]]. However, the doctor later meets privately with first Gooper and then Brick where he divulges that it is a deception. Big Daddy has inoperable cancer and will likely be dead within a year, and the truth is being kept from him. Brick later reveals the truth about Big Daddy's health to Maggie and she is heartbroken. Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his father\u2014for both selfish and unselfish reasons, but Brick stubbornly refuses.\n\n[[File:Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) Trailer.ogg|thumb|265px|Original theatrical trailer]]\nAs the party winds down for the night, Big Daddy meets with Brick in his room and reveals that he is fed up with his alcoholic son's behavior, demanding to know why he is so stubborn. At one point Maggie joins them and reveals what happened a few years ago on the night Brick's best friend and football teammate Skipper died by [[suicide]]. Maggie was jealous of Skipper because he had more of Brick's time, and says that Skip was lost without Brick at his side. She decided to ruin their relationship \"by any means necessary\", intending to seduce Skipper and use this information to make her husband question Skipper's loyalty. However, Maggie ran away without completing the plan. Brick had blamed Maggie for Skipper's death, but actually blames himself for not helping Skipper when he repeatedly phoned Brick in a hysterical state.\n\nAfter an argument, Brick lets it slip that Big Daddy will die from cancer and that this birthday will be his last. Shaken, Big Daddy retreats to the basement. Meanwhile, Gooper, who is a lawyer, and his wife argue with Big Mama about the family's cotton business and Big Daddy's will. Brick descends into the basement, a labyrinth of antiques and family possessions hidden away. He and Big Daddy confront each other before a large cut-out of Brick in his glory days as an athlete, and ultimately reach a reconciliation of sorts.\n\nThe rest of the family begins to crumble under pressure, with Big Mama stepping up as a strong figure. Maggie says that she would like to give Big Daddy her birthday present: the announcement of her being pregnant. After the jealous Mae calls Maggie a liar, Big Daddy and Brick defend her, even though Brick knows the statement is untrue and Big Daddy thinks the statement may be untrue. Maggie and Brick reconcile, and the two kiss, with the implication that they will possibly make Maggie's \"lie\" become \"truth\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Cat on a Hot Tin Roof13.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Taylor received her second [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Oscar]] nomination for the film.]]\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Margaret \"Maggie The Cat\" Pollitt\n* [[Paul Newman]] as \"Brick\" Pollitt\n* [[Burl Ives]] as Harvey \"Big Daddy\" Pollitt\n* [[Judith Anderson]] as Ida \"Big Mama\" Pollitt\n* [[Jack Carson]] as Cooper \"Gooper\" Pollitt\n* [[Madeleine Sherwood]] as Mae Flynn \"Sister Woman\" Pollitt\n* [[Larry Gates]] as Dr. Baugh\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as Deacon Davis\n\n==Production notes==\nThe original stage production of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] March 24, 1955, with Ives and Sherwood in the roles they subsequently played in the film. [[Ben Gazzara]] played Brick in the stage production and rejected the film role.

On March 21, she canceled plans to fly with her husband [[Mike Todd]] to [[New York City|New York]], where he was to be honored the following day by the [[New York Friars' Club]].  The plane crashed, and all passengers, including Todd, were killed.  Beset with grief, Taylor remained off the film until April 14, 1958, at which time she returned to the set in a much thinner and weaker condition.<ref>Parish, p. 329</ref>\n\n==Music and soundtrack==\nThe music score, \"Love Theme from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" was composed by Charles Wolcott in 1958. He was an accomplished music composer, having worked for Paul Whiteman, Benny Goodman, Rudy Vallee and George Burns and Gracie Allen. From 1937 to 1944, he worked at Walt Disney Studios. In 1950, he transferred to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios where he became the general music director and composed the theme for ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''. The remaining songs on the soundtrack are composed by a variety of artists such as Andre Previn, Daniel Decatur Emmett and Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\n===Song list===\n* \"Lost in a Summer Night\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] and Milton Raskin\n* \"Nice Layout\" by Andr\u00e9 Previn\n* \"Love Theme from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" by [[Charles Wolcott]]\n* \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" by [[Daniel Decatur Emmett]], played by the children on various instruments\n* \"[[Skidamarink|Skina Marinka]]\", adapted by Marguerite Lamkin, sung by the children\n* \"[[I'll Be a Sunbeam]]\" by E.O.

Paul Newman, the film's star, had also stated his disappointment with the adaptation. The [[Hays Code]] limited Brick's portrayal of sexual desire for Skipper, and diminished the original play's critique of homophobia and sexism. Williams so disliked the toned-down film adaptation of his play that he told people waiting in line to see the movie, \"This movie will set the industry back 50 years. Go home!\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Michael|title=Cat on a Hot Tin Roof: Tennessee Williams's southern discomfort|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/30/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof|website=theguardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite this, the film was highly acclaimed by critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that although \"Mr. Williams' original stage play has been altered considerably, especially in offering explanation of why the son is as he is,\" he still found the film \"a ferocious and fascinating show,\" and deemed Newman's performance \"an ingratiating picture of a tortured and tested young man\" and Taylor \"terrific.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=September 19, 1958 |title=The Fur Flies in 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=24 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the picture \"a powerful, well-seasoned film produced within the bounds of good, if 'adults only,' taste ... Newman again proves to be one of the finest actors in films, playing cynical underacting against highly developed action.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 13, 1958 |title=Cat on a Hot Tin Roof |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6}}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' declared it \"an intense adult drama, superbly acted by a formidable cast.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 16, 1958 |title='Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' with Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=130}}</ref> [[Richard L.

Paul Newman does his finest work in the rich role of Brick, catching that remarkable fact of film acting\u2014the illusion of the first time.

[[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote of the characters that \"although it is interesting for a while to listen to them letting off emotional steam, their caterwauling (boosted Lord knows how many decibels by stereophonic sound) eventually becomes severely monotonous.\" McCarten also lamented that the filmmakers were \"unable to indicate more than fleetingly the real problem of the hero\u2014homosexuality, which is, of course, a taboo subject in American movies.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCarten |first=John |date=September 27, 1958 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=162}}</ref> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' shared that regret, writing, \"Censorship difficulties admittedly make it impossible to show homosexuality as the root of Brick's problem, but Brooks does not appear to have the skill to make convincing the motives he has substituted. Most of Williams' exhilarating dialogue has been left out or emasculated, and the screenplay fails to harmonise the revised characterisation of Brick with the author's original conception.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 1958 |title=Cat on a Hot Tin Roof |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=25 |issue=298 |page=139}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations. However the film did not win any awards. [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] went to ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (another [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] production).
