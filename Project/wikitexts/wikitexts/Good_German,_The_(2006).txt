A [[film adaptation]] of [[Joseph Kanon]]'s  2001 novel of the same name,  it was directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]], and stars [[George Clooney]], [[Cate Blanchett]], and [[Tobey Maguire]]. Set in [[Berlin]] following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory over the [[Nazis]], it begins as a murder mystery but weaves in elements involving the American postwar employment of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[aerospace engineering|rocket scientists]] in [[Operation Paperclip]].\n\nThe film was shot in black-and-white and is designed to imitate the appearance of [[film noir]] from the 1940s, although it also includes material \u2013 such as sex scenes and swearing \u2013 that would have been prohibited by the [[Hays Code|Production Code]]. Its [[movie poster|poster]] is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the poster for the classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942, also a [[Warner Bros.]] film), as is the closing scene at an airport. The DVD release presents the film in the 1.33:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] which declined in use from [[List of film formats#Film formats|about 1953]], though the theatrical release, and other DVD Releases, used the slightly more modern but still unusual 1.66:1 ratio.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews and grossed $5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $32 million.\n\n==Plot==\nJacob \"Jake\" Geismer, an American [[war correspondent]] for ''[[The New Republic]]'', returns to [[Berlin]] during the [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam negotiations]] between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] after [[Victory in Europe Day|World War II was over in Europe]] (May 1945) but before [[Victory over Japan Day|hostilities ended in Asia]] (August 1945). Jacob witnesses his murdered driver, a [[Black market|black-market]]eering American soldier named Tully, being fished from a river eddy, suspiciously adjacent to the Potsdam conference grounds. The corpse is discovered to be in possession of 50,000 [[German reichsmark]]s \u2014 which are later revealed to have been printed by the U.S occupying forces.\n\nGeismer becomes entwined in both the mystery of his murdered driver and the clandestine search by both [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United States|American]] forces for the missing German Emil Brandt. He becomes more involved in both mysteries as his investigation intersects with his search for Lena Brandt, a Jew \u2014 and Emil's wife \u2014 with whom Geismer had been in a relationship during his first stint as a journalist in pre-war Berlin. Lena has survived the [[Holocaust]] by doing \"what she had to\" to stay alive \u2014 early in the film this is assumed to be [[prostitution]], but Lena (based loosely on the Jewish collaborator [[Stella Goldschlag]]<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286511330 |doi=10.1080/17504902.2015.1117839|title=\"Blonde poison\": The Holocaust and the case of Stella Goldschlag in Joseph Kanon's ''The'' Good German |year=2016 |last1=Lake |first1=Anthony |journal=Holocaust Studies |volume=22 |pages=84\u201399 |s2cid=147248046 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17504902.2015.1117839|doi = 10.1080/17504902.2015.1117839|title = \"Blonde poison\": The Holocaust and the case of Stella Goldschlag in Joseph Kanon's ''The'' Good German|year = 2016|last1 = Lake|first1 = Anthony|journal = Holocaust Studies|volume = 22|pages = 84\u201399|s2cid = 147248046}}</ref>) is later revealed to be secretly complicit in the deportation of her fellow Jews.\n\nIn the film, Emil Brandt is a former [[SS]] officer who had been the secretary of Franz Bettmann, Chief Production Engineer of the [[V-2 rocket]] at [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] [[Mittelbau-Dora]]/[[Mittelwerk]]. (Bettmann is only a minor character in the film; he appears to be based on the real [[Arthur Rudolph]].) The Soviets, the Americans, and the [[British people|British]] all try to get hold of Emil Brandt, for different reasons. The Americans have already detained Bettmann in a [[safehouse]] and intend to transport him to the U.S. as part of their [[Operation Paperclip|Operation Overcast/Paperclip]] to have him work on their own rocket program (cf. [[Wernher von Braun]]). In the film, they are fully aware of Bettmann's role at Camp Dora and know about the [[slave labor]] used in the V-2 program, but want to cover up his involvement (because they could not lawfully employ a known [[war criminal]]), which includes eliminating Emil Brandt, whose testimony or written notes would prevent their whitewashing of Bettmann.\n\nGeismer, in his attempts to get his former lover, Lena, out of Berlin, gets more and more involved in the search for Emil Brandt. At one point, Lena gives Emil's notes on Camp Dora to Geismer. When Lena and Geismer try to hand Emil Brandt over to the American prosecutor charged with handling war crimes cases, they are intercepted by the American authorities who want to protect Bettmann, and Brandt is murdered. But Geismer still has Brandt's notebooks, which he now trades in to the war crimes investigators of the U.S. Army (who have turned out to be in league with the other American authorities \u2014 the ones who want to keep that evidence confidential to whitewash Bettmann) in exchange for a ''[[Persilschein]]'' (a [[denazification]] document) and a [[visa (document)|visa]] for Lena, such that she can leave Germany.\n\nThrough a minor character of a Jewish owner of a [[pawn shop]] who survived the Holocaust with his legs amputated, the film refers to the [[Nazi human experimentation]], in particular to bone transplantation experiments as they were done at the [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Clooney]] as Captain Jacob \"Jake\" Geismer\n*[[Cate Blanchett]] as Lena Brandt\n*[[Tobey Maguire]] as Corporal Patrick Tully\n*[[Beau Bridges]] as Colonel Muller\n*[[Tony Curran]] as Danny\n*[[Leland Orser]] as Captain Bernie Teitel\n*[[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Congressman Breimer\n*[[Robin Weigert]] as Hannelore\n*[[Ravil Isyanov]] as General Sikorski\n*Dave Power as Lieutenant Hasso Schaeffer\n*[[Christian Oliver]] as Emil Brandt\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Good German screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot illustrating the film's use of a Classical Hollywood visual style, including black-and-white photography and a 1.33:1 aspect ratio]]\nThe film imitates the appearance of films from [[Classical Hollywood]] [[Studio system|studio-era]]. Most of the scenes were shot on [[soundstage]]s and on [[Universal Studios]]' [[backlot]], and were then edited with archival Russian footage and archived film from [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]]. Although the finished film is in black and white, it was shot in color because this allowed the use of faster film than available black-and-white film stocks, and afforded the ability to use [[chroma key|'green screen']] techniques. The color was then reduced in post-production through the use of a [[digital intermediate]] to a grainier [[black and white]], in order to blend with the carefully restored archival material.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.lariat.org/AtTheMovies/new/goodgermn.html| title = The Good German: Who says they don't make 'em like they used to?| first=Robert|last=Roten| date=February 16, 2007| access-date = January 28, 2010|website=Lariat.org}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}\n\nUnlike modern films that are shot with significant [[camera coverage|\"coverage\"]] and mostly with [[close-up]]s or [[two shot]]s, ''The Good German'' was shot with 1940s era wide angle lenses, such as a 32&nbsp;mm, with [[deep focus]], \"strongly accented camera angles\" and entire scenes staged. Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] said:\n{{blockquote|that kind of staging is a lost art, which is too bad.

These decisions, combined with the limited coverage, allowed the rough cut to be produced in two days after wrapping up filming.<ref name=nyt2006 />\n\n===Title and theme===\n\"[[Good Germans]]\" is a term referring to German citizens during and after World War II who claimed not to have supported the Nazi regime, but remained silent and did not resist in a meaningful way. In addition, the title is an allusion to the phrase common among soldiers of the Allied Powers during the invasion of Europe after D-Day, that \"The only good German is a dead German\" \u2014 and the consequences of this death are seed for all that follows in the story of the film. Thematically, the film centers on guilt, and whether it is possible to survive the atrocities while being unaware of and not complicit in them.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Good German'' received generally mixed reviews, with many critics complaining that it was too reliant on style and did not concentrate on the building of characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-good-german/critic-reviews|title=The Good German critic reviews|access-date=July 5, 2015|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viennareview.net/on-the-town/on-screen/the-good-german-art-of-darkness|title=The Good German Art of Darkness|work=[[The Vienna Review]]|date=April 1, 2007|access-date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> {{As of|2020|06}}, the film holds a 34% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 153 reviews with an average rating of 5.04/10.
