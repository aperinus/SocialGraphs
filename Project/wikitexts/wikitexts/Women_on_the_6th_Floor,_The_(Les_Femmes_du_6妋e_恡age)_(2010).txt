One is a [[traditional]] [[wealthy]] family in a comfortable apartment, whose lives are devoted to making money and meaningless socialising. The other is the underpaid and overworked domestic servants living in cramped conditions above them. As few French people want such work, the jobs are taken by Spanish women, eager to escape the poverty and oppression of [[Francoist Spain]], who bring with them their native solidarity and human warmth.<ref name='Hoej'>Van Hoej, Brad [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944619?refcatid=31 The Women on the Sixth Floor -Les Femmes du 6e etage], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 15 February 2011. Retrieved 26 March 2011.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJean-Louis Joubert is a stockbroker living with his wife Suzanne, who does not work, in a large apartment. The family's French maid leaves after a dispute, so Suzanne goes to a church where the [[priest]] finds jobs for Spanish immigrants. There she hires Mar\u00eda, young and pretty, who speaks French and is the niece of Concepci\u00f3n, the maid for another family in the same building.\n\nThe apartment is a mess after days without a maid and Concepci\u00f3n gets some of her Spanish friends to rally round and clean it up, to the surprise and delight of Suzanne. When Suzanne wants some furniture moved up to a little room on the 6th floor that they use for storage, Jean-Louis discovers that the other little rooms there, all unheated, are occupied by Spanish maids, including their Mar\u00eda. There is only one cold water tap on the landing for them to wash themselves and one [[Turkish toilet]] that is forever getting blocked. He calls a plumber to fix the toilet and says that Mar\u00eda can use their own bathroom. He also lets another maid come in to use their phone for an urgent call home.\n\nThough he has been struck by Mar\u00eda since first seeing her, he becomes a friend to the other women too and starts learning about Spanish language, life and culture. His wife Suzanne begins to worry, not about the maids who are mostly not  young or beautiful and in any case are only servants, but about a rich client of his called Bettina de Brossolettes who is a notorious maneater. When they have a cocktail party in their flat, she is furious on finding that Bettina is invited. During the party Jean-Louis catches a hired waiter trying to kiss Mar\u00eda and, furious, sacks him on the spot. Mar\u00eda, furious now that Jean-Louis has openly revealed his feelings for her, accuses him of being a lecher and treats him with contempt.\n\nMeanwhile Jean-Louis has found a new post for one of the Spanish women, who invites him and all the others to a [[paella]] party. When Mar\u00eda turns up, she is furious to find Jean-Louis there and enjoying himself. Arriving home late to a furious Suzanne, he is accused of having been with Bettina. He says that he was and agrees to move out. Taking over the storeroom on the 6th floor, he is not only close to Mar\u00eda but becomes more closely involved in the lives of the other women on the floor. He goes to their church on Sundays, a new experience for him, and takes some of them in his car for a pilgrimage to [[Basilica of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Lisieux|Lisieux]].\n\nConcepci\u00f3n is now worried that Mar\u00eda will again fall for a man who will not marry her and, to stop any affair between the two, tells Mar\u00eda where in Spain the son of her previous relationship now is. Mar\u00eda immediately tells Suzanne she is leaving to return to Spain and, going upstairs in an emotional state, lets Jean-Louis take her into his room and kiss her. She spends the night with him and next day disappears to Spain. He is very hurt, not only because she did not tell him but also because all the other women he thought his friends were silent too.\n\nThree years later, Jean-Louis drives to Spain looking for Concepci\u00f3n. When he tracks her down, she claims she does not know where Mar\u00eda is. However her husband, who recognises what Jean-Louis is feeling, secretly tells him. When he drives there, he sees Mar\u00eda hanging out her washing and the looks that the two exchange show their love for each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Fabrice Luchini]] as Jean-Louis Joubert\n* [[Sandrine Kiberlain]] as Suzanne Joubert\n* [[Natalia Verbeke]] as Mar\u00eda Gonzalez\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Concepci\u00f3n Ramirez\n* [[Lola Due\u00f1as]] as Carmen\n* Berta Ojea as Dolores Carbalan\n* Nuria Sol\u00e9 as Teresa\n* Concha Gal\u00e1n as Pilar\n* [[Audrey Fleurot]] as Bettina de Brossolette\n* [[Marie-Armelle Deguy]] as Colette de Bergeret\n* Muriel Solvay as Nicole de Grandcourt\n* [[Philippe Duquesne]] as G\u00e9rard\n* Annie Mercier as Madame Triboulet\n* Mich\u00e8le Gleizer as Germaine Bronech\n* Camille Gigot as Bertrand Joubert\n* Jean-Charles Deval as Olivier Joubert\n* Christine V\u00e9zinet as Valentine\n* Jeupeu as Boulard\n* Vincent Nemeth as Monsieur Armand\n* Philippe du Janerand as Piquer\n* Patrick Bonnel as Golmard\n* Laurent Claret as Blamond\n* Jean-Claude Jay as Pelletier\n* Joan Massotkleiner as Fernando\n* Ivan Martin Salan as Miguel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTwo of the Spanish actresses, Berta Ojea and Concha Gal\u00e1n, did not speak French before the film and learned their roles phonetically.<ref name='secrets'>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-133404/secrets-tournage/|title=Les secrets de tournage du film Les Femmes du 6e \u00e9tage|access-date=6 January 2022|website=Allocine.fr}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premi\u00e8red at the Montpellier International Festival of Mediterranean Film on 23 October 2010 and its cinematic run in France began on 16 February 2011.
