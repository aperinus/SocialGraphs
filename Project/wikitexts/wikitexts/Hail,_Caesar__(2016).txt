An American-British-Japanese co-production, the film stars [[Josh Brolin]], [[George Clooney]], [[Alden Ehrenreich]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Channing Tatum]] with [[Michael Gambon]] as the narrator. It is a fictional story that follows the real-life [[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]] [[Eddie Mannix]] (Brolin) working in the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood film industry in the 1950s]], trying to discover what happened to a star actor during the filming of a [[Epic film|biblical epic]].<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/hail-caesar!-v602088 AllMovie]</ref>\n\nFirst talked about by the Coens in 2004, ''Hail, Caesar!'' was originally to take place in the 1920s and follow actors performing a play about [[ancient Rome]]. The Coens shelved the idea until late 2013. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in November 2014 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The film premiered at the [[Regency Village Theater]] in Los Angeles, California on February 1, 2016, and was theatrically released by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] on February 5.\n\n''Hail, Caesar!'' grossed $63.6 million worldwide on a $22 million budget and received positive reviews from critics. The film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2016#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2016]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2016/ |title=National Board of Review Announces 2016 Award Winners |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |date=November 29, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref> and received nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPCm8Wcf-ZI \"La La Land\" wins for Production Design - Oscaers on YouTube]</ref> and [[70th British Academy Film Awards]], both for production design.<ref>[http://awards.bafta.org/award/2017/film/production-design 2017 Film Production Design|BAFTA Awards]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951 Hollywood, Eddie Mannix is head of physical production at Capitol Pictures. His duties as the studio \"[[Fixer (person)|fixer]]\" find him covering up for its scandalous stars, fending off twin gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and weighing a generous job offer from the [[Lockheed Corporation]]. When unmarried [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]] actress DeeAnna Moran becomes pregnant, Mannix arranges for Moran to place her baby in [[foster care]] then discreetly adopt it, preserving her career.\n\nBaird Whitlock, the talented but dim-witted star of the studio's major production ''Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ,'' is drugged and abducted. He awakens at a meeting of \"The Future\", a group of [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] [[Communist Party USA|Communist]] screenwriters, and is easily won over to their cause. The Future send a ransom note demanding $100,000 for Whitlock's return, which Mannix procures from the studio. He convinces Thora to withhold a story in exchange for information on singing Western film star Hobie Doyle.\n\nDoyle has been hopelessly miscast in a sophisticated [[comedy of manners]] and, despite the efforts of director Laurence Laurentz, cannot overcome his thick [[Western American English|Western American accent]]. When Laurentz requests Doyle's removal, Mannix convinces him to continue his coaching. Doyle admits to Mannix his trepidation about the role, but Mannix reassures him and confides in him about Whitlock's kidnapping.\n\nThat evening, Doyle attends the premiere of his latest Western with starlet Carlotta Valdez, as arranged by Mannix. The pair are accosted by the Thacker sisters, but Doyle spots the briefcase of ransom money, carried by [[Musical film|musical]] star Burt Gurney. Mannix and Moran meet with [[surety]] agent Joseph Silverman, a trusted scapegoat for the studio, who agrees to foster Moran's child. His dependability proves immensely attractive to Moran. Doyle follows Gurney to The Future's beach house but finds only Whitlock inside. The Future have taken Gurney to rendezvous with a [[Soviet]] submarine and defect to the USSR, but lose the briefcase in the ocean. Doyle returns Whitlock to the studio as police arrive to arrest the group.\n\nWhitlock spouts his newfound Communist beliefs to Mannix, who slaps Whitlock and orders him to \"go out and be a star\" and finish ''Hail, Caesar!'' The next morning, Mannix learns that Moran has married Silverman. Mannix declines Lockheed's offer, remaining at Capitol Pictures. Thora tells him that her column will reveal Whitlock won his role in an earlier picture by having sex with Laurentz, but Mannix tells her that if he exposes her source, Gurney\u2014a Communist and recent Soviet defector\u2014it will tarnish her reputation. Thora backs down from running the story and Mannix moves on, confident in his role in life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Eddie Mannix|Edward \"Eddie\" Mannix]], a tough but conflicted \"fixer\" who keeps actors' scandals out of the press.<ref name=\"THRCast\">{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Jonah Hill Joining Channing Tatum, George Clooney in Coen Brothers' 'Hail, Caesar!'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonah-hill-joining-channing-tatum-717525|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=August 4, 2014|date=July 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720044440/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonah-hill-joining-channing-tatum-717525|archive-date=2014-07-20|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"LABoost\">{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title=Coen brothers' 'Hail, Caesar!' is helping boost L.A. film production|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-onlocation-20141126-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 26, 2014|access-date=November 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[George Clooney]] as Baird Whitlock, a [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]]-type film star.<ref name=TONY/> \n* [[Alden Ehrenreich]] as Hobart \"Hobie\" Doyle, a [[singing cowboy]] in the [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] mold who is miscast as an urbane comic lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alden-ehrenreich-hail-caesar-spaghetti-863469|title='Hail, Caesar!'

She designed for a working film studio of the early 1950s, plus six genre films, each of which featured a major actor working on the set for about a week. Photos from the MGM library and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences]] showed that film crews dressed more formally than today\u2014no shorts or sneakers. Zophres produced about 15 [[Costume design#Design process|boards]] of preliminary sketches, including \"sculptural Technicolor gowns\" for the ballroom drama inspired by the work of [[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]]. Her [[Double-breasted|double-breasted suit]] for Brolin was intended to blend with his skin tone, his moustache was styled after [[Walt Disney]]'s, his hair was [[Perm (hairstyle)|permed]], and his character alone wore a [[fedora]]. Zophres modeled Tatum's look on [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Tyrone Power]]. The costumes in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' in particular served as references for the gladiator sequences, although Zophres employed the contemporary technique of using painted hard plastic foam instead of metal. The film ultimately required more than 2,500 costumes, including 170 Roman extras, 120 Israelites and about 45 slaves. About 500 of the costumes were custom-made. Toward the end of the shoot, the scope of the project overtook the budget, and Zophres completed some of the sewing herself.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title = Behind the Scenes of ''Hail, Caesar!''
