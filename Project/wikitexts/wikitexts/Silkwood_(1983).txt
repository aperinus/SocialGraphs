The screenplay by [[Nora Ephron]] and [[Alice Arlen]] was adapted from the book ''Who Killed Karen Silkwood?'' by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer and activist Howard Kohn which detailed the life of [[Karen Silkwood]]. Silkwood was a [[List of nuclear whistleblowers|nuclear whistle-blower]] and a [[Trade union|labor union]] [[Activism|activist]] who died in a [[Traffic collision|car collision]] while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant where she worked. In real life, her death gave rise to a 1979 [[lawsuit]], ''Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee'', led by attorney [[Gerry Spence]]. The jury rendered its verdict of $10 million in damages to be paid to the Silkwood estate (her children), the largest amount in damages ever awarded for that kind of case at the time. The Silkwood estate eventually settled for $1.3 million.<ref>{{cite book |last=Windell |first=James O. |date=2015 |title=Looking Back in Crime: What Happened on This Date in Criminal Justice History? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=698_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA43|location=Boca Raton, Florida |publisher=CRC Press |page=43 |isbn=978-1-4987-0414-4}}</ref>\n\n''Silkwood'' was shot largely in [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]] on a budget of $10 million. Factual accuracy was maintained throughout the script. One scene in particular involved Silkwood activating a radiation alarm at the plant; Silkwood herself had forty times the [[Radiation damage|legal limit]] of radioactive contamination in her system.\n\nStreep had just finished filming ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982) when production began. The film marked a departure for some of its stars: it is noted for being one of the first \"serious\" works of Cher, who had been previously known mostly for her singing, and for Russell, who was at the time widely known for his work in the action genre.\n\nThe film received positive reviews and was a box office success, with particular attention focused on Nichols' direction and Streep's performance. At the [[56th Academy Awards]], ''Silkwood'' received five nominations in total, including Streep for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], Cher for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], and Nichols for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. After being out of print on [[DVD]] in the United States, the film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on July 25, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nKaren Silkwood, a worker at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] (near [[Crescent, Oklahoma]]), shares a ramshackle house with two co-workers, her boyfriend Drew Stephens and her [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] friend Dolly Pelliker. She makes [[MOX fuel|MOX]] [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]] for [[nuclear reactor]]s, where she deals with the threat of [[Ionizing radiation|exposure]] to [[radiation]]. She has become a union activist, concerned that corporate practices may adversely affect the health of workers. She is also engaged in a conflict with her former [[Common-law marriage in the United States#Oklahoma|common-law husband]] in an effort to have more time with their three children.\n\nBecause the plant has ostensibly fallen behind on a major contract \u2013 fabricating MOX fuel rods for a [[Fast Flux Test Facility|breeder reactor]] at the [[Hanford Site]] \u2013 employees are required to work long hours and weekends of overtime. She believes that managers are falsifying safety reports and cutting corners wherever possible, risking the welfare of the personnel. Karen approaches the union with her concerns and becomes active in [[lobbying]] for safeguards. She travels to [[Washington, D.C.]] to testify before the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]. She interacts with union officials who appear to be more interested in the publicity she is generating than her welfare and that of her co-workers.\n\nWhen Silkwood and other workers become contaminated by radiation, plant officials try to blame her for the incident. When she sees [[Industrial radiography|weld sample radiographies]] of fuel rods being retouched to hide shoddy work, and that records of inadequate safety measures had been altered, she decides to investigate further herself. Complications arise in her personal life when Angela, a funeral parlour beautician, joins the household as Dolly's lover. Unable to deal with Silkwood's obsession with gathering evidence, and suspecting her of [[infidelities]], Drew moves out.\n\nOnce she feels she has gathered sufficient documentation, Silkwood contacts a reporter from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and arranges a night time meeting. In the film's final moments Silkwood leaves a union meeting, carrying documentation of her findings on her way to meet with the journalist. She sees approaching headlights in her [[rear-view mirror]]. The scene fades out as the lights draw up so close that they distract and blind her, preventing her from seeing the road ahead. The scene fades in again on the aftermath of her fatal one-car crash. There are no documents to be found in the car wreck.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Karen Silkwood]]\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Drew Stephens\n* [[Cher]] as [[Dusty Ellis|Dolly Pelliker]]\n* [[Craig T.

It eventually earned $35,615,609 in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Mojo\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n''Silkwood'' received a positive critical response. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a precisely visualized, highly emotional [[melodrama]] that's going to raise a lot of hackles\" and \"a very moving work.\" He added, \"There are, however, problems, not unlike those faced by [[Costa-Gavras]] in his ''[[State of Siege]]'' and ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'', and they are major. Mr. Nichols and his writers ... have attempted to impose a shape on a real-life story that, even as they present it, has no easily verifiable shape. We are drawn into the story of Karen Silkwood by the absolute accuracy and unexpected sweetness of its [[Middle class#Middle America|Middle American]] details and then, near the end, abandoned by a film whose images say one thing and whose final credit card another. The muddle of fact, fiction and speculation almost, though not quite, denies the artistry of all that's gone before.\" He concluded, \"I realize that films shouldn't be judged in bits and pieces, but it's difficult not to see ''Silkwood'' in that way. For most of its running time it is so convincing\u2014and so sure of itself\u2014that it seems a particular waste when it goes dangerously wrong. It's like watching a skydiver execute all sorts of graceful, breath-taking turns, as he appears to ignore gravity and fly on his own, only to have him smash to earth when the chute doesn't open.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C07EFD61638F937A25751C1A965948260 |title=''New York Times'' review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1983-12-14 |access-date=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film four stars and commented, \"It's a little amazing that established movie stars like Streep, Russell and Cher could disappear so completely into the everyday lives of these characters.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/silkwood-1983|author=Roger Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=Silkwood|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=December 14, 1983}}</ref>\n\nDavid Sterritt of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' called the film \"a fine example of Hollywood's love-hate attitude toward timely and controversial subject matter.\" He continued, \"The movie sides with Silkwood as a character, playing up her spunk and courage while casting wry, sidelong glances at her failings. When it comes to the issues connected with her, though, the filmmakers slip and slide around, providing an escape hatch ... for every position and opinion they offer. This makes the movie less polemical than it might have been, and a lot more wishy-washy ... This is too bad, because on other levels ''Silkwood'' is a strong and imaginative film. Meryl Streep gives the year's most astounding performance by an actress, adding vigor and complexity to almost every scene with her endlessly inventive portrayal of the eccentric heroine. The supporting players skilfully follow her lead.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Sterritt |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0105/010506.html |title=''Christian Science Monitor'' review |journal=Christian Science Monitor |date=5 January 1984 |publisher=Csmonitor.com |access-date=2013-12-05}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 76% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10.
