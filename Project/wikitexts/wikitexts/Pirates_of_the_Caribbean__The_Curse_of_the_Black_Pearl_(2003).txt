Around that time, producer Jerry Bruckheimer became involved in the project; he had [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] work on the script, adding the plot device of a supernatural curse to the story to bring it in line with the original theme park ride. Filming took place from October 2002 to March 2003 in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and on sets constructed around [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe first film released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]], ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' had its world premiere at [[Disneyland]] Park in [[Anaheim, California]], on June 28, 2003. Defying low pre-release expectations, the film was a huge box-office success, grossed $654.3 million worldwide; making it the [[2003 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2003]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with Depp's performance receiving universal acclaim. The film has been widely cited as the film that launched Depp as a box-office leading man after many years as a cult movie star. Depp won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]], in addition to Best Actor nominations at the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Awards]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTAs]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globes]]. ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' was also nominated for four other [[76th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] and [[57th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]]. The film became the first in a franchise, with two [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back sequels]], ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'', released in 2006 and 2007. Two more sequels, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|On Stranger Tides]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', were released in 2011 and 2017, respectively.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Current wordcount 697-->\nIn 1720, while sailing to [[Port Royal]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], aboard HMS ''Dauntless'', Governor [[Weatherby Swann]]'s crew encounters a [[shipwreck]] and recovers a boy, [[Will Turner]]. Swann's daughter, [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]], discovers a golden pirate [[medal]]lion around Will's neck, and takes it. Eight years later, Captain [[James Norrington]] is promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and proposes to Elizabeth. Her [[corset]] makes her faint and fall into the sea, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Captain [[Jack Sparrow]], having just arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship, rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a [[blacksmith]]. They duel, and Jack is imprisoned. \n\nThat night, the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' attacks Port Royal, searching for the medallion. The pirates capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]]. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter. Barbossa explains that the medallion is the last of 882 gold pieces his crew took from a lost treasure of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] on [[Isla de Muerta]]. Cort\u00e9s had accepted the treasure as payment to prevent the [[Fall of Tenochtitlan]], but did not fulfill his part of the bargain. The [[Aztec mythology|Aztec gods]] cursed the treasure; Barbossa and any members of his crew who took the coins were cursed by extension, and became [[immortality|immortals]] whose true, skeletal forms are revealed in moonlight. To lift the curse, they must return the treasure, each coin stained with the either its taker's blood or the blood of the taker's direct relative. Assuming Elizabeth is the daughter of [[William \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner|Bill Turner]] (Will's father, whom Barbossa tried to drown after discovering he sent the medallion to his child){{efn|Being also cursed, Bill could not die, and his true fate is explained in future films}}, Barbossa decides to use her blood on the medallion. \n\nTo save Elizabeth, whom he loves, Will frees Jack, who was the previous [[Sea captain|captain]] of the ''Black Pearl'' before Barbossa staged a [[mutiny]]. The two commandeer HMS ''Interceptor'', a small [[sloop-of-war]], and head for [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]. There, Jack enlists his friend [[Joshamee Gibbs]] to help them assemble a crew. Chasing the ''Pearl'' to the Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa cut Elizabeth's hand, stain the coin, and return it to the chest. As she is not Bill Turner's relative, the curse does not lift. Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to the ''Interceptor'', while Jack is captured by Barbossa and locked in the [[Military prison#brig|brig]] of the ''Pearl''. The ''Pearl'' pursues the ''Interceptor'', destroying it and taking Jack's crew hostage. Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a [[loophole]] in the agreement, [[marooning]] Jack and Elizabeth on an island. Elizabeth makes a [[smoke signal]], and Norrington brings the ''Dauntless'' to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth promises to marry Norrington if he will pursue the ''Pearl'' and save Will.\n\nThat night, the ''Dauntless'' arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack tells Norrington he will lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the ''Dauntless'', but instead persuades Barbossa's crew to attack the ''Dauntless'' before they lift the curse and lose their immortality. Elizabeth escapes the ''Dauntless'' and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the ''Pearl''. They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own. Jack again switches sides, freeing Will and dueling Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen. When Barbossa stabs Jack, it is revealed that Jack took a piece of gold from the chest and is likewise cursed and unable to die. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will returns both coins to the chest with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted; Barbossa dies from Jack's gunshot, and the rest of Barbossa's crew, no longer immortal, are arrested.\n\nAt Port Royal, Jack is to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention while Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the nearby ''Pearl'', reclaiming the ship and his new crew. Norrington permits Jack and the ''Pearl'' \"one day's head start\" before initiating pursuit.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members|l1=List of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' cast members|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters|l2=List of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' characters}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Jack Sparrow]]: An eccentric and [[trickster]] pirate characterized by his slightly drunken swagger, slurred speech and awkwardly flailing hand gestures.
