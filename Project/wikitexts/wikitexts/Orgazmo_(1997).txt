It stars Parker, Stone, [[Dian Bachar]], Robyn Lynne, and Michael Dean Jacobs. The plot follows Joe Young (Parker), a devout [[Mormon]] missionary who, to pay for his and his fianc\u00e9e's dream wedding and home, hesitantly participates in a [[pornographic film]] for an abusive director. ''Orgazmo'' is Parker and Stone's second film, following 1993's ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]] Joseph Young, assigned with his mission partner to [[Los Angeles]], finds the city to be a hostile and unenthusiastic place for their work. The problems worsen when they knock on the door of sleazy porn director Maxxx Orbison, and several security guards are sent to dispose of them. Joe defeats all of them singlehandedly with a variety of [[martial arts]] skills. Impressed by his performance and bored of his current project's lead actor, Orbison attempts to hire Joe to be the title character and lead of his pornographic superhero film, ''Orgazmo''. Joe is conflicted because of his beliefs because he is a missionary, but the salary offered would pay for a wedding in the temple in [[Utah]] where his fianc\u00e9e Lisa has expressed a strong desire to wed. Joe reluctantly accepts despite being given a sign from God.\n\nJoe finds the crew of the film intimidating but befriends co-star Ben Chapleski, a technical genius and graduate from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] who works in the pornographic industry to satiate his overactive libido. He plays Orgazmo's sidekick Choda Boy, who assists Orgazmo with specially designed [[sex toys]], including Orgazmo's signature weapon, the Orgazmorator, a ray gun that forces orgasm upon whomever it is fired. Ben invites Joe to his home later on and shows Joe a real, working Orgazmorator Ben has built, and he and Joe spend an evening using it on unsuspecting citizens for amusement.\n\nAt a sushi bar owned by Ben's Japanese friend G-Fresh, the two witness a group of thugs vandalizing the bar to force out G-Fresh so their dance club next door can expand. Later on, when Ben and Joe are gone, G-Fresh is coerced to leave after being assaulted by the same thugs. Upon finding this out, Joe and Ben don costumes and use their film props and the Orgazmorator to sneak into the club and steal back the contract G-Fresh was forced to sign. Joe is agitated after nearly being shot in the head, but Ben is excited by being a real superhero.\n\n''Orgazmo'' becomes an amazing success, both financially and critically, and Orbison withholds Joe's paycheck to keep him in town long enough to announce a sequel. Tempted with a doubled salary, Joe is confronted by his fianc\u00e9e, who has found out what he has been doing and leaves him. Facing production difficulties and harassment from Orbison's unsympathetic nephew A-Cup, Joe tries to back out of the project, but Orbison refuses.  When Joe stands up to him, Orbison has Lisa kidnapped. Ben realizes the thugs who assaulted G-Fresh are also working for Orbison, and he joins Joe in storming Orbison's mansion before Lisa can be forced to perform in one of Orbison's films.\n\nFighting through Orbison's group of henchmen, Joe and Ben meet their match in A-Cup. Joe encourages Ben to unleash his long-[[Repressed memory|repressed]] Hamster Style discipline of martial arts, allowing Ben to beat A-Cup. After repairing his damaged Orgazmorator, Joe repeatedly shoots Orbison with it, incapacitating him and capturing all the henchmen. Ben blows up the mansion with another device, the \"Cock Rocket\", destroying Orbison's base of operations. Joe and Lisa reconcile, and she gives him her blessing to remain in Los Angeles and continue being a hero alongside Ben.\n\nA doctor tells Orbison that after so many orgasms in a row, his testicles have swollen to the size of oranges, and surgical removal is the only option. A now insane Orbison declares revenge on Orgazmo and becomes the personification of A-Cup's character, who is immune to the Orgazmorator: Neutered Man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Trey Parker]] as Joe Young/Orgazmo\n* [[Dian Bachar]] as Ben Chapleski/Choda Boy\n** Robert Lansing as Young Ben\n* Robyn Lynne Raab as Lisa\n* Michael Dean Jacobs as Maxxx Orbison\n* [[Matt Stone]] as Dave The Photographer\n* Masao Maki as G-Fresh\n* [[Toddy Walters]] as Georgi\n* [[Ron Jeremy]] as Clark/Jizzmaster Zero\n* David Dunn as A-Cup/Neutered Man\n* [[Chasey Lain]] as Candi\n* [[Juli Ashton]] as Saffi\n* [[Shayla LaVeaux]] as Greek porn actress\n* [[Jill Kelly (actress)|Jill Kelly]] as Nurse\n* [[Lloyd Kaufman]] as Doctor\n* [[Max Hardcore]] as Award show presenter\n* [[Christi Lake]]\n* [[Jeanna Fine]]\n* Jacklyn Lick\n* Mike Eaton as Meatfish\n* [[Melissa Hill]]\n* [[Serenity (actress)|Serenity]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n''Orgazmo'' premiered at the [[Toronto Film Festival]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981023&slug=2779157|title='Orgazmo': Porn Story Of Corrupted Innocence Fumbles, Is Repetitious|last=Hartl|first=John|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=October 23, 1998|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>  The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave the film an [[MPAA rating#X is replaced by NC-17|NC-17]] rating, resulting in a very [[limited release]] in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/mpaa-orgazmo-stays-nc-17-1117481204/|title=MPAA: 'Orgazmo' stays NC-17|last=Cox|first=Dan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 8, 1998|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> There is an 'Unrated' version that was released on the two-sided DVD set along with the theatrical version; it runs two minutes shorter than the original 94-minute release.
