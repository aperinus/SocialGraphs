It stars [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[Benicio del Toro]], with [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Taye Diggs]], [[Nicky Katt]], [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]], and [[James Caan]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was released on September 8, 2000, and was a commercial disappointment, grossing $13 million against a production budget of $8.5 million. The critical reception was mixed, with some critics praising the acting, direction and action sequences, but criticizing the limits of the script and character development.\n\nThe film is now considered a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Scott Tobias | title=The New Cult Canon: The Way Of The Gun | url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/the-way-of-the-gun,25296/ | work=The AV Club | date=March 19, 2009 | accessdate=October 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nParker and Longbaugh are a pair of low-level petty criminals who fund their existence through unconventional and often illegal means. Wanting to move past petty crime, they vow to get the proverbial \"big score.\" While at a sperm donation clinic, the pair overhear a telephone conversation detailing a $1,000,000 payment to a surrogate mother for bearing the child of money launderer Hale Chidduck. Parker and Longbaugh resolve to kidnap the surrogate, Robin, but their attempt escalates into a shootout with her bodyguards, Jeffers and Obecks. The kidnappers are able to elude the bodyguards, who are arrested. Jeffers and Obecks are bailed out and returned to Chidduck by his right-hand man Joe Sarno. As Sarno begins coordinating Robin's rescue, Longbaugh contacts her gynecologist, Dr. Allen Painter, and orders him to a truck stop to examine Robin. \n\nAfter the examination, Painter returns to Chidduck, and it is revealed that the doctor is Chidduck's son. It is also revealed that Jeffers and Chidduck's wife are romantically involved. Longbaugh calls from a motel south of the Mexican border and demands a $15 million ransom. Jeffers and Obecks, tempted by the money, begin forming a plan to save the child and keep the money. As Longbaugh hangs up the telephone outside the motel, he is approached by Sarno, who identifies himself as the \u201cbag-man\u201d and offers to pay $1 million if they surrender Robin and simply walk away. Longbaugh, who is clearly skeptical of the offer from a \u201cbag-man\u201d declines the cash offer, but accepts Sarno's subsequent offer to buy him a cup of coffee. While having coffee the two discuss the current state of their chosen profession including the character of criminals and how no one takes \u201cbeing a criminal\u201d seriously anymore. \n\nLongbaugh jokingly mentions  \u201cthey want to be criminals more than they want to commit crimes\u201d, to which Sarno agrees. After the two leave the coffee shop Sarno tells Longbaugh that he \u201cseems like a good guy\u201d and ought to get out of this business. To which Longbaugh replies \u201cwhat would I do then?\u201d, indicating he is a true criminal. Sarno again offers to pay them $1 million dollars cash to turn Robin over to which Longaugh replies that he wishes he could accept the money but because Sarno is a bag-man he knows it would be a double cross alluding to that fact he was also a bag-man in the past. The two shake hands and guardedly go their separate ways. Longbaugh returns to his room, where Parker and Robin are playing cards. Sarno then returns to Chidduck's home to plan the next step. Jeffers comes to realize that Robin is Sarno's daughter. \n\nJeffers, Obecks, and Painter leave to meet with the kidnappers, while Sarno departs separately with the ransom. At the motel, Parker is having second thoughts. As he confers with Longbaugh outside the motel room, Robin takes the opportunity to seize a shotgun and barricade herself inside. As sirens are heard in the distance, Parker and Longbaugh hastily escape, and Robin emerges just as Mexican police arrive, followed by Jeffers, Obecks, and Painter. As Painter and the bodyguards try to persuade Robin to leave with them, the officers pull their guns and order everybody onto the ground. Parker and Longbaugh open fire from a nearby hilltop, and the shootout leaves the two officers dead and Obecks wounded. Jeffers shoves Painter and Robin into his car and drives off.\n\nParker and Longbaugh torture Obecks to learn Robin's location, while Jeffers confines Robin in a room in a Mexican brothel. Jeffers forces Painter to perform a Caesarean section to retrieve the baby, despite Robin's confession that the child is hers and Painter's and is not Chidduck's. Meanwhile, the heavily armed Parker and Longbaugh infiltrate the brothel. The ensuing gunfight, which leaves Parker wounded, turns into another standoff, until Painter shoots Jeffers. Outside, Sarno arrives with a group of men and the ransom, which they stack in the courtyard. Parker wants to kidnap Robin and Painter again, but Longbaugh, guilt-ridden after seeing her condition, responds: \"She's had enough.\" Despite realizing that the money is bait, Parker and Longbaugh charge headlong into an ambush.\n\nAll of Sarno's men are killed in the ensuing firefight. However, Sarno manages to shoot and cripple the already wounded Parker and Longbaugh, and then calls for an ambulance. Painter emerges with Robin and the baby. Lying in a pool of blood, Parker and Longbaugh call out to Sarno, informing him that the baby is in fact Robin and Painter's, and thus Sarno's grandson. Parker wonders aloud if this fact will influence Sarno to let them keep the child. Robin and the baby are then taken away in the ambulance with Painter, Sarno and the money, leaving Parker and Longbaugh to die. Days later, Chidduck's wife reveals that she is pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Parker\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Longbaugh\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Robin\n* [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Joe Sarno\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Jeffers\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Obecks\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Abner Mercer\n* [[Dylan Kussman]] as Dr. Allen Painter\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Hale Chidduck\n* [[Kristin Lehman]] as Francesca Chidduck\n* [[Mando Guerrero]] as Federale #1\n* [[Sarah Silverman]] as Raving Bitch\n\n==Production==\nAfter winning an [[Academy Award]] for ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', Christopher McQuarrie assumed that he would have no problem making his next movie \"and then you slowly start to realize no one in Hollywood is interested in making your film, they're interested in making their films.\"<ref name=\"Olsen\">{{cite news | last=Olsen | first=Mark | title=Fist in the Face | work=[[Sight and Sound]] | date = November 2000}}</ref> He spent years as a script doctor while trying to get financing for an epic biopic of [[Alexander the Great]] for [[Warner Bros.]] before finally realizing that he \"had to make a film with some commercial success to be taken seriously.\"<ref name=\"Konow\">{{cite news  | last=Konow | first=David | title=The Way of the Screenwriter: An Interview with Christopher McQuarrie | work=Creative Screenwriting | date=September\u2013October 2000 }}</ref> He approached [[20th Century Fox]] and told them that he would be willing to write and direct a movie for any budget they would be willing to give him as long as he had complete creative control. \"Fox told me to get fucked.
