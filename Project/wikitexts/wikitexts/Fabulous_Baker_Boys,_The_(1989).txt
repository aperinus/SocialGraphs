Primarily set in Seattle, Washington, the film follows a piano duo consisting of brothers, who hire an attractive singer to revive their waning career. After a period of success, complications ensue when the younger brother develops a romantic interest in the singer. Brothers [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Beau Bridges]] star as the titular musicians, with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] playing lounge singer [[Susie Diamond]].\n\n''The Fabulous Baker Boys'' was Kloves's directorial debut and second screenplay. He conceived the story based on [[Ferrante & Teicher]], a piano duo he had grown up watching perform on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which inspired him to write a film about [[working class]] musicians who are also siblings. Determined to direct the film himself, Kloves [[Spec script|sold the script]] to producers [[Paula Weinstein]] and [[Mark Rosenberg (producer)|Mark Rosenberg]], and it was subsequently rotated among several production companies before it was ultimately obtained by [[20th century Fox|20th Century Fox]] in 1986. The film was shot mostly in Los Angeles, California, from December 1988 to March 1989. Although both Jeff and Pfeiffer were Kloves's first choices for their respective roles, he was initially reluctant to cast Beau, despite Jeff's suggestion. Pfeiffer underwent several months of [[Vocal pedagogy|voice training]] to perform all of her character's songs, which largely consist of jazz and [[Traditional pop|pop standards]]. While both Bridges brothers play their instruments on camera, their audio was dubbed by the film's composer, [[Dave Grusin]], and musician John F. Hammond, respectively.\n\n''The Fabulous Baker Boys'' was released on October 13, 1989, to critical acclaim, receiving praise for its three leads' performances, particularly Pfeiffer's. The [[National Board of Review]] named it one of the year's [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films#1980s|10 best films]]. However, the film [[Box-office bomb|underperformed at the box office]], grossing $18.4 million against its $11.5 million budget. ''The Fabulous Baker Boys'' was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[62nd Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Pfeiffer), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. Pfeiffer won nearly every acting award for which she was nominated during the 1989-1990 [[Film awards seasons|awards season]], including the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], but lost the Academy Award to [[Jessica Tandy]]. The film is best remembered for Pfeiffer's sultry performance of \"[[Makin' Whoopee]]\" on top of a grand piano, which several media publications consider to be one of the most famous and sexiest scenes in film history.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Fabulous Baker Boys are a piano duo consisting of brothers Jack and Frank Baker. For 15 years, they have been performing [[show tune]]s in bars and lounges throughout Seattle, Washington on a pair of matching grand pianos. While Frank dutifully serves as the duo's manager, Jack has grown weary of the hackneyed material they have come to perform over the years, but his complacency leaves him uninspired to pursue his talents further. Apart from occasionally playing the music he enjoys at a local jazz club, Jack's personal life largely consists of meaningless [[one-night stand]]s, caring for his aging Labrador Eddie, and spending time with Nina, a lonely girl from his apartment building whose single mother neglects her in favor of romantic pursuits.\n\nConcerned about a sudden decrease in stable gigs and loss of income, Frank decides to hire a female singer to revive interest in their act. After auditioning several unsuccessful candidates, they meet [[Susie Diamond]], a former [[Escort agency|escort]] who demands an audition despite being several minutes late. Although initially at odds with Frank over her boldness and unprofessionalism, Susie impresses both brothers with her performance of \"[[More Than You Know (1929 song)|More Than You Know]]\", and they hire her. Their debut performance as a trio is flawed but ultimately well-received, and the rebranded act gradually receives better gigs and higher salaries in return.\n\nThe now in-demand trio is booked for an extended engagement at a luxurious resort. Jack and Susie flirt with each other cautiously in-between gigs, but neither acts upon their feelings. Noticing a growing attraction between them, Frank forbids Jack from pursuing Susie in fear that a relationship between the two would compromise the group's stability and newfound success. Frank returns to Seattle prematurely when one of his children suffers a minor injury. Taking advantage of his absence to contemporize their setlist, Susie and Jack deliver a sultry performance of \"[[Makin' Whoopee]]\" during the hotel's [[New Year's Eve]] festivities, after which they finally succumb to their feelings and sleep together. Susie opens up to Jack about her past as an escort but Jack remains emotionally distant.\n\nWhen the couple returns to Seattle, Frank quickly deduces that Jack and Susie have slept with each other; tensions arise when both rebel against Frank's [[Artistic control|creative control]] and song choices. After spending another night with Jack, Susie tells him she has received a lucrative job offer to record television jingles for cat food, which would require her to leave the group. Jack is quietly heartbroken that Susie would even consider leaving but refuses to admit how he truly feels, instead acting as though her departure is of no concern to him. Susie accepts the job after a final performance with The Fabulous Baker Boys, and the two part ways following a heated argument in which Susie accuses Jack of being a coward in his pursuits of both her and his career.\n\nJack and Frank quarrel about the increasingly humiliating gigs Frank has been booking them due to Susie's departure, which Frank blames Jack for. After nearly breaking Frank's hand during a physical altercation, Jack quits the band. He takes his frustrations out on Nina upon returning home but apologizes soon afterward, learning she will rely on him less once her mother marries her newest boyfriend. Now prepared to venture out on his own, Jack visits Frank to make amends. Having opted to offer piano lessons from his home, Frank accepts Jack's decision to pursue a solo career and explains he thought he was helping his younger brother live a carefree life, of which he was sometimes jealous. They reminisce about the early days of their act with a final duet.\n\nJack visits Susie, who is not particularly enjoying her new job, and expresses regret about his behavior towards her. Susie is not quite ready to resume their relationship but the two part as friends, with Jack telling her he has a feeling they will see each other again. Jack watches as Susie walks off to her new job until she is nearly out of sight.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|*[[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Baker\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Susie Diamond]]\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as Frank Baker\n* Ellie Raab as Nina\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Lloyd\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Blanche \"Monica\" Moran\n* [[Dakin Matthews]] as Charlie\n* [[Ken Lerner]] as Ray\n* [[Albert Hall]] as Henry\n* [[Terri Treas]] as Girl in Bed\n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as Vince Nancy\n* [[Bradford English]] as Earl\n* [[David Coburn (actor)|David Coburn]] as Kid at Vet}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Writing and development ===\nScreenwriter [[Steve Kloves]] was inspired to write ''The Fabulous Baker Boys'' based on [[Ferrante & Teicher]], a piano duo he had grown up watching perform on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' during the 1960s.<ref name=\":0\" /> He found himself fascinated by \"[[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] entertainment \u2013 people who work in the arts in a kind of [[working class]] way.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|last=Hemphill|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Hemphill|date=September 17, 2015|title=\"I'm Not Qualified For Anything Else\": Writer/Director Steve Kloves on The Fabulous Baker Boys and Flesh and Bone|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/95677-im-not-qualified-for-anything-else-writerdirector-steve-kloves-on-the-fabulous-baker-boys-and-flesh-and-bone/#.YLk0GahKiUk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604133156/https://filmmakermagazine.com/95677-im-not-qualified-for-anything-else-writerdirector-steve-kloves-on-the-fabulous-baker-boys-and-flesh-and-bone/|archive-date=June 4, 2021|access-date=June 3, 2021|website=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]}}</ref> Remembering that during his childhood parents typically enrolled their children in piano lessons simply to \"give them culture\", he decided to write a story about piano-playing brothers, citing [[Dysfunctional family|familial dysfunction]] as a common theme among his work.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although he felt a story about a waning piano act would provide strong material for a feature-length film, some of Kloves's peers warned him \"it was a completely bizarre, terrible idea for a movie\",<ref name=\":0\" /> expressing concerns that its dark subject matter and frequent arguments would not translate well on screen.<ref name=\":22\" /> Kloves conducted little research while penning the film, instead opting to write its first draft based on what he learned from spending time in hotels.<ref name=\":0\" /> Kloves recalled that he would sometimes visit hotel bars \"and hear some guy play the piano ... and some of them were pretty good.
