The original music score is composed by [[Brian Eno]] and the cinematography is by [[Peter Deming]].\n\nThe narrative is a [[time slip]] fantasy in which a [[Gulf War]] veteran who suffered a death or [[near-death experience]] while on active service returns to the United States where he is blamed for the death of a policeman, and incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane. Subject to experimental treatments there, which involve him being shut inside a morgue casket while tied in a straitjacket, he eventually learns to [[Time travel in fiction|travel through time]] and is able to offer help to various people.\n\n''The Jacket'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2005, and was released in theaters in the United States by [[Warner Independent Pictures]] on March 4, 2005. It grossed $21.1 million on a budget of $28.5 million and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter miraculously recovering from an apparently fatal bullet wound to the head, [[Gulf War]] veteran Jack Starks returns to [[Vermont]] in 1992, suffering from periods of [[amnesia]]. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie, and her alcoholic mother in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman.\n\nThe scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman's gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.\n\nStarks is placed in the care of Dr. Thomas Becker, a psychiatrist, and his staff. In December 1992, Starks is forced to undergo an unauthorized treatment designed by Becker: he is injected with experimental drugs, bound in a [[straitjacket]] and then placed inside a [[morgue]] drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie at a roadside diner where she works. He suspects this happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. She does not recognise him but seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and confronts her. Jackie, frightened, tells him that Jack Starks died on New Year's Day in 1993, and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning Jackie's trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life.\n\nEarly on 1 January 1993, knowing that his time is quickly running out, Starks is briefly taken out of the hospital by Dr. Beth Lorenson, who he has finally convinced of his time travel experiences and his knowledge of future events. She drives Starks to the childhood home of Jackie and her mother, where he gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a lit cigarette in her hand and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks experiences a flashback to the head wound he suffered in Iraq, simultaneously slipping on the ice and hits his head. Bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time.\n\nStarks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter to Jackie's mother has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007.  She is no longer a waitress, is now dressed in a nurse's uniform, and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother \u2014 still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white and we hear Jackie's voice ask, \"How much time do we have?\", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question, in this new future, is given by the words of the song \"[[We Have All the Time in the World]]\" sung by [[Iggy Pop]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Jack Starks\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Jackie Price\n** [[Laura Marano]] as Young Jackie\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Dr. Thomas Becker\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Dr. Beth Lorenson\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Jean Price\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as The Stranger\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Rudy Mackenzie\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Dr. Hopkins\n* [[Brendan Coyle]] as Damon\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Nurse Hardling\n* [[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]] as Officer Harrison\n* [[Richard Dillane]] as Captain Medley\n* [[Jonah Lotan]] and [[Angel Coulby]] as Interns\n* [[Paul Birchard]] as Doctor\n* [[Nigel Whitmey]] as Lieutenant\n* [[Ian Porter (actor)|Ian Porter]] as Major\n* Anthony Edridge as Dr. Morgan\n* [[Kerry Shale]] as Prosecutor\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Judge\n* [[Richard Durden]] as Dr. Hale\n* [[Tristan Gemmill]] as Officer Nash\n* [[Colin Stinton]] as Jury Foreman\n* [[Tara Summers]] as Nurse Nina\n* Angelo Andreou as Babak\n* [[Teresa Gallagher]] as Nurse Sally\n* Anne Kidd as State Representative\n* Charneh Demir as Jamite\n* Frances Brady-Stewart as Woman with Dog\n* Lolly Susi as Nurse\n* [[Garrick Hagon]] as Defense Lawyer\n* [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] as Jimmy Fleisher\n}}\n\n==Background==\n''The Jacket'' shares its title, and the idea of a person experiencing extra-corporeal time-travel while in an intolerably tight straitjacket, with a 1915 novel by [[Jack London]]. The novel was published in the United Kingdom as ''The Jacket'' and in the United States of America as ''[[The Star Rover]]''. Director Maybury has said that the film is \"loosely based on a true story that became a Jack London story\".<ref name=maybury /> The true story is that of [[Edward Morrell|Ed Morrell]], who told London about San Quentin prison's inhumane use of tight straitjackets.<ref>''The 25th Man: The Strange Story of Ed.
