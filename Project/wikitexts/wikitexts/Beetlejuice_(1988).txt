Pictures]], and starring [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Geena Davis]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Winona Ryder]], and [[Michael Keaton]] as the titular character. The plot revolves around a recently deceased couple who, as ghosts haunting their former home, contact Betelgeuse (pronounced and occasionally spelled Beetlejuice in the film), an obnoxious and devious \"[[Biology|bio]]-[[exorcist]]\" from the Netherworld, to scare away the house's new inhabitants.\n\n''Beetlejuice'' was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$74.2 million from a budget of US$15 million. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] and three [[Saturn Awards]]: [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Makeup]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Sylvia Sidney]]. The film's success spawned an [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|animated television series]], video games, and a 2018 [[Beetlejuice (musical)|stage musical]]. A sequel is currently in development.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn Winter River, [[Connecticut]], Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic country home. As they are driving home from a trip to town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into the river. After returning home, she and Adam notice they now lack reflections and find the book ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased''.\n\nThey begin to suspect they did not survive the car accident. When Adam attempts to leave the house, he ends up in a strange and otherworldly [[desert]]-like landscape populated by enormous sandworms.\n\nThe house is sold and the new owners, the Deetz family, arrive from [[New York City]]. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his second wife Delia is a self-proclaimed sculptor; and his teenage [[Goth subculture|goth]] daughter Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of [[interior designer]] Otho, the family transforms the house into a pastel-toned work of [[Modern Art|modern art]].\n\nConsulting the ''Handbook'', the Maitlands travel to an otherworldly waiting room populated by other distressed souls where they discover the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworkers]]. The Maitlands' caseworker Juno informs them they must remain in the house for the next one hundred and twenty five years on pain of a dire fate. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away.\n\nAlthough Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, Lydia can see the [[ghost]] couple and befriends them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant <!-- LONGSTANDING CONSENSUS IS TO USE BEETLEJUICE, NOT Betelguese. A NEW CONSENSUS IS NEEDED TO CHANGE IT.

At first, they are unaware his name is pronounced \"Beetlejuice\", which is why they have such difficulty pronouncing it and thereby summoning him.\n\nHowever, <!-- LONGSTANDING CONSENSUS IS TO USE BEETLEJUICE, NOT Betelguese.

SEE TALK PAGE AND ARCHIVES. --> quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor: they reconsider hiring him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the ''Handbook for the Recently Deceased'', Otho conducts what he ''thinks'' is a [[s\u00e9ance]] and [[Law of contagion|summons Adam and Barbara, using their wedding clothes]], but they begin to age and decay as Otho had unwittingly performed an [[exorcism]] instead.\n\nHorrified, Lydia summons <!-- LONGSTANDING CONSENSUS IS TO USE BEETLEJUICE, NOT Betelguese.

He saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].

Considering the scale and scope of the effects, which included [[stop motion]], replacement animation, prosthetic makeup, puppetry and [[Chroma key|blue screen]], it was always Burton's intention to make the style similar to the [[B movie]]s he grew up with as a child. \"I wanted to make them look cheap and purposely fake-looking\", Burton remarked.{{sfn|Salisbury|Burton|2006| pp=61\u20136}} Burton had wanted to hire [[Anton Furst]] as production designer after being impressed with his work on ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984) and ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), though Furst was committed to ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'', a choice he later regretted.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hughes |first=David |title=Comic Book Movies |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-7535-0767-6 |page=38}}</ref> He hired [[Bo Welch]], his future collaborator on ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).

''Beetlejuice.'' Warner Bros.

In this version of the script, Betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which he is free to wreak havoc; he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times, and wanders the world freely, appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations. McDowell's script also featured a second Deetz child, nine-year-old Cathy, the only person able to see the Maitlands and the subject of Betelgeuse's homicidal wrath in the film's climax, during which he mutilates her while in the form of a rabid squirrel before revealing his true form.<ref name=2nddraft />\n\nIn another version of the script, the film was to have concluded with the Maitlands, Deetzes, and Otho conducting an exorcism ritual that destroys Betelgeuse, and the Maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into Adam's model of their home, which they refurbish to look like their house before the Deetzes moved in.\n\nCo-author and producer Larry Wilson has talked about the negative reaction to McDowell's original script at [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] where he was employed at the time:\n\n{{blockquote|I won't name names here, but I worked at Universal Studios at the time. I was director of development for the director [[Walter Hill]]. I had a very good relationship with a very prominent executive at Universal. He liked me, and he liked what I was doing with Walter, and the material I was bringing in.\n\nI gave him ''Beetlejuice'' to read, and I gave it to him on a Friday, and on Monday his assistant called me and said well, he wants to meet with you. My initial reaction was wow! He'd read it. He must have loved it or he wouldn't have wanted to see me so soon. But I went into his office, and he literally said \"what are you doing with your career?\"\n\n\"This piece of weirdness, this is what you're going to go out into the world with? You're developing into a very good executive. You've got great taste in material. Why are you going to squander all that for this piece of shit\", was basically what he was saying. It goes to show, right? Shortly after that, we sold it to the Geffen Company.<ref>Brew, Simon (2014).

Skaaren had Barbara and Adam encounter different limbos every time they leave their home, including the \"clock world\", and the Sandworm's world, identified as Saturn's moon Titan. Skaaren also introduced the ''[[leitmotif]]'' of music accompanying Barbara and Adam's ghostly hijinks, although his script specified [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] tunes instead of [[Harry Belafonte]],<ref name=Skaaren /> and was to have concluded with Lydia dancing to \"[[When a Man Loves a Woman (song)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]\".\n\nSkaaren's first draft retained some of the more sinister characteristics of McDowell's Betelgeuse, but toned down the character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse's true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in [[African-American Vernacular English]]. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia's help, transform the exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. It also would have featured deleted scenes such as the real-estate agent, Jane, trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place\u2014Charles and Delia decline), and a revelation on how Beetlejuice had died centuries earlier (that he had attempted to hang himself while drunk, only to mess it up and died slowly choking to death, rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and wound-up working for Juno before striking it out on his own as a \"[[Freelancer|free-lance]] Bio-[[Exorcist]]\".\n\nRetrospectively, McDowell was impressed at how many people made the connection between the film's title and the star [[Betelgeuse]].<ref name=\"schaaf\">{{Cite book |last=Schaaf |first=Fred |title=The Brightest Stars |publisher=Wiley |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-471-70410-2 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |pages=175\u201376 |chapter=Betelgeuse}}</ref> He added that the writers and producers had received a suggestion the sequel be named ''Sanduleak -69 202'' after [[Sanduleak -69 202|the former star]] of [[SN 1987A]].\n\n=== Filming ===\nWhile the setting is the fictional village of Winter River, [[Connecticut]], all outdoor scenes were filmed in East Corinth, a village in the [[New England town#Characteristics of the New England town system|town]] of [[Corinth, Vermont]].<ref>{{Cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> writers |date=2013-02-20 |title=15 famous fictional New England locales |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/2013/02/20/famous-fictional-new-england-locales/gnWtJIWaeGbmmtjjIGzAXO/story.html?pg=15 |url-status=live |access-date=2019-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225110120/http://www.boston.com/ae/2013/02/20/famous-fictional-new-england-locales/gnWtJIWaeGbmmtjjIGzAXO/story.html?pg=15 |archive-date=December 25, 2013}}</ref> Interiors were filmed at [[The Culver Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]].
