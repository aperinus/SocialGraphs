It was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]]. It was written by Malcolm Marmorstein and is based on characters created by [[Alexander Key]], who also wrote the novelization of the film for Disney. [[Ike Eisenmann]], [[Kim Richards]], and [[Denver Pyle]] reprise their roles as Tony, Tia, and Uncle Ben\u00e9\u2014[[humanoid]] [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] with special powers including [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]. The two main villains are played by [[Bette Davis]] as Letha Wedge, a greedy woman using the last of her money to finance the scientific experiments of Dr. Victor Gannon, played by [[Christopher Lee]]. It was the final film of actor [[Jack Soo]], who died of cancer in January 1979.\n\nIn September 1978, the film was re-released to theaters on a [[Double feature|double bill]] with ''Escape to Witch Mountain''.\n\nA [[television film]] called ''[[Beyond Witch Mountain]]'' was made in 1982.\n\n== Plot ==\nTony and his sister Tia are in need of a vacation. Uncle Ben\u00e9 drops them off in their [[flying saucer]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] in Los Angeles, California, after which the siblings quickly become separated from each other. A man named Dr. Victor Gannon (Lee) and his assistant Letha Wedge (Davis) happen to see Tony using his powers to save Letha's nephew Sickle from certain death. Realizing that Tony has supernatural powers, Dr. Gannon drugs the boy with a tranquilizer shot and takes him back to their laboratory. There, Dr. Gannon successfully tests a new mind-control technology on him. Under its influence, Tony is completely hypnotized and does everything that his kidnappers want him to do, including stealing gold from a museum exhibit and stopping Tia from finding them. With Tony at his robotic bidding, Dr. Gannon hopes to achieve recognition within the scientific community and worldwide power, while Letha merely wants a return on her investment.\n\nA group of would-be tough boys whom Tia comes across, called the Earthquake Gang, are being chased by the Golden Goons, in which Tia then telepathically gets rid of them. The gang of boys accept her into their gang and help her look for her brother. They let her sleep in their secret hideout, where she often gets many visions of where her brother is; first at the gold museum where Tony is controlled by a chip attached to his ear. He unstacks the gold but is followed by Mr. Yokomoto, the [[truant]] officer who thinks Tony should go to school, and chases the doctor, aunt, nephew, and Tony in his minibus unsuccessfully. As a result, Mr. Yokomoto destroyed public property and ends up losing his job.\n\nUsing her telepathy to find Tony, Tia discovers his captors' hideout but is caught by Sickle using [[chloroform]] and is placed in an anaesthesia chamber by Gannon. Unable to move, Tia telepathically asks Alfred the goat to find the Earthquake Gang. They chase the goat back to the hideout and free Tia as Tony, Letha, Sickle, and Victor drive to a plant to steal plutonium. Tia traces their location and describes it to be a \"big round ball.\" One of the members assume the location to be another place, and Tia is upset. They come across Mr. Yokomoto, who tells them that he lost his job and the only thing that works is the radio. The news given about the plutonium plant stresses on the word \"molecular flow.\"\n\nTia then asks Mr. Yokomoto to drive them to the location after she magically repairs the minibus. After Victor and his gang reach the site, he shuts down the plant's cooling system. In exchange for turning it on, he requires 5 million dollars in cash. The people working at the plant make arrangements for the money as soon as possible, but Tia reaches the site in time, where she and Tony battle to turn on the cooling system. Tia manages to turn it on, but Victor commands Tony to kill his sister. In this course of time, she understands how he is being controlled and destroys the device. Tia explains what had happened to him, in which Tony makes Victor, Sickle and Letha go up to the ceiling with no way of getting down. Mr. Yokomoto drives the kids to the Rose Bowl Stadium and the Earthquake Gang come along to say bye. Tony and Tia bid farewell to the kids after they board the flying saucer and go back to Witch Mountain.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Letha Wedge\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Dr. Victor Gannon\n* [[Kim Richards]] as Tia Malone\n* [[Ike Eisenmann]] as Tony Malone\n* [[Jack Soo]] as Mr. \"Yo-Yo\" Yokomoto\n* [[Anthony James (actor)|Anthony James]] as Sickle\n* [[Richard Bakalyan]] as Eddie\n* [[Ward Costello]] as Mr. Clearcole\n* [[Christian Juttner]] as Dazzler\n* [[Brad Savage]] as Muscles\n* [[Poindexter Yothers]] as Crusher\n* [[Jeffrey Jacquet]] as Rocky\n* [[Stu Gilliam]] as Dolan\n* [[William Bassett (actor)|William Bassett]] as Operations officer\n* Tom Scott as Monitor\n* [[Helene Winston]] as Dowager\n* [[Albert Able]] as Engineer\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Uncle Ben\u00e9\n* [[Brian Part]], [[Pierre Daniel]] as Goons\n* Wally Brooks as Taxi fare\n* Mel Gold as Security guard\n* Bob Yothers as Cop\n* Casse Jaeger as School patrolman\n* Larry Mamorstein as Guard\n* Bob James as Gate guard\n* Ruth Warshawsky as Lady in car\n* Adam Anderson as Man in museum\n* Rosemary Lord as Woman in museum\n* Ted Noose as Policeman\n* Wally Berns as Man in car\n{{div col end}}\n\nActors Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann appear in at least four films together\u2014this one, the original 1975 Disney film ''Escape to Witch Mountain'', and the television film ''[[Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell]]''.
