The plot is about a group of Italian [[treasure hunters]] who set on a journey to find long-forgotten treasure in [[Leningrad]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\nIn a hospital in [[Rome]], a poor 92-year-old [[white \u00e9migr\u00e9]] lies on her deathbed. She reveals to her granddaughter Olga there is a treasure worth 9 billion [[Italian lira|Italian lire]] buried \"underneath a lion\" in [[Leningrad]]. However, the story is overheard by the woman's attending physician, two [[male nurse]]s named Antonio and Giuseppe, an [[Italian mafia|mafioso]] named Rosario, and a patient with a broken leg. All six of the characters fly to Leningrad to hunt for the treasure.\n\nThe mafioso steals the doctor's passport who is forced to make round trips from Russia to Italy since neither country will accept him. Antonio and Giuseppe are soon joined by Andrei, an undercover captain of the Soviet [[militsiya]] who poses as a tour guide for Antonio, who purports to grant Antonio free tours on the basis that he is \"the millionth Italian visitor\". Olga doesn't plan to share her treasure with anyone and runs away, but agrees to join forces with Andrei, while Rosario the mafioso continues his attempts to eliminate the competition. They start digging up lion statues all over Leningrad, which is a city well known for its many lion monuments.<ref>[http://www.visit-petersburg.ru/en/route/3/ \u00abLions guard the city\u00bb route] at the Visit Petersburg official city guide</ref>\n\nThey eventually find the treasure hidden underneath a lion cage at a zoo, but the lion starts chasing them through Leningrad. After making a successful escape they are confronted by the police who confiscate the treasure, which belongs to the state under the Soviet law. Nonetheless, they are awarded 25% of the value of the treasure as a reward for finding it. The now-wealthy adventurers part their ways and return to Italy, but Olga decides to stay with Andrei in the end.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]] \u2014 Andrei Vasiliev\n* [[Ninetto Davoli]] \u2014 Giuseppe (voiced by [[Mikhail Kononov]])\n* [[Antonia Santilli]] \u2014 Olga (voiced by [[Natalia Gurzo]])\n* [[Alighiero Noschese]] \u2014 Antonio Lo Mazzo (voiced by [[Aleksandr Borisovich Belyavskiy|Aleksandr Belyavskiy]])\n* [[Tano Cimarosa]] \u2014 Rosario Agr\u00f2 (voiced by [[Mikhail Gluzsky]])\n* [[Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev]] \u2014 Lame man\n* [[Olga Aroseva]] \u2014 Andrey's mother\n* Lion named [[King (lion)|King]]\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\n[[Eldar Ryazanov]] dreamed of working with [[Italia]]n filmmakers and in 1970 wrote a pitch for a comedy ''Spaghetti Russian-style'' with [[Emil Braginsky]], but [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino]] officials didn't like it as they found the Italian characters too [[anti-Italianism|stereotypical]]. Same year [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] finished ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' co-produced by [[Mosfilm]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]] who ended owning Mosfilm a lot of money and suggested to return it by producing a light cheap comedy. This is when Ryazanov and Braginsky were contacted.<ref name='afa'>''Olga Afanasyeva (2016)''. Eldar Ryazanov.

As Ryazonov wrote, he originally planned something in the vein of ''[[Cops and Robbers (1951 film)|Cops and Robbers]]'' and his own ''[[Beware of the Car]]'', with [[Alberto Sordi]] as a small Italian fraud and [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] as a Russian policeman attached, but Italian co-authors saw this idea as old-fashioned and sentimental and asked for a fast-paced commercial comedy.<ref name='eldar'>''[[Eldar Ryazanov]] (2010)''.

The final script was inspired by the comedy ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' which Ryazanov watched the same night at the hotel.<ref name='afa' />\n\n===Shooting===\nIt was Ryazanov's original intention to make a stunt-based comedy completely avoiding [[compositing]], thus only practical effects were used.<ref name='eldar'/> The episode with a plane landing on a [[M1 highway (Russia)|M1 highway]] among passing cars which parodied a scene from ''[[The Sicilian Clan]]'' was the hardest to make. It had to be shot at the [[Ulyanovsk Baratayevka Airport]] disguised as a highway since no road surface was hard enough for such task. The stunt was performed by a pilot and a deputy chief of the [[Ulyanovsk Institute of Civil Aviation]] Ivan Tarashan.<ref name='afa'/><ref name='eldar'/>\n\nAnother episode with a [[filling station]] blowing up and various station and car parts flying in the air parodied [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' and was also shot without [[chroma key]] or [[miniature effect]]s, although the station itself was a mere replica empty from inside.<ref name='eldar'/>\n\nMost of the stunts during the car chasing scenes were performed by the acclaimed Italian racer and stuntman Sergio Mioni.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591863/ Sergio Mioni] at [[IMDb]]</ref> Actors [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]] and [[Ninetto Davoli]] did a number of risky tricks by themselves, including the scene with a [[moveable bridge]] where Davoli made a long jump with a suitcase in his hand while Mironov had to hang for awhile holding tight into one part of the bridge to pose for a close-up.<ref name='afa'/>\n\n===Lion King===\nFor a real lion Ryazanov called [[:ru:\u0411\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Lev Berberov]], a [[Baku]] engineer famous for raising several wild animals in his flat including a lion named King. Berberov insisted that more scenes and tricks with King should be added to the script. Yet it turned out the lion was hardly capable of even simplest tasks and didn't pay attention to anyone. Ryazanov described it as \"untrained, ignorant and dull as it seemed\" and the whole experience \u2014 as exhausting; during the first scene King scratched [[Ninetto Davoli]] which left all actors terrified.<ref name='eldar'/><ref name='hutch'>''ed. by Steve Hutchings (2008)''.
