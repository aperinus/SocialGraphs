The original music score was composed by [[Quincy Jones]]. The cinematography for the film was by [[Charles Lang]]. The film received four [[Academy Award]] nominations, including ones for Gould and Cannon. Patricia Welles wrote the paperback novel from Mazursky and Tucker's screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\n\nAfter a weekend of emotional honesty at an [[Esalen Institute|Esalen]]-style retreat, Los Angeles sophisticates Bob and Carol Sanders return home determined to embrace complete openness. They share their enthusiasm and excitement over their new-found philosophy with their more conservative friends Ted and Alice Henderson, who remain doubtful. Soon after, filmmaker Bob has an affair with a young production assistant on a film shoot in San Francisco. When he returns home, he admits his liaison to Carol, describing the event as a purely physical act, not an emotional one. To Bob's surprise, Carol is completely accepting of his extramarital behavior. Later, Carol gleefully reveals the affair to Ted and Alice as they are leaving a dinner party. Disturbed by Bob's infidelity and Carol's candor, Alice becomes physically ill on the drive home. She and Ted have a difficult time coping with the news in bed that night. However, as time passes, they grow to accept that Bob and Carol really are fine with the affair. Later, Ted admits to Bob that he was tempted to have an affair once, but did not go through with it; Bob tells Ted he should, rationalizing: \"You've got the guilt anyway. Don't waste it.\"\n\nDuring another visit to San Francisco, Bob decides to skip a second encounter with the young woman, instead returning home a day early. When he arrives, he discovers Carol having an affair with her tennis instructor. Although initially outraged, Bob quickly realizes that the encounter was purely physical, like his own affair. He settles down and even chats and drinks with the man.\n\nWhen the two couples travel together to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Bob and Carol reveal Carol's affair to Ted and Alice. Ted then admits to an affair on a recent business trip to Miami. An outraged Alice demands that this new ethos be taken to its obvious conclusion: a [[Wife swapping|mate-sharing foursome]]. Ted is reluctant, explaining that he loves Carol \"like a sister\", but eventually acknowledges that he finds her attractive. After discussing it, all four remove their clothes and climb into bed together. Swapping partners, Bob and Alice kiss fervently, as do Ted and Carol, but after a few moments all four simply stop.\n\nThe scene cuts to the couples walking to the elevator, riding it down, and walking out of the casino hand-in-hand with their original partners. A crowd of men and women of various cultures and races congregate in the casino parking lot, wherein the four main characters exchange long stares with each other and with strangers, reminiscent of the non-verbal communication shown in the early scene at the retreat.\n\n==Cast==\n\n[[File:Opdracht Columbia Film .

Mazursky would write and shoot a few more stories set in California, including ''[[Alex in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]''.\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' panned the film as \"unpleasant because it acts superior to the people in it, which is no mean feat because Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice are conceived as cheerful but humorless boobs, no more equipped to deal with their sexual liberation than [[I Love Lucy|Lucy and Desi]] and [[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet|Ozzie and Harriet]].\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby|first= Vincent|author-link=Vincent Canby|date=September 17, 1969|title=' Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' Twits 'New Morality'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=50}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', however, gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"The genius of 'Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice' is that it understands the peculiar nature of the moral crisis for Americans in this age group, and understands that the way to consider it is in a comedy.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bob-and-carol-and-ted-and-alice-1969 |title=Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=December 22, 1969 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |access-date=April 21, 2019 |archive-date=October 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031063835/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bob-and-carol-and-ted-and-alice-1969 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"a scintillating social comedy and a movie which could turn out to have more to say about you than any flick you'll see this year.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Champlin|first=Charles|author-link=Charles Champlin|date=November 2, 1969|title='Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice' Is a Social Comedy|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=1 (Calendar)}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half-stars out of four and called it \"the best comedy of the year,\" with acting that was \"eminently tender and believable.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Siskel|first=Gene|author-link=Gene Siskel|date=December 21, 1969|title=Bob & Carol Etc.
