Gil is struggling to finish his debut novel, about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, and finds himself drawn to the rich artistic history of Paris, especially the [[Lost Generation]] of the 1920s. Inez dismisses his ambitions to move to Paris and write as a delusional dream and encourages him to stick with more lucrative screenwriting assignments. By chance, they meet Inez's friend Paul and his wife Carol, and Inez invites them to join her and Gil as they sightsee. Paul speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on every subject they encounter, even contradicting a tour guide at the [[Mus\u00e9e Rodin]], where he insists his knowledge of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] relationships is more accurate than the guide's.  Gil finds him pedantic and annoying, yet Inez adores him.\n\nA night of wine tasting gets Gil drunk, and he decides to walk the streets of Paris to return to the hotel; Inez goes off with Paul and Carol by taxi. Gil stops to get his bearings, and at midnight, a 1920s [[Peugeot Type 176|car]] pulls up beside him. The passengers urge him to join them and he finds himself at a party for [[Jean Cocteau]] attended by notable people of the 1920s Paris art scene: [[Cole Porter]], his wife Linda Lee Porter, and [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Zelda gets bored and encourages Scott and Gil to leave with her. They first head to Bricktops, where they see [[Josephine Baker]] dancing, and then to a cafe where they run into [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Juan Belmonte]]. After Zelda and Scott leave, Gil and Hemingway discuss writing, and Hemingway offers to show Gil's novel to [[Gertrude Stein]]. But as Gil exits the building to fetch his manuscript from his hotel, he returns to 2010: the cafe where he encountered Hemingway is now a laundromat.\n\nThe next night, Gil tries to share  his time-travel experience with Inez, but she ditches Gil before the clock strikes midnight. When it does, the same car returns. Gil joins Hemingway on his way to visit Gertrude Stein\u2019s apartment, where Gil is introduced to Stein, who is in the midst of giving [[Pablo Picasso]] a negative critique of a new painting of Picasso\u2019s lover Adriana. Gil is instantly drawn to Adriana, a costume designer who has also had affairs with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Georges Braque]]. Stein reads aloud the novel's first line:<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/film/midnight-paris | title= Midnight in Paris: Woody Allen | date= December 24, 2011 | publisher= No Ripcord | access-date= 2012-02-09 | archive-date= March 10, 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310020429/http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/film/midnight-paris | url-status= live }}</ref>\n{{Blockquote|'Out of the Past' was the name of the store, and its products consisted of memories: what was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also [[camp (style)|camp]].}} Adriana praises his writing, and admits that she has always had a longing for the past, especially the [[Belle \u00c9poque]].\n\nBack in 2010, Gil continues his time travel for the next couple of nights. Inez is unimpressed with the boulevards and bistros and Gil's disappearing, while her father is suspicious and hires a [[Private investigator|private detective]] to follow him. Adriana leaves Picasso and continues to bond with Gil, although he is conflicted by his attraction to her. Gil explains his inner conflict to [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Man Ray]], and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], but as [[Surrealism|surrealists]], they find nothing unusual about his claim of coming from the future. Gil later suggests the plot of the film ''[[The Exterminating Angel]]'' to Bu\u00f1uel, which he doesn't understand.\n\nInez and her parents are traveling to [[Mont Saint Michel]] while Gil meets Gabrielle, an antique dealer and fellow admirer of the [[Lost Generation]]. He buys a Cole Porter [[gramophone record]] from her and later finds at a book stall by the [[Seine]] Adriana's diary from the 1920s, which reveals that she was in love with him. Reading that she dreamed of receiving a gift of earrings from him and then making love to him, Gil tries to steal a pair of Inez's earrings to give to Adriana, but is thwarted by Inez's early return to the hotel room.\n\nGil buys earrings for Adriana and returns to the past. He takes Adriana for a walk, they kiss, and he gives her the earrings. While she's putting them on, a horse-drawn carriage comes down the street, and a richly dressed couple inside the carriage invite Gil and Adriana for a ride. The carriage transports the passengers to the [[Belle \u00c9poque]], an era Adriana considers Paris's [[Golden Age]]. Gil and Adriana go first to [[Maxim's Paris]], then to the [[Moulin Rouge]] where they meet [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Edgar Degas]]. Gil asks what they believe the best era was, and the three agree it is the [[Renaissance]]. The excited Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes and proposes to Gil that they stay, but Gil, upon observing the unhappiness of Adriana and the other artists, realizes that chasing nostalgia is fruitless because life, and thus, the present, is always \"a little unsatisfying.\" Adriana, however, decides to stay in the 1890s, and they part ways.\n\nGil rewrites the first two chapters of his novel and retrieves his draft from Stein, who praises his progress as a writer and tells him that Hemingway likes it but questions why the main character has not realized that his fianc\u00e9e, based on Inez, is having an affair with a character based on Paul.\n\nGil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez. She admits to having slept with Paul, but disregards it as a meaningless fling and that they can discuss it after their wedding. Gil breaks up with her and decides to move to Paris. Walking by the Seine at midnight, Gil bumps into Gabrielle; he offers to walk her home after it starts to rain. They learn that they share a love for Paris in the rain.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Main Cast'''\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=24em|\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Gil Pender\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Inez\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Adriana, fictionalised mistress of Picasso\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as F.

Scott Fitzgerald|F. Scott]] and [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], and uses the phrase \"a moveable feast\" in two instances, with a copy of the book appearing in one scene. Allen originally wrote the character Gil as an East Coast intellectual, but he rethought it when he and casting director Juliet Taylor began considering Owen Wilson for the role.<ref name='Allen'/> \"I thought Owen would be charming and funny but my fear was that he was not so Eastern at all in his persona,\" says Allen. Allen realized that making Gil a Californian would actually make the character richer, so he rewrote the part and submitted it to Wilson, who readily agreed to do it.

He describes that he likes it (the [[cinematography]]), \"intensely red, intensely warm, because if you go to a restaurant and you're there with your wife or your girlfriend, and it's got red-flecked wallpaper and turn-of-the-century lights, you both look beautiful. Whereas if you're in a seafood restaurant and the lights are up, everybody looks terrible. So it looks nice. It's very flattering and very lovely.\"<ref name=\"buzzinefilm1\"/> To achieve this he and his cinematographer, Darius Khondji, used primarily warm colors in the film's photography, filmed in flatter weather and employed limited camera movements, in attempts to draw little attention to itself. This is the first Woody Allen film to go through a [[digital intermediate]], instead of being [[color grading|color timed]] in the traditional photochemical way. According to Allen, its use here is a test to see if he likes it enough to use on his future films.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Vilmos and Woody, Together Again|url=http://www.theasc.com/asc_blog/goldman/2010/11/05/vilmos-and-woody-together-again/|work=American Cinematographer|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|access-date=8 August 2012|archive-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626193248/http://www.theasc.com/asc_blog/goldman/2010/11/05/vilmos-and-woody-together-again/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAllen's directorial style placed more emphasis on the romantic and realistic elements of the film than the fantasy elements.
