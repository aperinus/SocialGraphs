Written by [[Steve Tesich]], it is based on the 1978 novel ''[[The World According to Garp]]'' by [[John Irving]]. For their roles, [[John Lithgow]] and [[Glenn Close]] (in her film debut) were respectively nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] at the [[55th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nT.S. Garp is the out-of-wedlock son of a [[Feminism|feminist]] mother, Jenny Fields, who wanted a child but not a husband. A nurse during World War II, she encounters a dying [[ball turret]] gunner known only as [[Technical Sergeant]] Garp (\"Garp\" being all he is able to utter) who was severely brain damaged in combat, whose morbid [[priapism]] allows her to [[Rape of males|rape]] him and [[Sperm theft|get impregnated]]. She names the resultant child after Garp.\n\nGarp grows up and becomes interested in wrestling and fiction writing, topics his mother has little interest in. Garp's writing piques the interest of Helen Holm, the daughter of the school's wrestling coach. She is wary of him. His mother observes his interest in sex and is intellectually curious about it, having little more than clinical interest herself. She interviews a prostitute and offers to hire her for Garp. Immediately after, Jenny decides to write a book on her observations of lust and human sexuality.\n\nHer book is a partial autobiography, called ''Sexual Suspect'', and is an overnight sensation. Jenny becomes a feminist icon. She uses the proceeds from the book to fund a center at her home for troubled and abused women. Meanwhile, Garp's first novel is published, which impresses Helen. The two marry and eventually have two children, Duncan and Walt. Garp becomes a devoted parent and successful fiction writer, while Helen becomes a college professor.\n\nGarp spends time visiting his mother and the people who live at her center, including [[transgender]] ex-[[American football|football]] player Roberta Muldoon. He also first hears the story of Ellen James, a girl who was [[rape]]d at the age of eleven by two men who then cut out her tongue so that she could not identify her attackers. A group of women represented at Jenny's center, \"Ellen Jamesians,\" voluntarily cut out their own tongues as a show of solidarity. Garp is horrified by the practice and learns that the Jamesians have received a letter from Ellen James begging them to stop the practice, but they have voted to continue. Garp flirts with and possibly seduces his children's 18-year-old babysitter while driving her home.\n\nHaving learned about his wife's infidelity with one of her students, Garp rushes home with his children in the back seat and crashes into his wife's lover's car parked in their driveway, while his wife is in the car performing [[fellatio]] on the student. As a result, Walt is killed and Duncan loses an eye. Garp, through the aid of his mother, learns to forgive himself and his wife. The couple reconcile and have a baby daughter they name after Jenny.\n\nJenny receives death threats because of both her center and her book. To Garp's dismay, she dismisses the danger and decides to publicly endorse a politician who supports her message. Garp writes a book about the life of Ellen James and its aftermath. The book is very successful and well-regarded, but is highly critical of the Jamesians. Garp begins receiving death threats from them himself.\n\nDuring a political rally, Jenny is shot and killed by an anti-feminist fanatic. The women of Jenny's center hold a memorial for her, but forbid all men from attending. Garp, dressed as a woman, is infiltrated into the memorial by Muldoon. He is identified by Pooh, a Jamesian he knew when they both were in school. A commotion breaks out and Garp is in danger of being hurt, until a woman leads him out of the memorial to a taxi. The woman reveals herself to be Ellen James, and uses the gesture to thank Garp for his book about her. The Jamesians are further outraged that Garp attended the memorial.\n\nGarp returns to his old school as the wrestling coach. One day during practice, Pooh enters the gymnasium and shoots him at close range with a pistol. Garp is airlifted by helicopter with his wife. He flashes back to an earlier time when his mother would toss him into the air.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as T.S.
