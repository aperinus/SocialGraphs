The film mixes hyper-realism with an underlying [[surrealism]], and philosophical [[existentialism]] with poetical, psychological, political and apocalyptic themes.\n\n''Come and See'' received generally positive critical reception upon release, and received the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI]] prize at the [[14th Moscow International Film Festival]]. It has since come to be considered one of the greatest films of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1943, two [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] boys dig in a sand-filled trench looking for abandoned rifles in order to join the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] forces. Their village elder warns them not to dig up the weapons as it would arouse the suspicions of the [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|occupying Germans]]. One of the boys, Flyora, finds an [[SVT-40]] rifle, though both of them are seen by an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Uhu|Fw 189]] flying overhead.[[File:Focke Wulf Fw189.jpg|thumb|A [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189]]]]. A single [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance aircraft]] of this model repeatedly appears in scenes flying above Flyora's head throughout ''Come and See''. The model used in the film was originally a remote controlled toy plane.\n\nThe next day two partisans arrive at Flyora's house, to [[Conscription|conscript]] him. One confusingly wears a German military police uniform complete with helmet. Flyora becomes a low-rank [[militia]]man and is ordered to perform menial tasks. When the partisans are ready to move on, the partisan commander, Kosach, says that Flyora is to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, a young girl working as a nurse in the camp, and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|German paratroopers]] and [[dive bomber]]s.\n\nFlyora is partially deafened from the explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers. Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a [[bog]]. As they run from the village in the direction of the bogland, Glasha glances across her shoulder, seeing a pile of executed villagers' bodies stacked behind a house, but does not alert Flyora.\n\nThe two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha then screams at Flyora that his family is actually dead in the village, resulting in the latter attempting to drown her. They are soon met by Rubezh, a partisan fighter, who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Flyora sees the village elder, badly burnt by the Germans, who tells him that he witnessed his family's execution and that he should not have dug up the rifles. Flyora, hearing this, then attempts suicide out of guilt, but Glasha and the villagers save and comfort him.\n\nRubezh takes Flyora and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops. During their retreat, the group unknowingly wanders through a [[minefield]] resulting in the deaths of the two companions. That evening Rubezh and Flyora sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer. As they escape across an open field, Rubezh and the cow are shot and killed by a German [[machine gun]]. The next morning, Flyora attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Flyora's identity when [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops approach.\n\nFlyora is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while the SS unit, accompanied by collaborators from the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and [[Schutzmannschaft Batallion 118]], surround and occupy the village. Flyora tries to warn the townsfolk as they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a wooden church. Flyora and a young girl are allowed to escape the church, but the latter is dragged by her hair across the ground and into a truck to be [[gang rape]]d. Flyora is forced to watch as several [[Molotov cocktail]]s and grenades are thrown onto and within the church before it is further set ablaze with a flamethrower as other soldiers shoot into the building. A German officer points a gun to Flyora's head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground as the soldiers leave.\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Klara Hitler.jpg\n| image2 = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild retouched.jpg\n| footer = The two photos (Klara; left, and Adolf; right) merged by Klimov to create the picture that Flyora stops shooting at\n}}\nFlyora later wanders out of the scorched village in the direction of the Germans, where he discovers they had been ambushed by the partisans. After recovering his jacket and rifle, Flyora comes across the young girl in a [[fugue state]], her legs and face covered in blood after having been gang-raped and brutalized by the soldiers. Flyora returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander, an ''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]''. While some of the captured men including the commander and main collaborator plead for their lives and deflect blame, a young fanatical officer, an ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'', is unapologetic and vows they will carry out their genocidal mission.\n\nKosach makes the collaborator douse the Germans with a can of petrol brought there by Flyora, but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire. As the partisans leave, Flyora notices a framed portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]] in a puddle and proceeds to shoot it numerous times. As he does so, a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of clips from Hitler's life play in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on [[Klara Hitler|his mother]]'s lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries.

I had been reading and rereading the book ''I Am from the Fiery Village'', which consisted of the first-hand accounts of people who miraculously survived the horrors of the fascist genocide in Belorussia. Many of them were still alive then, and Belorussians managed to record some of their memories onto film. I will never forget the face and eyes of one peasant, and his quiet recollection about how his whole village had been herded into a church, and how just before they were about to be burned, an officer gave them the offer: \"Whoever has no children can leave\". And he couldn't take it, he left, and left behind his wife and little kids&nbsp;... or about how another village was burned: the adults were all herded into a barn, but the children were left behind. And later, the drunk men surrounded them with sheepdogs and let the dogs tear the children to pieces.\n\nAnd then I thought: the world doesn't know about [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]]! They know about [[Katyn massacre|Katyn]], about the massacre of the Polish officers there. But they don't know about Belorussia. Even though more than 600 villages were burned there!\n\nAnd I decided to make a film about this tragedy. I perfectly understood that the film would end up a harsh one. I decided that the central role of the village lad Flyora would not be played by a professional actor, who upon immersion into a difficult role could have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique and skill. I wanted to find a simple boy fourteen years of age. We had to prepare him for the most difficult experiences, then capture them on film. And at the same time, we had to protect him from the stresses so that he wasn't left in the loony bin after filming was over, but was returned to his mother alive and healthy. Fortunately, with Aleksei Kravchenko, who played Flyora and who later became a good actor, everything went smoothly.\n\nI understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay coauthor, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: \"Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace.\"\n|Elem Klimov<ref name=\"aif\"/>}}\n\n{{blockquote|''Come and See'' was shot over a nine months period in the Berezinsky-reserve near the village Kamyanka.

(The movie has been compared both to ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', and it would not be surprising to learn that [[Steven Spielberg]] had screened it before making either of these.) The film's central atrocity is a barbaric circus of blaring music and barking dogs in which a squadron of drunken German soldiers round up and parade the peasants to their fiery doom&nbsp;... The bit of actual death-camp corpse footage that Klimov uses is doubly disturbing in that it retrospectively diminishes the care with which he orchestrates the town's destruction.
