The film consists of six segments produced by Japanese animation studios [[Studio 4\u00b0C]], [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], [[Bee Train]] and [[Production I.G]] in association with DC Comics and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Set between ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', the segments in the film depict [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Batman]] battling against the mob of [[Gotham City]], as well as other villains. Although stated to take place within ''The Dark Knight'' trilogy, the producers have acknowledged that the plot from the anthology is not necessarily integral to the main story told within the films. The shorts are written by [[Josh Olson]], [[David S. Goyer]], [[Brian Azzarello]], [[Greg Rucka]], [[Jordan Goldberg]] and [[Alan Burnett]]. Although all use Japanese anime art styles, each segment has its own writing and artistic style, similar to other [[DC Universe]] works and ''[[The Animatrix]]''; however, some segments are connected, giving it the nickname, \"''The Batimatrix''\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Batman: Gotham Knight | publisher = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date = December 2007 | page = 101}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-08/japanese-anime-studios-confirmed-for-batman-video |title=Japanese Anime Studios Confirmed for Batman Video |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2007-12-08 |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref> All six segments of the anthology film star [[Kevin Conroy]], reprising his voice role as [[Batman]] from the [[DC Animated Universe]].\n\nIt is the third film of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] released by [[Warner Premiere]] and Warner Bros. Animation; with the first two releases being ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'' and ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''. It is rated [[MPAA rating system|PG-13]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] for \"stylized violence, including some bloody images\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Brevet |first=Brad |url=http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/article/latest_mpaa_ratings_99 |title=Latest MPAA Ratings: #99 &#124; Movie News &#124; RopeofSilicon.com Entertainment News |publisher=Ropeofsilicon.com |date=2008-04-02 |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref> While ''Batman: Gotham Knight'' was advertised as the \"first animated Batman movie to be rated PG-13\", the unedited version of ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' (2000) is actually the first such film. This film is also notable for being the first DC Original Animated movie to have a connection with another Batman medium. While ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'' and ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' have been released in the United Kingdom with a [[British Board of Film Classification|12 rating]], ''Batman: Gotham Knight'' was instead released with a 15 rating for \"images of bloody violence and injury\". The film had its television premiere on [[Cartoon Network]] on October 4, 2008 with a [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-14-V]] rating and an exclusive parental warning after each commercial break, with a few of the more graphic scenes cut. Over a decade later, it once again aired on the network on its nighttime programming block [[Adult Swim]]'s [[Toonami]] block on August 22, 2020, in partnership with [[DC FanDome]].\n\n==Segments==\n''Batman: Gotham Knight'' is split into six segments:\n\n===''Have I Got a Story for You'' (Studio 4\u00b0C)===\n''Have I Got a Story for You'' was written by [[Josh Olson]] and animated by [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].\n\nA street kid meets with his three friends at a skate park, to which all three of them claim to have seen Batman earlier that day. Batman's battle with the Man in Black, a high-tech criminal, is told in reverse chronological order with three very different interpretations of Batman's form and abilities (in the style of the 1950 film ''[[Rashomon]]''): one describes him as a living [[shadow]] that can melt away and reappear at will (similar to the Vampire Batman from the [[Batman & Dracula trilogy|''Batman & Dracula'' trilogy]]); another describes him as a half-human, half-bat creature (similar to the [[Man-Bat]]); and lastly, one describes him as a combat [[robot]] that can leap tall buildings in a single bound. At the end, Batman pursues the Man in Black to the skate park and captures him with the help of the fourth street kid. The fourth kid is able to see what Batman truly is after seeing him sustain injuries by a grenade blast from the battle: a human warrior in a costume. He then proceeds to tell his experience about seeing Batman to his friends after Batman disappears.\n\n'''Note''': Though the film credits give \"story by\" acknowledgment to first-time writer Jordan Goldberg, Josh Olson acknowledged it was actually based on a very similar story by Frank Robbins called \"The Batman Nobody Knows\".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17021 |title=CBR News: WW Chicago: \"Batman: Gotham Knight\" World Premiere |date=29 June 2008 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref> The story was first printed in ''Batman'' #250 in 1973, and subsequently adapted as \"[[List of The New Batman Adventures episodes#Legends of the Dark Knight|Legends of the Dark Knight]]\" in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. According to Olson: \"The first time it's stealing, the second time it's borrowing, the third time you're creating a genre\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The three different versions of the Man in Black have many similarities to other members of Batman's rogues gallery, though they all resemble a member of the League of Shadows. The first story features a tech-wielding villain who has teeth similar to [[Killer Croc]], the second uses a jetpack (reminiscent of the [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]]), and the third has similarities to the villain [[Deadshot]]. Also, the Batman of the second encounter is very similar to the villain [[Man-Bat]]. When the Man in Black is seen by all the teenagers, he has no identifiable characteristics. Lastly, the story is told backwards, with the kid who claims he saw Batman most recently going first, ending with the kid who saw him first.\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Cop\n* [[Scott Menville]] as B-Devil\n* [[George Newbern]] as Jacob Feely / Man in Black\n* Corey Padnos as Porkchop\n* Crystal Scales as Meesh\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Dander\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Woman\n\n===''Crossfire'' (Production I.G)===\n''Crossfire'' was written by [[Greg Rucka]] and animated by [[Production I.G]].\n\n[[Crispus Allen]] and Anna Ramirez are partners and members of the Major Crimes Unit that have been hand-picked by [[James Gordon (character)|Lieutenant James Gordon]]. The two are assigned to take the recently captured Man in Black (who was captured previously on ''Have I Got A Story For You''), revealed to be Jacob Feely, an escaped inmate from [[Arkham Asylum]] with an expertise in advanced electronics and explosives back to Arkham Asylum (which most of the Narrows has been converted into following the events in ''Batman Begins''). On their way, they argue over whether Batman can be trusted, with Allen saying that they are just running errands for a vigilante, while Ramirez replies that Batman has changed Gotham for the better. As they are heading back, Allen declares his intention to leave the MCU and Ramirez pulls into a vacant lot to confront Allen. However, the two get caught in a very large gunfight between gangs, the [[Russian mafia|Russian Mob]] and [[Sal Maroni]]'s gang. Maroni's men are gunned down and Maroni takes refuge behind Allen and Ramirez's patrol car, which the Russian subsequently destroys with a rocket launcher. Ramirez and Maroni manage to get clear in time, while Allen is rescued by Batman who proceeds to take out the Russian and his men. Sal Maroni then threatens to kill Ramirez, but he is dispatched by Batman. Batman recognizes Allen and Ramirez as Gordon's hand-picked officers and remarks that Gordon is a good judge of character, then disappears.\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]\n* [[Ana Ortiz]] as Anna Ramirez\n* [[Corey Burton]] as Yuri Dimitrov\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as [[Crispus Allen]]\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Doctor\n* [[Scott Menville]] as Cop\n* [[Pat Musick]] as News Anchor\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as [[Sal Maroni]]\n* [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] as Dispatcher\n\n===''Field Test'' (Bee Train)===\n''Field Test'' was written by [[Jordan Goldberg]] and animated by [[Bee Train]].\n\nAn accident involving a new WayneCom satellite's gyroscopic [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] guidance system gives [[Lucius Fox]] an idea to create a device with the satellite's gyro with an advanced sound sensor that will electromagnetically deflect small-arms fire. Bruce Wayne takes the device and attends a charity golf tournament being held by land developer Ronald Marshall, with whom he discusses the mysterious death of a community activist named Teresa Williams, who had opposed some of Marshall's plans. During the tournament, Wayne secretly takes Marshall's [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] device. Later that night as Batman, he hijacks a boat owned by Sal Maroni and drives it alongside a boat owned by the Russian Mob's leader, the Russian, and proceeds to attack both gangs at once with assistance from his new device. He attempts to force a truce between the two gang leaders until he can get evidence against them and that Sal Maroni and the Russian can then argue who gets the top bunk at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]. The discussion is disrupted when one of Maroni's men fires at him. The bullet deflects and instead hits one of the Russian's men. Distressed, Batman takes the injured man to the hospital. Later, he returns the device to Fox, stating: \"...It works too well: I'm willing to put my life on the line to do what I have to. But it has to be mine, no one else's.\"\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Corey Burton]] as Yuri Dimitrov, Ronald Marshall\n* [[Will Friedle]] as Anton\n* [[George Newbern]] as Guido\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as [[Sal Maroni]]\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as [[Lucius Fox]]\n\n===''In Darkness Dwells'' (Madhouse)===\n''In Darkness Dwells'', was written by [[David S. Goyer]] (who also wrote for all three films) and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]].\n\nThe police respond to a riot in a cathedral where [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] O'Fallon was giving a sermon. According to eyewitness testimony, the Cardinal was abducted by a large  monster and taken down into the crypts below the cathedral. Lieutenant Gordon, Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez investigate. Gordon has a brief conversation with Batman, who agrees with Gordon's theory that the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)#Fear gas|fear toxin]] is behind the riot, as the doctor has been at large since the riot at the Narrows (during the events of ''[[Batman Begins]]''). Batman gives Gordon an earpiece that will allow them to stay in contact and descends below ground, trying to find Cardinal O'Fallon and his abductor. A homeless man living in an abandoned subway station identifies the abductor as [[Killer Croc]]. Batman and Gordon briefly discuss the villain's past, but are cut off when Killer Croc ambushes Batman. During the fight, Batman discovers Croc is under the influence of the Scarecrow's fear toxin. Batman defeats him, but not before sustaining a bite that transfers some of the toxin to him. He then finds Cardinal O'Fallon being put on trial and sentenced to death by the Scarecrow (who is unhappy with O'Fallon's efforts to help the homeless). Batman leaps in to defend the Cardinal. Using the [[methane]] already present in the room, he sparks an explosion that destroys several water pipes, flooding the area and allowing him to escape with the Cardinal. While the Scarecrow escapes, Gordon appears in a helicopter to retrieve the Cardinal. Gordon offers to help Batman, but Batman refuses, saying: \"Maybe next time.\"\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as [[Crispus Allen]]\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]\n* [[Ana Ortiz]] as Anna Ramirez\n* [[Corey Burton]] as [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane / The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Will Friedle]] as Cultist\n* [[Brian George]] as O'Fallon\n* [[George Newbern]] as Man\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as Mole Man\n\n===''Working Through Pain'' (Studio 4\u00b0C)===\n''Working Through Pain'' was written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and animated by [[Studio 4\u00b0C]].\n\nTaking place after ''In Darkness Dwells'', Batman is shot in the stomach by a man hallucinating in the sewers of Gotham. Severely injured, Batman [[Cauterization|cauterizes]] the wound and attempts to get out from underground, reflecting on his experiences with managing pain as he does so (before the events of ''[[Batman Begins]]''). First, he remembers volunteering with a relief effort in the [[Middle East]] and assisting a doctor in performing surgery without anesthesia. Next, he reflects on the lessons he learned from a woman named Cassandra who was cast out of her community for disguising herself as a boy in an attempt to become a [[fakir]]. Over several months, she teaches him to minimize his pain to the point where he can control it, sleeping on a bed of needles or standing on hot coals without reacting. One night, several young men appear to harass Cassandra, who takes their blows without seeming to feel them. Bruce steps in to defend her, not only demonstrating his ability to withstand their attacks, but defeating them all with his [[Martial arts|martial arts skills]]. Cassandra then tells him to leave, saying that he has learned what he came to learn. She then comments on how Bruce's pain was beyond her or possibly even his ability to handle, but how it also appeared to be leading him down a path he desired. Back in the present, Batman ends up in a gutter where he discovers a cache of guns buried in the garbage. [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] then arrives to assist him and tells Batman to reach out his hand so he can pull him out of the gutter but Batman, whose arms are full of guns, replies that he cannot.\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n* [[Will Friedle]] as Youth 1\n* [[Brian George]] as Arman, Scruffy Man\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Youth 2\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as Cassandra\n* [[George Newbern]] as Youth 3\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as Youth 4\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Avery, Wounded Man\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Young Cassandra\n\n===''Deadshot'' (Madhouse)===\n''Deadshot'' was written by [[Alan Burnett]] and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]].\n\nBruce Wayne has a flashback to the murder of his parents. In his penthouse, he examines the firearms he took from the underground tunnel's gutter (during the events of ''Working Through Pain'') which he intends to turn in to the police. Wayne admits to Alfred that even though he vowed never to use them in the memory of his parents, he can still understand the temptation to use one. Meanwhile, in another city, a prodigious assassin known as [[Deadshot]] carries out an assassination on Mayor Manning with a spectacularly difficult shot from a moving ferris wheel literally miles away from the man and returns to his tropical base. There, one of his associates hires him to carry out a hit in Gotham. It is revealed that the Russian has put out a hit on Lieutenant Gordon and Batman is called in to protect him. Batman gives [[Crispus Allen]] Ronald Marshall's handheld PDA device (which he stole as Bruce Wayne in ''Field Test''), containing a link to encrypted e-mails proving that Ronald Marshall hired Deadshot in the past. He then follows Gordon's motorcade, with Alfred providing satellite-imagery assistance using the new WayneCom satellites. Deadshot attempts to shoot Gordon from a moving train, but Batman deflects the bullet. Deadshot then gleefully reveals that Batman was his real target the entire time and that the threat against Gordon was merely a ruse to draw him out. He opens fire as the train enters a tunnel and as Batman attempts to charge at Deadshot, he gets shot and falls off the train. Deadshot advances to where he saw Batman fall while gloating about shooting Batman, but is suddenly ambushed and disarmed from behind by Batman. Now terrified, Deadshot confesses that he was hired by the Russians to kill Batman and tries to talk Batman out of killing him since he was \"only doing his job.\" Infuriated with Deadshot's cowardice, Batman knocks him out and Deadshot and Ronald Marshall are later arrested afterwards. Later, Wayne confides to Alfred about how similar the fight in the tunnel seemed to the night his parents were murdered and comments that \"I've been trying to stop those two bullets all my life.\" He expresses discouragement and Alfred agrees, but then adds that he thinks Bruce has a higher purpose. The film ends with Bruce looking up at the sky and seeing the [[Bat-Signal]].\n\n====Voice cast====\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Bruce Wayne (Dark Knight trilogy)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n:* [[Hynden Walch]] as Young Bruce Wayne, Female Campaign Worker\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as [[Crispus Allen]]\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]], [[Deadshot|Floyd Lawton / Deadshot]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as [[Thomas Wayne]], Doctor\n* [[Pat Musick]] as News Anchor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Bulky Man\n* [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] as [[Martha Wayne]]\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Batman: Gotham Knight {{nobold|\u2013 soundtrack from the DC Universe animated original movie}}\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[Christopher Drake]], [[Robert J.
