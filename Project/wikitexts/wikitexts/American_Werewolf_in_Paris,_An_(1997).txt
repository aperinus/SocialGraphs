It follows the general concept of, and is a sequel to, [[John Landis]]'s 1981 film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''. The film is an [[international co-production]] between companies from the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, ''An American Werewolf in London'', which was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], this film was distributed by [[Buena Vista Pictures]] under its [[Hollywood Pictures]] division. Upon theatrical release, the film was met with unfavorable reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nAndy McDermott is a tourist seeing the sights of [[Paris]] with his friends Brad and Chris. When Serafine Pigot (presumably the daughter of the werewolf from the first film)  leaps off the [[Eiffel Tower]] just before Andy is about to [[bungee jump]], he executes a mid-air rescue. She vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued. That night, Andy, Chris, and Brad attend a nightclub called Club de la Lune hosted by Serafine's friend Claude. Serafine is not present, so Chris volunteers to go back to her house. He frees her from a cell in the basement and is locked in it. He escapes when he finds a legless werewolf confined to a bed. The club's owner, Claude, is actually the leader of a [[werewolf]] society that uses the club as a way to lure in people (preferably tourists) to be killed. Serafine arrives, tells Andy to run away, and transforms into a werewolf. The club owners transform into werewolves as well, and butcher all the guests, including Brad and Andy.\n\nThe next day, Andy wakes up at Serafine's house. She tells him he is transforming into a werewolf. This revelation is interrupted by the ghost of Serafine's mother. Andy jumps out the window in panic and runs away. Chris tries to get his attention, but Claude kidnaps him. Brad's ghost appears to Andy and explains his werewolf condition. For Andy to become normal again, he must eat the heart of the werewolf that bit him, and for Brad's ghost to be at rest, the werewolf that killed him must be killed. After developing an appetite for raw meat, Andy hooks up with an American tourist named Amy Finch at a cemetery. He transforms and kills her and a cop who tailed him, suspecting Andy was involved in the Club de la Lune massacre. Andy is arrested, but escapes. He begins to see Amy's ghost, and she tries to find ways to get him killed.\n\nClaude and his henchmen capture Andy and pressure him to join their society, but Andy must kill Chris to prove his loyalty. Serafine again saves him, and they return to her home to find her basement ransacked and her stepfather, the confined werewolf, dead. Serafine explains that her stepfather prepared a drug to control werewolf transformations, but the drug had the opposite effect: forced transformation. As a result of testing on Serafine, she killed her mother and savaged her stepfather. Claude had stolen these drugs during the ransacking.\n\nAndy and Serafine learn of a [[Fourth of July]] party Claude has planned and infiltrate it. They try to help the people escape, but flee once they see that police have entered. Claude and his men inject themselves with the transforming-inducing drug and slaughter almost all the guests. Andy and Serafine flee after killing a werewolf and setting Brad's spirit free. Serafine takes the drug to fight another werewolf when they become separated. Andy encounters them but, not knowing who is who, he accidentally shoots her and leaves her to be found by the police. A werewolf then attacks him, chasing him down to an underground train track. The train stops due to it hitting the werewolf. It gets on the train where it attacks the driver and several passengers. The drug wears off, revealing Claude as the werewolf. Claude tries to inject himself with the last vial, but he is interrupted by Andy and the two fight. When Andy finds that Claude is the culprit behind his infection, the two struggle to obtain the last vial of the drug, and Andy is accidentally injected. After transforming, Andy kills and eats Claude's heart, thus ending his own werewolf curse and presumably Serafine's (this point is not clarified since earlier in the movie Serafine implied that Claude had stolen ''her'' blood to become a werewolf. In an alternate ending, after Andy eats Claude's heart, Serafine has a vision of her stepfather in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death). An ambulance transports her to the hospital.\n\nSerafine and Andy celebrate their wedding atop the [[Statue of Liberty]] with Andy's pal Chris, who survived. They bungee jump off when Chris accidentally drops the wedding ring from the statue.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Everett Scott]] as Andy McDermott\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as S\u00e9rafine Pigot McDermott\n* [[Vince Vieluf]] as Brad\n* [[Phil Buckman]] as Chris\n* [[Julie Bowen]] as Amy Finch\n* [[Pierre Cosso]] as Claude\n* [[Tom Novembre]] as Inspector LeDuc\n* [[Thierry Lhermitte]] as Thierry Pigot\n* [[Anthony Waller]] as Metro Driver\n* Isabelle Constantini as Serafine's Mother\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe film's title has its roots in the production of its predecessor; when production of the original ''London'' film ran into trouble with British [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], director [[John Landis]], having scouted locations in Paris, considered moving the production to France and changing the title of his film to ''An American Werewolf in Paris''.<ref>[[David Naughton]] and [[Griffin Dunne]] DVD audio commentary on ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''</ref>\n\nLandis was approached by [[PolyGram Pictures]] to develop a sequel to the first movie, as Landis explained in the book ''Beware the Moon: The Story of An American Werewolf in London'':<blockquote>I was asked to do a sequel by PolyGram in 1991. The company, under [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], made something like 10 or 12 movies, and the only one that made money was American Werewolf. They then left the company and were replaced by a guy called [[Michael Kuhn]]. He called me and said that they were interested in making a sequel. I entertained the idea for a little bit and then came up with something that I liked and wrote a first draft of the script.<ref name=comsequel/></blockquote>\n\nLandis's draft focused on Debbie Klein (a character mentioned but never seen or heard in the original film) getting a job in London, and her subsequent investigation into the deaths of David and Jack.<ref name=comsequel>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/horror/news/american-werewolf-in-london-sequel-john-landis/|title=American Werewolf in London' Almost Got a Sequel in 1991|website=www.comicbook.com |first=Patrick|last=Cavanaugh|date=November 21, 2017|access-date=February 1, 2021}}</ref> Several characters from the original film, including Alex Price, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt.

The teacher is bitten by a lycanthrope and goes through the expected changes, while on his trail is the doctor from the first film, who has been working on a werewolf serum.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}} In an interview with ''[[Fangoria]]'', Lafia stated that the studio was not interested in his script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/comicscrazy/docs/fangoria_099 |title=Fangoria #99|website=www.issuu.com|date=|access-date=February 3, 2021}}{{Dead link|date=July 2022}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lafia left the project, Tom Stern and Tim Burns, who had previously worked on the short-lived MTV series [[The Idiot Box (TV series)|''The Idiot Box'']] and the 1993 comedy film ''[[Freaked]]'', were hired to write a new script, with Stern set as director. Stern and Burns's script followed a young American named Andy McDermott, who is vacationing in Spain when he is called to Paris after hearing that his uncle was savaged by a mysterious beast there.<ref name=Fangowasnt>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouperproductions.com/Freekland/werewolf.htm|title=An American Werewolf in Paris: The American Werewolf that Wasn't|access-date=February 1, 2021|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325123342/http://www.trouperproductions.com/Freekland/werewolf.htm|archive-date=March 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all |work=Fangoria |issue=134 |date=July 1994}}</ref> In keeping with the tradition of ''An American Werewolf in London'', Stern and Burns loaded the script with as many songs referring to the moon as they could find.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/an-american-werewolf-in-turnaround-the-untold-story-of-the-american-werewolf-sequel-that-wasnt-part-1|title=AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN TURNAROUND: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE AMERICAN WEREWOLF SEQUEL THAT WASN'T - PART 1 |website=www.graffitiwithpunctuation.com |date=July 15, 2018|access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref> As part of the preproduction process, Stern had makeup effects (FX) artists [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] and [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] work on preliminary designs for the monster, and [[Phil Tippett]], who had worked on [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], was going to use computer graphics to bring the beast to life for full-body shots, while the closeups would be handled by the makeup FX crew using animatronic heads.<ref name=Fangowasnt/> Once they turned in their script to the studio, the studio informed Stern that while they liked the script, he was no longer going to be directing the film. Stern said in an interview: \"They were planning to do it on, a medium-low budget, around $10-12 million, and they felt comfortable with me directing it at that level. Then when I handed it in, they liked it so much that they wanted to do it on a higher budget, and they needed a big-name director they could use the foreign presales, since Polygram, which owns [[Propaganda Films|Propaganda]], is a foreign company.\"<ref name=Fangowasnt/>\n\n[[Marco Brambilla]], whose film [[Demolition Man (film)|''Demolition Man'']] was a major international hit, was brought on to take over directing. According to Stern, Brambilla's approach was going to involve the traditional half-man, half-wolf look, with FX to be created by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]].<ref name=Fangowasnt/>\n\nAfter a meeting with Brambilla, both Stern and Burns left and moved on to other projects, with Burns stating: \"There wasn\u2019t any shouting or anything... but it was such a strange feeling. We\u2019d been working on this for a year and a half, and put all this thought into it. He'd been on it for a week and was saying 'I don't think the ending works' and 'this scene's got to go'.\"<ref name=turnar2>{{cite web |url=https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/an-american-werewolf-in-turnaround-the-untold-story-of-the-american-werewolf-sequel-that-wasnt-part-2?format=amp|title=AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN TURNAROUND: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE AMERICAN WEREWOLF SEQUEL THAT WASN'T - Part 2 |website=www.graffitiwithpunctuation.com |date=July 15, 2018|access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref> Stern added, \"We took pride in writing a villain that was somewhat charming and had a compelling argument because the great villains are the ones that have a great pitch and make you think 'wow, I can see the logic to this.' He just wanted a cartoon villain that was twirling his moustache and being all 'ultimate evil'.\"<ref name=turnar2/>\n\nThe project fell into limbo for about two years. During that time, 12 screenwriters, including Larry Brothers, [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade]] did rewrites on Stern and Burn's script, with Purvis and Wade contributing the danger tour and the bungee jump off the [[Eiffel Tower]]. During the hiatus, Brambilla left, and was replaced by [[Anthony Waller]], who had gained a cult following for his low-budget thriller ''[[Mute Witness]]''. Upon joining the project, Waller rewrote the script. After the arbitration process, the final screenplay credit went to Stern, Burns, and Waller.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxjgCwAAQBAJ&q=American+werewolf+in+paris&pg=PT115|title=Story and Character: Interviews With British Screenwriters |last=Owen|first=Alistair |date=2016-05-19|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408880661|language=en |access-date=2021-02-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Locations ===\nFilming took place in [[Amsterdam]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Metz]], and New York City, and on location in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118604/locations|title=An American Werewolf|website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternate endings ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2022}}\nIn an [[alternate ending]], after Andy eats Claude's heart, Serafine has a vision of her stepfather in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death.
