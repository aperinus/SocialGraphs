Claire, an [[asthma|asthmatic]] college dropout, and Luke, owner of a website chronicling the hotel's supposed hauntings, are both [[ghost hunting]] enthusiasts fascinated by the hotel's \"haunted\" history. They were especially interested in Madeline O'Malley, a bride who hanged herself when abandoned at the altar, and whose body was hidden in the basement by the hotel owners.\n\nLuke checks in an older woman, whom Claire recognizes as Leanne Rease-Jones, a former actress. While delivering towels to her room, Claire is starstruck and has an awkward encounter with Leanne, who is initially cold toward her. The following night, while taking out the garbage, Claire notices Leanne watching from her room window and waves, but Leanne moves away from the window without acknowledging her. Claire hears noises coming from the hotel's garage, where there is a door leading to the basement. She padlocks the door and returns inside. She uses Luke's ghost-hunting equipment to record [[Electronic voice phenomenon|EVP]]s in various places around the hotel. While recording, she hears faint voices and music, and sees the grand piano in the lobby play by itself.\n\nClaire awakens to Madeline's apparition in her room. She later runs into Leanne in the hallway. Leanne reveals she is in town for a [[psychic]]s' convention, having left her acting career to become a [[mediumship|medium]]. She warns Claire not to go into the basement. Later that day, an elderly man arrives and asks for a honeymoon suite on the third floor, and Claire obliges him.\n\nLuke and Claire investigate the basement. They encounter disembodied voices and other paranormal activity, which scares Luke into leaving the hotel. Panicked, Claire asks Leanne for help. Leanne makes contact with a spirit and tells Claire they need to leave the hotel immediately. Claire rushes upstairs to retrieve the elderly man, only to find a [[suicide note]] and discovers his body in the bathtub, his wrists slashed, with Madeline's apparition hanging from a rope. Claire runs downstairs and finds that Luke has returned to the hotel. As Luke goes upstairs to find Leanne, Claire hears noises coming from the basement and approaches the stairwell. Startled by an apparition of the elderly man, she falls down, injuring her head.\n\nDisoriented, Claire walks into the basement room where Madeline's body was kept. She tries in vain to open the door leading to the garage, forgetting she had locked it. Confronted by Madeline's apparition, Claire dies of an [[asthma attack]]. \n\nThe next morning, Luke tells police he heard Claire's screams coming from the cellar but could not open the door to save her. Luke and Leanne leave with the police. Leanne comforts Luke, saying that Claire couldn't have been saved.\n\nThe film ends with a view of Claire's room where her barely-visible apparition looks out the window. As she turns towards the viewer, the door slams shut.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sara Paxton]] as Claire\n* [[Pat Healy (actor)|Pat Healy]] as Luke\n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Leanne Rease-Jones\n* Alison Bartlett as Gayle, the angry mom\n* Jake Ryan as Boy\n* [[Lena Dunham]] as Barista\n* George Riddle as Old Man\n* Brenda Cooney as Madeline O'Malley\n* John Speredakos as Officer Mitchell\n\n==Production==\nIn January 2010, [[Ti West]] was named as the director of the Dark Sky Films project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/18898 |title=Ti West Tells Tale of Haunted Hotel in 'The Innkeepers' |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting.com |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> [[Sara Paxton]], Pat Healy and [[Kelly McGillis]] signed on in May 2010.<ref>[https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20155 \"First Look Inside Ti West's Haunted Tale of 'The Innkeepers'!\"].
