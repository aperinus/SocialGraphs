The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tom Hardy]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Revenant |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1663202/ |access-date=2022-05-29 |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film is also considered a remake<ref>{{cite web|title=\u2018The Revenant\u2019 Is Slow-Paced Suffering Leo DiCaprio Stars in Remake of an Epic Western|url=https://www.independent.com/2016/01/13/revenant-is-slow-paced-suffering//|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|accessdate=26 August 2022|date=13 January 2016}}</ref> of the film ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971).\n\nIn August 2001, [[Akiva Goldsman]] purchased Punke's manuscript.

[[Principal photography]] began in October 2014. Location and crew concerns delayed production from May to August 2015.\n\n''The Revenant'' premiered at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|TCL Chinese Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California on December 16, 2015. It had a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] on December 25 and a [[wide release]] on January 8, 2016. It was a blockbuster, grossing $533 million worldwide. It received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, particularly for DiCaprio and Hardy, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction, and Lubezki's cinematography; however, some criticism went to screenplay and runtime.<ref name=\"Stephanie Zacharek 2016, p54\">Stephanie Zacharek, TIME magazine, January 18, 2016, p54.</ref><ref name=\"MoraskiCBS_151225\"/><ref name=\"newyorkerreview\">{{cite magazine|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=Wilder West \"The Hateful Eight\" and \"The Revenant.\"|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=December 27, 2015|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/04/wilder-west|access-date=February 8, 2016|archive-date=February 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201104123/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/04/wilder-west|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt won three [[Golden Globe Awards]] and five [[BAFTA Awards]], including Best Film at both shows. For the [[88th Academy Awards]], the film received 12 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Hardy). It won the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, his second consecutive in that category), [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (DiCaprio, his first after 5 previous nominations), and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Emmanuel Lubezki]], his third consecutive in that category).

While he and his half-[[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by an [[Arikara]] war party seeking to recover its Chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. Many of the trappers are killed during the fight, while the rest of them escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to [[Fort Kiowa]], because he believes that traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.\n\nWhile scouting game, Glass is mauled by a female [[grizzly bear]] guarding its cubs, and left near death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, who is fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must [[Euthanasia|mercy-kill]] Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but he is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young [[Jim Bridger]], Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.\n\nAfter the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is neutralized by Hawk. Fitzgerald, afraid that Hawk's loud reaction to his attempt to kill Glass could alert Bridger, who is away gathering water, stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. Bridger protests at first, but he ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. Bridger leaves his canteen, in which he engraved a spiral symbol, with Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits that he lied about the approaching Arikara. When Fitzgerald and Bridger later meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, although he knows nothing about Hawk's murder.\n\nGlass begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude cauterization of his wounds and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into white water rapids. He later encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that \"revenge is in the Creator's hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel together. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift [[sweat lodge]] for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover that his wounds are healing but Hikuc has been hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills several hunters and recovers Hikuc's horse. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the stormy night by eviscerating the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.\n\nA frightened French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes his spiral engraved canteen as Glass's. Believing that it might be a surviving Hawk, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing that Glass is alive, empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger, but Glass vouches for Bridger by stating that he was not present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk and was later deceived and threatened by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.\n\nAfter the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills, and scalps Henry. Glass finds Henry's corpse, places it on his horse to act as a decoy, and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank, where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Their chief Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald, and the Arikara (who have found Powaqa) spare Glass. Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife and is heard breathing throughout the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Hugh Glass]]\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as John Fitzgerald\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]]\n* [[Will Poulter]] as [[Jim Bridger]]\n* [[Forrest Goodluck]] as Hawk\n* [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]] as Anderson\n* [[Kristoffer Joner]] as Murphy\n* [[Duane Howard]] as Elk Dog\n* [[Melaw Nakehk'o]] as Powaqa\n* [[Arthur Redcloud]] as Hikuc\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Jones\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Fryman\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as Billy Brother Trapper\n* [[Grace Dove]] as Hugh Glass's wife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu 2014.jpg|thumb|Director [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu|Alejandro G.
