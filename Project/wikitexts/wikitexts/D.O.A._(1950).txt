It is considered a classic of the [[genre]].  A fatally poisoned man tries to find out who has poisoned him and why. It was the film debuts of [[Beverly Garland]] (as Beverly Campbell) and [[Laurette Luez]].\n\n[[Leo C. Popkin]] produced ''D.O.A.'' for his short-lived Cardinal Pictures. Due to a filing error, the copyright to the film was not renewed on time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightdata.com/chart/ch17.html#DOA |title=The Copyright Office Records an Invalid Renewal \u2014 Then Corrects Its Error |last1=Hayes |first1=David P. |date=2008 |website=The Copyright Registration and Renewal Information Chart and Web Site |access-date=2015-06-14}}</ref> causing it to fall into the [[public domain]]: it was subsequently remade as ''[[Color Me Dead]]'' (1969), [[D.O.A. (1988 film)|''D.O.A.'']] (1988), and ''Dead On Arrival'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\n\nAn opening sequence features Frank Bigelow walking through the long hallway of a police station to report his own murder. From here to the end, the story is told in flashback. Bigelow is a hard-driving accountant and notary public in [[Banning, California]], who decides to escape for a fun vacation in [[San Francisco]]. At the hotel, he is invited to join a group of conventioneers for a night out. He ends up at a nightclub where, unnoticed, a stranger swaps his drink for another one. The next morning, he feels extremely ill. Doctors determine that he swallowed a poison, \"luminous toxin,\" for which there is no antidote.\n\nWith only days to live, Bigelow embarks on a desperate search to discover the motive for his poisoning. A call to his secretary Paula provides a possible lead: a Eugene Philips has been urgently trying to contact him. Bigelow travels to Philips' import-export company, meeting Halliday, the company comptroller, who says that Philips has committed suicide.\n\nBigelow locates Eugene Philips' widow and brother Stanley Philips. Months earlier, Eugene had purchased [[iridium]], a \"luminous toxin\", which had been stolen by a criminal named Majak. The seller was a George Reynolds (aka Raymond Rakubian), Majak's nephew. As a result of this illegal sale/purchase transaction, Eugene Philips faced criminal charges.\n\nThe bill of sale would have cleared Eugene, but has gone missing\u2014and that document had been notarized by Bigelow himself. He learns that Reynolds/Rakubian is now dead. He realizes that someone seems intent on eliminating all evidence of this sale.\n\nThat someone turns out, in a plot twist, to be Halliday. Stanley Phillips\u2014who has now been poisoned\u2014reveals that Eugene discovered that his wife and Halliday were having an affair. Mrs. Philips affirms that during a confrontation that turned violent, Halliday threw Eugene over a balcony. To make it look like suicide, the pair insisted that Eugene had killed himself over his legal troubles. When they discovered that there was exonerating evidence of his innocence in the notarized iridium bill of sale, Halliday began disposing of anyone knowing about the document, and that led to Bigelow.\n\nIn the final scene, Bigelow tracks Halliday to the Philips company and finds him wearing the same distinctive coat and scarf as the man who switched the drinks. Halliday draws a gun and fires first, but Bigelow fatally shoots him.\n\nBigelow finishes telling his story and dies. The police detective taking down the report instructs that his file be marked \"dead on arrival.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Laurette Luez and Edmond O'Brien in DOA.jpg|thumb|237px|Marla Rakubian threatens Bigelow when he comes to her for information.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Edmond O'Brien in DOA crop.jpg|70px]] ||[[Edmond O'Brien]] as Frank Bigelow || [[File:Pamela Britton in DOA 1.jpg|70px]] ||[[Pamela Britton]] as Paula Gibson\n|-\n| [[File:Luther Adler in DOA.jpg|70px]] ||[[Luther Adler]] as Majak ||[[File:Lynn Baggett in DOA.jpg|70px]] ||Lynn Baggett as Mrs. Phillips\n|-\n| [[File:William Ching in DOA.jpg|70px]] ||[[William Ching]] as Halliday ||[[File:Henry Hart in DOA.jpg|70px]] || Henry Hart as Stanley Phillips\n|-\n| [[File:Beverly Garland in DOA.jpg|70px]] ||[[Beverly Garland]] (credited Beverly Campbell) as Miss Foster||[[File:Neville Brand in DOA cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[Neville Brand]] as Chester\n|-\n| [[File:Laurette Luez in DOA 2.jpg|70px]] ||[[Laurette Luez]] as Marla Rakubian||[[File:Virginia Lee in DOA.jpg|70px]] ||Virginia Lee as Jeannie\n|-\n|}\n\nAdditional cast members:\n* [[Jess Kirkpatrick]] as Sam\n* [[Cay Forrester]] as Sue\n* [[Frank Jaquet]] as Dr. Matson\n* [[Lawrence Dobkin]] as Dr. Schaefer\n* [[Frank Gerstle]] as Dr. MacDonald\n* [[Carol Hughes (actress)|Carol Hughes]] as Kitty\n* [[Frank Cady]] as Eddie the bartender in Banning (uncredited)\n* Michael Ross as Dave the bartender in San Francisco\n* Donna Sanborn as the nurse\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:D.O.A.

O'Brien's performance had a \"good deal of drive\", while Britton adds a \"pleasant touch of blonde attractiveness\".<ref>{{cite web |date=May 1, 1950 |title=Melodrama Opens at Criterion (Published 1950) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/05/01/archives/melodrama-opens-at-criterion.html |website=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 [[Foster Hirsch]] carried on a trend of more positive reviews, calling Bigelow's search for his own killer ''noir'' irony at its blackest.  He wrote, \"One of the film's many ironies is that his last desperate search involves him in his life more forcefully than he has ever been before...

''D.O.A.'' producer Harry Popkin owned the [[Million Dollar Theater]] at the southwest corner of Broadway and Third Street in downtown Los Angeles, directly across the street from the [[Bradbury Building]] at 304 South Broadway, where O'Brien's character confronted his murderer. Director Rudolph Mat\u00e9 liberally used Broadway and the Bradbury Building during location shooting and included the Million Dollar Theater's blazing marquee in the background. The theater would later serve the same function when [[Ridley Scott]] filmed ''[[Blade Runner]]'' at the Bradbury Building.\n\nAfter \"The End\" and before the listing of the cast, a credit states the medical aspects of this film are based on scientific fact, and that \"luminous toxin is a descriptive term for an actual poison.\"\n\nThe bop jazz band playing at the Fisherman's Club while O'Brien's glass is being spiked was filmed on a Los Angeles soundstage after principal photography was completed. According to [[Jim Dawson]] in his 1995 book ''Nervous Man Nervous: Big Jay McNeely and the Rise of the Honking Tenor Sax'', the sweating tenor saxophone player was James Streeter, also known as James Von Streeter. Other band members were [[Shifty Henry]] (bass), [[Al \"Cake\" Wichard]] (drums), Ray LaRue (piano), and [[Teddy Buckner]] (trumpet). However, rather than use the live performance, the music director went back and rerecorded the soundtrack with a big band, not a quintet as seen in the film, led by saxophonist [[Maxwell Davis]].<ref>[[Jim Dawson|Dawson, Jim]].
