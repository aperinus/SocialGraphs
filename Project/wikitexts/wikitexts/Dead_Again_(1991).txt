(1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[romantic thriller]] film directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]] and written by [[Scott Frank]]. It stars Branagh and [[Emma Thompson]], with [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Hanna Schygulla]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Robin Williams]] appearing in supporting roles.\n\n''Dead Again'' was a moderate box office success and received positive reviews from the majority of critics. Jacobi was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], and [[Patrick Doyle]], who composed the film's music, was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nNewspapers detail the 1948 murder of Margaret Strauss, who was stabbed during a robbery; her anklet is missing. Her husband, composer Roman Strauss, is found guilty of the crime and condemned to death. Before his execution, Roman is visited by reporter Gray Baker. Asked if he killed Margaret, Roman appears to whisper something in Baker's ear. Baker does not disclose Roman's answer.\n\nForty-three years later, private detective Mike Church investigates the identity of a woman who has appeared at the orphanage where he grew up. She has [[amnesia]], cannot speak and has nightmares. Mike takes her in and asks his friend, Pete Dugan, to publish her picture and his contact info. Antiques dealer and [[hypnotist]] Franklyn Madson approaches Mike, suggesting [[hypnosis]] may help her recover her memory.\n\nWhen the session is unsuccessful, Madson suggests they experiment with [[past life regression]]. Mike is skeptical, but the woman details Margaret and Roman's lives in [[Third-person narrative|third person]], from courtship to their wedding. When the session ends, she can speak but still has amnesia. Madson shows them [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] articles covering the murder. Mike and the woman bear a striking resemblance to Roman and Margaret. Mike visits former psychiatrist Cozy Carlisle, who insists they continue to see Madson; delving into the problems between Margaret and Roman may resolve her amnesia.\n\nMike nicknames the woman \"Grace\", and falls in love with her. A man named Doug appears and claims she is his fianc\u00e9e Katherine, but Mike discovers he is lying and chases him off. Hypnotized, Grace remembers that Roman suffered from [[writer's block]] and is broke. He believes that Margaret is flirting with Baker, whom she met on their wedding day. Margaret cannot convince him she is faithful and catches Frankie, the son of their housekeeper Inga, looking through her jewelry box. She asks Roman to dismiss Inga but Roman refuses, saying that Inga saved his life in [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nGrace sees Mike standing over Margaret with scissors, and is convinced he intends to kill her. Mike insists that he would never hurt her, but when he accidentally calls her \"Margaret\", he agrees to let Madson regress him. During his regression, he realizes that he was Margaret and Grace was actually Roman, but is unable to tell Madson or Grace about this revelation.\n\nPete Dugan tells Mike that he has identified Grace as artist Amanda Sharp. Amanda/Grace, still afraid of Mike, accompanies Dugan and Madson to her apartment; her artwork focuses on scissors. Madson gives her a gun to protect herself from Mike. Mike visits Gray Baker in a nursing home and asks him about Roman's secret, but Baker insists that Roman said nothing to him. Baker is convinced that Roman did not kill his wife and suggests Mike find Inga, who would know what happened.\n\nMike realizes that Madson is Frankie. He questions Inga, who explains that she declared her love to Roman but he rebuffed her. Frankie blamed Margaret for his mother's unhappiness and killed her with scissors, then stole her anklet. Roman later was found covered in his wife's blood and holding the murder weapon.\n\nAfter Roman's execution, Inga took Frankie to London where he learned about [[hypnotherapy]] and past-life regression. After returning to LA, Frankie was convinced that Margaret's spirit would seek revenge. Seeing Amanda's photo in the paper, he knew she had returned. He hired Doug, an actor, to separate Mike and Amanda and distract Amanda while he waited to kill her. Inga apologizes for her role in Margaret's death and gives Mike the anklet. After Mike leaves to find Amanda, Frankie/Madson smothers Inga with a pillow.\n\nMike tries to tell Amanda the truth. Terrified, she shoots him. Madson arrives and reveals that he is Frankie. Amanda tries to shoot him as well, but the gun jams and he knocks her out. He puts the scissors he used to kill Margaret in Mike's hand and tries to make it look like Amanda killed him and committed suicide. Mike revives and stabs Madson in the leg with the scissors. In the ensuing struggle, Mike grabs the gun from Madson. Dugan arrives, misconstrues the scene and tackles Mike.  As Madson reaches for the dropped pistol, Amanda stabs him in the back with the scissors.  In a rage, Madson pulls the scissors out and charges at Mike, but Mike quickly positions Amanda's scissors sculpture so that Madson impales himself.\n\nA closing montage shows Mike and Amanda embracing, superimposed over Margaret and Roman in happier times.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Mike Church/Roman Strauss\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as \"Grace\"/Amanda Sharp/Margaret Strauss\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Gray Baker\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Franklyn Madson\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as \"Piccolo\" Pete Dugan\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Cozy Carlisle\n* [[Hanna Schygulla]] as Inga\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Doug\n* [[Jo Anderson]] as Sister Madeleine/Masquerade Party Guest\n* [[Lois Hall]] as Sister Constance\n* [[Richard Easton]] as Father Timothy\n* Gregor Hesse as Frankie\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Sid\n* Vasek Simek as Otto Kline\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Lydia Larson \n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as supermarket clerk\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section| date=January 2020}}\nAn international co-production film between The United States and The United Kingdom.

If ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'', the first film he directed and starred in, caused people to compare him to [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]], ''Dead Again'' will inspire comparisons to Welles and Hitchcock - and the Olivier of Hitchcock's ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''. I do not suggest Branagh is already as great a director as Welles and Hitchcock, although he has a good start in that direction. What I mean is that his spirit, his daring, is in the same league. He is not interested in making timid movies.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Ebert | first =Roger | title =Dead Again  | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = August 23, 1991  | url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dead-again-1991 | access-date = August 24, 2019 }}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] also gave the film a four star review, praising Branagh's direction and all levels of the production, from the screenplay by [[Scott Frank]] to [[Patrick Doyle]]'s score, stating, \"...Branagh has combined all of these cinematic elements into an achievement that rivals Hitchcock's best work and stands out as one of the most intriguing and memorable thrillers of the 1990s.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Berardinelli | first =James | title =Dead Again  | work =ReelViews | url =http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dead_again.html | access-date =January 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' viewed the film negatively, praising some elements of Branagh's direction while criticizing the romance, saying, \"In his efforts to crowd the screen with character and incident, Branagh cheats on the one element that might have given resonance to the mystery: the love story. Branagh and Thompson (married in real life) are sublime actors, but they never develop a convincing ardor as either couple. How could they when the director is so busy playing tricks? ''Dead Again'' isn't a disaster, merely a miscalculation from a prodigious talent who has forgotten that you squeeze the life out of romance when you don't give it space to breathe.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Travers | first =Peter | title =Dead Again  | work =[[Rolling Stone]] | date =August 23, 1991 | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dead-again-19910823 | access-date =January 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a lukewarm review, calling it \"a big, convoluted, entertainingly dizzy romantic mystery melodrama\" and concluding, \"''Dead Again'' is eventually a lot simpler than it pretends to be. The explanation of the mystery is a rather commonplace letdown, but probably nothing short of mass murder could successfully top the baroque buildup. In this way, too, the film is faithful to its antecedents, while still being a lot of fun.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Canby | first =Vincent | title =Dead Again  | work =[[The New York Times]] | date =August 23, 1991 | url =https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE7DB1F39F930A1575BC0A967958260 | access-date =January 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Jason Bailey at ''[[Flavorwire]]'', repeated Roger Ebert's initial directorial comparisons, writing that, \"''Dead Again'' is one of the most Hitchcockian thrillers this side of [[Brian De Palma|De Palma]], with easily traceable influences of Olivier-fronted ''Rebecca'' (in the creepy, needy housekeeper), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (the mysterious old mother in the next room), ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (the scissors as murder weapon), and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (the therapeutic elements, plus a quickie reference to [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], who advised on that film\u2019s dream sequences)\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/587426/second-glance-kenneth-branaghs-twisty-giddy-dead-again|title=Second Glance: Kenneth Branagh's Twisty, Giddy 'Dead Again'|date=2016-08-22|work=Flavorwire|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Dead Again'' grossed $3,479,395 during its opening weekend, playing on 450 screens.
