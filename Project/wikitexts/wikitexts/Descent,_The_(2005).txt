The film follows six women who enter a [[cave system]] and struggle to survive against the humanoid creatures inside.\n\nFilming took place in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed at [[Ashridge]] Park, [[Hertfordshire]], and in Scotland. Because the filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave, interior scenes were filmed on sets built at [[Pinewood Studios]] near London designed by [[Simon Bowles]].\n\n''The Descent'' opened in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2005. It premiered in the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and released on 4 August 2006 in the United States. The film received positive reviews and was a box-office success, grossing $57.1 million against a \u00a33.5 million budget.\n\nA sequel, titled ''[[The Descent Part 2]]'', directed by the first film's editor [[Jon Harris (director)|Jon Harris]], was released in 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nThrill seeker friends Sarah, Juno, and Beth whitewater raft together. Afterward, Sarah, along with her husband Paul and their daughter Jessica, are involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives.\n\nOne year later, Sarah, Juno, and Beth, as well as friends Sam, Rebecca, and newcomer Holly reunite at a cabin in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] for a [[spelunking]] adventure. The next day, they hike up to a mountain cave entrance and descend. While in the cave, Juno apologizes to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. After the group moves through a narrow passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits that she has led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system that they had originally planned to visit, and so rescue is therefore impossible. She then tells Sarah that this adventure was in the hopes of restoring their relationship.\n\nAs the group presses forward with hopes of finding an exit, they discover aged climbing equipment and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones and is suddenly attacked by a creature known as a \"crawler.\" Holly is killed when a crawler attacks and bites through her throat. Sarah runs and falls down a hole, where she is knocked unconscious. Juno, trying to prevent Holly's body from being dragged away, kills a crawler with her pickaxe but then, startled and in shock, accidentally strikes Beth through the neck. Beth collapses with Juno's pendant in her hand and begs Juno not to leave her, but a traumatized Juno flees.\n\nSarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, witnessing Holly's body being mauled and eaten by crawlers. Juno discovers cave markings from previous explorers that point to a specific path through the caves. Juno locates Sam and Rebecca. Sam has deduced that the crawlers are blind and rely on sound to hunt. Juno tells them about the markings, but she will not leave without Sarah.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah encounters Beth, who tells her that Juno wounded then abandoned her. Beth gives her Juno's pendant, telling her it is a gift from Paul, and realizes that Juno and Paul had an affair before his death. Beth begs Sarah to [[euthanasia|euthanize]] her, which Sarah reluctantly does by bashing her head in with a rock. Sarah then encounters several crawlers and manages to kill them all, falling into a blood-filled pond in the process and emerging covered in blood.\n\nElsewhere, Juno, Sam and Rebecca are pursued by a large group of crawlers. They reach a chasm and Sam tries to climb across, but a crawler scaling the ceiling attacks and rips her throat out. Sam stabs it before bleeding to death in front of Juno and Rebecca. Rebecca is then dragged away and eaten alive as Juno escapes. Juno encounters Sarah and lies to her about seeing Beth die. After defeating a group of crawlers close to the exit, Sarah confronts Juno, revealing the pendant and her knowledge of Beth's fate and the affair with Paul. Sarah then strikes Juno in the leg with a pickaxe and leaves her to die as a swarm of crawlers approaches. Juno is last heard screaming as Sarah escapes. Sarah falls down a hole and is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen Sarah awakens, she sees sunlight and clambers up a slope covered in bones to escape the cave. After exhaustedly running to her car, she speeds out of the woods before she pulls over to the side of the road, breaking down in tears. After a truck passes her, she vomits out the window. When she sits up, she sees a hallucination of a bloodied Juno sitting next to her and screams.\n\n===Extended ending===\nIn the original release in the United Kingdom, an extended ending is presented, which was cut for the US release over concerns that it was too depressing. After hallucinating the image of Juno, Sarah awakens in the cave, her entire escape having been revealed to be part of the same hallucination. She sits up to see Jessica sitting across from her, holding a birthday cake. As Sarah smiles the shot widens to reveal that the cake's birthday-candlelight is actually the light of her torch. The camera slowly backs out, revealing the darkness surrounding Sarah as the crawlers are heard closing in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shauna Macdonald (Scottish actress)|Shauna Macdonald]] as Sarah Carter\n* [[Natalie Mendoza]] as Juno Kaplan\n* [[MyAnna Buring]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Vernet\n* [[Saskia Mulder]] as Rebecca Vernet\n* [[Alex Reid (actress)|Alex Reid]] as Elizabeth \"Beth\" O'Brien\n* [[Nora-Jane Noone]] as Holly Mills\n* [[Oliver Milburn]] as Paul Carter\n* Molly Kayll as Jessica Carter\n\n==Production==\nWhen [[Neil Marshall]]'s film ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'' (2002) was a moderate success, the director received numerous requests to direct other horror films. The director was initially wary of being typecast as a horror film director, although he eventually agreed to make ''The Descent'', emphasizing, \"They are very different films.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Geoffrey | last=Macnab | title=Brace yourself: the British horror film is about to rise from the grave | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=4 July 2005 }}</ref> \n\n===Casting===\nFilmmakers originally planned for the cast to be both male and female, but Neil Marshall's business partner realized that horror films rarely have all-female casts. Defying convention, Marshall cast all women, and to avoid making them clich\u00e9d, he solicited basic advice from his female friends. He explained the difference, \"The women discuss how they feel about the situation, which the soldiers in ''Dog Soldiers'' would never have done.\" He also gave the characters different accents to enable the audience to tell them apart and to establish a more \"cosmopolitan feel\" than the British marketing of ''Dog Soldiers''.<ref name=blues>{{cite news | first=Donald | last=Clarke | title=Subterranean sick blues | work=[[The Irish Times]] | publisher=[[Irish Times Trust]] | date=9 July 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe cast included [[Shauna Macdonald (Scottish actress)|Shauna Macdonald]] as Sarah, [[Natalie Mendoza]] as Juno, [[Alex Reid (actress)|Alex Reid]] as Beth, [[Saskia Mulder]] as Rebecca, [[MyAnna Buring]] as Sam, [[Nora-Jane Noone]] as Holly, [[Oliver Milburn]] as Paul, and Molly Kayll as Jessica. [[Craig Conway (actor)|Craig Conway]] portrayed one of the film's crawlers, Scar.<ref>Listed in the film's credits.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile ''The Descent'' is set in North America, the film was shot entirely in the United Kingdom. Exterior scenes were filmed in Scotland, and interior scenes were filmed in sets built at [[Pinewood Studios]], near London. The cave was built at Pinewood because filmmakers considered it too dangerous and time-consuming to shoot in an actual cave. Set pieces were reused with care, and filmmakers sought to limit lighting to the sources the characters bring with them into the cave, such as helmet lights.<ref name=blues/>\n\nMarshall cited the films ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', and ''[[Deliverance]]'' as influences in establishing tension in ''The Descent''. The director elaborated, \"We really wanted to ramp up the tension slowly, unlike all the American horror films you see now. They take it up to 11 in the first few minutes and then simply can't keep it up. We wanted to show all these terrible things in the cave: dark, drowning, claustrophobia. Then, when it couldn't get any worse, make it worse.\"<ref name=blues/> Marshall also said at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]] that he was inspired by [[Cinema of Italy#Giallo (Thriller/Horror) (1960s\u20131970s)|Italian horror films]] of the past, in particular, those by [[Dario Argento]] and [[Lucio Fulci]].\n\n[[Simon Bowles]] designed the maze of caves for ''The Descent''. Reviews credited Bowles: e.g., \"Bowles' beautifully designed cave sets conjure a world of subterranean darkness.\"<ref>[[Mark Kermode]] in ''[[The Observer]]''.</ref>\nThe film had twenty-one cave sets, built by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo Ltd. using a unique system of polyurethane sprayed rock that was developed for this production.\n\nProduction of ''The Descent'' competed with a big-budget American film that had a similar premise, ''[[The Cave (2005 film)|The Cave]]''. ''The Descent'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by November 2005 or February 2006, but ''The Cave'' began filming six months before its competitor. The filmmakers of ''The Descent'' decided to release their film before ''The Cave'', so they fast-tracked production to be completed by the end of February 2005.<ref name=blues/>\n\n===Editing===\n''The Descent'' was released in North America with approximately one minute cut from the end. In the American cut, Sarah escapes from the cave and sees Juno, but the film does not cut back to the cave. The 4 August 2006 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that the ending was trimmed because American viewers did not like its \"uber-hopeless finale\". Lionsgate marketing chief [[Tim Palen]] said, \"It's a visceral ride, and by the time you get to the ending you're drained. [Director Neil] Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open [to making a switch].\" Marshall compared the change to the ending of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', saying, \"Just because she gets away, does that make it a happy ending?\" The ending is featured on DVD as an \"unrated cut\" in the United States.\n\n==Creature design==\nIn the film, the women encounter underground creatures referred to as crawlers by the production crew. Marshall described the crawlers as [[caveman|cavemen]] who have stayed underground. The director explained, \"They've evolved in this environment over thousands of years. They've adapted perfectly to thrive in the cave. They've lost their eyesight, they have acute hearing and smell and function perfectly in the pitch black. They're expert climbers, so they can go up any rock face and that is their world.\" Filmmakers kept the crawler design hidden from the actresses until they were revealed in the scenes in which the characters encountered the creatures, to allow for natural tension.<ref>{{cite news | first=John | last=Millar | title=Millar's movie: Shauna loved working in dark | work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] | publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] | date=3 July 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nDirector [[Neil Marshall]] first chose to have a dark cave as the setting for his horror film ''The Descent'' then decided to add the element of the crawlers, describing them as \"something that could get the women, something human, but not quite\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Roger | last=Moore | title=Secrets unearthed: Spelunking with Neil Marshall | work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=10 August 2006 }}</ref> The crawlers were depicted as cavemen who never left the caves and evolved in the dark. The director included mothers and children in the colony of creatures, defining his vision, \"It is a colony and I thought that was far more believable than making them the classic monsters. If they had been all male, it would have made no sense, so I wanted to create a more realistic context for them. I wanted to have this very feral, very primal species living underground, but I wanted to make them human. I didn't want to make them aliens because humans are the scariest things.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Nick | last=Morrison | title=Descent into hell | work=[[The Northern Echo]] | publisher=[[Newsquest]] | date=7 July 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe crawlers were designed by Paul Hyett, a makeup and prosthetics creator.<ref name=darker>{{cite news | first=Alan | last=Jones | url=http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=6750 | title=The Darker Depths of ''The Descent 2'' | work=[[Fangoria]] | publisher=Starlog Group | access-date=26 June 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622135651/http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=6750<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 22 June 2008}}</ref> Production designer [[Simon Bowles]] said that the crawler design had started out as \"wide-eyed and more creature-like\", but the design shifted toward a more human appearance. Crawlers originally had pure white skin, but the look was adjusted to seem grubbier. The skin was originally phosphorescent in appearance, but the effect was too bright and reflective in the darkened set, so the adjustment was made for them to blend in shadows.<ref>{{cite journal | first=David E | last=Williams | title=Creepy crawlers | journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=87 | issue=9 |date=September 2006 | pages=18, 20, 22, 24 }}</ref> The director barred the film's cast from seeing the actors in full crawler make-up until their first appearance on screen. Actress [[Natalie Mendoza]] said of the effect, \"When the moment came, I nearly wet my pants!  I was running around afterwards, laughing in this hysterical way and trying to hide the fact that I was pretty freaked out.

For the sequel, Hyett improved the camouflaging ability of the crawlers' skin tones to deliver better scares. According to Hyett, \"Jon wanted them more viciously feral, inbred, scarred and deformed, with rows of sharklike teeth for ripping flesh.\"  A [[charnel house]] was designed for the crawlers as well as a set that the crew called the \"Crawler Crapper\".<ref name=darker/>\n\n===Description===\nRene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' described the crawlers as \"blind, snarling cave-dwellers, looking much like [[Gollum]]'s bigger kin\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Rene | last=Rodriguez | title=Down deep, it's a real fright | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] | date=4 August 2006 }}</ref> Douglas Tseng of ''[[The Straits Times]]'' also noted that the crawlers looked similar to Gollum, being a cross between the creature and the vampiric Reapers from ''[[Blade II]]''.<ref>{{cite news | first=Douglas | last=Tseng | title= Hold on tight, ''The Descent'' is deep | work=[[The Straits Times]] | publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]] | date=7 December 2005 }}</ref> David Germain of the [[Associated Press]] noted of the crawlers, \"[They] have evolved to suit their environment\u2014eyes blind because of the darkness in which they dwell, skin slimy and gray, ears batlike to channel their super-hearing.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=Germain | title='Descent' takes viewers into the depths of horror | work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]] | agency=Associated Press | date=4 August 2006 }}</ref> The crawlers are [[sexually dimorphic]], with males being completely bald, whilst females sport thick dark hair on their heads.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} They are nocturnal hunters which surface from their caves to hunt for prey and bring the spoils of their hunts to their caverns.<ref name=\"crawly\">{{cite video|people=[[Neil Marshall]] (writer/director)|title=The Descent|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Path\u00e9]]|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nThe skull of women motif used in some advertising material is based on [[Philippe Halsman]]'s ''[[In Voluptas Mors]]'' photograph.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://illusion.scene360.com/art/51997/dali-skull-illusion/ |title=Dali's Skull Illusion Still Inspires |access-date=23 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826030144/http://illusion.scene360.com/art/51997/dali-skull-illusion/ |archive-date=26 August 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film's marketing campaign in the United Kingdom was disrupted by the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] in July 2005. Advertisements on London's [[Transport for London|public transport system]] (including the bus that had exploded) had included posters that carried the quote, \"Outright terror... bold and brilliant\", and depicted a terrified woman screaming in a tunnel. The film's theatrical distributor in the UK, [[Path\u00e9]], recalled the posters from their placement in the [[London Underground]] and reworked the campaign to exclude the word \"terror\" from advertised reviews of ''The Descent''. Path\u00e9 also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations. The distributor's marketing chief, Anna Butler, said of the new approach, \"We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back.
