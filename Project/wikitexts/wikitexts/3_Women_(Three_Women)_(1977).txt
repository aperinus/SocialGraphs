It depicts the increasingly bizarre, mysterious relationship between a woman (Duvall) and her [[roommate]] and co-worker (Spacek) in a dusty [[California]] desert town. The story came directly from a dream Altman had, which he adapted into a [[film treatment|treatment]], intending to film without a [[screenplay]]. [[20th Century Fox]] financed the project on the basis of Altman's past work, and a screenplay was completed before filming.\n\n''3 Women'' premiered at the [[1977 Cannes Film Festival]], and earned positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised the performances of the cast (especially that of Duvall). Interpretations of the film are centered around its use of [[psychoanalysis]] and discussion of [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. It was not a strong box office success despite Hollywood studio financing and distribution. After its theatrical release, the film was unavailable on home video for almost thirty years, until it was released by [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nPinky Rose, a timid and awkward young woman, starts working at a [[health spa]] for the elderly in a small California desert town. She becomes enamored of Millie Lammoreaux, a relentlessly outgoing and self-absorbed co-worker who talks incessantly. Despite their stark personality differences, Pinky and Millie become roommates at the Purple Sage Apartments, owned by a drinking, womanizing, has-been Hollywood [[stunt double]], Edgar Hart, and his wife Willie, a mysterious pregnant woman who rarely speaks and paints striking and unsettling [[mural]]s.\n\nMillie takes Pinky along on her visits to Dodge City, a local tavern and shooting range also owned by Willie and Edgar, where Millie continues expounding her petty opinions and interests to her new roommate. Millie's babble alienates most of her co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, and would-be suitors; Pinky is the only person in Millie's orbit who enjoys her advice about dating, fashion, cuisine and interior decorating gleaned from women's magazines.\n\nTensions begin to rise between Pinky and Millie over their living situation. After a quarrel with Pinky one night, Millie leaves the apartment and returns with a drunken Edgar. Pinky begs Millie to consider Edgar's pregnant wife and not have sex with him. Millie, angry at what she perceives as Pinky's meddling and sabotaging her social life, yells at her and suggests she move out of the apartment. A distraught Pinky jumps off the apartment balcony into the swimming pool.\n\nPinky survives the [[suicide attempt]] but falls into a coma. Millie, feeling responsible, visits her in the hospital daily. When Pinky still fails to wake up, Millie contacts Pinky's parents in Texas, hoping their presence at the hospital will help her regain consciousness. When Pinky wakes up, she does not recognize her parents and furiously demands that they leave. Once sent home to live with Millie again, Pinky copies Millie's mannerisms and behavior&mdash;drinking and smoking, sleeping with Edgar, shooting guns at Dodge City&mdash;and demands to be called Mildred, both women's birth name.\n\nMillie becomes increasingly frustrated by Pinky's imitative shift in personality and begins to exhibit Pinky's timid and submissive personality herself. One night after Pinky has a bad dream, she shares a bed with Millie platonically. Edgar, soused again, enters their apartment and makes sexual overtures before casually telling them that Willie is about to give birth. Pinky and Millie drive to Edgar and Willie's house, where Willie is alone and in agonizing labor. Her baby is [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], as Pinky fails to summon medical help during the delivery as Millie told her to.\n\nLater, Pinky and Millie are working at Dodge City, having again changed roles: Pinky has reverted to her child-like timidity and refers to Millie as her mother, while Millie has assumed Willie's role in running the tavern&mdash;even imitating Willie's make-up and attire. A delivery vendor at the tavern refers to Edgar's death from a \"gun accident\" when talking to Millie, who offers a pat, hollow reply that suggests the three women are complicit in Edgar's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as Mildred \"Millie\" Lammoreaux\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Mildred \"Pinky\" Rose\n* [[Janice Rule]] as Willie Hart\n* [[Robert Fortier]] as Edgar Hart\n* [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]] as Mrs. Rose\n* [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]] as Mr. Rose\n* Sierra Pecheur as Ms. Bunweil\n* [[Craig Richard Nelson]] as Dr. Maas\n* Maysie Hoy as Doris\n* [[Belita Moreno]] as Alcira\n* Leslie Ann Hudson as Polly\n* Patricia Ann Hudson as Peggy\n* Beverly Ross as Deidre\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Robert Altman 01.jpg|250px|thumb|Director [[Robert Altman]] based the film on a dream he had.]]\nDirector [[Robert Altman]] conceived of the idea for ''3 Women'' while his wife was being treated in a hospital, and he was afraid that she would die.{{sfn|Altman|2000|p=194}} During a restless sleep, he had a dream in which he was directing a film starring [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Sissy Spacek]] in an [[identity theft]] story, against a desert backdrop.<ref name=\"Sterritt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/319-3-women-dream-project |title=3 Women: Dream Project |last=Sterritt |first=David |date=2004 |access-date=21 November 2016|work=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref> He woke up mid-dream, jotted notes on a pad, and went back to sleep, receiving more details.{{sfn|Altman|2000|p=194}}\n\nUpon waking up, he wanted to make the film, although the dream had not provided him with a complete storyline.

Assistant director Tommy Thompson called for a [[Cut (transition)#Verbal command|cut]]. However, Altman stated he \"loved\" the accident, and had Duvall intentionally catch her dress and skirt in the door in several scenes.{{sfn|Zuckoff|2010|pp=321-322}}\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\nAltman has said the film is about \"empty vessels in an empty landscape\".{{sfn|Mazur|2011|pp=13}} Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, [[schizophrenia]] and [[personality disorder]], and linked the film to Altman's earlier films ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969) and ''[[Images (film)|Images]]'' (1972), declaring them a trilogy. Caso states critics have argued the dreamer in the film is Willie, since she says she had a dream at the end of the film, and Pinky had the \"dream within a dream\".{{sfn|Caso|2015}}\n\nPsychiatrist [[Glen O. Gabbard]] and Krin Gabbard believed ''3 Women'' could best be understood through [[psychoanalysis]] and the study of dreams. In theory, a person dreaming can shift from one character into another within the dream. The three titular characters in the film represent the psyche of one person.{{sfn|Gabbard|Gabbard|1999|p=223}} Whereas Pinky is the child among the three, Millie is the sexually awakened young woman and the pregnant Willie is the mother figure.{{sfn|Gabbard|Gabbard|1999|pp=223-224}} The Gabbard siblings interpreted Pinky, post-coma, as transforming into Millie, while Millie became more of a mother figure to her.{{sfn|Gabbard|Gabbard|1999|p=227}} Altman equated the death of Willie's child to the murder of Edgar, which the three title characters appear to all have participated in.{{sfn|Gabbard|Gabbard|1999|p=230}} Author David Greven agreed psychoanalysis could be used, but saw the relationship between Millie and Pinky as one of mother and daughter, respectively, with Willie at the end of the film being the \"grandmotherly figure\" who defends Pinky from Millie's scornful mothering. Greven wrote the film also demonstrated a focus on strong female characters.{{sfn|Greven|2013|p=236}}\n\n[[File:Janice Rule 1973.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Janice Rule]]'s character Willie has been interpreted, variously, as symbolizing either mother or grandmother.]]\n\nThe setting is also a key feature in the film, with Joe McElhaney arguing the California landscapes \"come to represent something much larger than a 'mere' location\".{{sfn|McElhaney|2015|p=150}} He states it is \"a space of death but also one of creation\".{{sfn|McElhaney|2015|p=153}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened in [[New York City]] in April 1977.<ref name=Canby>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2DA113BE334BC4952DFB266838C669EDE |title=Altman's '3 Women' a Moving Film; Shelley Duvall in Memorable Role |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=11 April 1977 |access-date=21 November 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The film was also screened at the [[1977 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1977, which was where Altman first admitted to Ladd the film was based on his dream.{{sfn|Zuckoff|2010|p=320}}\n\nOn home video, the film never had a [[VHS]] release, and Altman said the film negative was beginning to deteriorate until it was repaired and remastered.<ref name=\"Clements\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/movies/film-dvd-3-women-coming-of-age-at-27.html |title=Film/DVD; '3 Women' Coming of Age At 27 |last=Clements |first=Marcelle |date=30 May 2004 |access-date=22 November 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> However, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film on [[DVD]] in 2004, with a [[Audio commentary|director's commentary]].<ref name=\"Clements\"/> Criterion re-released the film on [[Blu-ray]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/3-women-2123 |title=3 Women |last=Wilkins |first=Budd |date=20 October 2011 |access-date=22 November 2016 |work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n[[File:Shelley Duvall Bernice Bobs Her Hair 1977.JPG |thumb|The performance of [[Shelley Duvall]] received acclaim from critics, earning her the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress]] and a nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|British Academy Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]].]]\nThe film has a 94% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 31 reviews,<ref>{{Cite web|title=3 Women (1977)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/3_women/|access-date=21 November 2016|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and has received generally positive reviews from critics.{{sfn|Cook|2002|p=96}} [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, calling the first half \"a funny, satirical, and sometimes sad study of the community and its people,\" and adding the film then turns into \"masked sexual horror\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/3-women-1977 |title=3 Women |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=15 March 1977 |access-date=21 November 2016|work=Rogerebert.com}}</ref> Ebert added ''3 Women'' to his [[The Great Movies|Great Movies]] list in 2004, calling it \"Robert Altman's 1977 masterpiece\" and stating Duvall's expressions are \"a study in unease\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\n[[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''3 Women'' a \"funny, moving\" film, and Millie \"one of the most memorable characterizations Mr. Altman has ever given us,\" giving credit to Duvall as well.<ref name=\"Canby\" /> [[Molly Haskell]], in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', ranked the film as the second best of the year, describing it as \"ambitious, pretentious, gentle, goofy and mesmerizing\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Haskell |first=Molly |date=26 December 1977 |title=Choice and Prime |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |page=82}}</ref> ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' critics Marie Brenner and Jesse Kornbluth stated Altman had a likely desire to be the \"American [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]],\" calling ''3 Women'' \"an attempt at equaling Bergman's ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brenner |first1=Marie |last2=Kornbluth |first2=Jesse |date=June 1977 |title=Altman Stays Serious |magazine=[[Texas Monthly]] |page=118}}</ref>\n\nBrenner and Kornbluth credited Duvall for an \"extraordinary performance,\" but lamented the second-half shedding a documentary style.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Brenner |first1=Marie |last2=Kornbluth |first2=Jesse |date=June 1977 |title=Altman Stays Serious |magazine=[[Texas Monthly]] |page=120}}</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"It needed no proving, but on the evidence of his '3 Women,' Robert Altman is identifiable anew as one of the most fluent, imaginative, individual and magical film-makers working here or anywhere else.\"<ref>[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (April 27, 1977). \"Altman Magic in '3 Women'\".
