The film is a remake of [[Dino Risi]]'s 1974 Italian film ''[[Scent of a Woman (1974 film)|Profumo di donna]]'', adapted by [[Bo Goldman]] from the novel ''Il buio e il miele'' ({{lang-it|Darkness and Honey}}) by [[Giovanni Arpino]]. The film stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]], with [[James Rebhorn]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] and [[Gabrielle Anwar]] in supporting roles.\n\nPacino won the [[65th Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance and the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published]].

He accepts a temporary job over [[Thanksgiving]] weekend so he can buy a plane ticket home to [[Oregon]] for [[Christmas]]. The woman who hires him asks Charlie to watch over her uncle, retired Army [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Frank Slade, a blind, highly decorated [[Vietnam War]] veteran whom Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous alcoholic.\n\nCharlie and another student, George Willis Jr., witness three students setting up a prank to publicly humiliate the headmaster, Mr. Trask. After falling victim to the prank, Trask quickly learns of the witnesses and unsuccessfully presses them to name the perpetrators. Trask privately offers Charlie a bribe: a letter of recommendation to attend [[Harvard University]].\n\nFrank unexpectedly takes Charlie on a trip to [[New York City]], where they stay at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]] hotel. During dinner at the [[Oak Room (Plaza Hotel)|Oak Room]], Frank glibly states his intention to commit suicide. They pay an uninvited visit to the home of Frank's brother in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] for Thanksgiving dinner, where the cause of Frank's blindness is revealed: while drunk, he juggled live grenades to show off for a group of younger officers, and one exploded. Frank deliberately provokes everyone at dinner, which ends after a heated confrontation with his nephew Randy.\n\nAs they return to New York City, Charlie tells Frank about his problem at school. Frank advises Charlie to turn informant and go to Harvard, warning him that George will probably submit to Trask's pressure, so he should act and obtain a benefit before George does. While at a restaurant, Frank notices Donna, a young woman waiting for her date. He leads her to the dance floor, where they perform a spectacular [[tango]] (\"[[Por una Cabeza]]\").\n\nDeeply despondent the next morning, Frank is initially uninterested in Charlie's suggestions for that day's activities until he brings up test driving a new [[Ferrari Mondial#Mondial t|Ferrari]]. Frank talks the reluctant salesman into letting them take the car. Once on the road, Frank is unenthusiastic until Charlie allows him to drive, which results in a traffic stop, but Frank talks the police officer into letting them go without revealing that he is blind.\n\nAfter returning the car and waiting to cross the street, Frank grows impatient and walks into the middle of [[Park Avenue]], where he narrowly avoids being struck by multiple cars. When they return to the hotel, Frank sends Charlie to run several errands. Charlie initially leaves but quickly becomes suspicious. He returns to find Frank in his dress uniform and preparing to commit suicide with his service pistol. They fight over the gun, but Frank backs down after Charlie convinces him that he has much to live for and should face his circumstances courageously.\n\nCharlie and George are subjected to a formal inquiry by the student/faculty disciplinary committee, with the rest of the student body on hand to observe. As Trask opens the proceedings, Frank unexpectedly appears and sits with Charlie. George enlists the help of his wealthy father and they name the three perpetrators. When pressed for details, the Willises claim George Jr.'s poor vision prevented him from seeing more and defer to Charlie. Charlie refuses to inform, so Trask recommends his expulsion. Frank changes his earlier position and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie, in which he reminds the audience to value qualities like loyalty, integrity and courage. The disciplinary committee places the perpetrators on probation, deny George any reward for having named them and excuse Charlie from the rest of the proceedings.\n\nAs Charlie escorts Frank to his limousine, Frank flirts with political science professor Christine Downes, who commends him for his speech. He impresses her by telling her the brand of her perfume (\"[[Parfums Caron|Fleurs de Rocaille]]\"). Afterwards he inaccurately describes her to Charlie, stating her eyes are brown when they are actually blue. Charlie brings Frank home, where Frank happily greets his niece's children.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt.
