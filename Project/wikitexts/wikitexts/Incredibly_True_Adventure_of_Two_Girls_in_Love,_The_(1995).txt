It tells the story of two very different high school girls who fall in love.\n\n==Plot==\nRandy Dean is a 17-year-old student in her [[twelfth grade|final year]] with poor grades, only one friend\u2014Frank, a [[gay]] [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]\u2014secret cigarette and [[marijuana]] habits, and a cashier's job at a gas station with fellow worker Regina. Shunned by other students for her [[tomboy]]ish personality and appearance, she spends most of her free time either by herself or in illicit meetings with her [[affair|romantic partner]] Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her, even though Randy knows they are in a dead-end relationship. Randy lives with her [[lesbian]] aunt Rebecca and her girlfriend Vicky, as well as Rebecca's ex-girlfriend Lena, who has no place to stay and is living with them until she finds somewhere else she can go to.\n\nOne day Evie Roy stops in a pristine [[Range Rover]], unsure if her tires need air. Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time. Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her remarried husband. Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her [[clique|cliquish]] friends. During this time, Randy is approached by Wendy's jealous husband Ali at the gas station, who grabs Randy and warns her to stay away from his wife. Randy spends much of her time with Evie hanging out in meadows, trading music ([[opera]] and [[Mozart]] from Evie, [[punk rock]] from Randy) and talking. When Wendy next visits her, Randy rejects her, telling her she has a new girlfriend, Evie.\n\nEvie breaks up with her boyfriend Hayjay after he complains of her distant attitude towards him. Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of [[Walt Whitman]]\u2019s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', which Randy starts to devour. Inviting Evie to her family\u2019s small house for dinner one evening, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with Rebecca and Vicky since Randy's devoutly religious mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]]-like group. On the front steps of Rebecca's house, they kiss for the first time. Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means.\n\nRandy and Evie experiment with how \"[[coming out|out]]\" they can be as [[lesbian]]s, nervously holding hands at a local diner. Remembering Randy\u2019s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends. One girl is supportive (if confused), but the other two are hostile to the idea: one of them says, \u201cGod, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay you think you could at least choose someone who\u2019s pretty.\u201d Meanwhile, Randy's grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca. When Evie's mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in [[wine]] and marijuana. That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie's mother's bed.\n\nThe next morning, it is Evie's 18th birthday; Evelyn returns prematurely with presents for her, but is shocked by the mess in the kitchen and the rest of the house. Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers Evie and Randy, but only realizes Randy is a girl when she runs past her on her way out. Rebecca, who has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, goes over to go to Frank's house with Vicky and Lena, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night. Rebecca threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evie's phone number. She calls, but Evie and Randy have already absconded and she is left talking to a furious Evelyn.\n\nEvie and Randy, crying, scared and accusatory, take refuge in a motel. Randy finally calls Wendy, who comes out, pays for the room and tries to comfort the girls. Ali sees her car in the parking lot, however, and comes bursting in, eventually attracting Evelyn, Rebecca, Vicky, Lena, Frank, and Evie's three friends, who were driving past reading aloud from [[Rita Mae Brown]]\u2019s ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'' (apparently still processing Evie\u2019s news). The movie ends with Randy and Evie kissing and hugging in the open motel room doorway while everyone else argues in the background at top volume.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Laurel Holloman]] as Randall \"Randy\" Dean\n*[[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Evelyn \"Evie\" Roy Jr.\n*Maggie Moore as Wendy\n*Kate Stafford as Rebecca\n*[[Sabrina Artel's Trailer Talk|Sabrina Artel]] as Vicky\n*Nelson Rodr\u00edguez as Frank\n*[[Dale Dickey]] as Regina\n*Katlin Tyler as girl #1\n*Anna Padgett as girl #2\n*Chelsea Cattouse as girl #3\n*John Elsen as Ali\n*Stephanie Berry as Evelyn Roy\n*Toby Poser as Lena\n*Andrew Wright as Hayjay\n*Babs Davy as waitress\n*Lillian Kiesler as old lady #1\n*Maryette Charlton as old lady #2\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1992, Maria Maggenti started a script with an image in her head of a [[tomboy]] with love notes in her back pocket, gradually adding more characters such as the tomboy's family and her love interest. Later, she realized this character was based on her first girlfriend.<ref name=Cineaste/> Maggenti's script, which originated as \"a very dark story of teenage sexuality and [teenagers'] relationship to adults\", grew until Maggenti briefly abandoned it in 1994.<ref name=Cineaste/>\n\nHowever, the film's future associate producer, Melissa Painter, convinced Maggenti to shop the story around as an [[independent film]]. Two producers wanted a pivotal element of the two love interests being from very different paths, so Maggenti added a scene that established the beginning of the girls' relationship. The producers were delighted with this, so Maggenti wrote a new script which she finished in eight days.<ref name=\"FM\">{{cite magazine |date=1995 |title=On Screwball Comedy, Making it Work in the Master and Queer Love Stories: Writer/Director Maria Maggenti on The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/112588-on-screwball-comedy-making-it-work-in-the-master-and-queer-love-stories-writer-director-maria-maggenti-on-the-incredibly-true-adventures-of-two-girls-in-love/ |magazine=[[Filmmaker Magazine]] |access-date=17 September 2022}}</ref> She found she had surprised herself in that her script was now a comedic [[farce]]; the story wasn't about gay love or [[coming out]], but about first love between teenagers.<ref name=Cineaste/>\n \nShooting was completed in 21 days during the summer of 1994.<ref name=\"FM\"/> Scenes taking place at Randy and Evie's high school were filmed in divisions of [[Horace Mann School]], in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] neighborhood of [[the Bronx]].<ref name=\"VillageVoice\">{{cite news |last1=Pareles |first1=Marissa |title=Close-up on Riverdale |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/11/11/close-up-on-riverdale/ |access-date=17 September 2022 |date=November 11, 2003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909025817/https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/11/11/close-up-on-riverdale/ |archive-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOf the film's ending being likened by audiences to a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[romantic comedy]], Maggenti said, \"A lot of people have mentioned to me that the shot looks like a marriage portrait\u2026 That final shot is actually a very ambivalent shot, leaving them at the threshold of adulthood, a relationship, their families, everything.\"<ref name=Cineaste>{{cite web|first1=Joan M.|last1=West |first2=Dennis|last2=West|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/IncrediblyTrue.html|title=An Incredibly True Cinematic Adventure: An Interview with Maria Maggenti|year=1995|work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|volume=21|issue=4|via=[[University of California, Berkeley Library System|UC Berkeley Library]]|access-date=January 22, 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080803010751/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/IncrediblyTrue.html |archive-date=August 3, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Collider\">{{cite web |last1=Laman |first1=Douglas |title=How 'the Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love' Conveys the Idea That Queer Women Are Everywhere |url=https://collider.com/the-incredibly-true-adventure-of-two-girls-in-love-queer-women-are-everywhere/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |access-date=17 September 2022 |date=January 6, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Release ==\n''The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love'' debuted at the 1995 [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 1995 to good reviews.<ref name=\"Review for The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Caryn |author-link=Caryn James |date=June 16, 1995 |title=FILM REVIEW; Young love just between friends |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/movies/film-review-young-love-just-between-friends.html |accessdate=January 22, 2015 |website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  It was then given a [[limited theatrical release]] in the [[United States]] on June 16, 1995.
