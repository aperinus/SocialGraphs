The film stars [[Lindsey Haun]], [[Jack Huston]], and [[Max Kasch]]. The plot follows a group of American students and their English guide who are stalked by a serial killer while out in the woods looking for [[psilocybin mushrooms]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAmerican student Tara and her college friends visit Ireland to meet with local resident and friend Jake, and go camping in woodlands surrounding a long-disused children's home. While collecting psilocybin mushrooms for later consumption, Tara eats a death bell mushroom (Galerina) and suffers a seizure after which she experiences dream-like trances in which she begins having premonitions of future events.\n\nAround the evening camp fire, with Tara resting in her tent, Jake tells a ghost story of the empty children's home nearby, and of a violent sadistic monk who survived an assault by one of his charges, as revenge for killing his twin brother. Overhearing this causes Tara to have premonitions of the murders of her friends.\n\nAfter a deathly row with his girlfriend and the others, aggressive [[jock (athlete)|jock]] Bluto drinks some of the hallucinogenic tea (supposedly for all to share in the morning) and experiences a [[psychedelic experience|trip]] which culminates in his murder, seemingly at the hands of the rogue monk from the children's home.\n\nThe following morning, unconcerned by Bluto's disappearance&nbsp;\u2013 the others consume the mushroom tea, only to become separated from one another in the woods while under its effects. The three women, arguing and squabbling, get lost until they themselves are split, and Holly and Lisa are violently murdered&nbsp;\u2013 in accordance with Tara's continuing visions&nbsp;\u2013 after an encounter with local woodsmen Ernie and Bernie.\n\nJake and Troy find Tara on the bank of a river, and tell her to meet them in the abandoned home to summon help. Upon investigating the property, Troy is apparently killed by the monk, and Jake escapes by jumping from a high window, breaking his leg as he lands.  Tara finds him and the two flee the [[Haunted House|haunted]] scene. Then, while resting his leg, he is murdered.\n\nTara awakes as a [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] helicopter hovers over the camp, and is dispatched into an ambulance as the sole survivor.  As her mobile phone rings, she experiences a rapid flashback and realizes that the death bell mushroom caused her to murder all of her friends. She asks the paramedic for help. Everything becomes quiet until we see her bloody hands holding a pair of bloody scissors which suggests that she has killed the paramedic. The film ends with Tara running in the woods.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Lindsey Haun]] as Tara\n*[[Max Kasch]] as Troy\n*[[Jack Huston]] as Jake\n*[[Robert Hoffman (actor)|Robert Hoffman]] as Bluto\n*[[Maya Hazen]] as Lisa\n*[[Alice Greczyn]] as Holly\n*[[Don Wycherley]] as Ernie\n*[[Sean McGinley]] as Bernie\n*David McGinley as Dale\n*Toby Sedgwick as Black Brother\n*Andr\u00e9 Pollack as The Dog\n*Jack Gleeson as Lonely Twin\n**Joe Phelan as Young Lonely Twin\n*Mike Carbery as Paramedic\n*Anna Tikhonova as Mysterious Woman 1\n*Goranna McDonald as Mysterious Woman 2\n*Berry Murphy as Lonely Twin's Brother\n*Joe Murphy as Feral Boy\n*Stuart Rankin as Extra\n\n== Production ==\nAn Irish, Danish, and British co-production,<ref name=bfi/> ''Shrooms'' was shot over a period of seven weeks in April and May 2006 in locations including Gosford Park, [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Breathnach & Huston On Spine Chiller 'Shrooms' {{!}} The Irish Film & Television Network|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4280850&tpl=archnews&force=1|access-date=2021-10-07|website=www.iftn.ie}}</ref> and [[Rossmore Forest Park]] in [[County Monaghan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-30|title=Celebrating Northern Ireland's Most Spooky Films|url=https://www.culturenightbelfast.com/celebrating-northern-irelands-most-spooky-films/|access-date=2021-10-07|website=Culture Night Belfast}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], gave it a rating of 22% based on 18 reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shrooms|title=''Shrooms''|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2022-04-17}}</ref>  Derek Elly of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as \"A shake-'n'-bake slasher movie that shows just how difficult it is to do effective, modestly budgeted horror\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934481.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |title=Shrooms Review |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2008-02-28 | first=Derek | last=Elley}}</ref>  S\u00e9amus Leonard wrote in [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]]'s review, \"The film definitely looks the part, but is hollow in virtually every other department.\"  Leonard said the film may play better to non-Irish audiences, but viewers in Ireland will likely find it unintentionally funny.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2007/1122/447458-shrooms/|title=''Shrooms''|last=Leonard|first=S\u00e9amus|work=[[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]]|date=2007-11-22|accessdate=2022-04-17}}</ref>  Writing for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Donald Clarke said the film has \"some elegant compositions\" but seems assembled from other recent horror films.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/shrooms-1.985153|title=''Shrooms''|last=Clarke|first=Donald|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=2007-11-23|accessdate=2022-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of films featuring hallucinogens]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0492486|Shrooms}}\n* {{allmovie title}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes}}\n* {{metacritic film}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080201191630/http://www.andersongraphics.co.uk/2008/01/20/interview-paddy-breathnack-on-shrooms/ Paddy Breathnach interview on ''Shrooms'']\n\n{{Paddy Breathnach}}\n\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:2007 horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:2000s slasher films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dario Marianelli]]\n[[Category:Films about hallucinogens]]\n[[Category:Films about vacationing]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paddy Breathnach]]\n[[Category:Films set in forests]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:Icon Productions films]]\n[[Category:Irish horror films]]\n[[Category:Irish slasher films]]\n[[Category:Danish horror films]]\n[[Category:British horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
