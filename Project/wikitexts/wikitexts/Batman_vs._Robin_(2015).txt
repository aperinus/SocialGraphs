After witnessing the death of his parents, Bruce suspects that the Court was behind the murder but finds no evidence, leaving him to believe the Court was in fact just a story. In the present day, Bruce\u2019s son [[Damian Wayne|Damian]]{{refn|group=N|Introduced in the 2014 film ''[[Son of Batman]]''.}} goes out as Robin to rescue a group of missing children abducted by [[Anton Schott (comics)|Anton Schott]], who has been turning them into dolls. Afterward, a mysterious figure in an owl costume suddenly appears and kills Anton, leaving a feather behind. However, due to his past violent actions, Bruce blames Damian for his murder, prompting him to place security measures around Wayne Manor to prevent Damian from going out as Robin.\n\nThe following night, Bruce goes out as Batman to track down the feather, leading him to a museum where he is confronted by a group of owl costumed assassins. They eventually capture him and take him to the Court of Owls headquarters, where he meets their leader the \"Grandmaster\". The Grandmaster offers Bruce the chance to join them, but he kindly declines, with the Court returning him home safely. Meanwhile, Damian manages to escape Wayne Manor, and while out he meets the same assassin who killed Anton, introducing himself as Talon. Talon takes Damian under his wing, training him to become a Court assassin.\n\nBruce infiltrates a Court headquarters and is taken out by hallucination gas, but is rescued by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. When Damian is revealed to be Bruce's son, the Grandmaster rejects him under the decision to emotionally cripple Bruce with Damian's death, prompting Talon to attack the Court killing several members in the process before killing the Grandmaster, who is revealed to be socialite Samantha Vanaver, Bruce\u2019s girlfriend, while also insisting that she would have done the same to him. Now having control of the Court, Talon leads an attack on Wayne Manor, but Batman, Nightwing and Alfred fend them off.\n\nDamian escapes the Court headquarters and defeats Talon, telling him he can never be a better father than Bruce. In his defeat, Talon commits suicide by forcing Damian to stab him through the neck with his own sai. This greatly traumatizes Damian, who rejects Bruce\u2019s offer to return home on the grounds that he doesn\u2019t know who he is. Ultimately, Damian decides to leave Bruce, who suggests he should go to a monastery in the Himalayas in order to find himself.{{refn|group=N|Damian returns in the 2016 film ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason O'Mara]] \u2013 [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Stuart Allan]] \u2013 [[Damian Wayne|Damian Wayne / Robin]]<ref name=\"hr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/animated-batman-robin-movie-finds-763553|title=Jason O'Mara, Jeremy Sisto and even \"Weird Al\" Yankovic are among those lending their pipes to the 'Son of Batman' sequel.|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 14, 2015|access-date=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] \u2013 [[Court of Owls#The Talons|Talon]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Sean Maher]] \u2013 [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson / Nightwing]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[David McCallum]] \u2013 [[Alfred Pennyworth]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Troy Baker]] \u2013 [[Court of Owls]] Lieutenant<ref name=\"castandcrew\">{{cite web|title=Batman vs Robin: Backstage - Cast and Crew|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/dcuam/batmanvsrobin/backstage/castcrew.php|publisher=The World's Finest|access-date=2015-04-09}}</ref>\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] \u2013 [[Thomas Wayne]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] \u2013 Samantha Vanaver<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Robin Atkin Downes]] \u2013 [[Court of Owls]] Grandmaster<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] \u2013 [[Anton Schott (comics)|Anton Schott / The Dollmaker]]<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Trevor Devall]] \u2013 Jack<ref name=\"castandcrew\"/>\n* [[Griffin Gluck]] \u2013 Young Bruce Wayne<ref name=\"castandcrew\"/>\n* [[Peter Onorati]] \u2013 Draco<ref name=\"hr\" />\n* [[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] \u2013 Jill<ref name=\"castandcrew\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2015}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of {{RT data|score}}, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}, based on {{RT data|count}} reviews.<ref>{{Cite Rotten Tomatoes |id={{RT data|rtid|noprefix=y}} |type=m |title=Batman vs. Robin |access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{cbignore}}</ref> IGN rated it 6.7/10<ref>{{Citation|title=Batman vs. Robin Review - IGN|date=April 14, 2015|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/14/batman-vs-robin-review|language=en|access-date=2020-12-23}}</ref> and Screen Rant 2.5/5.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-04-13|title='Batman vs. Robin' Review|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-vs-robin-movie-reviews/|access-date=2020-12-23|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US}}</ref> The film earned $4,238,572 in domestic home video sales.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Batman-vs-Robin#tab=summary \"Batman vs. Robin (2014) The Numbers listing\"].
