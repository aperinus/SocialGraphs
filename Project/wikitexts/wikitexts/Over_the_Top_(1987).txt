It was produced and directed by [[Menahem Golan]], and its screenplay was written by [[Stirling Silliphant]] and Stallone. The original music score was composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]]. The main character, Lincoln Hawk/Hawks, played by Stallone, is a long-haul truck driver who tries to win back his estranged son, Michael, while becoming a champion [[arm wrestling|arm wrestler]].\n\n==Plot==\nLincoln Hawk is a truck driver who also arm wrestles for extra cash. Hawk's estranged wife Christina, who is suffering from heart disease, asks that Hawk pick up their young son Michael from [[military academy|military school]] and develop a relationship with him; Hawk had left them ten years earlier. Michael's wealthy grandfather, Christina's father, Jason Cutler, believes that Hawk has no right to be in his grandson's life. Michael distrusts Hawk initially and treats him with contempt at every turn.\n\nOver the course of a trip from [[Colorado]] to [[California]], the two reconcile and bond. When they finally arrive at the hospital, Christina has died from complications during surgery. Michael blames Hawk for delaying his arrival and immediately leaves for his grandfather's estate. An attempt to retrieve Michael ends with Hawk being arrested when he resorts to [[ramraiding]] the gated mansion. Michael visits Hawk in jail and forgives him, but says he feels safer living with his grandfather. As a condition of charges being dropped, Hawk is obliged to sign over custody of Michael to Cutler.\n\nHawk leaves to compete in the [[World Armwrestling Championship]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], hoping to start his own trucking company with the prize of $100,000 in cash and a $250,000 [[Volvo]] White Tractor Truck, despite his underdog status. Most other participants are much larger, including Bull Hurley, who is the undefeated world champion for the prior five years the odds-on favorite to win again, other competitors include John Grizzly, Mad Dog Madison, Harry Bosco and Two Time Canadian Champion \"Slammin'\" Carl Adams, When Hawk arrives, he sells his truck for $7,000 and uses the proceeds to place a bet on himself (as a 20\u20131 long shot) to win. Meanwhile, Michael learns Cutler had driven his parents apart and had been intercepting and hiding letters Hawk had regularly written to him. Stunned by his grandfather's deceptions, Michael steals a pickup truck and drives to Las Vegas to find Hawk.\n\nHawk advances to the final eight competitors in the double-elimination tournament before suffering his first loss, injuring his arm in the process. Cutler, who is also in Las Vegas, summons Hawk to his hotel suite and offers Hawk a chance for a fresh start: $500,000 and a top-of-the-line semi (even better than the tournament's grand prize) on the condition that he stay out of their lives for good, but Hawk refuses. He returns to the tournament with improved focus and advances to the final match against Hurley. Michael finds Hawk and apologizes for misjudging him, which gives Hawk the emotional support he needs to compete. After a long match, Hawk manages to beat Hurley and wins the tournament. A triumphant Hawk and Michael take their new truck, cash prize and gambling winnings and drive off to start a new life together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Lincoln \"Linc\" Hawk/Hawks (both names are used, in error, throughout the movie by many characters including Stallone)\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Jason Cutler\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Christina Hawk\n* [[Rick Zumwalt]] as Bob \"Bull\" Hurley\n* [[David Mendenhall]] as Michael \"Mike\" Cutler \n* Chris McCarty as Tim Salanger\n* [[Terry Funk]] as Ruker\n* Bruce Way as John Grizzly\n* [[Jimmy Keegan]] as Richie\n* Greg \"Magic\" Schwartz as Smasher\n* [[Allan Graf]] as Collins\n* John Braden as Col.

Moroder was in charge of creating a [[concept album]] with a compilation of new songs in different genres and diverse artists, writing most tracks on the album himself in collaboration with [[Tom Whitlock]].<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/over-the-top-mw0000191330 Allmusic review]</ref>\n\nThe [[soundtrack]] [[album]] was released on February 13, 1987, under [[CBS Records International|CBS]] to coincide with the release of the movie. It contains music from [[Frank Stallone]], [[Kenny Loggins]] (who performs the film's central theme, \"[[Meet Me Half Way]]\"), [[Eddie Money]], and [[Sammy Hagar]]. [[John Wetton]], lead singer of the rock group [[Asia (band)|Asia]], sang \"[[Winner Takes It All (Sammy Hagar song)|Winner Takes It All]]\" for the movie, but after performing the song, it was felt that his voice wasn't \"mean\" enough, so the song was offered to Hagar, whose version, featuring a bass guitar solo from Hagar's then-[[Van Halen|bandmate]] [[Edward Van Halen]], ended up being the one on the soundtrack. Asia is credited for the track \"Gypsy Soul\", but Wetton is the only Asia member who actually contributed to the song.\n\nThe track listing is:\n# \"[[Winner Takes It All (Sammy Hagar song)|Winner Takes It All]]\" \u2013 Sammy Hagar\n# \"In This Country\" \u2013 [[Robin Zander]] (international versions of the film had [[Eddie Money]] singing instead)\n# \"Take It Higher\" \u2013 Larry Greene\n# \"All I Need Is You\" \u2013 [[Big Trouble (band)|Big Trouble]]\n# \"Bad Nite\" \u2013 Frank Stallone\n# \"[[Meet Me Half Way]]\" \u2013 [[Kenny Loggins]]\n# \"Gypsy Soul\" \u2013 Asia\n# \"The Fight (Instrumental)\" \u2013 [[Giorgio Moroder]]\n# \"Mind Over Matter\" \u2013 Larry Greene\n# \"I Will Be Strong\" \u2013 Eddie Money\n\nStallone appears in the video for \"Winner Takes It All,\" wrestling Hagar at the end of the video. Hagar says in his video commentary on the DVD ''The Long Road to Cabo'' that he was unenthusiastic about the song. Hagar says that Stallone gave him his black cap at the end of the shoot, both signed it, and the cap went to charity, fetching around $10,000.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n[[File:Over the Top - Renato Casaro (1987 Film).jpg|thumb|Theatrical international release poster by [[Renato Casaro]]]]\n''Over the Top'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] on Thursday, February 12, 1987, in New York and Los Angeles before expanding to 1,758 theaters on Friday, grossing $5.1 million over the [[President's Day]] weekend, finishing in fourth place.<ref name=\"opening\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 18, 1987|page=3|title='Platoon' Pumps Up February B.O.; Brisk Biz At Top}}</ref> In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US and Canada.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stallone Loses A Box-office Arm-wrestle|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-19/entertainment/ca-4353_1_box-office|access-date=2012-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 32% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10.

[[David Mendenhall]] won two for both Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star, and [[Sylvester Stallone]] was nominated for Worst Actor, which he lost to [[Bill Cosby]] for ''[[Leonard Part 6]]''.\n\nStallone later said of the film, \"I would have made it less glossy and set it more in an urban environment, for one. Next, I would've not used a never-ending stream of rock songs, but scored music instead, and most likely would've made the event in Vegas more ominous \u2013 not so carnival-like.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 |title=Stallone answers December 9th & 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA at BNAT!!! |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |access-date=July 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0093692|title=Over the Top}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|36935|Over the Top}}\n* {{AFI film|id=57776|title=Over the Top}}\n* {{mojo title|0093692}}\n\n{{Kenny Loggins}}\n{{Menahem Golan}}\n{{Sylvester Stallone}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Over The Top (Film)}}\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s chase films]]\n[[Category:1980s drama road movies]]\n[[Category:1980s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama road movies]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Arm wrestling]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:Trucker films]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Giorgio Moroder]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Menahem Golan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Sylvester Stallone]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Stirling Silliphant]]\n[[Category:1987 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about father\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Menahem Golan]]\n[[Category:Golden Raspberry Award winning films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Yoram Globus]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
