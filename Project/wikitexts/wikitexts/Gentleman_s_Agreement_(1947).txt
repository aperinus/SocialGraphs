Hobson]]'s best-selling 1947 [[Gentleman's Agreement (novel)|novel of the same title]]. It concerns a journalist (played by [[Gregory Peck]]) who poses as a Jew to research an expos\u00e9 on the widespread [[Anti-Semitism]] in [[New York City]] and the affluent communities of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and [[Darien, Connecticut]]. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] and won three: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Celeste Holm]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] ([[Elia Kazan]]).\n\nThe movie was controversial in its day, as was a similar film on the same subject, ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'', which was released the same year (though that film was originally a story about anti-homosexuality, later changed to anti-Semitism).\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words long. -->\nPhilip Schuyler Green is a widowed journalist who has just moved to New York City with his son Tommy and mother. Green meets with magazine publisher John Minify, who asks Green, a [[Gentile]], to write an article on [[anti-Semitism]]. He is not very enthusiastic at first, but after initially struggling with how to approach the topic in a fresh way, Green is inspired to adopt a Jewish identity and writes about his first-hand experiences.\n\nAt a lunch party, Phil meets Minify's niece Kathy Lacey, who turns out to be the person who suggested the story idea. The next day, Phil tries to explain anti-Jewish prejudice to his son \u2013 directly after displaying some anti-female prejudice. Green tells his mother that he was surprised after learning that the article came from \"a girl\". His mother mocks him for this. Phil and Kathy begin dating. They agree to keep it secret that Phil is not Jewish. Though Kathy seems to have [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] views, she is taken aback after learning of Phil's plan.\n\nAt the magazine, Phil is assigned a secretary, Elaine Wales. She turns out to be Jewish, but changed her name to get the job. After Phil informs Minify about Wales' experience, Minify orders the magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Phil meets fashion editor Anne Dettrey, who becomes a good friend and potentially more, particularly as strains develop between Phil and Kathy.\n\nPhil's childhood friend, Dave Goldman moves to New York for a job and lives with the Greens while looking for a home for his family. Dave is Jewish and also experiences anti-Semitism. Housing is scarce in the city, but it is particularly difficult for Goldman, since not all landlords will rent to a Jewish family.\n\nAs Phil researches his story, he experiences several incidents of bigotry. When his mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with an obviously Jewish name. After hearing Phil is Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves. In addition, the janitor is shocked to see that a Jewish name is listed on the mail box. Furthermore, when Phil wants to celebrate his honeymoon at a swanky hotel, the manager refuses to register Phil and tells him to go to a different hotel instead. Tommy also becomes the target of [[bullying|bullies]] because of this. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles Tommy, telling him their taunts of \"dirty Jew\" are wrong because he isn't Jewish, not that the [[epithet]] is wrong in and of itself.\n\nKathy's attitudes are revealed further when she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane invites them to a celebration in her home in [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], which is known to be a community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene, Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil is only pretending to be a Jew, but he dissuades her. At the party, everyone is very friendly to Phil, though many people are \"unable\" to attend at the last minute.\n\nDave announces that he will have to quit his job because he cannot find a residence for his family. Kathy owns a vacant cottage in Darien, and Phil sees it as the obvious solution to Dave's problem. Kathy, however, is unwilling to offend her neighbors by renting it to a Jewish family. Phil breaks his engagement to her and announces that he will be moving away from New York when his article is published. When it comes out, it is very well received by the magazine staff.\n\nKathy meets with Dave and tells him how sick she felt when a party guest told a bigoted joke. However, she has no answer when Dave asks her what she did about it. She realizes that remaining silent condones the prejudice. The next day, Dave tells Phil that he and his family will be moving into the cottage in Darien, and Kathy will be moving in with her sister next door to make sure they are treated well. When Phil hears this, he reconciles with Kathy.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Gregory Peck in Gentleman's Agreement trailer closeup.jpg|70px]] ||[[Gregory Peck]] as Philip Schuyler Green || [[File:Anne Revere in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[Anne Revere]] as Mrs. Green\n|-\n| [[File:Dorothy McGuire in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[Dorothy McGuire]] as Kathy Lacey ||[[File:June Havoc in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[June Havoc]] as Elaine Wales\n|-\n| [[File:John Garfield in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[John Garfield]] as Dave Goldman ||[[File:Albert Dekker in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[Albert Dekker]] as John Minify\n|-\n| [[File:Celeste Holm in Gentleman's Agreement trailer.jpg|70px]] ||[[Celeste Holm]] as Anne Dettrey||[[File:Jane Wyatt in Gentleman's Agreement trailer cropped.jpg|70px]] ||[[Jane Wyatt]] as Jane\n|-\n|}\n\n===Other cast members===\n{|\n|-\n|[[Dean Stockwell]]\n|as Tommy Green\n|-\n|Nicholas Joy\n|as Doctor Craigie\n|-\n|[[Sam Jaffe]]\n|as Professor Fred Lieberman\n|}\n\n==Production==\nZanuck decided to make a film version of Hobson's novel after being refused membership in the [[Los Angeles Country Club]], because it was assumed (incorrectly) that he was Jewish. Before filming commenced, [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and other Jewish film executives approached Darryl Zanuck and asked him not to make the film, fearing it would \"stir up trouble\". They also warned that [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]] enforcer [[Joseph Breen]] might not allow the film to pass the censors, as he had been known to make disparaging remarks about Jews. There was also concern that Dorothy McGuire's character being divorced would offend the [[National Legion of Decency]].\n\nThe role of Phillip Green was first offered to [[Cary Grant]], but he turned it down. Peck decided to accept the role, although his agent advised him to refuse, believing Peck would be endangering his career. Jewish actor John Garfield agreed to play a lesser role in the film to be a part of it.\n\nPortions of the film were shot on location in [[Darien, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynn Haney |title=Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life|publisher= Da Capo Press|date= 2003 |ISBN =0-7867-1473-5}}</ref>\n\n==Reception and box-office==\n''Gentleman's Agreement'' received a generally favorable reception from influential ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]]. Crowther said that \"every point about prejudice which Miss Hobson had to make in her book has been made with superior illustration and more graphic demonstration in the film, so that the sweep of her moral indignation is not only widened, but intensified thereby\". However, Crowther also said that the movie shared the novel's failings in that \"explorations are narrowly confined to the upper-class social and professional level to which he is immediately exposed\". He also said the main character's shock at the extent of anti-Semitism was lacking in credibility: \"It is, in a careful analysis, an extraordinarily naive role.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE7DE113AE233A25751C1A9679D946693D6CF |title=''Gentleman's Agreement'' (1947) |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 11, 1947}}</ref>\n\n''The New York Herald Tribune'' described it as a \"brilliant blow against racial and religious intolerance\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/motionpictureher169unse|title=Motion Picture Herald|date=July 11, 1947|publisher=Quigley Publishing Co.|accessdate=July 11, 2021|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>''The Daily Mirror'' assessed it as \"the most explosive picture of the year\" and \"one of the most exciting and punch-laden pictures you've ever seen.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn addition to winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress ([[Celeste Holm]]), ''Gentleman's Agreement'' was one of Fox's highest-grossing movies of 1947. The political nature of the film, however, upset the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], with [[Elia Kazan]], [[Darryl F. Zanuck|Darryl Zanuck]], [[John Garfield]], and [[Anne Revere]] all being called to testify before the committee. Revere refused to testify and although Garfield appeared, he refused to \"name names\". Both were placed in the ''[[Red Channels]]'' of the [[Hollywood Blacklist]]. Garfield remained on the blacklist for a year, was called again to testify against his wife, and died of a heart attack at the age of 39 before his second hearing date.\n\nIn recognition for producing ''Gentleman's Agreement'', the Hollywood chapter of [[B'nai B'rith International]] honored Darryl Zanuck as its \"Man of the Year\" for 1948. On Sunday, December 12, a gala commemoration evening was held in downtown Los Angeles at the Biltmore Hotel before a crowd of over a thousand. Among the tributes to Zanuck, New Mexico Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson|Clinton Anderson]] said, \"He does not storm up and down the streets of a community, urging its citizens to do good. He does not fill the pages of books with words that string together into a sermon. He allows you to be seated comfortably in a theater, to be absorbed in a problem and to walk out into the night with your thoughts clarified and your lips saying, 'This situation ought to be changed'.\"<ref>''Los Angeles Times''. (December 14, 1948). p. 14.</ref> After the formal speeches there was a star-studded variety show, including the debut before the Hollywood film world of the team of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].\n\nThe movie was an unexpected hit at the box office. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', it earned $3.9&nbsp;million in rentals in the US in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/variety173-1949-01|title=Variety (January 1949)|date=July 11, 1949|publisher=New York, NY: Variety Publishing Company|accessdate=July 11, 2021|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] said \"sincere...then daring approach to the subject matter is tame now.\"<ref name=\"Maltin, Leonard 2005\">{{cite book|isbn = 9780452286207 |publisher = Plume |editor1-last= Maltin |editor1-first= Leonard |title = Leonard Maltin\u2019s Classic Movie Guide|date = 2005|editor2-first=Spencer|editor2-last= Green|editor3-first= Luke|editor3-last= Sader }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
