The film was produced by Open Road Films Ltd. and [[Columbia Pictures]]. The screenplay, written by [[Hollywood Blacklist|blacklisted]] Hollywood writer [[Lester Cole]] (under the pseudonym \"Gerald L.C. Copley\"), was based upon Joy Adamson's 1960 non-fiction book ''[[Born Free (book)|Born Free]]''. The film was directed by [[James Hill (British director)|James Hill]] and produced by [[Sam Jaffe (producer)|Sam Jaffe]] and [[Paul Radin]].  ''Born Free'', and its [[Film score|musical score]] by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], won numerous awards, as well as the [[Born Free (Matt Monro song)|title song]] with lyrics by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and sung by [[Matt Monro]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn the Northern Province of Kenya, a woman is killed and eaten by a male lion. British senior wildlife warden [[George Adamson]] (Bill Travers) is sent in to kill the menacing [[lion]] and also his female, who charges him in defence of her three cubs. Realizing they are now motherless, George brings the three cubs home to his wife [[Joy Adamson|Joy]] (Virginia McKenna) and raises them. They name the cubs Big One, Lastika, and [[Elsa the lioness|Elsa]], who is the youngest and the one which Joy and George become especially attached to. When the cubs get too old, the older two are sent to [[Rotterdam Zoo]] but the Adamsons choose to keep Elsa.\n\nSome years later, Joy and George soon have to travel to Kiunga as George has been told by his boss, John Kendall (Geoffrey Keen) about a lion who is killing goats in a local village. George successfully manages to kill the lion and he and Joy are able to share a special holiday with Elsa, where they introduce her to the [[Indian Ocean]]. On returning to the Northern Province, the Adamsons learn that Elsa has caused a massive elephant stampede. Kendall states that the Adamsons can no longer keep Elsa and must find a zoo to take her in. However, Joy instead wishes to teach Elsa how to survive in the wild, which Kendall reluctantly gives her and George three months to do.\n\nJoy and George travel to [[Meru National Park]] where they aim to release Elsa. Initially, they attempt to introduce Elsa to a male lion, which does not go to plan \u2013 they leave her overnight with a fresh zebra kill but return in the morning to find her all by herself. Elsa is constantly taken out to the bush but fails to make a kill, getting attacked by a [[warthog]] on one of these outings. Eventually, Joy and George decide to leave Elsa in the bush for at least a week and change the location of their camp so that Elsa can become more independent. However, they find her severely injured (possibly by wild lions). Joy still believes that she can teach Elsa to survive as she opposes sending her to a zoo, where she will have no freedom. This proves to be a good decision as Elsa eventually starts leaving the Adamsons for days at a time and eventually makes several kills. The Adamsons thus take her out for her final test \u2013 an attempt to join a wild pride. Elsa manages to fight a wild lioness and is accepted into the pride \u2013 Joy and George are overjoyed at their success but promise to see their dear friend again when they return to Kenya.\n\nA year later, the Adamsons return to Kenya and are given a week to find Elsa. They are overjoyed to see that Elsa has succeeded as a wild lion and is now the mother of three cubs. However, Joy and George both agree that they will not interact with the cubs, allowing them to survive as wild lions.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Virginia McKenna]] as [[Joy Adamson]]\n* [[Bill Travers]] as [[George Adamson]]\n* [[Geoffrey Keen]] as John Kendall\n* Peter Lukoye as Nuru\n* Surya Patel as the Doctor\n* Geoffrey Best as Watson, a big game hunter\n* Bill Godden as Sam\n\nThe film's credits list lions and lionesses Boy, Girl, Henrietta, [[Mara the Lioness|Mara]], Ugas, and \"the Cubs\".\n\n==Production==\nThe film reunited the real-life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as a couple first seen together in ''[[The Smallest Show on Earth]]'' in 1957.\n\nGeorge Adamson served as chief technical advisor on the film and discusses his involvement in his first autobiography, ''Bwana Game'' (UK title, 1968), known in the US as ''A Lifetime with Lions''.<ref>[http://www.fatheroflions.org/Bibliography.html Bibliography \u2013 BooksFilmsMovies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to [[Ben Mankiewicz]], who introduces the film on [[Turner Classic Movies]], the production unit mainly used wild lions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe making of the film was a life-changing experience for actors [[Virginia McKenna]] and her husband [[Bill Travers]], who became [[animal rights]] activists and were instrumental in creating the [[Born Free Foundation]].\n\nOne of the lions in the film was played by a former [[mascot]] of the [[Scots Guards]], who had to leave him behind when they left Kenya.<ref>{{citation|magazine=Life|author=Time Inc|title=A 'Born Free' Star Is Saved From Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21AEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47|date=28 November 1969|publisher=Time Inc|pages=47, 48}}</ref>\nThe producers also acknowledged the help received from Emperor [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia and the [[Uganda Game and Fisheries Department|Game Department of Uganda]].\n\n==Critical response and box-office==\n''Born Free'' received critical acclaim.

In 1972, a film sequel entitled ''[[Living Free]]'' was released. While deriving its name from the second book, the film was based on the third book in the series. It starred [[Susan Hampshire]] and [[Nigel Davenport]] as Joy and George Adamson although the film was not as well-received as its predecessor.\n\nA documentary follow-up to ''Born Free'', entitled ''The Lions Are Free'', was released in 1969. The film follows ''Born Free''-actor [[Bill Travers]] as he journeys to a remote area in [[Kenya]] to visit [[George Adamson]], and several of Adamson's lion friends.\n\nIn 1974, a 13-episode American television series was broadcast by [[NBC]], entitled ''[[Born Free (TV series)|Born Free]]'', starring [[Diana Muldaur]] and [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] as Joy and George Adamson. The series was later followed by television film in 1996 called ''[[Born Free: A New Adventure]]'', with [[Linda Purl]] and [[Chris Noth]]. Joy and George Adamson do not appear as the main characters in the story. It spawned a TV series in 1998, but none of the episodes aired in the U.S.\n\n''[[To Walk with Lions]]'' (1999) depicts the last years of George Adamson's life, as seen through the eyes of his assistant, [[Tony Fitzjohn]]. George is portrayed by [[Richard Harris]], and [[Honor Blackman]] makes a brief appearance as Joy.\n\nThe one-hour ''[[Nature (TV series)|Nature]]'' documentary ''Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story'' was released on [[PBS]] stations in January 2011. It includes a collection of archival footage and an exploration into the lives of Joy and George Adamson during the years following release of the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Rachel|title=Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story, Nature on PBS \u2013 US TV review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8246070/Elsas-Legacy-The-Born-Free-Story-Nature-on-PBS-US-TV-review.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=18 December 2012|date=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christian the lion]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*[http://www.bornfree.org.uk/ Born Free website] for the [[Born Free Foundation]]\n*{{IMDb title|0060182|Born Free}}\n* {{TCMDb title|23970|Born Free}}\n* {{AFI film|id=22316|title=Born Free}}\n\n{{James Hill}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1960s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:British children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:British adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:British films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Children's drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Environmental films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television shows]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Hill (British director)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Australia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Papua New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Films set in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Films about lions]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:1960s children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:1966 drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]"}]}}}}
