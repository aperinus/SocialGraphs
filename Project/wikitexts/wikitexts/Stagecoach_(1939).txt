The screenplay by [[Dudley Nichols]] is an adaptation of \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", a 1937 short story by [[Ernest Haycox]]. The film follows a group of strangers riding on a [[stagecoach]] through dangerous [[Apache]] territory.\n\nThe film has long been recognized as an important work that transcends the Western genre. Philosopher [[Robert B. Pippin]] has observed that both the collection of characters and their journey \"are archetypal rather than merely individual\" and that the film is a \"mythic representation of the American aspiration toward a form of politically meaningful equality.\"<ref name=\"Pippins 2010 3, 5\">{{cite book |last=Pippins|first=Robert |date=2010 |title=Hollywood Westerns and American Myth |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=3, 5|isbn=9780300172065}}</ref> In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in their [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref> Still, ''Stagecoach'' has not avoided controversy.

Many of the movies Ford shot there also starred John Wayne. Scenes from ''Stagecoach'', including a sequence introducing John Wayne's character the Ringo Kid, blended shots of Monument Valley with shots filmed on the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]], [[RKO]] Encino [[Movie Ranch]], and other locations. Geographic incongruities are visible throughout the film, including the closing scene where Ringo (Wayne) and Dallas (Trevor) depart Lordsburg, in southwestern New Mexico, by way of Monument Valley.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn June 1880, a group of strangers boards the [[stagecoach]] from Tonto, [[Arizona Territory]], to [[Lordsburg, New Mexico]]. Among them are Dallas, a [[prostitute]] driven out of town by the \"Law and Order League\"; the alcoholic Doc Boone; pregnant Lucy Mallory, who is travelling to join her cavalry officer husband; and whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock.\n\nBuck, the stage driver, looks for his shotgun guard, and Marshal Curley Wilcox tells him that the guard is off searching for the Ringo Kid.  Ringo has broken out of prison after hearing that his father and brother were murdered by Luke Plummer. Buck tells Curley that Ringo is heading for Lordsburg. Knowing that Ringo has vowed vengeance, Curley decides to ride the stage as guard.\n\nAs the stagecoach sets out, [[Cavalry (United States)|U.S. Cavalry]] Lieutenant Blanchard announces that [[Geronimo]] and his [[Apache]]s are on the warpath, and that the small cavalry troop will provide an escort to Dry Fork. Upon seeing her distress, gambler and Southern gentleman Hatfield offers his protection to Mrs. Mallory and climbs aboard. At the edge of town Henry Gatewood, a banker absconding with embezzled money, flags down the stage and joins the passengers.\n\nFurther along the road, the stage comes across the Ringo Kid, stranded when his horse went lame. Though Curley and Ringo are friends, Curley takes Ringo into custody and crowds him into the coach. When they reach Dry Fork, they learn the expected cavalry detachment has gone on to Apache Wells. Buck wants to turn back, but most of the party votes to proceed. The group is taken aback when Ringo invites Dallas to sit at the main table for lunch. As they are eating Hatfield reveals that he served in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] under the command of Mrs. Mallory's father in [[Virginia]].\n\nAt Apache Wells, Mrs. Mallory learns that her husband had been wounded in battle with the Apaches. When she faints and goes into labor, Doc Boone sobers up and delivers the baby with Dallas assisting. Later that night, Ringo asks Dallas to marry him and live on a ranch he owns in [[Mexico]].  Afraid to reveal her past, she does not answer immediately. The next morning, she accepts, but does not want to leave Mrs. Mallory and the new baby, so she tells Ringo to go on alone to his ranch, where she will meet him later. As Ringo is escaping, he sees [[smoke signal]]s heralding an Apache attack and returns to custody.\n\nThe stage reaches Lee's Ferry, which the Apaches have destroyed. Curley uncuffs Ringo to help lash logs to the stagecoach and float it across the river. Just when they think the danger has passed, Apaches attack. A long chase follows, where some of the party are injured fighting off their pursuers. Just as they run out of ammunition and Hatfield is getting ready to save Mrs. Mallory from capture by killing her with his last bullet, he himself is mortally wounded. The [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Cavalry]] rides to the rescue.\n\nAt Lordsburg Gatewood the banker is arrested by the local sheriff and Mrs. Mallory learns that her husband's wound is not serious. She thanks Dallas, who gives Mrs. Mallory her shawl. Dallas then begs Ringo not to confront the Plummers, but he is determined to settle matters. As they walk through town, he sees the brothel to which she is returning. Luke Plummer, who is playing poker in one of the saloons, hears of Ringo's arrival and gets his brothers to join him in a gunfight to kill Ringo.\n\nRingo survives the three-against-one shootout that follows, then surrenders to Curley, expecting to go back to prison. As Ringo boards a wagon, Curley invites Dallas to ride with them to the edge of town; but when she does so Curley and Doc stampede the horses, letting Ringo ride off with Dallas to his ranch across the border.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Claire Trevor]] as Dallas\n* [[John Wayne]] as Ringo Kid\n* [[Andy Devine]] as Buck\n* [[John Carradine]] as Hatfield\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as Doc Boone\n* [[Louise Platt]] as Lucy Mallory\n* [[George Bancroft (actor)|George Bancroft]] as Marshal Curley Wilcox\n* [[Donald Meek]] as Samuel Peacock\n* [[Berton Churchill]] as Henry Gatewood\n* [[Tim Holt]] as Lieutenant Blanchard\n* [[Tom Tyler]] as Luke Plummer\n\n'''Uncredited''':\n* [[Chief John Big Tree]] as Apache scout\n* [[Yakima Canutt]] as Cavalry scout\n* [[Nora Cecil]] as Boone's landlady\n* [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] as Sergeant Billy Pickett\n* [[Brenda Fowler]] as Mrs. Gatewood\n* [[William Hopper]] as Sergeant\n* [[Duke R.

The rights to \"Lordsburg\" were bought by John Ford soon after it was published in ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' magazine on April 10, 1937.<ref name=\"Haycox, Jr.\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ochcom.org/haycox| title=Ernest Haycox (1899\u20131950)| publisher=Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission| year=2001| author=Ernest Haycox Jr. | access-date=February 6, 2012}}</ref> According to Thomas Schatz, Ford claimed that his inspiration in expanding ''Stagecoach'' beyond the bare-bones plot given in \"The Stage to Lordsburg\" was his familiarity with another short story, \"[[Boule de Suif]]\" by [[Guy de Maupassant]],<ref name=\"SchatzBoule\">{{cite book| author=Thomas Schatz| title=''Stagecoach'' and Hollywood's A-Western Renaissance| url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/93315/sample/9780521793315ws.pdf| work=John Ford's Stagecoach edited by Barry Keigh Grant| publisher=Cambridge University Press| place=Cambridge| year=2003| pages=21\u201347| isbn=0-521-79331-9}}</ref> although Schatz believes \"this scarcely holds up to scrutiny\".<ref>Schatz, p. 27.</ref> Ford's statement also seems to be the basis for the claim that Haycox himself relied upon Guy de Maupassant's story. However, there appears to be no concrete evidence for Haycox actually being familiar with the earlier story, especially as he was documented as going out of his way to avoid reading the work of others that might unconsciously influence his writing, and he focused his personal reading in the area of history.<ref Name=\"Haycox, Jr.\"/>\n\nBefore production, Ford shopped the project around to several Hollywood studios, all of which turned him down because big budget Westerns were out of vogue, and because Ford insisted on using [[John Wayne]] in the key role in the film. Independent producer [[David O. Selznick]] finally agreed to produce it, but was frustrated by Ford's indecision about when shooting would begin, and had his own doubts over the casting. Ford withdrew the film from Selznick's company and approached independent producer [[Walter Wanger]] about the project. Wanger had the same reservations about producing an \"A\" western and even more about one starring John Wayne. Ford had not directed a western since the silent days.<ref name=Clooney194>{{cite book| author=Nick Clooney| title=The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen| date=November 2002| publisher=Atria Books| location=New York| isbn=0-7434-1043-2| page=[https://archive.org/details/moviesthatchange00cloo/page/194 194]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/moviesthatchange00cloo/page/194| author-link=Nick Clooney}}</ref> Wanger said he would not risk his money unless Ford replaced John Wayne with [[Gary Cooper]] and brought in [[Marlene Dietrich]] to play Dallas.<ref>Clooney, pp. 196\u2013197.</ref>\n\nFord refused to budge; it would be Wayne or no one. Eventually they compromised, with Wanger putting up $250,000, a little more than half of what Ford had been seeking, and Ford would give top billing to [[Claire Trevor]], <!-- film mainly shot in 1938. -->better known than John Wayne at the time.<ref>Clooney, p. 197.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Bert Glennon-John Ford in Stagecoach.jpg|thumb|right|Cinematographer Bert Glennon and director John Ford]]\nThe members of the production crew were billeted in [[Kayenta, Arizona|Kayenta]], in Northeastern [[Arizona]], in an old [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] camp.   Conditions were spartan, production hours long, and weather conditions at this 5700 foot elevation were extreme with constant strong winds and low temperatures.  Nonetheless,  director [[John Ford]] was satisfied with the crew's location work.  For this location, filming took place near [[Goulding's Trading Post]] on the Utah border, about 25 miles from Kayenta.<ref>Crew Letter from Kayenta, Arizona, December 1938, [http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/films/movie-stagecoach.html#kayentaletter Thenedscottarchive.com]</ref> Scenes were filmed in [[Monument Valley]] locations as well as the [[Movie ranch#Iverson Movie Ranch|Iverson Movie Ranch]] and the [[Movie ranch#RKO Encino Ranch|RKO Encino Movie Ranch]].<ref name=\"MoWFH\">{{cite web |title=John Wayne - Stagecoach |url=https://www.museumofwesternfilmhistory.org/142-resources/further-information-about-current-exhibits/6-john-wayne-stagecoach |website=museumofwesternfilmhistory.org |publisher=Museum of [[Western (genre)|Western]] film History |access-date=1 November 2020}}</ref> ''Stagecoach'' was the first of many Westerns that Ford shot using [[Monument Valley]] as a location, many of which also starred John Wayne.

Many independent companies were responsible for this film in the years since. The film's copyright (originally by Walter Wanger Productions) was renewed by [[20th Century Fox]], who produced a later [[Stagecoach (1966 film)|1966 remake of ''Stagecoach'']]. The rights to the original 1939 film were subsequently acquired by [[Time-Life Films]] during the 1970s. The copyright has since been reassigned to Wanger Productions through the late producer's family under the Caidin Trust/Caidin Film Company, the ancillary rights holder. However, distribution rights are now held by [[Shout! Factory]], which in 2014 acquired Jumer Productions/Westchester Films (which in turn had bought the Caidin Film holdings after the folding of former distributor [[Castle Hill Productions]]). [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] handles sales and additional distribution.\n\nThe original negative of ''Stagecoach'' was either lost or destroyed. Wayne had one positive print that had never been through a projector gate that director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] noticed in Wayne's garage while visiting. In 1970, Wayne allowed it to be used to produce a new negative and that is the film seen today at film festivals.<ref>Clooney, p. 191.</ref> UCLA fully restored the film in 1996 from surviving elements and premiered it on cable's [[American Movie Classics]] network. The previous DVD releases by [[Warner Home Video]] did not contain the restored print but rather a video print held in the Castle Hill/Caidin Trust library. A digitally restored Blu-ray/DVD version was released in May 2010 via [[The Criterion Collection]].\n\n== Lone Ranger radio play ==\nThe theme of the movie has been reproduced as a Lone Ranger radio episode \"The Last Coach West\", which played August 22, 1945.<ref name=\"detmich.com\">{{cite web|url=http://detmich.com/rhp/radio/The%20Lone%20Ranger%2045-08-22%20(1963)%20The%20Last%20Coach%20West.mp3 |format=MP3|title=Sound file|website=Detmich.com|access-date=July 17, 2022}}</ref> Most main characters in the movie had a counter-part in the radio play.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Character counter-parts\n|-\n!
