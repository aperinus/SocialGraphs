DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->\nIn [[New York City]], four men wearing similar disguises and carrying concealed weapons board the same downtown [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6 train]], Pelham 1-2-3, at different stations. Using the codenames Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown, they take 18 people, including the conductor and an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] police officer, hostage in the first car.\n\nCommunicating over the radio with [[New York City Transit Police]] lieutenant Zachary Garber, Blue demands a $1 million [[ransom]] to be delivered exactly within one hour or he will kill one hostage for every minute it is late. Green sneezes periodically, to which Garber always responds, \"[[Responses to sneezing|Gesundheit]]\". Garber, Lt. Patrone and others cooperate while speculating about the hijackers' escape plan. Garber surmises that one hijacker must be a former motorman since they were able to uncouple the head car and park it down the tunnel below [[28th Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|28th Street]].\n\nConversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue is a former [[British Army]] Colonel and was a [[mercenary]] in Africa; Green was a motorman caught in a drug bust; and Blue does not trust Grey, who was ousted from the mafia for being erratic. Just then, Grey shoots and kills a supervisor sent from [[Grand Central-42nd Street station|Grand Central]] as he approaches the stalled train.\n\nThe ransom is transported uptown in a speeding police car that crashes well before it reaches 28th Street. As the deadline is reached, Garber bluffs Blue by claiming that the money has reached the station entrance and just has to be walked down the tunnel to the train. Meanwhile a police motorcycle arrives with the ransom. As two patrolmen carry the money down the tunnel, one of many [[sniper#Law enforcement applications|police sniper]]s in the tunnel shoots at Brown, and the hijackers exchange gunfire with the police. In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.\n\nThe money is delivered and divided among the hijackers. Blue orders Garber to restore power to the subway line, set the signals to green all the way to [[South Ferry loops|South Ferry]], and clear the police from stations along the route. Before the process is complete, however, Green moves the train farther south. When Garber becomes alarmed, Blue explains that he wanted more distance from the police inside the tunnel.\n\nThe hijackers override the [[dead-man's switch]] so that the train will run without anyone at the controls. Garber joins Inspector Daniels above ground where the train stopped. The hijackers set the train in motion and get off. As the hijackers walk to the tunnel's [[emergency exit]], the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails. Unaware that the hijackers have left the train, Garber and Daniels drive south above the train's route. With no one at the controls, the train gains speed.\n\nThe hijackers collect their disguises and weapons for disposal, but Grey refuses to surrender his gun, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead. The undercover officer shoots and kills Brown and exchanges fire with Blue, while Green escapes through the emergency exit onto the street.\n\nGarber, contemplating the train's last suspicious movement, concludes that the hijackers bypassed the dead-man feature and are no longer on board. He returns to where the train had stopped, enters the same emergency exit from street level, and confronts Blue as he is about to kill the undercover officer. With no escape, Blue deliberately places his foot against the [[third rail]] and electrocutes himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Pelham 1-2-3 hurtles through the southbound tunnel. When it enters the South Ferry loop, its speed triggers the automatic safeties. It screeches to a halt, leaving the hostages bruised but safe.\n\nSince none of the three dead hijackers was a motorman, Garber surmises that the lone survivor must be. Working their way through a list of recently discharged motormen, Garber and Patrone knock on the door of Harold Longman (Green). After hastily hiding the loot, Longman lets them in, bluffs his way through their interrogation, and complains indignantly about being suspected. Garber vows to return with a search warrant. As Garber closes the apartment door behind him, Longman sneezes, and Garber reflexively says \"Gesundheit\", as he had over the radio. Garber re-opens the door and gives Longman a knowing, caustic stare.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Lieutenant Zack Garber\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Bernard Ryder / Mr. Blue\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Harold Longman / Mr. Green\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Giuseppe 'Joe Welcome' Benvenuto / Mr. Grey\n* [[Earl Hindman]] as George Steever / Mr. Brown\n* [[James Broderick]] as Denny Doyle, Train Motorman\n* [[Dick O'Neill]] as Frank Correll\n* [[Lee Wallace (actor)|Lee Wallace]] as Mayor Al\n* [[Tom Pedi]] as Caz Dolowicz\n* [[Beatrice Winde]] as Mrs. Jenkins\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Deputy Mayor Warren LaSalle\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Jessie, The Mayor's Wife\n* [[Jerry Stiller]] as Lieutenant Rico Patrone\n* [[Nathan George]] as Patrolman James\n* [[Rudy Bond]] as Police Commissioner Phil\n* [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Borough Commander Harry\n* [[Julius Harris]] as Deputy Inspector Daniels\n* William Snickowski as The Hippie, An Undercover Police Officer\n* Jerry Holland as Bud Carmody, Train Conductor\n* [[Thomas Barbour (actor)|Thomas Barbour]] as T.A.

The paperback rights sold for $450,000.<ref>''Variety'', Sept. 6, 1972 page 60</ref>\n\nGodey (Morton Freedgood) was a \"subway buff\".<ref>''The New York Times'', 28 Jan 1974. p 29.</ref> The novel and the film came out during the so-called \"Golden Age\" of [[skyjacking]] in the United States from 1968 through 1979. Additionally, New York City was edging toward a financial crisis; crime had risen citywide (as depicted in the contemporaneous film ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''); and the subway was perceived as neither safe nor reliable.\n\nAt first, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] refused to cooperate with the filmmakers. Godey's novel was more detailed about how the hijackers would accomplish their goal and recognized that the caper's success did not rely solely on defeating the \"deadman feature\" in the motorman's cab. Screenwriter Stone, however, made a fictional override mechanism the linchpin of the script. Director Sargent explained, \"We're making a movie, not a handbook on subway hijacking ... I must admit the seriousness of 'Pelham' never occurred to me until we got the initial TA reaction. They thought it potentially a stimulant\u2014not to hardened professional criminals like the ones in our movie, but to kooks. Cold professionals can see the absurdities of the plot right off, but kooks don't reason it out. That's why they're kooks. Yes, we gladly gave in about the 'deadman feature'. Any responsible filmmaker would if he stumbled onto something that could spread into a new form of madness.\"<ref name=\"haun\" />\n\nFor several years after the film was released, the New York City Transit Authority would not schedule any train to leave Pelham Bay Park station at 1:23. Although this policy was eventually rescinded, dispatchers have generally avoided scheduling a Pelham train at 1:23&nbsp;p.m. or a.m.<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Jim Dwyer (journalist)|first=Jim|last=Dwyer|title=Subway lives : 24 hours in the life of the New York City subway|url=https://archive.org/details/subwaylives24hou00dwye|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers, Inc.]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1991|isbn=978-0517584453|edition=1st|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nSargent said, \"It's important that we don't be too plausible. We're counting on the film's style and charm and comedy to say, subliminally at least, 'Don't take us too seriously.'\"<ref name=\"haun\" /> (The credits have a disclaimer that the Transit Authority did not give advice or information for use in the film.)\n\nAfter eight weeks of negotiations, and through the influence of Mayor [[John Lindsay]], the MTA relented, but required that the producers take out $20 million in insurance policies, including special \"kook coverage\" in case the movie inspired a real-life hijacking.<ref name=\"haun\" /> This was in addition to a $250,000 fee for use of the track, station, subway cars, and TA personnel.\n\nThe TA also insisted that no [[Graffiti in the United States|graffiti]] appear in the film. \"New Yorkers are going to hoot when they see our spotless subway cars\", Sargent said. \"But the TA was adamant on that score. They said to show graffiti would be to glorify it. We argued that it was artistically expressive. But we got nowhere. They said the graffiti fad would be dead by the time the movie got out. I really doubt that.\"<ref name=\"haun\" /> (Mayor Lindsay had first announced his intention to remove graffiti from subway trains in 1972, but the last graffiti-covered car was not removed from service until 1989.)\n\nOther changes included beefing up Matthau's role. In the novel, Garber is the equivalent of the Patrone character in the film. \"I like the piece\", Matthau said. \"It moves swiftly and stays interesting right down to the wire. That's the reason I wanted to do it. The TA inspector I play is really a supporting role\u2014they built it up a bit when I expressed interest in it\u2014but it's still secondary.\"<ref name=\"haun\" /> In the novel, Inspector Daniels confronts Mr. Blue in the tunnel during the climax. Additionally, screenwriter Peter Stone gave the hijackers their color code names, with hats whose colors matched their code names, and the Longman character his telltale cold.\n\nFilming began on November 23, 1973, and was completed in late April 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/54411?cxt=filmography |title=AFI&#124;Catalog |access-date=2018-08-17 |archive-date=2018-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817092354/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/54411?cxt=filmography |url-status=live }}</ref> The budget was $3.8 million.<ref name=\"haun\" />\n\n===Filming locations===\nProduction began with scenes inside the subway tunnel. These were filmed over the course of eight weeks on the local tracks of the [[IND Fulton Street Line]] at the abandoned [[Court Street (IND Fulton Street Line station)|Court Street]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Closed to the public in 1946, it became a filming location and later home to the [[New York Transit Museum]]. (Among other films, the Court Street station was used for ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', and the 2009 remake of ''Pelham''.)\n\nThe production company set up chess boards, card tables, and [[Table tennis|ping pong]] tables along the Court Street platform for cast and crew recreation between set-ups. Robert Shaw apparently beat all comers in ping pong.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251/trivia?ref_=ttgf_sa_1 |title=The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) - Trivia - IMDb |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=2018-08-22 |archive-date=2021-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427184301/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251/trivia?ref_=ttgf_sa_1 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlthough this was an abandoned spur of track, passing [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]], [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], and [[G (New York City Subway service)|GG]] trains rumbled through adjacent tracks on their regular schedules. Dialogue that was marred by the noise was later post-dubbed. The third rail, which carries 600 volts of direct current, was shut off, and three protective bars were placed against the rail, but the cast and crew were told to treat it as if it were still live. \"Those TA people ... are super careful\", Sargent said. \"They anticipate everything. By the fifth week we were dancing our way through those tunnels like nobody's business. They were expecting that, too. That's when they told us of the fatalities in the tunnels. They're mostly old-timers. The young guys still have a healthy fear of the place.\"<ref name=\"haun\" />\n\n\"There was one scene where Robert Shaw was to step on the third rail\", Sargent recalled. \"When we were rehearsing the scene, Shaw accidentally stubbed his toe and the sparks from his special-effects boot flew everywhere. He turned white as a sheet. We had eight weeks of that. I think we got out just in time. It was like coal mining.\"<ref name=\"haun\" />\n\nAccording to a notation on IMDb{{Better source needed|date=November 2022}}, the crew wore surgical masks during the tunnel scenes.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Shaw's biographer, John French, reported: \"There were rats everywhere and every time someone jumped from the train, or tripped over the lines, clouds of black dust rose into the air, making it impossible to shoot until it had settled.\"<ref>French, John. ''Robert Shaw: The Price of Success''. Dean Street Press.</ref>\n\nMatthau, who had one scene in the tunnel, said, \"There are bacteria down there that haven't been discovered yet. And bugs. Big ugly bugs from the planet Uranus. They all settled in the New York subway tunnels. I saw one bug mug a guy. I wasn't down there a long time\u2014but long enough to develop the strangest cold I ever had. It stayed in my nose for five days, then went to my throat. Finally I woke up one morning with no voice at all, and they had to shut down for the day.\"<ref name=\"haun\" />\n\nAccording to ''Backstage'', the filmmakers were the first to utilize a \"flash\" process developed by Movielab to bring out detail when shooting with low light in the tunnel. The process reportedly increased film speed by two stops. It allowed the filmmakers to use fewer lights and generators and cut five days out of the schedule.<ref>''Backstage'', March 1, 1974</ref>\n\nAt least two different [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22]] trains portrayed Pelham 1-2-3. As it enters 28th Street station, the head car is labeled 7339. However, in an early scene at Grand Central, 7339 is seen on the express track across the platform. Later, after being cut from the rest of the train, the head car is labeled 7434.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251/goofs?ref_=tttrv_sa_1 |title=The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) - Goofs - IMDb |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=2018-08-22 |archive-date=2021-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427184258/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251/goofs?ref_=tttrv_sa_1 |url-status=live }}</ref> R22 cars first went into service in April 1957, and the vast majority of the 450 cars were scrapped in 1987.\n\nAfter two months in the tunnel, production moved to [[Filmways]] Studios at 246 East 127th Street in [[East Harlem]], where a replica of the Transit Authority's Brooklyn control center was constructed. Built around 1920 as [[Cosmopolitan Productions|Cosmopolitan Studios]], the facility was leased in 1928 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for sound production and purchased by Filmways in 1959. Among later films shot there were ''Butterfield 8'', ''The Godfather'', ''The Wiz'', and ''Manhattan''. The building was demolished in the 1980s.\n\nThe exterior street scenes above the hijacked subway train were filmed at the subway entrance at 28th and Park Avenue South in Manhattan. The mayor's residence, [[Gracie Mansion]], was used for exteriors. [[Wave Hill]], a nineteenth-century mansion overlooking the Hudson in [[Riverdale, Bronx]], was used for the interior scenes set in Gracie Mansion.<ref>''Daily News'', \"Will The Real Movie Mayor Stand Up?\", February 21, 1974.</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[Jerry Fielding]] and [[Don Ellis]] sounding score, composed and conducted by [[David Shire]], \"layers explosive horn arrangements and serpentine keyboard riffs over a rhythm section that pits hard-grooving basslines against constantly shifting but always insistent layers of percussion\".<ref name=allmusic123/> Shire used the 12-tone composition method to create unusual, somewhat dissonant melodic elements.<ref name=FSM123>{{cite web |title=The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/CDID/33/Taking-of-Pelham-One-Two-Three-The/ |work=[[Film Score Monthly]] |year=2013 |access-date=June 10, 2013 |archive-date=June 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623030650/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm/CDID/33/Taking-of-Pelham-One-Two-Three-The |url-status=live }}</ref> The soundtrack album was the first CD release by ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' and was later released by Retrograde Records.<ref name=FSM123/> The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme, courtesy of Shire's wife at the time, [[Talia Shire]], who suggested that he end the score with a more traditional ode to New York.<ref>Adams, Doug. CD liner notes</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' was released on October 2, 1974.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film was well received by critics. ''Variety'' called it \"a good action caper\" but \"the major liability is Peter Stone's screenplay, which develops little interest in either Matthau or Shaw's gang, nor the innocent hostages\" which are \"simply stereotyped baggage\". While the trade paper complained that the Mayor was \"played for silly laughs\", it called Shaw \"superb in another versatile characterization\".<ref>Variety, Oct. 2, 1974, p. 22</ref>\n\n''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' thought that \"some of the excitement has been lost\" translating the novel to the screen, but \"there is entertainment value in Peter Stone's screenplay\".<ref>\"Feature Reviews: The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\". ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]''. October 7, 1974.</ref>\n\n[[Nora Sayre]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought it captured the mood of New York and New Yorkers. \"Throughout there's a skillful balance between the vulnerability of New Yorkers and the drastic, provocative sense of comedy that thrives all over our sidewalks. And the hijacking seems like a perfectly probable event for this town. (Perhaps the only element of fantasy is the implication that the city's departments could function so smoothly together). Meanwhile, the movie adds up to a fine piece of reporting\u2014and it's the only action picture I've seen this year that has a rousing plot.\"<ref>Sayre, Nora (October 3, 1974). \"'Pelham One Two Three,' Starring Matthau, Catches the City's Mood\". ''The New York Times'', Oct. 3, 1974, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe film was one of several released that year that gave New York a bad image, including [[Law and Disorder (1974 film)|''Law and Disorder'']], [[Death Wish (1974 film)|''Death Wish'']], ''[[Serpico]]'', and ''[[The Super Cops]]''. [[Vincent Canby]], another ''New York Times'' critic, wrote, \"New York is a mess, say these films. It's run by fools. Its citizens are at the mercy of its criminals who, as often as not, are protected by an unholy alliance of civil libertarians and crooked cops. The air is foul. The traffic impossible. Services are diminishing and the morale is such that ordering a cup of coffee in a diner can turn into a request for a fat lip.\" But ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'', \"compared to the general run of New York City films, is practically a tonic, a good-humored, often witty suspense melodrama in which the representatives of law and decency triumph without bending the rules.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (November 10, 1974). \"New York's Woes Are Good Box Office\". ''The New York Times'', Section 2, p. 1.</ref>\n\n''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it \"fast, funny and fairly terrifying\", and \"a nerve-racking ride\", and appreciated the \"wry humor\" of Stone's script. It tapped into a darker reality: \"A short time ago subways were safe; today some of them are full of the dark rage of asylums. And who really is to say a Pelham-type incident is out of the question?\"<ref>''The Boston Globe'', Oct. 17, 1974, p. 61</ref>\n\n[[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"coarse-textured and effective, a cartoon-vivid melodrama and not, it's nice to know, a case study of psychopathic behavior. 'Pelham' is in fact the best to date of the new multiple-jeopardy capers, fresh, lively and suspenseful... . There are some marvelously managed scenes in the subway tunnels and on teeming platforms and at the barricaded street-level entrances. The subway nerve center is fascinating, and indeed one of the pleasures of the film is its glimpse of how things work... . The violence is handled with restraint; the dangers are mixed with raucous humor and what stays clear is that the aim is swift entertainment.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (October 23, 1974). \"Taking A-Train\u2014for Keeps\".
