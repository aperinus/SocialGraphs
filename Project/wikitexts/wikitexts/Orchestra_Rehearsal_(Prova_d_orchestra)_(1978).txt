Speaking candidly and often cynically about their craft, interviewees are seen routinely interrupting one another as their artistic claims are contested or derided by orchestral peers, each self-importantly regarding his own instrument as the most vital to group performance, the most solitary in nature or spiritual in relation \u2014 these varied opinions reflecting each listener's intensely personal experience with music, one of the recurring themes of the film.\n\nThe [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] arrives (speaking Italian but with an affected [[German language|German]] accent), proving theatrically critical of the ensuing performance quality and equally quarrelsome with trade union representatives on site, wearing down the orchestra members as he commands them to play with exceedingly particular nuances bordering on absurd abstraction, leading several musicians to strip away clothing under the strain of this taxing effort.\n\nProtesting the conductor's authoritarian abuses, the union reps intervene, spitefully announcing that all musicians will be taking a 20-minute double break. While one camera follows the players to a local tavern to further catalog their ideological musings, in a backstage interview the defeated conductor expresses his frustrations regarding the impossible contradictions of his leadership role, opining on the subjective power of music just as a [[power outage]] in the building prompts his return to the auditorium hall.\n\nThere he discovers the darkened auditorium space has been thoroughly defaced with spray-painted revolutionary slogans and rubbish being flung about by the musicians who chant a discordant chorus of protest against their oppressive taskmaster and then against music itself (\"The music in power, not the power of music!\"). This increasingly [[Anarchy|anarchistic]] bacchanal culminates in a violent crescendo of gunshots and in-fighting, until finally an impossibly large wrecking ball \u2014 its presence going unexplained \u2014 smashes with God-like wrath through a wall of the building (at the altar of this former church), causing the death of the [[harp]]ist beneath an avalanche of rubble.\n \nAs the silenced fellow musicians reflect on this tragedy in a cloud of settling dust, the conductor steps in to eulogize with a motivational speech declaring that music requires them to play through the pain of life, to find strength, identity and guidance in the fated notes of its composition. Amid the ruins, the newly inspired musicians accommodatingly take to their instruments to deliver a tour de force redemptive performance. At its conclusion, however, the conductor's former words of fleeting praise once again sour to perfectionist dissatisfaction, resuming his comically agitated critique at the dais as the picture [[Fade (filmmaking)|fades to black]], to the swelling accompaniment of a classical opus. As the credit roll commences, the conductor's continued Italian dialogue berating the orchestra is heard to slip into [[dictator]]ial German barking, suggesting a sharper political [[allegory]] at play in the movie's message all along.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Balduin Baas]] - Conductor\n*[[Clara Colosimo]] - Harp player\n*Elizabeth Labi - Piano player\n*Ronaldo Bonacchi - Bassoon player\n*Ferdinando Villella] - Cello player\n*Franco Iavarone - Bass tuba player (as Giovanni Javarone)\n*David Maunsell - First violin\n*[[Francesco Aluigi]] - Second violin\n*[[Andy Miller (actor)|Andy Miller]] - Oboe player\n*[[Sibilla (singer)|Sibyl Amarilli Mostert]] - Flute player\n*[[Franco Mazzieri]] - Trumpet player\n*[[Daniele Pagani]] - Trombone player\n*[[Luigi Uzzo]] - Violin player\n*[[Cesare Martignon]] - Clarinet player\n*[[Umberto Zuanelli]] - Copyist\n*[[Filippo Trincaia]] - Head of orchestra\n*[[Claudio Ciocca]] - Union man\n*[[Angelica Hansen]] - Violin player\n*[[Heinz Kreuger]] - Violin player\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe film was adapted into an opera by [[Giorgio Battistelli]], premiered in 1995 at the [[Opera du Rhin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ionarts.blogspot.com/2006/06/battistelli-prova-dorchestra.html|title=Battistelli, \"Prova d'Orchestra\"|access-date=Nov 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giorgiobattistelli.it/en/opere/teatro-musicale/prova-dorchestra/|title=Prova d'orchestra &#124; Giorgio Battistelli|access-date=Nov 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0079759}}\n*{{Allmovie title|128010}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|orchestra_rehearsal}}\n\n{{Federico Fellini}}\n\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:Films about classical music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Federico Fellini]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Nino Rota]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Michael Fengler]]\n[[Category:Italian political satire films]]\n[[Category:Italian satirical films]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Federico Fellini]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into operas]]\n[[Category:1970s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
