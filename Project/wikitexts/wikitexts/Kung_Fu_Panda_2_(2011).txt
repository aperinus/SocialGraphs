The film is the sequel to ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]'' (2008) and the second installment in the [[Kung Fu Panda|''Kung Fu Panda'' franchise]]. Directed by [[Jennifer Yuh Nelson]] (in her feature [[directorial debut]]), the film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[David Cross]], [[James Hong]], and [[Jackie Chan]] reprising their character roles from the first film, with [[Gary Oldman]], [[Michelle Yeoh]], [[Danny McBride]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], and [[Victor Garber]] voicing new characters. In the film, [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]] and his allies (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis) travel to Gongmen City to stop the evil peacock Lord Shen from conquering China, while also rediscovering Po's forgotten past.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 26, 2011, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], and [[Digital 3D]], and received very positive reviews from critics. It grossed $665 million worldwide against its $150 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film directed by a female director until ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013), as well as the highest-grossing film solely directed by a female director until ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017). It is also [[2011 in film|the sixth highest-grossing film of 2011]]. The film was the highest-grossing animated feature film of the year and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[84th Academy Awards|84th]] [[Academy Awards]], losing to ''[[Rango (2011 film)|Rango]]''. Nelson became the first woman to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature since [[Marjane Satrapi]] for ''[[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]'' (2007). A sequel, ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'', was released in January 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. Currently 695. -->\nThe peacock rulers of Gongmen City invented fireworks for peaceful purposes, but their son, Lord Shen, put the fireworks' [[gunpowder]] to evil use. Overhearing a prophecy that a \"warrior of black and white\" would defeat him if he continued, Shen destroyed the local [[giant panda]] population. Horrified by the genocide, Shen's parents banished him, but Shen swore revenge. Many years later, Shen and his wolf army raid villages for scrap metal, hoping to build cannons which Shen can use to conquer all of China.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]] is enjoying his new role as a Kung Fu Master alongside the Furious Five, though Master Shifu warns him he has not yet achieved [[inner peace]]. When the leader of the wolf army raids another village, Po and the Five intercept him; however, a symbol on his armor gives Po a [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of his mother. Po questions his father Mr. Ping, and the goose reveals that he found Po as an infant in a shipment of [[Daikon radish|radish]]es outside his restaurant. When no one came forward to claim the cub, Mr. Ping adopted Po as his son. Po and the Five are dispatched across the sea to Gongmen City next, after learning Shen used a cannon to kill a [[regent]] of the city, Master Thundering Rhino. Shen imprisons the other regents, Masters Ox and Croc, and takes over the city. Shen enters Gongmen Palace, where the city's goat [[fortune-telling|soothsayer]] continually reminds him of the prophecy.\n\nUpon arrival at Gongmen City, Po and the Five free Masters Ox and Croc, but the duo refuses to help, believing Kung Fu died with Master Rhino. Po and the Five feign surrender to Shen, with Master Mantis freeing the others from bondage. They destroy one of the cannons, but Po sees the same familiar symbol on Shen's [[plumage]], which distracts him long enough for Shen to escape and destroy Gongmen Palace with his cannonade.\n\nOnce they are safe, Tigress demands answers, and Po reveals he has remembered Shen was there the day he last saw his biological parents. Tigress sympathizes, but fears Po's lack of focus will get him killed. The Five leave Po and proceed to Shen's cannon factory with the intent to blow it up. However, Po follows and confronts Shen, inadvertently spoiling the plan and allowing the Five to be captured. Shen lies and says Po's parents hated him, and shoots him with a cannon. Badly wounded but alive, Po floats downriver and is rescued by the soothsayer. She tells him about the panda genocide, and encourages him to embrace his past. Po, finally achieving inner peace, is able to recall that his father went down fighting, while his mother hid him in a radish crate and drew off Shen's army so he could survive.\n\nRejuvenated, Po returns to Gongmen City, where Shen is sailing downriver with his cannons and army. Po frees the Five, and with the help of Masters Ox, Croc, and Shifu, they are able to wreck the foremost ships and prevent Shen's forces from reaching the harbor. Lord Shen fires a cannon, killing some of his own soldiers, to clear the way. Po stands alone against Shen, using his newfound inner peace skills to deflect all the cannonballs shot at him back at Shen's fleet, destroying it. Po offers mercy to Shen, but he rejects it and attacks Po with a [[spear]]. Shen accidentally severs the lines holding up one of the cannons, and it falls onto the ship, killing him. The Five embrace Po, and Shifu congratulates Po for achieving inner peace. A firework show celebrating Shen's defeat proceeds, before Po, Shifu and the Five return to the Valley. Po tearfully reunites with Mr. Ping, and calls him his father again. Meanwhile, at a secret panda village in the mountains, Po's biological father Li Shan is revealed to still be living, and senses his son is still alive.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]''.}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Kung Fu Panda characters}}\n* [[Jack Black]] as [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Master Po]]\n** [[Liam Knight]] as [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Baby Po]]\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Master Tigress\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Lord Shen\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Soothsayer\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Master Mantis\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as Master Viper\n* [[David Cross]] as Master Crane\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Master Monkey\n* [[James Hong]] as Mr. Ping\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Master Shifu\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Master Storming Ox\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Master Croc\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Master Thundering Rhino\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Wolf Boss\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as Li Shan\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Market Sheep\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Boar\n\n==Production==\nAfter the original ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]'' was released in June 2008, [[DreamWorks Animation]] planned a second film with the subtitle ''Pandamoneum'',<ref name=\"title\">{{cite journal|author=Fiona |url=https://www.filmofilia.com/2008/10/01/kung-fu-panda-sequel-pandamonium-in-3d/ |title=\"Kung Fu Panda\" Sequel \"Pandamonium\" In 3D |journal=FilmoFilia |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> which was changed by 2010 to ''The Kaboom of Doom''<ref name=\"title2\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.budomate.com/kung-fu-panda-2-the-kaboom-of-doom/ |title=Kung Fu Panda 2: The Kaboom of Doom |journal=Budomate |date=September 11, 2010 }}</ref> before simply being retitled to ''Kung Fu Panda 2''.
