Unlike the first film, this film is not based on any of the books.\n\nMost of the cast returned from the first film, including [[Julie Andrews]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Heather Matarazzo]], and [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]]. [[Garry Marshall]] returned to direct and [[Debra Martin Chase]] and [[Whitney Houston]] to produce. New characters include Viscount Mabrey ([[John Rhys-Davies]]), Lord Nicholas Devereaux ([[Chris Pine]], his film debut), and Andrew Jacoby ([[Callum Blue]]).\n\nDespite not being critically successful, the film had a worldwide box office of $134.7 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/person/18810401-Spencer-Breslin#tab=acting|title=Spencer Breslin - Box Office|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]}}</ref> and received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nFive years after [[The Princess Diaries (film)|the first film]], Mia Thermopolis graduates from [[Princeton School of Public and International Affairs|Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]], returning to Genovia. There, she awaits her grandmother, Queen Clarisse's, [[abdication]]. Dancing with all eligible bachelors at her 21st birthday party to find a husband, she meets a dashing young gentleman named Nicholas, and the two become mutually attracted. During the evening, Mia's tiara falls off, caught by Member of Parliament (MP), Viscount Mabrey, who secretly plans to steal the crown.\n\nDuring the Parliamentary session the next morning, Mia hears Mabrey revealing his nephew, Lord Devereaux, to be the next male heir to the throne. By law, Mia can only be Queen if she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, and Mia is shocked to discover he is Nicholas. Her best friend, Lilly Moscovitz, surprises her with a visit. Together, they look through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth, and days later, they are engaged. Mabrey plans to have Nicholas seduce Mia so the engagement will fail. Joe tries to persuade Clarisse to publicly pursue their feelings for each other as her reign as queen is coming to an end.\n\nMia has to ride sidesaddle for a ceremony but is inexperienced, so Queen Clarisse provides an [[ancestral]] wooden leg decoy so it seems she's doing so. When Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a rubber snake, Joe inadvertently tears off the wooden leg. Humiliated, she flees to the stables, where Nicholas fails to comfort her. At a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about her relationship with Andrew. As they argue, he kisses her. At first, she kisses him back but then backs away. Pursuing her, they fall into a fountain. Queen Clarisse tells Mia that her behavior with Nicholas has to stop.\n\nAt the Genovian Independence Day parade, seeing some boys harassing a little girl, Mia abruptly halts the parade to help. Learning the girl, Carolina, and the others are orphans, she has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with them in the parade. Everyone is impressed, while Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver. Nicholas is also struck by Mia's care for Genovia and begins doubting taking over the throne. Mia later declares the conversion of a royal palace into a temporary children's center.\n\nAt Mia's bachelorette slumber party, princesses attend from around the world. They mattress surf and sing karaoke. Meanwhile, Nicholas tries to stop his uncle from pursuing the throne as Mia is doing well as a ruler. Mabrey realizes Nicholas has fallen for her, but believes Mia will never love him. Mabrey encourages him to pursue her, later revealing to his surly and mistreated housekeeper Gretchen he plans to let this ruin Mia's chances of becoming queen. Manipulating Nicholas, he makes him believe it was his late father's wish for him to become king. Nicholas helps Mia succeed at hitting the target as she is practicing for her [[coronation]] rites. He tells her he is leaving, but asks to see her once more before he goes. She declines, as she is under close guard.\n\nThat night, Nicholas convinces Mia outside her window, to sneak out. By a lake, they share secrets, dance, and eventually fall asleep. They awaken to find a man filming them. Mia thinks Nicholas set her up, while he insists he had no idea. The scandalous footage is already being broadcast before she returns. Disappointed, Andrew kisses Mia to see if there is a romantic spark between them. There isn't, but they do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia. The wedding is the following day, and Mia's mother, Helen, comes with her new husband Patrick O'Connell and their newborn son named Trevor. Nicholas decides against attending, until Gretchen tells him Mabrey engineered the televised scandal.\n\nBefore the wedding, Joe tells Mia that Nicholas is innocent. Walking down the aisle, she suddenly stops and runs out of the church. Queen Clarisse follows and Mia says she doesn't want to be forced to marry. Clarisse encourages her to follow her heart, something she never did, costing her Joe, the love of her life. Returning into the church, Mia points out to everyone that her unmarried grandmother has ruled Genovia for many years, asking the members of parliament to reconsider the law, asking them if they would force the significant women in their lives to marry without love. Mabrey again suggests his nephew be named King instead, but Nicholas appears, refusing the crown. Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be abolished, and the Parliament unanimously assents. Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly married.\n\nA week later, Mia is preparing for her [[coronation]] when Nicholas arrives. Professing his love on bended knee, they kiss. The next day, Queen Clarisse steps down, and Mia is crowned \"Her Majesty Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi, ''Queen'' of Genovia\", with all in attendance in the palace.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] shows the Genovian Parliament now allows female members, one of whom is Charlotte (Clarisse's [[lady-in-waiting]]). In a final scene, Queen Mia officially opens a new children's home with Carolina.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anne Hathaway]] as [[The Princess Diaries#Mia Thermopolis|Mia Thermopolis]]\n*[[Julie Andrews]] as Queen Clarisse Renaldi\n*[[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Joe\n*[[John Rhys-Davies]] as Viscount Mabrey\n*[[Heather Matarazzo]] as Lilly Moscovitz\n*[[Chris Pine]] as Nicholas Deveraux\n*[[Callum Blue]] as Andrew Jacoby\n*[[Caroline Goodall]] as Helen Thermopolis O'Connell\n*[[Meredith Patterson]] as Lady Elissa\n*Kathleen Marshall as Charlotte Kutaway\n*Joel McCrary as Prime Minister Motaz\n*[[Kim Thomson]] as Elsie Kentworthy\n*[[Tom Poston]] as Lord Palimore \n*[[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Princess Asana\n*[[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Paolo Puttanesca\n*[[Matthew Walker (American actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Captain Kip Kelly\n*[[Shea Curry]] as Brigitte\n*Anna A.
