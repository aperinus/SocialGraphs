The film [[Gross (economics)|grossed]] $26.2 million in the [[United States]]. A [[DVD]] release of the film was issued in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nMax Fiedler ([[Chevy Chase]]) is an air traffic controller at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy International Airport]] whose life is slowly going down the drain.  His girlfriend, Darcy, has just left him because of his jealousy and negativity. Now, everywhere he goes he seems to run into her with Barry, her narcissistic friend who wants her to be his girlfriend, which drives Max crazy. One night while driving home from a party that turned out to be held at a [[Gay bar|gay nightclub]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], a tanker truck spills nuclear waste onto Max's car. Some of it splashes onto him through his open sunroof, temporarily making him glow green before absorbing into his skin. The next day, he notices he has developed telekinesis. Max decides to use his new power to ruin Barry's attempts to woo Darcy. With newfound optimism & confidence, he slowly begins to win back Darcy's love.\n\nThings come to a head, however, when Max is asked to spend the weekend at the summer [[beach house]] of Brian ([[Brian Doyle-Murray]]), a paraplegic friend and publisher, who is now living with Max's ex-wife Lorraine. Brian has also invited self-confidence author and womanizer Mark Winslow ([[Dabney Coleman]]), who immediately has designs on Darcy. Winslow constantly demeans and derides Max, while trying to seduce Darcy (although his egomaniacal bragging and unabashed nudity alienates her). Between no one believing his claims that he can move objects and Winslow's onslaught of insults, Max grows increasingly depressed until he cracks, proving his telekinetic power to all present at dinner by humiliating Winslow. Finally, despairing that he is a monster, Max climbs onto the roof of Brian's house during an approaching thunderstorm. Max is fortuitously struck by lightning, causing the transference of his powers to Dorita ([[Nell Carter]]), the voodoo-practicing maid. Now understanding his odd behavior, Darcy forgives Max and he is finally convinced that she truly loves him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Max Fiedler\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Darcy Carson\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Lorraine\n* [[Nell Carter]] as Dorita\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Brian Stills\n* Mitch Kreindel as Barry\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Mark Winslow\n* Tom Sherohman as Waiter\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Shamberg]] and [[Doug Kenney]] had a deal with [[Ken Shapiro]] to make a film\u2014Kenney had a title, ''Teenage Communists from Outerspace'' and Shapiro wanted to make a film about telekinesis.

The members of that audience, whose inner clocks are set by their television habits, don't worry much about consistency or point of view. And, having short attention spans, they immediately forget the long dull patches that separate the truly funny sequences.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/28/movies/chevy-chase-traffic-controller.html \"CHEVY CHASE, TRAFFIC CONTROLLER\"]: [Review] Canby, Vincent.
