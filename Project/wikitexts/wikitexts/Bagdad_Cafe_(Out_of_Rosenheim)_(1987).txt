It runs 95 minutes in the U.S. and 108 minutes in the German version.\n\n==Plot==\nGerman tourists Jasmin M\u00fcnchgstettner (S\u00e4gebrecht) from [[Rosenheim]] and her husband fight while driving across the desert. She storms out of the car and makes her way to the isolated truck stop, which is run by the tough-as-nails and short-tempered Brenda (Pounder), whose own husband, after an argument out front, is soon to leave as well. Jasmin takes a room at the adjacent motel. Initially suspicious of the foreigner, Brenda eventually befriends Jasmin and allows her to work at the cafe.\n\nThe cafe is visited by an assortment of colorful characters, including a strange ex-Hollywood set-painter (Palance) and a glamorous tattoo artist (Kaufmann). Brenda's son (Darron Flagg) plays [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] preludes on the piano. With an ability to quietly empathize with everyone she meets at the cafe, helped by a passion for cleaning and performing magic tricks, Jasmin gradually transforms the cafe and all the people in it.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Marianne S\u00e4gebrecht]] as Jasmin M\u00fcnchgstettner\n*[[CCH Pounder]] as Brenda\n*[[Jack Palance]] as Rudi Cox\n*[[Christine Kaufmann]] as Debby\n*[[Monica Calhoun]] as Phyllis\n*Darron Flagg as Salomo\n*[[George Aguilar]] as Cahuenga\n*G.

I am not sure exactly what it is, but that is comforting; if a director could assemble these strange characters and then know for sure what they were doing in the same movie together, he would be too confident to find the humor in their situation. The charm of \"Bagdad Cafe\" is that every character and every moment is unanticipated, obscurely motivated, of uncertain meaning and vibrating with life\".<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>\nThe film was successful at the European box office, and was one of the most financially successful foreign-language productions in the U.S. at that time, grossing $3.59 million.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bagdadcafe.htm Bagdad Cafe] ''[[Box Office Mojo]]''.
