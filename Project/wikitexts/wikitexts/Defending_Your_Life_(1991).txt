Written, directed, and starring [[Albert Brooks]], the film also stars [[Meryl Streep]], [[Rip Torn]], [[Lee Grant]], and [[Buck Henry]]. Despite comedic overtones, the film also contains elements of drama and [[allegory]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Los Angeles]] [[advertising]] executive Daniel Miller dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday, largely due to his distractedness, and is sent to Judgment City, a kind of a temporary paradise for the recently deceased. The city is a [[purgatory]]-like waiting area staffed by all-knowing and efficient but largely condescending bureaucracy who, having themselves moved on to their current new universal phase, mostly seem to gingerly look down on the new arrivals who will have their lives (or most recent lives) on Earth judged over a week-long or so hearing, each before two judges. Amenities and activities are provided, from delicious, calorie-free all-you-can-eat buffets to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/features/welcome-to-judgment-city-a-look-back-at-defending-your-life|title = Welcome to Judgment City: A Look Back at Defending Your Life &#124; Features &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\nDaniel's defense attorney, Bob Diamond, explains that people from Earth [[ten percent of the brain myth|use so little of their brains]] that they spend most of their lives functioning based on their fears. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.\n\nAt Daniel's tribunal, presided over by two judges, Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase, but his formidable opponent, prosecutor Lena Foster, takes the opposing argument. Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in Daniel's life to make their case to the judges.\n\nDuring the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia, a recently deceased woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his, which also explains why her fancy hotel lodgings are so much nicer than his spartan motel-like room.\n\nFollowing each day's proceedings, Daniel and Julia spend time exploring Judgement City, including the Pavilion of Past Lives (hosted by a version of [[Shirley MacLaine]], famous for her outspoken belief in reincarnation), where people can see all their past lives, often quite shockingly dichotomous.\n\nIn the meantime, things do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel never managed to overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps, while Diamond vigorously attempts to portray Daniel's actions more positively, sometimes praising his client's \"restraint\" and \"thoughtfulness\".\n\nBefore the last day of Daniel's hearing, Julia asks Daniel to spend the night with her, but despite his strong feelings for her, he declines. The next day, Foster plays footage of Daniel's previous night with Julia, over Diamond's objections. Foster argues this clearly underscores Daniel's fear and lack of courage. The next day, it is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth, while Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye, Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right, but Daniel remains disappointed.\n\nDaniel boards a tram poised to return to Earth when Julia yells to him from a different tram. He manages to desperately unstrap himself, claw open a door, and leap, dodging other trams, and suffering minor electric shocks to get to Julia's tram. She is unable to open the door and he is unable to enter her tram. He clings to the outside of the moving vehicle, banging on the door and trying to pry it open. She yells in vain for the driver to stop. They tell each other they love each other. The scene pulls back to show that the entire event is being watched by closed circuit TV by Diamond, Foster, and the judges in the chamber where Daniel's hearing took place. Diamond remarks to Foster, \"Brave enough for you?\", who gives him a slight smiling acknowledgement. One judge whispers to the other, who then sends a message ordering the tram doors opened. Daniel and Julia are reunited, applauded by the other passengers, and embrace as they are allowed to move on to the next phase of existence together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Daniel Miller\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Julia\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Bob Diamond\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Lena Foster\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Dick Stanley, Daniel's substitute attorney\n* [[George D.

But Brooks has always been more of a muser than a ''[[List of English words of Yiddish origin#List of words|tummler]]'', and perhaps more [[Bipolar disorder|depressive than he is manic]]. He asks us to banish the [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha beat]] of conventional comedy from mind and bend to a slower rhythm. His pace is not that of a comic standing up at a microphone barking one-liners, but of an intelligent man sitting down by the fire mulling things over. And in this case offering us a large slice of angel food for thought.</blockquote>\n\nBob Mondello, on NPR, said, \"The result is not just his most mature comedy yet, but the best American comedy in years.\" J.Hoberman, in ''The Village Voice,'' called it \"Pure pleasure. Funny, deft, impressive comedy.\"\n\nThe film was not a box office success, grossing about $16 million in the United States.
