It is about a [[William Castle]]-type independent filmmaker, with the American home front during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] as a backdrop. The film stars [[John Goodman]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Simon Fenton]], [[Omri Katz]], [[Lisa Jakub]], [[Robert Picardo]], [[Kellie Martin]], and [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] (in his final theatrical film role). It was written by Jerico Stone<ref name=\"LAT19980712\">{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Jerico|title=Same Old, Same Old|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/12/entertainment/ca-2867|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=19 May 2017|date=12 July 1998}}</ref> and [[Charles S. Haas]], the latter portraying Mr. Elroy, a schoolteacher.\n\n==Plot==\nIn October 1962, in Key West, Florida, Gene Loomis and his younger brother, Dennis, live on a military base with their mother Anne while their father is away on a United States Navy submarine. At a local movie theater one afternoon, Gene and Dennis see a promo for an exclusive engagement of producer Lawrence Woolsey's sensational new horror film, entitled ''Mant!'' Woolsey is scheduled to appear in-person at the theater the following Saturday. After the boys return home to the base, the Loomis family watches [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] deliver a [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Speech to the nation|speech]] confirming the presence of [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Soviet missiles in Cuba]]. Meanwhile, arriving in Florida with his actress girlfriend, Ruth Corday, Woolsey finds the fearful atmosphere created by the ongoing crisis as being perfect for hosting ''Mant!''{{'}}s premiere.\n\nWoolsey has brought along two of his actors, Herb Denning, a former hired thug, and Bob, a victim of the [[Hollywood blacklist]] now relegated to cheap, independent [[B movie]]s  They pose as outraged citizens protesting ''Mant!''{{'}}s theatrical exhibition. However, local couple Jack and Rhonda strongly argue for allowing the premiere based son [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. Later, at home, while reading an issue of ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'', Gene recognizes Herb as having starred in an earlier Woolsey film, ''The Brain Leeches''.\n\nAt school, Gene gradually befriends one of his classmates, Stan. He also becomes infatuated with Jack and Rhonda's daughter Sandra after she gets a week of detention for protesting against the uselessness of a \"[[duck and cover]]\" air raid drill. She tells the other students that it would be preferable to die from the immediate effects of an atom bomb instead of [[acute radiation syndrome]] caused by fallout. Stan has a crush on another girl at school, Sherry. However violent juvenile delinquent (and would-be poet) Harvey Starkweather, her ex-boyfriend, threatens Stan, so he lies to her out of fear, calling off their first date.\n\nWoolsey continues to devote himself to promoting ''Mant!'', hiring Harvey to dress as the mutated half-man, half-ant creature from the film. He also installs buzzers in the theater seats as the first phase of a new film gimmick he is calling \"Rumble-Rama\". The cinema's manager, Howard, warns about Rumble-Rama's potential effects on the old and fragile balcony area, which can now only hold 100 people. At the Saturday matinee, Sherry encounters Stan, who is attending the premiere screening with Gene and Dennis. She is upset that he deceived her, but later reconciles with him when Gene intercedes on the couple's behalf. Sandra attends the premiere with her parents, but leaves them to watch the film with Gene. When Harvey (costumed as the ''Mant!'' monster) sees Sherry and Stan kissing during the film, he attacks Stan in a rage, then punches Woolsey after he tries to intervene, and a chase ensues. Stan takes a shotgun from a [[fallout shelter]] located in the theater's basement and uses it to frighten off Harvey. Sandra and Gene are locked inside the shelter by mistake when the door is accidentally closed and its time-lock activated. While trapped inside, the two comfort each other, eventually sharing their first kiss.\n\nWoolsey helps rescue the pair from the shelter before their oxygen supply runs out. Harvey reappears and holds his [[switchblade]] to Ruth's throat, demanding the movie premiere's cash receipts from Woolsey. As he steals the cash, he kidnaps Sherry and escapes. Howard immediately calls the police, and Harvey is quickly arrested after crashing Woolsey's Cadillac outside the movie theater. Sherry and Stan happily reunite after this ordeal. Woolsey also realizes that Harvey has turned the \"Rumble-Rama\" machinery up so high that the now overcrowded theater balcony is starting to collapse from the heavy sound vibrations. Assisted by Gene, Woolsey projects trompe-l'\u0153il footage of an atomic bomb [[mushroom cloud]] that appears to blast a hole through the screen and the theater's outside wall, quickly evacuating the now panicked audience to safety.\n\nAfter the Cuban missile crisis has ended, Ruth and Woolsey leave for another premiere in Cleveland, bidding goodbye to Sandra and Gene. Woolsey has grown fond of the two kids, telling Ruth he might like to have two children after they marry. Sandra and Gene watch them drive away in Woolsey's new Cadillac. Navy helicopters fly over the beaches in Key West, implying that Gene's father will soon return home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Goodman]] as Lawrence Woolsey\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Ruth Corday / Carole\n* [[Simon Fenton]] as Gene Loomis\n* [[Omri Katz]] as Stan\n* [[Lisa Jakub]] as Sandra\n* [[Kellie Martin]] as Sherry\n* [[Jesse Lee Soffer|Jesse Lee]] as Dennis Loomis\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Anne Loomis\n* James Villemaire as Harvey Starkweather\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Howard, the Theater Manager\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Mr. Spector\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Herb Denning\n* [[John Sayles]] as Bob\n* [[David Clennon]] as Jack\n* Lucy Butler as Rhonda\n* [[Belinda Balaski]] as Stan's Mom\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Shopping Cart Starlet\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Gen. Ankrum (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nJoe Dante says the financing of the film was difficult:\n<blockquote>''Matinee'' got made through a fluke. The company that was paying for us went out of business and didn't have any money. Universal, which was the distributor, had put in a little money, and we went to them and begged them to buy into the whole movie, and to their everlasting sorrow they went ahead and did it. [Laughs.]<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/article/joe-dante-13689 \"Joe Dante\" By Joshua Klein ''AV Club'' Nov 29, 2000] accessed 3 February 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 13, 1992. Filming took place in and around the state of [[Florida]], including the towns of Cocoa, Maitland, and Key West. The interior sequences in the school and the movie theater were filmed on set at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The street scenes were filmed in [[Oxnard, California]]. Production was completed on June 19, 1992.\n\n===Music===\nThe original [[film score]] was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. Several cues from previous genre films were also used, arranged and conducted by [[Dick Jacobs]]. These included \"Main Title\" from ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943); \"Visitors\" from ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'' (1953); \"Main Title\" from ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'' (1955); \"Winged Death\" from ''[[The Deadly Mantis]]'' (1957); two cues from ''[[This Island Earth]]'' (1955), \"Main Title\" and \"Shooting Stars\"; and three cues from the ''Creature from the Black Lagoon'' trilogy: \"Monster Attack\" from ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954); \"Main Title\" from ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]'' (1955); and \"Stalking the Creature\" from ''[[The Creature Walks Among Us]]'' (1956).\n\n===Casting===\nJoe Dante had cast character actor [[Dick Miller]] in each of his movies, casting him in ''Matinee'' as one of the men protesting the monster movie's release, and as a soldier holding a sack of sugar in ''Mant''. Also appearing in supporting roles are [[William Schallert]] and [[Robert O. Cornthwaite]] (who both appeared in scores of low-budget films of all genres); [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] (perhaps best remembered for his role in ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'') as well as [[Robert Picardo]], both of whom appeared in several of Dante's films. [[John Sayles]], who collaborated with Dante on earlier films, appears as one of the men who is protesting the release of  ''Mant''.\n\n===Films within the film===\n====''Mant!''====\nWoolsey's low-budget ''Mant!'' is a parody morphing of several low-budget science fiction horror films of the 1950s (many in black and white) that fused radioactivity with [[Mad Science|mad science]] and mutation. These films include ''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'' (1955), wherein a scientist is injected with an [[Atomic isotope separation methods|atomic isotope formula]] with disastrous results, and the films ''[[Them!]]'' (1954); ''[[The Beast with a Million Eyes]]'' (1955) ''[[The Deadly Mantis]]'' (1957); ''[[The Black Scorpion (film)|The Black Scorpion]]'' (1957); ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'' (1957); ''[[Monster That Challenged the World]]'' (1957); ''[[Beginning of the End (film)|Beginning of the End]]'' (1957); ''[[War of the Colossal Beast]]'' (1958); ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'' (1958) and ''[[The Alligator People]]'' (1959). The depiction of ''Mant!''{{'}}s use of Rumble-Rama is a riff on William Castle's many in-theatre gimmicks ([[William Castle#On his own: the gimmicks|\"Emergo\", \"Percepto\", \"Illusion-O\", \"Shock Sections\" etc.]]), however, the only \"monster movie\" produced or directed by William Castle before 1970 was 1959's ''[[The Tingler]]'', which did not have a radiation theme. Rumble-Rama is also a nod to [[Sensurround]], Universal's sound process of the 1970's. ''Matinee'' also mentions some of Woolsey's earlier horror movies: ''Island of the Flesh Eaters'', ''The Eyes of Doctor Diablo'', and ''The Brain Leeches'' (not to be confused with [[The Brain Leeches|the real-world 1977 film of the same name]]).\n\n====''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''====\nAlthough ''Matinee'' is set in October 1962, its other [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]], the family-oriented gimmick comedy ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart'' (featuring an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] shopping cart), is a reference to some color Disney comedies that came later in the decade: ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1969) in particular, and ''[[The Ugly Dachshund]]'' (1966); ''[[Monkeys, Go Home!]]'' (1967); ''[[Blackbeard's Ghost]]'' (1968); ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1968); ''[[The Million Dollar Duck]]'' (1971); ''[[Snowball Express]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Shaggy D.A.]]'' (1976) in general.<ref>[http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s3208dant.html DVD Savant: ''Joe Dante interviewed on the DVD release of Matinee'' By Glenn Erickson May 11, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/movies-about-moviegoing-sherlock-jr-matinee-and-go,46257/ The Onion A.V.
