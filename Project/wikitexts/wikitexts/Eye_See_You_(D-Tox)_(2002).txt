The supporting cast features [[Tom Berenger]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], [[Polly Walker]], [[Robert Patrick]], [[Stephen Lang]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[Courtney B. Vance]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. The film had a limited release in the United States on September 20, 2002, under the title '''''Eye See You''''' by [[DEJ Productions]].\n\nThe film is based on the 1999 novel ''Jitter Joint'' written by [[Clinton Howard Swindle|Howard Swindle]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Jake Malloy pursues a [[serial killer]] who targets police officers, his former partner becomes a victim. At his partner's home, the killer calls Malloy from Malloy's home. The killer says Malloy pursued him earlier for a series of prostitute murders; as revenge, he kills Mary, Malloy's girlfriend. Malloy pursues the killer, only to find that he appears to have committed [[suicide]]. Three months later, Malloy descends into [[alcoholism]]. After a suicide attempt, Malloy's best friend and supervising officer, Agent Chuck Hendricks, enrolls Malloy in a rehabilitation program for law enforcement officers run by Dr. John \"Doc\" Mitchell, a former cop and recovering alcoholic. Hendricks stays in Wyoming to ensure Malloy will be okay.\n\nMalloy meets several other officers who are patients in the clinic, including Peter Noah, an arrogant and paranoid ex-[[SWAT]] officer; Frank Slater, a cynical British police officer; Willie Jones, a religious homicide detective; Jaworski, a narcotics cop who attempted suicide; Lopez, a foul-mouthed [[LAPD]] officer; and McKenzie, an elderly member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] who witnessed his partner's murder. He meets several staff members, including Doc's assistant and mechanic Hank and compassionate resident psychiatrist and nurse Jenny Munroe, with whom Malloy develops a bond.\n\nA blizzard seals everyone in the rehab center without outside communication. Jenny finds the body of Connor, a troubled patient who apparently killed himself, but Jenny believes Connor would have sought help. The next morning Hank finds another apparent suicide, but Malloy believes otherwise. Doc locks up the surviving patients while he reviews their files. Jenny informs Doc that Jack Bennett, an orderly who was a former patient, is missing. After an axe-wielding man kills Doc, everyone but Malloy and Jenny suspect Jack. Malloy returns the cops' sidearms. Hendricks finds a dead cop in a frozen lake and returns to the clinic with the owner of a nearby fishing shop.\n\nHank, the clinic's cook Manny, and helper Gilbert, volunteer to drive through the blizzard to get help. While driving away, Hank veers away from something. The truck slides off the icy road and crashes. Malloy and Jenny hear the crash, and Malloy hands a gun to Jenny before investigating. Malloy finds Manny murdered and also found Jack's body, which caused the crash. Gilbert flees while Malloy rushes back to the clinic.\n\nThe killer electrocutes McKenzie, deactivating the building's power and heating system. Malloy forces everyone except Jenny to their cells, realizing a murderer is impersonating a cop. Suspecting this is Mary's killer, Malloy finds evidence on Connor's body to support this. As Malloy and Jenny return to the cells, Hank, suspecting Malloy, knocks him out. He locks Malloy in Slater's cell and releases everyone else.\n\nMalloy finds a matchbook in Slater's cell from a Seattle restaurant frequented by cops, identifying him as the killer. Malloy realizes Slater has been observing him and other policemen he murdered at the restaurant. Malloy escapes and finds the missing badges above Slater's room, which he collects as trophies. After establishing his innocence, Malloy has Jones and Lopez conduct patrol while Jaworski stays with Jenny. Malloy heads into the tunnels beneath the facility. Unaware that Slater is the killer, Hank and Noah help him retrieve logs in the tunnels for heating.  Slater convinces them to split up before killing each. As Malloy patrols the tunnels, Slater taunts him over a CB radio and lures Malloy to Noah's hanged body, where he finds the other radio. While leaving the clinic, Slater hears Jenny call Malloy. Malloy learns Slater is at the tunnel's trapdoor and rushes to save Jenny.\n\nOutside the installation, Hendricks and the fishing shop owner find Gilbert alive and take him to the rehab center. Hendricks follows Jenny's footprints. Jenny runs to a nearby [[quonset hut]], hiding from Slater. Malloy arrives, telling Jenny to stay inside the shed. Slater catches Hendricks before Malloy catches him from behind. Slater jumps into the shed, knocks Jenny out, and wounds Hendricks. After a fight, Malloy finally kills Slater. Jenny regains consciousness and helps Hendricks walk to the clinic with Malloy. Malloy puts his engagement ring on a tree branch and walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Agent Jake Malloy\n* [[Charles S.

The film was then shelved for quite some time while re-shoots and story changes were being done.<ref>{{cite web|title=Universal's EYE SEE YOU aka THE OUTPOST aka DETOX... info|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/8011|website=Aint It Cool|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> Composer John Powell wrote two complete scores for the film, one of which was rejected. With the film delayed and relegated to a European release by Universal due to the studio's dissatisfaction with the film in general, most of Powell's score was replaced with additional music by William Ross, Geoff Zanelli, and Nick Glennie-Smith as an attempt to make the film salvageable. A new ending was also filmed in which the main villain is killed in a different way.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Paul|title=Sylvester Stallone for \"D-Tox\"|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/sylvester-stallone-for-d-tox/|website=Dark Horizons|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> Even after re-shoots and title changes, Universal did not care for the film and after test screenings for the new version also got negative response from audiences, they shelved it. DEJ Productions acquired domestic distribution rights from Universal and released it over three years after it was originally finished but in a limited release.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Patrick|title=Hidden by Hollywood: All-star cast of bombs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/15/entertainment/et-goldside15|website=Los Angeles Times|date=15 October 2002 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>\nIn an interview with ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' in December 2006, Sylvester Stallone was asked why the film did not get a wide release and then answered:\n\n<blockquote>It\u2019s very simple why ''D-Tox'' landed in limbo. A film is a very delicate creature. Any adverse publicity or internal shake-up can upset the perception of \u2013 and studio confidence in \u2013 a feature. For some unknown reason the original producer pulled out and right away the film was considered damaged goods; by the time we ended filming there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio. The studio let it sit on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a re-shoot. We screened it, it tested okay, [[Ron Howard]] was involved with overseeing some of the post-production\u2026 but the movie had the smell of death about it. Actually, if you looked up, you could see celluloid buzzards circling as we lay there dying on the distributor's floor. One amusing note: It was funny, when we were met at the airport by the teamsters they'd have a sign in front of them saying DETOX, and all these actors like Kris Kristofferson, Tom Berenger and myself looked like we were going into rehab rather than a film shoot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stallone answers December 9th & 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA at BNAT!!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932|website=Aint It Cool|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the original filming of ''D-Tox'' in 1999, Sylvester Stallone became attached to star in another Universal produced film, an action horror entitled ''Fatalis''. Written by novelist [[Jeff Rovin]] in 1998 and sold to Universal for over a million dollars, the script for the film concerned a huge pack of [[Smilodon|saber-toothed tigers]] who come back to life after an [[El Ni\u00f1o]] hurricane awakens them from being frozen inside an ancient sinkhole for thousands of years. They start attacking any humans they run into while moving down the mountains and through the woods before eventually attacking [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/the-definitive-spec-script-sales-list-1991-2012-1998-918113f4199a|title = The Definitive Spec Script Sales List (1991\u20132012): 1998|date = 10 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/eye-tiger/|title=Eye of the Tiger}}</ref> Rovin, who wrote the novelization of Stallone's ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'' (1993) and his biography, wrote ''Fatalis'' with Stallone in mind for the lead role of an anthropologist who, along with a female reporter he befriends, wants to capture the tigers alive as they are our last link with the past, however the local sheriff wants to destroy them. The film went into pre-production by 2000, but following the huge failure of ''D-Tox'' and Stallone's other films, Universal ceased production and it went unproduced, though Rovin later turned his script into very successful novel of the same name. Rovin did the same with ''Vespers'', another cancelled action-horror film from around the same time, which would have focused on [[Pteropus|giant bats]] that attack [[New York City]]. When asked in 2021 about the chances of ''Fatalis'' being produced twenty years later, Rovin revealed that Stallone still owns the rights to the original story, and he suspects it will [[development hell|not be produced]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stallonezone.com/fatalis061100.html|title = Stallone Zone News: Fatalis Now Available}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stallonezone.com/wordpress/?page_id=32|title = \"Unmade\"|date = 11 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1081426.Fatalis | title=Fatalis }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/11762.Jeff_Rovin/questions|title = Jeff Rovin answers your questions \u2014 Ask the Author}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nThe DVD release of the film includes eight deleted scenes as bonus feature, but the original ending is not included.
