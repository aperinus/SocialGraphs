The film stars [[Jon Voight]], [[Mary Tamm]], [[Maximilian Schell]] and [[Maria Schell]] and was directed by [[Ronald Neame]], with a score by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. It was the only film that the Schell siblings made together.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn 22 November 1963, the day of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in Dallas, Peter Miller ([[Jon Voight]]), a young [[freelancer|freelance reporter]] in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]], pulls his car over to the kerb to listen to a radio report of the event. As a result, he happens to be stopped at a traffic signal as an ambulance passes by on a highway.\n\nHe follows the ambulance and discovers it is en route to pick up the body of an elderly man who has committed suicide, leaving behind no family. Peter obtains the diary and learns the man was Salomon Tauber ([[Towje Kleiner]]), a Jewish [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]]. Salomon's diary details information on his life in the [[Riga Ghetto]] during [[World War II]], including the name of the [[SS]] officer who ran the camp, [[Eduard Roschmann]] ([[Maximilian Schell]]). Salomon's diary catalogues all of Roschmann's crimes including the murder of a highly decorated Wehrmacht officer ([[Oskar Werner]]) while attempting to flee at the end of the war.\n\nPeter is filled with a determination to hunt Roschmann down and he sets out to meet famed Nazi-hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]], who informs him about [[ODESSA]], a secret organization for former members of the SS which is developing a [[Missile guidance|missile guidance system]] for [[History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasserist Egypt]]. Simon explains that most of the [[Berlin Police|West Berlin Police]] are members of ODESSA and not to be trusted. As Peter leaves he is accosted by Israeli [[Mossad]] agents who suspect Peter of trying to harm Wiesenthal. Peter manages to convince the men that his true mission is to find and bring Roschmann to justice. The Israelis propose to send Peter deep undercover in the ODESSA. Peter agrees to the mission and with the help of the Israelis, they provide him with a cover identity. Peter is to be a former SS soldier who died recently in a nearby hospital. Before going under cover, Peter then leaves his girlfriend Sigi ([[Mary Tamm]]).\n\nThe Israelis drill Peter on all details of his cover identity in preparation of meeting with ODESSA. Complete with a new cover identity, Peter gains access to the inner ranks of the ODESSA. After getting through his first test he is sent to get a [[fake passport]] from a forger who is working for ODESSA. While awaiting his train, Peter blunders by making a call to Sigi to assure her that he is OK. Thinking he is safe, he boards the train. Meanwhile, the ODESSA report back that Peter has made a call and they work out that Peter is not who he says he is. An assassin is dispatched to kill him. Peter meets with the forger Klaus Wenzer ([[Derek Jacobi]]) a shy insecure young man living with his mother. After taking [[passport photo]]s, Klaus tells Peter to return after the weekend, but then calls him after midnight and tells him to return within the hour.\n\nSuspicious, Peter rings Klaus' home from his hotel and having had no answer is wary, and sees the armed assassin who is waiting for him. Peter sneaks into the house and awakes Klaus' mother: she mistakes him for a priest and begs him to pray for her son. He then tackles the assassin and manages to kill the man. Whilst exploring Klaus' safe he uncovers a book detailing every fake ID Klaus created and detail the real identity of those he created the fake IDs for. Peter takes the file and hides it in a train station locker, later giving the key to Sigi, lest anything should happen to him.\n\nPeter victorious returns to the Israelis and details all he has found but refuses to disclose the location of the file until Roschmann has been apprehended. The Israeli agents reluctantly agree to Peter's demands and he then leaves for Roschmann's home where he finds him living an opulent life as a munitions factory owner. Peter manages to gain access to the mansion and evade his security before confronting Roschmann at gunpoint. Peter reveals Salomon Tauber's diary to Roschmann who attempts to deny everything, claiming Peter has been misled. Peter then discloses to Roschmann, Salomon's description of the murder of a fellow German Wehrmacht officer at the end of the war. Peter goes through the unique details of the cowardly murder and then discloses that the Wehrmacht officer was in fact Peter's father. Roschmann realising he is about to be exposed, panics and goes for his gun forcing Peter to defend himself. Peter returns fire at Roschmann killing the former SS officer.\n\nThe detailed ODESSA files obtained by Peter are used to arrest numerous [[German war crimes|Nazi war criminals]] including high-ranking members of the police. Later Roschmann's factory mysteriously burns to the ground before any rockets are delivered to Egypt.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast from opening credits, per closing credits order and roles --->\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Peter Miller\n* [[Mary Tamm]] as Sigi\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as [[Eduard Roschmann]]\n* [[Maria Schell]] as Frau Miller\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Klaus Wenzer\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as David Porath\n* [[Klaus L\u00f6witsch]] as Gustav Mackensen\n* [[Kurt Meisel]] as Alfred Oster\n* [[Hannes Messemer]] as [[Richard Gl\u00fccks|General Gl\u00fccks]]\n* [[Garfield Morgan]] as Israeli General\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Simon Wiesenthal]]\n* [[Ernst Schr\u00f6der (actor)|Ernst Schr\u00f6der]] as Werner Deilman\n* [[G\u00fcnter Strack]] as Kunik\n* [[Noel Willman]] as Franz Bayer\n* [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] as General Greifer\n* [[Gunnar M\u00f6ller]] as Karl Braun\n* Til Kiwe as Medal Shop Proprietor\n* [[Cyril Shaps]] as Tauber's Voice (narrating the diary)\n* [[Oskar Werner]] as an [[Wehrmacht]] Officer (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nFilming was done on location in [[Hamburg]], Germany; [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]; [[Heidelberg]], Germany; [[Munich]], Germany; at [[Pinewood Studios]], England; and the [[Bavaria Studios]] in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria|Gr\u00fcnwald]], [[Bavaria]], Germany.
