The film focuses on two gangs, the 248 and the 245, fighting for control of [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]] (the FP). The gangs settle their disputes by playing ''Beat-Beat Revelation'', a [[music video game]] similar to ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Gang member JTRO (Jason Trost) trains to defeat L Dubba E ([[Lee Valmassy]]), the leader of a rival gang. The film also features [[Caitlyn Folley]], [[Art Hsu]], [[Nick Principe]] and [[Dov Tiefenbach]].\n\nJason Trost conceived ''The FP'' when he was 16, and developed it into a short film starring himself, Valmassy, Principe, DeBello, Brandon Barrera, Diane Gaeta, [[Kris Lemche]] and Torry Haynes in 2007. After seeing the finished film, Barrera suggested that Trost make a feature-length version. In the expanded production, Gaeta, Lemche, and Haynes were replaced with Folley, Hsu, and Bryan Goddard, respectively. [[Principal photography]] took place in Frazier Park, California in September 2008. Ron Trost{{mdash}}Brandon and Jason Trost's father{{mdash}}served as [[special effects supervisor]] and [[executive producer]] of the film, and his property was the primary filming location.\n\nThe full-length version of ''The FP'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on {{nowrap|March 13}}, 2011, and received positive reviews. After its screening at the [[Fantasia Festival]] on {{nowrap|July 30}} that year, [[Drafthouse Films]] acquired the film for distribution. It had a limited release in 28 American theaters, beginning on {{nowrap|March 16}}, 2012, and was released on home media on {{nowrap|June 29}}, 2012. The theatrical release received mixed reviews and failed to recoup its production budget of {{USD|45,000}}, grossing $40,557 in the United States. A sequel, ''[[FP2: Beats of Rage]]'', was released in September 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[dystopia]]n future, rival gangs the 245 and the 248 fight for control of [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]] (the FP) by challenging each other in ''Beat-Beat Revelation'', a dance-fight video game. L Dubba E, the leader of the 245 gang, battles and defeats BTRO, the leader of the 248 gang. BTRO dies as a result. His younger brother JTRO is traumatized and leaves the FP.\n\nOne year later, BTRO's best friend KCDC finds JTRO working as a lumberjack. KCDC convinces JTRO that the FP needs him because L Dubba E has taken control of the local alcohol industry and is refusing to sell alcoholic drinks to everyone. The lack of alcohol has led to an increase in [[methamphetamine]] addicts, a decrease in [[Homelessness|homeless people]] and, consequently, ducks. Reluctantly, JTRO returns with KCDC; he meets BLT and reunites with Stacy, an old friend. JTRO and Stacy are interrupted by L Dubba E{{mdash}}now Stacy's boyfriend{{mdash}}who is picking her up to go to a party. JTRO goes to the same party and Stacy drunkenly flirts with him. L Dubba E taunts JTRO then hits him with a baseball bat, rendering him unconscious. JTRO dreams that BTRO tells him to fight back, pushing him to challenge L Dubba E. L Dubba E declines, saying that JTRO lacks sufficient \"[[Credibility#On the street|street cred]]\". L Dubba E demands that JTRO defeat Triple Decka 1K before he will accept JTRO's challenge.\n\nJTRO begins a grueling training regime with BLT to regain his former level of skill. Before his match with Triple Decka 1K, BLT gives BTRO's boots to JTRO. At the match venue, JTRO is tricked into drinking alcohol tainted with methamphetamine. Despite his drug-induced visual impairment, JTRO defeats Triple Decka 1K before vomiting and passing out.\n\nKCDC wakes JTRO, having taken him to the 248 headquarters. After JTRO's recovery, BLT takes him and KCDC shooting; they decide to take guns to JTRO's match against L Dubba E. Stacy tells JTRO that her relationship with L Dubba E began when he spiked her drink with [[turpentine]] and raped her. She continued the relationship so she could supply her father with beer to prevent him from turning to drugs. One day, JTRO hears Stacy's father assaulting her and intervenes. After a brief fight with him, JTRO persuades Stacy to leave. Immediately after their departure, L Dubba E arrives and says that he has been cheating on Stacy. Stacy decides to stay with him, which angers JTRO and causes him to end their friendship.\n\nLater the same day, Stacy, who has been badly beaten, finds JTRO and tells him that she has ended her relationship with L Dubba E. She apologizes, and they kiss. Meanwhile, L Dubba E tells his gang members to also take guns to the final match. At the venue, JTRO wears BTRO's outfit and L Dubba E taunts him. When the match begins, L Dubba E defeats JTRO in the first round but JTRO perseveres and wins the second and third rounds. L Dubba E tries to kill JTRO, triggering a lengthy gunfight between the 248 and the 245.\n\nL Dubba E escapes the event and kidnaps Stacy. JTRO and KCDC pursue him while BLT remains at the venue. L Dubba E abruptly pulls into a gas station; JTRO follows and a fight ensues. JTRO gains the upper hand, beats L Dubba E into submission and forces him to leave the FP. Freedom to buy alcohol is restored and control of the FP is returned to the 248. JTRO and Stacy go to the pond together as ducks fly over them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason Trost]] as JTRO, a member of the 248 gang who sets out to defeat L Dubba E. Trost wrote JTRO as the [[straight man]] and compared him to [[Rocky Balboa]] and [[John Rambo]].<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" />\n* [[Lee Valmassy]] as L Dubba E, the leader of the 245, a rival gang to the 248. Jason Trost said the character is similar to [[Mr. T]] and that Valmassy was \"so embarrassed&nbsp;...&nbsp;when he first [played the part] he almost didn't want to talk to me again\".<ref name=\"Uproxx\" /> Valmassy also appears several times as a background extra.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n* [[Caitlyn Folley]] as Stacy, L Dubba E's girlfriend and JTRO's old friend.\n* [[Art Hsu]] as KCDC, an energetic member of the 248 and BTRO's best friend who serves as the [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]] for the ''Beat-Beat Revelation'' matches. The directors said Hsu needed little direction because he played his character well. Hsu described KCDC as \"the sidekick\" and \"the guy who&nbsp;...&nbsp;guides people through the FP\".<ref name=\"Art\" /> The Trosts originally wrote the character to be more [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] but they decided to reduce those elements for the final draft.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n* [[Nick Principe]] as BLT, an abrasive member of the 248 and JTRO's trainer. Jason met Principe during the production of ''[[Laid to Rest (film)|Laid to Rest]]'', on which he worked as a costume assistant and as Principe's body double.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Triple Decka 1K, a Russian ''Beat-Beat Revelation'' player who faces JTRO. Tiefenbach engaged in [[method acting]] by maintaining his Russian accent on- and off-set throughout filming.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n* James DeBello as Beat Box Busta Bill, a member of the 245 and one of L Dubba E's henchmen.\n* Bryan Goddard as Sugga Nigga, a member of the 245 and one of L Dubba E's henchmen.\n* Brandon Barrera as BTRO, JTRO's brother and the leader of the 248. Barrera appears as an extra in several scenes.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n\nAdditional cast members include Mike Sandow as Jody, Rachel Robinson as Lacy, Natalie Minx as Macy, [[Sean Whalen]] as Stacy's father, and [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] as CC Jam. [[Blayne Weaver]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as the owner of a gas station KCDC robs,<ref name=\"JComm\" /> while [[James Remar]] narrates the film's prelude. [[Dash Mihok]] played a small role in the cut of the film shown at South by Southwest,<ref name=\"Twitch\" /> but his scenes were removed from the theatrical release. Producer Christian Agypt, first [[assistant director]] Christopher Holmes, costume designer Sarah Trost, Valmassy's younger brother Kyle, and several of the Trosts' friends appear as background extras.

He noticed people playing the game intensely and thought of treating the gameplay \"like some blood sport\".<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> Trost made short films throughout high school before briefly attending film school. After dropping out, he used his tuition money to fund a short film, also titled ''The FP'' (2007). The short film was based on the original feature-length script, but only the first ten pages were filmed.<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" /> The feature film recreated several shots from the short film.<ref name=\"Crave\" /> Trost said the feature film was inspired by what they imagined a ''Dance Dance Revolution'' film made by producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] would look like.<ref name=\"Uproxx\" />\n\nThe Trost brothers asked producer Brandon Barrera to act in the short film. After seeing their work, Barrera suggested that the brothers expand the premise into a feature film.<ref name=\"BarreraBTS\" /> The filmmakers placed an advertisement in the ''[[Mountain Enterprise]]'', the [[Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass]]'s newspaper, encouraging community members to call if they wanted to help with locations, catering, donations, or by serving as extras or crew members on the film.<ref name=\"Barrera2008\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=\"[W]e were playing ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', and&nbsp;...&nbsp;''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY|Def Jam[: Fight for NY]]]''&nbsp;...&nbsp;[''Def Jam''{{'}}s] vernacular just kind of worked its way in ''Dance Dance'', and I was like, what if we mix these two worlds?\"|author=[[Jason Trost]]|source=on the inspiration of the film's dialogue<ref name=\"BD\" />}}\n\nThe Trost brothers named ''The FP'' after Frazier Park, California, where they grew up.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> Jason Trost said locals started referring to Frazier Park as \"the FP\" after ''[[The O.C.]]'' began airing.<ref name=\"Crave\" /> He also said the film's story copies that of ''[[Rocky]]'' \"beat for beat\" and that there were \"near-plagiarism moments\".<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" /> All the character names were based on his friends.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> Over 80 percent of the dialogue was based on phrases frequently spoken by several Frazier Park residents.<ref name=\"BD\" /> Much of the profanity in the script was taken from conversations overheard by costume designer Sarah Trost at parties,<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> and what the Trost brothers thought of on set.<ref name=\"BrandonBTS\" /> Further inspiration for the dialogue came from ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''<ref name=\"AlienBee\" /> and ''[[Def Jam: Fight for NY]]'', both of which Jason Trost played alongside ''Dance Dance Revolution''.<ref name=\"BD\" />\n\nThe settings in ''The FP'' were written using the materials that the Trosts' father had on his property due to the minimal budget. Jason Trost said he had seen several low-budget films that \"try to be something they aren't\" and did not want to feign the production value.<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" /> When they are defeated in a dance-off, characters in the film die of a \"[[187 (slang)|187]]\", which is slang for murder that originated from [[California Penal Code]].<ref name=\"JComm\" /><ref name=\"Penal\" /> The characters' actual causes of death are unexplained in the film. The Trost brothers found depicting the deaths as ambiguous funnier and believed it would remove doubts about the film being a comedy.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nJason Trost (JTRO), Lee Valmassy (L Dubba E), Brandon Barrera (BTRO), and James DeBello (Beat Box Busta Bill) reprised their roles from the original short film, while Diane Gaeta (Stacy), Kris Lemche (KCDC), and Torry Haynes (Sugga Nigga)<ref name=\"Short\" /> were replaced with Caitlyn Folley, Art Hsu, and Bryan Goddard, respectively.<ref name=\"Feature\" /> Goddard was cast as a \"[[rite of passage]]\" for being a noteworthy resident of Frazier Park.<ref name=\"FPinFP\" /> Mike Sandow, who portrays Jody, originally had a larger part in the film but his scenes were almost entirely edited out for pacing reasons.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n\nMost of the cast were friends of the Trosts.<ref name=\"JComm\" /> James Remar, a friend of the Trosts since childhood, agreed to narrate the film's opening. The brothers had met Remar on the set of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', on which their father Ron worked as the [[special effects supervisor]].<ref name=\"Wired\" /> Brandon Trost knew Hsu and Clifton Collins, Jr. after working with them on ''[[Crank: High Voltage]]'' (2009) and invited them to join ''The FP''{{'}}s cast.<ref name=\"BComm\" />\n\n=== Costume design ===\n[[File:Sean Whalen in the FP.png|thumb|[[Sean Whalen]] as Stacy's father. Sarah Trost designed his character to look [[Transsexualism|transsexual]]. Whalen agreed to wear anything if he could have his nipple exposed.|alt=Sean Whalen in dim lighting, with heavy make-up around his eyes. He wears a light blue tank top with a pink scarf over it. His left nipple is exposed.]]\n\nSarah Trost was the costume designer for ''The FP''; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence.<ref name=\"SarahBTS\" /> She was also inspired by the fashions of [[Elvis Presley]], and the films ''[[Double Dragon]]'', ''Rocky'',<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'', [[X-Men]], as well as the works of [[John Carpenter]].<ref name=\"SarahInterview\" /> Trost based the opposing gangs' outfits on American military uniforms of the [[American Civil War]] era. The 245's outfits were based on the [[Uniforms of the Confederate States military forces|uniforms of the Confederate Army]], while the 248's outfits were based on [[uniforms of the Union Army|those of the Union Army]].<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> The flags of the gangs were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union. Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty.<ref name=\"SarahInterview\" /> Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew; L Dubba E's costumes were made from jumpsuits.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /><ref name=\"SarahBTS\" /> The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /> Most of the base clothing came from [[Charity shop|thrift stores]], Sarah Trost's fabric storage, and the Trost's childhood clothing.<ref name=\"Independent\" />\n\nTrost designed the costumes to be distinct from one another. JTRO and BTRO wear very similar costumes, the only noticeable difference being a color inversion. Both costumes had American flag-like emblems on the backs of their jackets, further enforcing the identification of the 248 with the Union. At the end of the film, JTRO takes BTRO's outfit, which required Trost to readjust it for the height difference between Jason Trost and Brandon Barrera, who portray JTRO and BTRO, respectively.<ref name=\"SarahInterview\" /> As the film progresses, JTRO's color scheme changes from black and blue to military green to reflect his \"becoming one with BLT\".<ref name=\"JComm\" /> KCDC's costume design features ducks, referencing a speech in the film in which he notes the lack of ducks in the FP. Stacy and her father are both dressed to be somewhat [[Transsexualism|transsexual]], though it is more prominent in her father's character. Whalen told Trost he would wear anything as long as his nipple was exposed at all times. Stacy also wears an [[I Love New York]] shirt, with the words New York covered in duct tape and \"The FP\" written over it with a marker. CC Jam's costume was designed to be as colorful as possible to emulate [[rave]] culture.<ref name=\"SarahInterview\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in Frazier Park, California, with a budget of $45,000.<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" /><ref name=\"Independent\" /> It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days, most of which were spent on Ron Trost's property.<ref name=\"Barrera2008\" /><ref name=\"BComm\" /><ref name=\"SarahBTS\" /><ref name=\"Independent\" /> Scenes set in BLT's house were filmed at the Trosts' childhood home, while the look of his basement was designed using the inside of a shipping container.<ref name=\"JComm\" /><ref name=\"BComm\" /> Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets.<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /><ref name=\"BarreraBTS\" /><ref name=\"Independent\" /> The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story.<ref name=\"BD\" /><ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n\n[[File:Frazier Park Texaco station.jpg|190px|thumb|right|A non-operational [[Texaco]] gas station in [[Frazier Park, California]], where the film's final fight scene was shot.|alt=A white and red Texaco gas station, with a chainlink fence surrounding it. There is a road in front of the station.]]\n\nSeveral planned filming locations were abandoned due to budget constraints.<ref name=\"BarreraBTS\" /> For thematic reasons, the film's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Mart{{mdash}}a key location in the film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission for the crew to film on the property.<ref name=\"JComm\" /><ref name=\"FPinFP\" />\n\nThe penultimate dance-off was filmed in three eight-minute [[long take]]s and edited down. Brandon Trost would \"float around with the camera\" while Valmassy and Jason Trost performed the dance-off sequence.<ref name=\"JComm\" /> While filming a tire training scene, Brandon asked Jason to increase the amount of spins he was performing.<ref name=\"BComm\" /> Jason broke his ankle and relied on his costume's snow boots as [[Boot (medical)|medical boots]].<ref name=\"DailyCal\" /><ref name=\"Nerdist\" />\n\nDirector of photography Brandon Trost shot ''The FP'' using [[digital cinematography]] with [[List of Canon camcorders#Canon XH-A1|Canon XH-A1]] cameras, which he had recently used while filming ''Crank: High Voltage''.<ref name=\"Nerdist\" /> Using a [[single-camera setup]], he filmed ''The FP'' using [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] to evoke the traditional look of films such as ''The Warriors'' and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''. Trost ignored camera and lighting errors to make the film \"feel genuine\".<ref name=\"CHUD\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects artist Aaron Juntunen copied the visuals from the ''Beat-Beat Revelation'' dance tracks from ''Dance Dance Revolution'' by using [[computer graphics]].<ref name=\"JComm\" /> The tracks were played live, allowing the actors to dance in unison.<ref name=\"Crave\" /> Visual effects were also used to cover the name of Dawn's Liquor Mart, as the actual location did not give the production permission to use its name and logo.<ref name=\"JComm\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nGeorge Holdcroft composed the score for ''The FP''. He was invited to a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, and asked if he could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in [[Chicago]] at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in [[falsetto]] and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.<ref name=\"GeorgeInterview\" />\n\nHoldcroft had never played ''Dance Dance Revolution'', though he was familiar with video game music{{mdash}}specifically the compositions of [[Koji Kondo]], the score of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', and the music of early [[Nintendo]] games.<ref name=\"GeorgeInterview\" /> The film's soundtrack consists of 61 songs.<ref name=\"Drafthouse\" />\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:THE FP World Premiere SXSW.jpg|thumb|right|280px|From left: First assistant director Christopher Holmes, producer Christian Agypt, director [[Jason Trost]], director [[Brandon Trost]], costume designer Sarah Trost, actor [[Art Hsu]], and production designer Tyler B.

[[Jordan Hoffman]], writing for [[UGO Networks]], gave it a B+, compared it to ''[[Black Dynamite]]'', and wrote that it \"is bursting with idiotic humor and in-your-face stoner wit\".<ref name=\"UGO\" /> Eric Kohn of [[Indiewire]] also gave the film a B+, called it \"loud, furious and recklessly funny\", and mentioned the references to ''The Warriors'', ''RoboCop'', and ''Escape from New York''.<ref name=\"IWReview\" /> Scott Weinberg of [[Twitch Film]] echoed Hoffman's comparison to ''Black Dynamite''. Weinberg said he \"found quite a lot to enjoy\" and praised the performances of Hsu, Valmassy, and Trost.<ref name=\"Twitch\" /> Jacob Hall of [[Moviefone]] gave the film a positive review, praising Brandon Trost's cinematography and mentioned its similarities to ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.

Club]]'' gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of [[John Carpenter]], ''The Warriors'', ''Mad Max 2'', and ''A Clockwork Orange'', and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was \"a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning\".<ref name=\"Tobias\" /> Nick Schager of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave it 1\u00bd stars out of 4, and called it a \"humorless void\" and a \"wannabe cult hit\".<ref name=\"Schager\" /> Eric Hynes of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' said, \"the film's charm fades fast\" and , \"[t]he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth.\"<ref name=\"Hynes\" /> [[Ethan Gilsdorf]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not \"obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'\".<ref name=\"Gilsdorf\" /> [[Christy Lemire]] of the [[Associated Press]] echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is \"just plain bad{{mdash}}and boring, and repetitive\" and that \"as comedy, it just feels numbing\".<ref name=\"Lemire\" /> Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] said the film \"is by no means the worst thing I've ever seen\", but that it \"should have been a three-minute sketch on [[Funny or Die]]\".<ref name=\"Nicholson\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n[[Image Entertainment]] released ''The FP'' on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[video on demand]], and [[Digital distribution|digital download]] on June 19, 2012. The feature was accompanied by a [[making-of]] [[featurette]], interviews with costume designer Sarah Trost and composer George Holdcroft, audio commentary by the Trost brothers, and a special edition collectors' booklet with introductions by [[Rob Zombie]], [[Brian Taylor (filmmaker)|Brian Taylor]], and [[Mark Neveldine]].<ref name=\"HomeMedia\" /> Four special editions were made available for purchase on [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema#Drafthouse Films|Drafthouse Films]]' website, all of which contain Holdcroft's soundtrack and a [[720p]] [[High-definition video|HD]] digital download. Additional items sold include a Blu-ray or DVD copy of the film, a poster signed by the Trost brothers, a model of L Dubba E's [[Grill (jewelry)|grill]], and a tampon in a glass tube signed by the Trost brothers.<ref name=\"Drafthouse\" />\n\n== Sequels ==\n{{Main|FP2: Beats of Rage}}\nAccording to Jason Trost, two sequels to ''The FP'' have been planned, the first of which would involve going to [[Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"Uproxx\" /> He said the first sequel would take place five years after the original and would feature more dancing and a ''Beat-Beat Revelation'' tournament.<ref name=\"Crave\" /> He also compared the sequel's plot to that of ''[[Escape from L.A.]]''<ref name=\"Geekadelphia\" /> Trost also teased the possibility of a fourth film to come when he was older, comparing it to ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.<ref name=\"JasonBTS\" /> In August 2013, Trost said that both he and the film's investors had not received any money from ''The FP'', and \"probably never will\". He further stated that it was challenging \"to figure out a way to get people to fund a sequel to a movie that recouped zero dollars\".<ref name=\"Geekadelphia\" />\n\nTrost started an [[Indiegogo]] fundraising campaign seeking $100,000 in February 2016, revealing the title to be ''Beats of Rage: The FP Part II''.<ref name=\"Inverse\" /> The campaign received over $19,000 in donations by its end, with the amount raised below the fundraising goal to finish a third of the film.<ref name=\"Indiegogo1\" /> In July 2017, Trost started another Indiegogo campaign to finish the film, now titled ''Beats of Rage: The FP 2''. The first thirty minutes of the film had already been shot at the time of the posting, and the fundraising goal was set at $20,000, which was surpassed with over $34,000 donated.<ref name=\"BORIndie\" /> In April 2018, a synopsis and poster were released for the film, now simply titled ''Beats of Rage''. The film follows the events of ''The FP'', and features Trost, Hsu, Barrera, and Principe reprising their roles from the first film, alongside new cast members Mike O'Gorman, Tallay Wickham, and Bru Miller. ''Beats of Rage'' will again feature JTRO and KCDC trying to save the world from an alcohol withdrawal by competing in the titular ''Beat-Beat Revelation'' tournament against AK-47, the leader of The Wastes.<ref name=\"BORDisgusting\" /><ref name=\"BORFestival\" /> Trost also said that the film will debut at \"a major U.S. genre festival\" in October 2018.<ref name=\"BORFestival\" /> The film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 22, 2018, again retitled ''[[FP2: Beats of Rage]]''.<ref name=\"Fantastic\" />\n\n''FP3: Escape From BAKO'' and ''FP4: EVZ'' world premiered in October
