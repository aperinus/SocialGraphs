The film was produced by Melanie Coombs and Melodrama Pictures with music by Dale Cornelius. The voice cast includes [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Eric Bana]] and [[Bethany Whitmore]], with narration provided by [[Barry Humphries]].\n\nThe film follows the lives and friendship of two unlikely pen-pals; Mary, a lonely Australian girl, and Max, an overweight American man with [[Asperger's syndrome]]. The film is inspired by Elliot's relationship with his pen-friend in New York whom he has been writing to for over twenty years.\n\nThe film premiered on the opening night of the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival]] on 15 January 2009. The film won the Annecy Cristal in June 2009 from the [[Annecy International Animation Film Festival|Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] and [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film|Best Animated Feature Film]] at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]] in November 2009. The film was theatrically released on 9 April 2009, by [[Icon Entertainment International]], it received acclaim from critics and earned US$1.7 million on an $8.2 million AUD budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle ([[Bethany Whitmore]]) lives a lonely life in [[Mount Waverley, Victoria|Mount Waverley]], \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead; while at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, [[kleptomaniac]] mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened [[condensed milk]]; and a [[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]-like cartoon show called ''The Noblets''. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a [[New York City]] telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz's name from the phone book and writes him a letter telling him about herself, sending it off in the hope that he will become her [[pen pal]].\n\nMax Jerry Horowitz ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) is a [[Obesity-associated morbidity|morbidly obese]] 44-year-old [[Jewish atheist]] who has trouble forming close bonds with other people, due to various mental and social problems. Though Mary's letter initially gives him an [[anxiety attack]], he decides to write back to her, and the two quickly become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and ''The Noblets''). Due to Vera's disapproval of Max, Mary tells him to send his letters to her [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] neighbour, Len Hislop, whose mail she collects regularly. When Mary later asks Max about [[Romance (love)|love]], he suffers a severe anxiety attack and is institutionalized for eight months. After his release, he is hesitant to write to Mary again for some time. On his 48th birthday, he wins the [[New York Lottery]], using his winnings to buy a lifetime supply of chocolate and an entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the rest of his money to his elderly neighbour Ivy, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying in an accident with a malfunctioning [[jet pack]]. Meanwhile, Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.\n\nOn the advice of his therapist, Max finally writes back to Mary and explains he has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]]. Mary is thrilled to hear from him again, and the two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires from his job at a teabag factory, he takes up [[metal detector|metal detecting]], but is soon swept away (and presumably killed) by a big [[tidal bore]] while on a beach. Mary ([[Toni Collette]]) goes to the [[University of Melbourne]] and has her birthmark surgically removed, and develops a crush on her [[Greek Australians|Greek Australian]] neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos ([[Eric Bana]]). Drunk and guilt-ridden over her husband's death, Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks [[Embalming chemicals|embalming fluid]] (which she mistook for [[Classification of wine#Other styles|cooking sherry]]). Mary and Damien grow closer following Vera's death and are later married.\n\nInspired by her friendship with Max, Mary studies [[psychology]] at university, writing her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her case study. She plans to have her dissertation published as a book; but when Max receives a copy from her, he is infuriated, believing that she has taken advantage of his condition, which he sees as an integral part of his personality and not a disability that needs to be cured. Feeling betrayed and unable to put his emotions into words, he breaks off communication with Mary (by removing the letter \"M\" from his typewriter), who, heartbroken, has the entire run of her book [[pulped]], effectively ending her budding career. She sinks into [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and begins drinking cooking sherry, as her mother had done. While searching through a cabinet, she finds a can of condensed milk and sends it to Max as an apology in an attempt to heal wounds. She checks the post daily for a response and one day finds a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her for his own pen friend, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand.\n\nMeanwhile, after an incident in which he nearly chokes a homeless man ([[Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum]]) in anger, for throwing away a used cigarette, Max realizes Mary is an imperfect human being, like himself, and sends her a package containing his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary, however, has sunken into despair after Damien's departure and fails to find the package on her doorstep for several days. Finding some [[Diazepam|Valium]] that had belonged to her mother, and unaware that she is pregnant with Damien's child, Mary decides to commit [[suicide]]. As she takes the Valium and is on the verge of hanging herself, Len knocks on her door, having conquered his [[agoraphobia]] to alert her of Max's package. Inside, she finds the Noblet figurines and a letter from Max, in which he tells her of his realization that they are not perfect and expresses his forgiveness. He also states how much their friendship means to him, and that he hopes their paths will cross one day.\n\nOne year later, Mary travels to New York with her infant child to finally visit Max. Entering his apartment, Mary discovers Max on his couch, gazing upward with a smile on his face, having died earlier that morning. Looking around the apartment, Mary is awestruck to find all the letters she had sent to Max over the years, laminated and taped to the ceiling. Realizing Max had been gazing at the letters when he died, and seeing how much he had valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy as she sits beside him on the couch.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Barry Humphries]] as the Narrator<ref name=mary />\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Mary Daisy Dinkle<ref name=mary>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993177.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2564 | first=Archie | last=Thomas | title=Philip Seymour Hoffman joins 'Mary' | magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=1 October 2008 | access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Bethany Whitmore]] as Young Mary\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Max Jerry Horowitz<ref name=mary />\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Damien Popodopoulos<ref name=mary />\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Geyer]] as Vera Lorraine Dinkle\n* [[Ian Meldrum|Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum]] as Homeless Man\n* Michael Ienna as Lincoln (uncredited)\n* [[Julie Forsyth]], [[John Flaus]], Christopher Massey, Shaun Patten, Leanne Smith and Carolyn Shakespeare-Allen as additional voices\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the opening credits, the film is based on a true story.
