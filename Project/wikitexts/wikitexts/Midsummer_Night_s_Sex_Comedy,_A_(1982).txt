It also marks the first appearance of Allen as an ensemble performer in his own film, as previously he had either been the lead character or did not appear at all.\n\n''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' received positive reviews and was a minor commercial success. However, it was nominated for one [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]], for Farrow&nbsp;&ndash; the only time an Allen film has been nominated for a Razzie.\n\n== Plot ==\nIt is 1906 in upstate New York.<ref name=\"arnold\"/> Distinguished philosopher Leopold and his much younger fianc\u00e9e, Ariel, are going to spend a weekend in the country with Leopold's cousin Adrian, and her crackpot inventor husband Andrew. Also on the guest list is womanizing doctor, Maxwell, and his latest girlfriend, a free-thinking nurse, Dulcy. Over the course of the weekend, old romances reignite, new romances develop, and everyone ends up sneaking off behind everyone else's backs.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Andrew\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Ariel Weymouth\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as Professor Leopold Sturges\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Dulcy Ford\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Dr. Maxwell Jordan\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Adrian\n* Adam Redfield as Student Foxx\n* Moishe Rosenfeld as Mr. Hayes\n* Timothy Jenkins as Mr. Thomson\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Reynolds\n* Sol Frieder as Carstairs\n* Boris Zoubok as Purvis\n* Thomas Barbour as Blint\n* Kate McGregor-Stewart as Mrs. Baker<ref name=nyt-jm>{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E2D8123BF935A25754C0A964948260| title=A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) A New Woody Allen| work=The New York Times| date=July 16, 1982| access-date=June 20, 2015| archive-date=June 20, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620045812/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E2D8123BF935A25754C0A964948260| url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Background ==\nAllen explained the inspiration for the film:\n{{Blockquote\n|text=I thought I wanted to do a film about poignant relationships, a film about a guy who missed an opportunity and was haunted by the thought and a girl who was about to throw in her lot with a much older man, not really the right one for her. The genesis was not a comedy but a kind of serious [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhovian]] story, in the style of ''[[Interiors]]'' almost. That serious of a thing. Then I started to think, God, it sort of cries out for a comic treatment\u2014a group of people at a summer house on a weekend and the silvery moon in concert with the animals and flowers. Why not take a comic approach to it? Let the seriousness be a subtext. So I started to write it, and it worked very rapidly for me. I started to take delight in it. You know, I hate the country, but I began wanting to create the country, not as I experience it but as I would like to.<ref name=\"arnold\">Arnold, Gary (July 16, 1982). \"Woody Allen, Inside And Out\".
