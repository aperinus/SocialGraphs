It stars [[Jon Voight]] as Billy Flynn, a former boxer who attempts to support his son ([[Ricky Schroder]]) and reconcile with his ex-wife ([[Faye Dunaway]]) by fighting in the ring again.\n\nThe film is the last featuring [[Joan Blondell]] to be released during her lifetime.\n\n== Plot ==\nEx-boxing champion Billy Flynn lives in the city of [[Hialeah]], [[Florida]], where he is trying to settle down as a horse trainer after giving up his boxing title. A boxer propositions that Billy enter a match with him in the future. Billy shows up at the gym with his son T.J., who calls his father Champ. When he learns the man has not arrived, Billy angrily storms out of the gym, leaving his son behind. T.J. later finds him drunk inside a bar. When he takes him home, neighbor Josie asks about his drunken state on the street, and T.J. tells her that Charlie and his friends bought him four beers as a celebration.\n\nThe next morning, Billy announces that he won $6,400 gambling and uses it to buy T.J. his own horse named She\u2019s a Lady. Lady is entered in a race, but suddenly collapses, scraping her leg. Annie, Billy's wife from whom he had separated seven years ago, had placed a bet on the horse and arrives after Lady's fall. Billy explains that he told T.J. that Annie was dead and that she had deserted them. Annie invites T.J. to her cruise ship.\n\nAnnie's current husband confronts Billy to convince him to tell T.J. that Annie is his mother. Billy tells him that because she was not there for T.J., he has no mother. Billy loses a gamble on T.J.'s horse and is told by Whitey to either give him Lady or $2,000 in cash. Annie gives Billy the money, but Whitey takes the horse instead. After assaulting Whitey in response and attacking anyone who tries to stop him, including a police officer, Billy is arrested and taken into custody, where he tells T.J. that he is to live with Annie. T.J. refuses to leave, and Billy slaps him in a fit of rage. At her home, Annie tries to comfort T.J., but accidentally tells him that she is indeed his mother. T.J. refuses to accept her as his mother, and Annie is distraught.\n\nWhen Billy is released, he hugs T.J. at a stadium and promises to never leave him ever again. Annie visits Billy and says that she wants him to explain why she wasn't there for T.J. After a fight, Billy allows her back into his life as a friend. To make amends with his son, Billy explains his promise to fight in the ring after Jackie warns him about his age and constant headaches, which could be fatal when boxing. Jackie reluctantly agrees to train Billy to fight again.\n\nThe night of the fight arrives. From his dressing room, T.J. sees that Billy's opponent is much stronger than Billy, but Billy wins the first two rounds. He later receives many blows to the head and is weakened. The doctor examines Billy during a break and explains that if Billy suffers more damage, the fight will have to be stopped. Billy continues to receive sharp blows but finds enough stamina to knock out his opponent. Billy faints on the way back to his dressing room, and he calls for T.J. to ask him if he is happy that his father won. T.J. replies that \"the champ always comes through.\" Billy then dies from his injuries. T.J., unaware that his father is dead, tries frantically to rouse him. Jackie tells T.J. that his father is dead. T.J. says goodbye to Billy and is embraced by Annie.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Billy Flynn (\"Champ\")\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Annie Phillips\n* [[Ricky Schroder]] as Timothy Joseph \"T.J.\" Flynn\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Jackie\n* [[Joan Blondell]] as Dolly Kenyon\n* [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]] as Mike Phillips\n* [[Strother Martin]] as Riley\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Georgie\n* [[Stefan Gierasch]] as Charlie Goodman\n* [[Mary Jo Catlett]] as Josie\n* [[Kristoff St. John]] as Sonny\n* [[Dana Elcar]] as Hoffmaster, an attorney\n[[Robert Redford]] turned down the lead role.<ref name=\"afi\" /> [[Ryan O'Neal]] signed to play the lead but wanted his son [[Griffin O'Neal|Griffin]] as T.J.

These movies don't mean to deal with the world as it really is, but as it should be, a place where there's no pile-up of emotional garbage too big that it can't be washed clean by a good cry.

In 1988, psychologists conducted a study involving more than 250 film clips shown to 500 people. The study concluded that the last three minutes of ''The Champ'', in which T.J. sees his father win his comeback fight and then die, elicited the saddest response from a majority of the subjects.<ref>{{cite journal | title =  The Saddest Movie in the World | author = Chin, Richard | journal = [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] | date = July 21, 2011 | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/The-Saddest-Movie-in-the-World.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Emotion Elicitation Using Films | author1 = Gross, James L. | author2 = Levenson, Robert W. | journal = Cognition & Emotion | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | year = 1995 | pages = 87\u2013108 | url = http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ucbpl/docs/48-Emotion%20Elicitation95.pdf | doi = 10.1080/02699939508408966}}</ref>\n\n=== Box office ===\nAt the American box office, the film performed modestly at first but went on to become MGM's greatest international hit in 14 years, grossing $30.4 million<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=champ.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=The Champ, Box Office Information|access-date=June 6, 2013}}</ref> in the U.S. and Canada and more than $35 million elsewhere, including more than $10 million in [[Japan]].<ref name=ww/> By September 1979, ''The Champ'' had registered as MGM's fourth-greatest success in its history.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=September 19, 1979|last=Pollock|first=Dale|title='Champ' Nearing $48 Mil In World B.O., Looms Biggest MGM Int'l Film in 14 Yrs.|page=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\nRicky Schroder won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best New Male Star of the Year in a Motion Picture.
