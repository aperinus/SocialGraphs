The ring bears a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[sun]] symbol, which, according to Juli, has the power to lead him to the woman of his dreams, whom he will recognise by a similar sun symbol. As Juli has the ring's counterpart, and as she is in love with him, she invites Daniel to a party that evening, hoping that they will meet.\n\nCurious, Daniel goes to the party and meets Melek ([[\u0130dil \u00dcner]]), a young Turkish woman who is wearing a [[T-shirt]] imprinted with a sun symbol. Convinced that she is the woman of his dreams, Daniel talks to her. Melek is only passing through and looking for a place to spend the night. After spending the evening together seeing the sights of [[Hamburg]], Daniel invites her to spend the night in his apartment.\n\nDaniel and Melek leave the party just as Juli arrives. She sees them leave together. In her disappointment, she decides to leave town. Next day she goes to the [[Autobahn]] to [[hitchhike|hitch]] a ride, with no predetermined destination.\n\nAs [[destiny|fate]] would have it, Daniel is the first car to stop, on his way back from the [[Hamburg Airport|airport]], where he has just dropped Melek off. He has decided to drive to [[Istanbul]] in search of Melek, who, as she told him, will be under the bridge over the [[Bosporus]] at a certain time a few days later, although he does not know why. Daniel takes Juli with him in his stoner roommate's rusty old car. And this is the beginning a long and exciting trip across a scorching hot [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\n==Symbolism==\nThe film opens with an eclipse, an event in which the sun and the moon cross paths.  Daniel crosses paths with Luna, whose name means \"moon,\" and suffers the consequences.  July is a sunny month.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Daniel Bannier\n* [[Christiane Paul]] as Juli\n* [[\u0130dil \u00dcner]] as Melek\n* [[Mehmet Kurtulu\u015f]] as \u0130sa\n* [[Jochen Nickel]] as Leo\n* [[Branka Kati\u0107]] as Luna\n* [[Birol \u00dcnel]] as Club Doyen\n* [[Sandra Borgmann]] as  Marion\n* [[Ernest Hausmann]] as Kodjo, Daniel's neighbour\n* [[G\u00e1bor Salinger]] as Jewellery vendor in Hungarian market\n* [[Cem Ak\u0131n]] as Turkish border guard\n* [[Fatih Ak\u0131n]] as Romanian border guard\n* [[S\u00e1ndor Bad\u00e1r]] as Alin\n* [[Daniel Puente Encina]] as singer and musician.
