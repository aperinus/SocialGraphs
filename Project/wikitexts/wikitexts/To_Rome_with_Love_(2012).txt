The film is set in Rome, Italy; it was released in Italian theaters on April 13, 2012,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Eric J.|last=Lyman|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-to-rome-with-love-italian-premiere-312013|title=Woody Allen's ''To Rome With Love'' Draws Mixed Response in Italy at World Premiere|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 13, 2012|access-date=April 17, 2020|archive-date=September 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916192554/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-to-rome-with-love-italian-premiere-312013|url-status=live}}</ref> and opened in Los Angeles and New York City on June 22, 2012.<ref name=\"NYT Review\" />\n\nThe film features an [[ensemble cast]], including Allen himself. The story is told in four [[Anthology film|separate vignettes]]: a clerk who wakes up to find himself a celebrity, an architect who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student, a young couple on their honeymoon, and an Italian funeral director whose uncanny singing ability enraptures his soon to be in-law, an American opera director.\n\n==Plot==\n===Hayley's Story===\nAmerican tourist Hayley becomes engaged to lawyer Michelangelo while spending a summer in Rome. Hayley's parents, Jerry and Phyllis, fly to Italy to meet her fianc\u00e9. During the visit, Michelangelo's mortician father Giancarlo sings in the shower and Jerry, a retired\u2014and critically reviled\u2014opera director, feels inspired to bring his gift to the public. Giancarlo is convinced by Jerry to audition in front of a room of opera bigwigs but performs poorly in this setting.\n\nJerry then realizes that Giancarlo's talent is tied to the comfort and freedom he feels in the shower. He stages a concert in which Giancarlo performs at the [[Teatro dell'Opera]] while actually washing himself onstage in a shower. This is a great success, so Jerry and Giancarlo decide to stage ''[[Pagliacci]]'' with an incongruous shower present in all scenes. Giancarlo receives rave reviews, but decides to retire from opera singing, preferring to work as a mortician and spend time with his family.\n\n===Antonio's Story===\nNewlyweds Antonio and Milly plan to move to Rome after his uncles offer him a job in their family's business. Before meeting Antonio's relatives, Milly gets lost in Rome and loses her cell phone. After ending up at a film shoot, Milly meets Luca Salta, an actor she idolizes. Back at her hotel, Anna, a prostitute, is mistakenly sent to Antonio's room.\n\nBefore he can clarify the misunderstanding, his relatives arrive. To save face, Antonio convinces her to pose as Milly. The group goes to lunch, and then, to a party. While there, Antonio talks to Anna about how pure Milly is. After discovering he was a virgin before meeting Milly, she seduces him in the bushes.\n\nMeanwhile, Luca tries to seduce Milly at his hotel room. Milly decides to have sex with him, but then an armed thief breaks in. Later, Luca's wife and a private investigator show up. Milly and the thief climb into bed and fool Mrs. Salta into believing the room is theirs while Luca hides in the bathroom. Once his wife has left, Luca runs off. The burglar flirts with Milly and she has sex with him instead. After returning to the hotel room, she and Antonio decide to return to their rustic hometown\u2014but first they begin to make love.\n\n===Leopoldo's Story===\nLeopoldo lives a mundane life with his wife and two children. Inexplicably, he wakes up one morning to discover that he has become a national celebrity. Paparazzi document his every move, wanting to know everything about him. Leopoldo even becomes a manager at his company and begins dating models and attending prestigious events. The constant attention wears on him, though. One day, in the middle of an interview, the paparazzi spot a man \"who looks more interesting\" and abandon Leopoldo. At first, Leopoldo welcomes the return to his old life, but one afternoon he breaks down, missing the attention.\n\n===John's Story===\nJohn, a well-known architect, visits Rome with his wife and their friends. He lived there some 30 years ago, and would rather revisit his old haunts than go sightseeing with the others. While looking for his old apartment building, John meets Jack, an American architecture student who recognizes him. Jack happens to live in John's old building, and invites him to the apartment he shares with his girlfriend Sally. Throughout the rest of the story, John appears as a quasi-real and quasi-imaginary figure around Jack and makes frank observations of events.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2012/06/woody_allen_s_to_rome_with_love_reviewed.html | title=To Rome With Love | author=Dana Stevens | date=June 22, 2012 | access-date=November 4, 2012 | archive-date=November 3, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103183851/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2012/06/woody_allen_s_to_rome_with_love_reviewed.html | url-status=live }}</ref> One day, Sally invites her best friend Monica to stay with them. Jack hits it off with her, and the two end up having an affair.\n\nJack, now besotted with her, plans to leave Sally, but decides to wait until she finishes her midterms. When that day comes, Monica receives the news that she has been cast in a Hollywood blockbuster. Becoming completely focused on preparing for the role, Monica forgets about traveling with Jack, who realizes how shallow she is. John and Jack later part ways. It is possible that John's whole experience was actually his memory of what happened to him 30 years ago. (It is loosely implied that Sally is now his wife.)\n\n==Cast==\nGrouped by storylines\n{|\n|valign=top|\n\"Hayley's Story\"\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Hayley, Michelangelo's fianc\u00e9e\n* {{ill|Flavio Parenti|it}} as Michelangelo Santoli, Hayley's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Jerry, Hayley's father and Phyllis' husband\n* [[Judy Davis]] as Phyllis, Hayley's mother and Jerry's wife\n* [[Fabio Armiliato]] as Giancarlo Santoli, Michelangelo's father\n|valign=top|\n\"Leopoldo's Story\"\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Leopoldo Pisanello, a clerk and temporary celebrity\n* Monica Nappo as Sofia Pisanello, Leopoldo's wife\n* Cecilia Capriotti as Serafina, a secretary\n* {{ill|Marta Zoffoli|it}} as Marisa Raguso, an interviewer for Leopoldo\n|-\n|valign=top|\n\"Antonio's Story\"\n* {{ill|Alessandro Tiberi|it}} as Antonio, Milly's husband\n* [[Alessandra Mastronardi]] as Milly, Antonio's wife\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Anna, a prostitute\n* [[Simona Caparrini]] as Giovanna, Antonio's aunt\n* [[Ornella Muti]] as Pia Fusari, a famous actress\n* [[Antonio Albanese]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/greta-gerwig-alison-pill-join-203353 |title=Greta Gerwig, Alison Pill Join Woody Allen Movie |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=June 20, 2011 |access-date=June 22, 2011 |archive-date=June 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623042310/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/greta-gerwig-alison-pill-join-203353 |url-status=live }}</ref> as Luca \"Luchino\" Salta, a famous actor\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as hotel thief\n* [[Roberto Della Casa]] as Uncle Paolo\n* [[Giuliano Gemma]] as hotel manager\n|valign=top|\n\"John's Story\"\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as John Foy, successful architect and Jack's acquaintance and adviser\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jack, Sally's boyfriend\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Sally, Jack's girlfriend and Monica's best friend\n* [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} as Monica, Sally's best friend\n* [[Lino Guanciale]] as Leonardo\n|}\n* {{ill|Cristiana Palazzoni|it}}, the [[TG3]] anchorwoman, is a real-life journalist of the Italian network [[Rai 3]].

Allen accepted, seeing the offer as a way to work in the city and \"get the money to work quickly and from a single source\". The four vignettes featured in the film were based on ideas and notes he had written throughout the year before he wrote the script. The vignettes featured in the film deal with the theme of \"fame and accomplishment\", although Allen stated that he didn't intend for them to have any thematic connection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Woody-Allen-Explains-Why-Annie-Hall-Hannah-Her-Sisters-Were-Disappointments-31531.html |title=Woody Allen Explains Why Annie Hall And Hannah And Her Sisters Were Disappointments |publisher=Cinema Blend |last=Eisenberg |first=Eric |date=June 22, 2012 |access-date=July 5, 2012 |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701233552/http://www.cinemablend.com/new/woody-allen-explains-why-annie-hall-hannah-her-sisters-were-disappointments-31531.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He initially named the film ''Bop Decameron'', a reference [[The Decameron|to the 14th century book]] by Italian author [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], but several people did not understand the reference, so he retitled it ''Nero Fiddles''.
