Initially, the [[British royal family|Royal Family]] regard Diana's death as a private affair and thus not to be treated as an official royal death, in contrast with the views of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and Diana's ex-husband, [[Charles III|Prince Charles]], who favour the general public's desire for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, [[Etiquette|royal protocol]] regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Peter Morgan]], directed by [[Stephen Frears]], and starring [[Helen Mirren]] in the title role of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref name=\"bas2009\">{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34\u201352|doi=10.1080/08989575.2009.10846787|s2cid=220313542|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref> The film's production and release coincided with a revival of favourable public sentiment in respect to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]], a downturn in fortunes for Blair, and the British inquest into the death of Diana, [[Operation Paget]]. Actor [[Michael Sheen]] reprised his role as Blair from ''[[The Deal (2003 film)|The Deal]]'' in 2003, and he did so again in ''[[The Special Relationship (film)|The Special Relationship]]'' in 2010.\n\n''The Queen'' garnered general critical and popular acclaim for Mirren playing the title role, which earned her numerous awards, namely the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]], the [[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]].

Less than four months later, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], is [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|killed in a car crash]] at the [[Alma Bridge]] tunnel in Paris.\n\nImmediately, her death presents problems for her former husband, [[Charles III|Prince Charles]], and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Tony Blair, to accord the mother of a future king who is no longer a member of the royal family. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] wonders if Blair will turn his modernisation pledge on to the royal family since he attempts to have her reconsider her views on the funeral plans. Diana's family, [[Spencer family|the Spencers]], calls for the funeral to be private.\n\nIn the press, Diana is dubbed the \"People's Princess\"; this begins an outpouring of grief by the general public in broadcasts, and displays of floral tributes so numerous at [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham]] and [[Kensington Palace]]s that the main entrances onto the complexes have to be rerouted. The royal family's senior members make no effort to acknowledge Diana's significance to society and remain on holiday at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]]. The royal family's popularity plummets, while Blair's approval rises as he responds to the royal family's public outcry of inaction.\n\nBlair's attempts to guide the royal family through the controversy are met with resistance: the Queen describes them as a surrender to public hysteria. Despite the Queen and Prince Philip's indignation toward any sympathy toward Diana or acknowledgment of the country's mourning, he is encouraged by the private secretaries of both the Prince of Wales and the Queen to continue with his attempts to change the attitude of the royal family. As Britain continues its outpouring of grief, Blair attempts to defend the royal family publicly, but his attempts are futile. Blair's compassion earns him overwhelming praise and adoration, while the royal family's indifference earns them fiery condemnation from the people. As Britain's outrage hits a critical mass, Blair cannot placate the Queen's refusal to acknowledge Diana and the public any longer, revealing to her that 70% of the country believes her actions are damaging to the monarchy, and \"1 in 4\" people are in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether. Blair adamantly insists that the royal family fly the [[Flags at Buckingham Palace|flag]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] at half-mast, that the Queen pay her respects to Diana, and give a public address consoling the country.\n\nAlthough she is demoralised by the country's reaction and the Prime Minister's suggestions, the Queen comes to realise that the world has changed during her reign. She and [[Prince Philip]] return to London, despite their disagreement. The Queen finally pays public tribute on live television to Diana's significance to the nation and society and can somewhat quell Britain's agony. The royal family attends the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|public funeral for Diana]] at [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\nAt Blair's next meeting with the Queen, they exchange views about what has happened since their last meeting, including the controversy surrounding Diana's death and the actions that followed. Then she cautions the prime minister that, just as public opinion has changed about how the royal family should react to a new Britain, so must he as he may very well find himself in the same position of changing public opinion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as [[Tony Blair]]\n* [[James Cromwell]] as [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]\n* [[Helen McCrory]] as [[Cherie Blair]]\n* [[Alex Jennings]] as [[Charles III|Charles, Prince of Wales]]\n* [[Roger Allam]] as [[Robin Janvrin, Baron Janvrin|Robin Janvrin]]\n* [[Sylvia Syms]] as [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]\n* [[Tim McMullan]] as [[Stephen Lamport]]\n* Mark Bazeley as [[Alastair Campbell]] \n* Michel Gay as [[Dodi Fayed]]\n* [[Douglas Reith]] as [[David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie|Lord Airlie]]\n}}\nThe film uses [[stock footage|archival footage]] of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]], [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]], [[Julia Somerville]], [[Martyn Lewis]], [[Trevor McDonald]] and [[John Suchet]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe screenplay was written by [[Peter Morgan (screenwriter)|Peter Morgan]].<ref name=\"sar15oct\">{{cite news|last=Sarris|first=Andrew|title=Sublime Queen Opens Festival with Mirren's Crowning Role|url=http://observer.com/2006/10/sublime-iqueeni-opens-festival-with-mirrens-crowning-role/|access-date=17 June 2013|newspaper=[[New York Observer]]|date=15 October 2006}}</ref> It was produced by [[Path\u00e9|Path\u00e9 Pictures]] and [[Granada Productions]] (ITV Productions).
