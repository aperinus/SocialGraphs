The film was shot in 1997 and released in 1998. [[Brendan Gleeson]] plays Cahill, [[Adrian Dunbar]] plays his friend Noel Curley, and [[Jon Voight]] plays Inspector Ned Kenny.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story of Dubliner [[Martin Cahill]], who pulled off two daring robberies but came into conflict with members of his gang and attracted attention from the police and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], and whose dealings with the [[Ulster Volunteer Force|UVF]] ultimately led to his downfall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Martin Cahill\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Noel Curley\n* [[Sean McGinley]] as Gary\n* [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] as Frances\n* [[Angeline Ball]] as Tina\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Inspector Ned Kenny\n* [[Eanna MacLiam]] as Jimmy\n* [[Tom Murphy (actor)|Tom Murphy]] as Willie Byrne\n* [[Paul Hickey]] as Anthony\n* [[Tommy O'Neill (actor)|Tommy O'Neill]] as Paddy\n* [[John O'Toole (actor)|John O'Toole]] as Shea\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Fitzgerald]] as Tommy\n* [[Ned Dennehy]] as Gay\n* [[Vinny Murphy]] as Harry (as Vinnie Murphy)\n* [[Roxanna Williams]] as Orla\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is based on the book of the same name by Irish journalist [[Paul Williams (media personality)|Paul Williams]], who is \"Special Correspondent\" for the ''[[Irish Independent]]''.\n\nDirector Boorman was himself one of Cahill's burglary victims. This event is dramatised in a scene in which Cahill breaks into a home, stealing a gold record and pilfering a watch from the wrist of a sleeping woman. The gold record, which Cahill later breaks in disgust after discovering it is not made of gold, was awarded for the score of ''[[Deliverance]]'', Boorman's best-known film.\n\nFilming was at various locations around Dublin, including [[South Lotts]] and Ranelagh. Although shot in colour, the theatrical release of the film was presented in black-and-white for artistic reasons, while an alternate version of the desaturated original colour print was subsequently made available for television broadcast and home video.<ref>{{cite web|title=The General (1998) - Alternate Versions|website=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120706/alternateversions|access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref> Asked why he chose to depict Cahill's life in black-and-white, Boorman later explained: \n<blockquote>I love black-and-white, and since I was making the film independently \u2014 I borrowed the money from the bank \u2014 there was no one to tell me I couldn't. If I had made ''[The General]'' for a studio, they wouldn't let me do that. The other reason, the main reason, was because it was about recent events and people who were still alive. I wanted to give it a little distance. Black-and-white gives you that sort of parallel world. Also, it's very close to the condition of dreaming, to the unconscious. I wanted it to have this mythic level because I felt this character was an archetype. All throughout history, you find this rebel, this violent, funny, brilliant kind of character. I wanted to make that kind of connection, and black-and-white film helps. Up until the middle to late '60s, it was a choice to film in black-and-white or color. But then television became so vital to a film's finance, and television won't show black-and-white. So that killed it off, really.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joshua|last=Klein|date=January 20, 1999|url=https://www.avclub.com/john-boorman-1798207985|title=John Boorman|work=AV Club|access-date=November 21, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Reception ==\n''The General'' was nominated for and won several awards, including [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics)|Grand Prix]] of the [[Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4909/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The General |access-date=2009-10-02|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 49 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087427-general/|title=The General (1998)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed \u00a31.6 million in the UK and Ireland, the second highest-grossing Irish film of the year, behind ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 December 1998|page=72|title=British biz at the box office}}</ref> In the United States and Canada it grossed $1.2 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=general.htm|title=The General (1998)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> for a worldwide total of at least $4 million.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring diabetes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0120706}}\n* {{mojo title|general}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{John Boorman}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:General, The}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:Irish crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish heist films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British heist films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about criminals]]\n[[Category:Films about The Troubles (Northern Ireland)]]\n[[Category:Films about the Irish Republican Army]]\n[[Category:Films about organised crime in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films set in Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Boorman]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
