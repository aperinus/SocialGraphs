Its plot concerns three [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacker]]s who find themselves taken captive and subsequently hunted by Mick Taylor, a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]], [[psychopathic]], [[xenophobic]] [[serial killer]], in the [[Australian outback]]. The film was ambiguously marketed as being \"based on true events\", while its plot bore elements reminiscent of the [[backpacker murders|real-life murders of backpackers]] by [[Ivan Milat]] in the 1990s and [[Bradley John Murdoch|Bradley Murdoch]] in 2001, both of which McLean used as inspiration for the screenplay.\n\nProduced on a $1.1 million budget, filming of ''Wolf Creek'' took place in South Australia; the film was shot almost exclusively on [[HDCAM|high-definition video]]. It had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2005. It was given a theatrical release in Ireland and the United Kingdom in September 2005, followed by a general Australian release in November, apart from the [[Northern Territory]], out of respect for the pending trial surrounding the murder of [[Peter Falconio]].<ref name=mercer/> In the United States and Canada, it was released on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2005, distributed by [[Dimension Films]].\n\n''Wolf Creek'' received mixed reviews from film critics, with several, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Manohla Dargis]], criticising it for its realistic and unrelenting depictions of violence.{{efn-lr|Both Roger Ebert and Manohla Dargis<ref name=dargis/> in their reviews of the film criticised the film's presentation of violence, with Ebert writing that he wanted to walk out of the cinema.<ref name=ebert/>}} Other publications, such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', praised the film's [[grindhouse]] aesthetics, with the latter calling its straightforward depiction of crime and violence \"taboo-breaking\".<ref name=\"timeout\" /> The film was nominated for seven [[Australian Film Institute]] awards, including Best Director (for McLean). In 2010, it was included in ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s list of the 100 best films of the decade.<ref name=slant/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Broome, Western Australia]], 1999, two British tourists, Liz Hunter and Kristy Earl, are backpacking across the country with Ben Mitchell, an Australian friend. Ben buys a dilapidated car for their journey from Broome to [[Cairns]], Queensland via the [[Great Northern Highway]].\n\nThe trio makes a stop at [[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolf Creek National Park]]. Hours later, they discover that their watches have stopped and the car will not start. After dark, a man named Mick Taylor comes across them and offers to tow them to his camp to repair the car. The group goes with him to an abandoned mining site several hours south of Wolf Creek. Mick regales them with tall stories of his past while making a show of fixing their car. He then gives the group water which causes them to fall unconscious.\n\nLiz awakens gagged and tied in a shed. She breaks free and hears Mick torturing Kristy in a garage, it is implied that Mick had sexually assaulted her. Liz sets the now-dismantled car on fire to distract him, and goes to help Kristy. When Mick returns, she shoots him with his rifle, the bullet hitting him in the neck. The women attempt to flee in Mick's truck. Mick stumbles out of the garage and shoots at them before giving chase. The women evade him by pushing his truck off a cliff before returning to the site to get another car. Liz leaves the hysterical Kristy outside, telling her to escape on foot if Liz does not return in five minutes.\n\nLiz enters another garage and discovers Mick's large stock of cars and travellers' possessions, including video cameras. She watches the playback on one of them and is horrified to see Mick \"helping\" other travellers stranded at Wolf Creek. She picks up Ben's camera and notices Mick's truck in the footage; he had followed them long before they got to Wolf Creek. She gets into a car but Mick appears in the backseat and stabs her with a [[bowie knife]]. Liz crawls out and he hacks her fingers off, then severs her [[spinal cord]], paralyzing her. He interrogates her as to Kristy's whereabouts.\n\nBy dawn, Kristy has reached a highway and is discovered by a passing motorist. He attempts to help her but is shot dead by Mick with a [[sniper rifle]]. Mick gives chase, prompting Kristy to take off in the dead man's car. Kristy sideswipes Mick's car into a ditch when he pulls up alongside and begins to get away, but Mick emerges and shoots out her back tire causing her in turn to drive into a ditch, rolling the car. She attempts to crawl away, but is shot dead. Mick bundles her body and the dead motorist into the back of his car and torches the car.\n\nBen awakens nailed to a mock [[crucifix]] in a mine shaft. He extracts himself and enters the camp in early daylight. He escapes into the [[outback]], but becomes dehydrated and passes out beside a dirt road. He is discovered by a Swedish couple who take him to [[Kalbarri, Western Australia|Kalbarri]], where he is airlifted to a hospital.\n\nA series of title cards state that despite several police searches, no trace of Liz or Kristy has ever been found. Early investigations into the case were disorganised, hampered by confusion over the location of the crimes, a lack of physical evidence and the alleged unreliability of the only witness. After four months in police custody, Ben was cleared of suspicion. The film ends with Mick walking into the sunset with his rifle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Jarratt]] as Mick Taylor\n* [[Cassandra Magrath]] as Liz Hunter\n* [[Kestie Morassi]] as Kristy Earl\n* [[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]] as Ben Mitchell\n* Guy O'Donnell as Car Salesman\n* Geoff Revell as Graham\n* Andy McPhee as Bazza\n* Aaron Sterns as Bazza's mate\n* Michael Moody as Bazza's older mate\n* Gordon Poole as Old man\n* Guy Petersen and Jenny Starvall as Swedish backpackers\n* [[Greg McLean (film director)|Greg McLean]] as Policeman\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration and screenplay===\nWriter-director Greg McLean wrote the screenplay for ''Wolf Creek'' in 1997.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} The original screenplay resembled a straightforward [[slasher film]], and McLean was ultimately displeased with the final product.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} After seeing media on serial killer [[Backpacker murders|Ivan Milat]], McLean was inspired to rewrite the screenplay.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} He later said in subsequent interviews that he crafted the character of Mick Taylor based on archetypal \"famous Australian exports\" such as [[Steve Irwin]], combined with darker national figures, such as Milat, a sadistic killer who murdered seven people in [[New South Wales]] between 1989 and 1993.<ref name=making/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"ryan\" /> McLean\u2019s revised script was significantly anchored in the character of Mick Taylor: \"The movie was really about, 'What would it be like to be stuck in this incredibly isolated place with the most evil character you can possibly imagine, who is also distinctly Australian?'\", McLean commented in 2006.<ref name=making/> Additionally, the July 2001 abduction of British tourist [[Peter Falconio]] and the assault of his girlfriend [[Joanne Lees]] by [[Bradley John Murdoch]] in the [[Northern Territory]] was cited as an influence.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Story: The Australian Outback Murder|access-date=26 February 2010|last=Bradtke|first=Birgit|url=http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/wolf_creek_true_story.html|work=Outback Australia Travel Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/wolf_creek_true_story.html|work=Outback Australia: Travel Guide|access-date=27 January 2015|title=The Wolf Creek Movie: the true story of a murder in the Australian Outback?}}</ref>\n\nThe film contains several oblique references to these crimes,<ref name=\"murdochuniv\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> including the setting of Taylor's mining camp, which is called \"Navithalim Mining Co.\", a [[wikt:semordnilap|semordnilap]] variation of \"Ivan Mila[h]t\".{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}}\n\n===Casting===\nJohn Jarratt was cast in the role of Mick Taylor after having a meeting with McLean; Jarratt would later recall being significantly impressed by the screenplay, and McLean knew \"within ten minutes\" of their meeting that he was the right actor for the role.<ref name=making/> Cassandra Magrath was cast as Liz, as McLean felt she had a \"relatable quality\" that the character required.<ref name=making/> Nathan Phillips was cast in the role of Ben; McLean had known Phillips prior, as they had met while preparing to work on a project that ultimately fell through.<ref name=making/> Kestie Morassi was cast as Kristy after a different actress had to drop out of the film.<ref name=making/> Incidentally, Morassi was scheduled to take a personal backpacking trip abroad when she was offered the role.<ref name=making/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater at Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Wolfe Creek Crater]] is featured prominently in the film]] \n''Wolf Creek'' was a considerably low-budget production, made for around A$1.4 million, with a minimal crew.<ref name=making/> Producer David Lightfoot stated that the filmmakers wanted to \"mak[e] a 5 million dollar film on a 1 million dollar budget\".<ref name=making/> The film was shot digitally on the [[HDCAM]] format and was mostly handheld (aside from a few static [[compositing|composite]] shots).<ref name=making/> Filming took place over five weeks<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:11:11)</ref> in Australia's winter months of 2004 almost entirely in [[South Australia]];<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:06:05)</ref> aerial shots of the crater, however, show the genuine Wolfe Creek crater.<ref name=making/> The film is set in a real location; however, the actual meteorite crater location is called \"[[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolfe Creek]]\", and is located in northern Western Australia. The sequences in which the three main characters ascend the edge of crater were shot on a nondescript hillside in South Australia,<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:26:10)</ref> while beachfront scenes in the first fifteen minutes of the film were shot in Adelaide, standing in for Broome.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:04:58)</ref>\n\nSeveral strange occurrences happened during the production. One particular location that was used during the shooting of the travellers' drive to Wolf Creek had not seen rainfall in over six years; however, once the crew arrived and shooting proceeded, it rained for three continuous days, forcing the writer, director and actors to incorporate the highly unexpected rainfall into the shooting script.<ref name=making/> According to McLean, the fact that it was raining and gloomy in an otherwise dry, sunny desert area gave the sequences a feel of \"menace\".<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:24:05\u201325:30)</ref>\n\nThe rock quarry where Mick's mining site is located was the site of a real-life murder, which stirred up controversy from the local residents who mistook the film as being based on that crime.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:45:19)</ref> According to director McLean and others, Jarratt went to extremes in preparing for his role as Mick, in a bid to emulate, as close as possible, the real-life serial killer [[Backpacker Murders|Ivan Milat]]: he spent significant time alone in the isolated outback and went for weeks without showering.<ref name=making>{{cite video|title=The Making of Wolf Creek Documentary|medium=DVD|publisher=Genius Productions|year=2006|work=Wolf Creek}}</ref>\n\nSince the film had a relatively low budget, many of the action scenes involved the real actors; for example, after running through the outback [[barefoot]] when her character escapes, star Kestie Morassi ended up with hundreds of thorns and nettles in her feet.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (1:26:40)</ref> During the shooting of Morassi's torture scene in the shed, her non-stop screams and crying began to discomfort and unsettle the crew; executive producer Matt Hearn said that the female members of the shooting crew were brought to tears by it, as if someone was actually being tortured.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:56:53)</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nThe original cut of ''Wolf Creek'' ran 104 minutes; however, 5 minutes of the film were excised in [[post-production]].<ref name=making/> The surplus footage in this cut included an additional scene at the beginning of the film after the party sequence, in which Kristy awakens in bed next to Ben at a beach cottage the following morning; this created a romantic subplot between the characters, and was cut from the film for \"complicating\" matters unnecessarily.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:07:32)</ref>\n\nThe other additional footage took place when Liz returns to the mining site after leaving Kristy behind; rather than immediately entering the car garage, as she does in the theatrical cut, she finds a revolver and fills it with cartridges, and then explores an abandoned mine shaft in order to search for Ben. She subsequently drops her pistol into the shaft, and climbs down inside to find dozens of decomposing bodies. This explains why, in the theatrical cut, the revolver disappears after she enters the car garage. According to McLean, this scene was cut from the film after [[test screening]]s because it was \"simply too much\", along with all of the other gruesome events that had taken place prior.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (1:18:09)</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Wolf Creek'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]], United States, on 24 January 2005.<ref name=getty>{{cite web|work=[[Getty Images]]|title=2005 Sundance Film Festival - \"Wolf Creek\" Premiere|date=24 January 2005|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/event/sundance-film-festival-wolf-creek-premiere-107659577#/greg-mcclean-and-nathan-phillips-during-2005-sundance-film-festival-picture-id116949558|access-date=15 April 2018}}</ref> Exactly one month prior to the film's Sundance premiere, [[Dimension Films]] acquired North American distribution rights for US$3.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Dimension up a scary 'Creek'|date=3 January 2005|access-date=14 April 2018|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/dimension-up-a-scary-creek-1117915676|author1=Dunkley, Cathy|author2=Harris, Dana}}</ref> It was subsequently screened in [[Adelaide]], Australia in March 2005, followed by screenings at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=screen>{{cite web|work=[[Screen Australia]]|series=The Screen Guide|title=Wolf Creek (2005)|url=https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/wolf-creek-2005/19891/|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\n''Wolf Creek'' was marketed in both Australia and international markets as being \"based on a true story\", though it is in actuality a composite inspired by several true crimes (including the aforementioned killings by Milat and Murdoch).{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}}\n\n===Box office===\nIn Australia, the film opened on 151 cinemas on 3 November 2005, excluding the [[Northern Territory]], out of respect for the pending trial for the [[murder of Peter Falconio]], an event which had served as a partial inspiration for the screenplay.<ref name=mercer>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Australia gripped by Falconio Mystery|date=16 October 2005|access-date=27 February 2010|author=Mercer, Phil|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4344690.stm}}</ref><ref name=puzzles>{{cite web|work=ABC News Australia|title='Wolf Creek' ban puzzles director|date=15 December 2005|access-date=26 February 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200512/s1531954.htm}}</ref> The trial for Falconio's accused killer, Bradley Murdoch, was still under way at the time, and for this reason the Northern Territory court placed an injunction on the film's release there in the belief that it could influence the outcome of the proceedings;<ref name=mercer/><ref name=puzzles/> Murdoch was eventually found guilty of murder on 13 December 2005.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}} The film earned [[Australian dollar|AU]]$1.2 million during its opening weekend,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/australia/?yr=2005&wk=44&currency=local&p=.htm|title=Australian Box Office, November 3\u20136, 2005|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> entering the Australian box office at number one.<ref name=aubo>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Wolf Creek (2005) - International Box Office Results - Australia|access-date=14 April 2018|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&country=AU&id=wolfcreek.htm}}</ref> It would go on to gross a total of A$4,560,118 domestically.<ref name=aubo/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was given a modest release on 16 September 2005 on 292 screens, and grossed \u00a31,722,870.<ref name=ukbo/> The film opened on 25 December 2005 in the United States on 1,749 screens, and grossed a total $16,188,180 at the U.S. box office over the following three months.<ref name=bom>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wolfcreek.htm#at |title=Wolf Creek (2005) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=9 March 2006 |access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> [[Box Office Mojo]] cites a worldwide gross of US$27,762,600 (A$35,172,500, as of 9 March 2006).<ref name=bom/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n!
