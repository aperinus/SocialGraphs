It relies primarily on [[archival footage|archival]] racetrack footage and home video clips provided by the Senna family, rather than retrospective video interviews, and has no formal commentary.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins with Senna's arrival into [[Formula One]] during the [[1984 Formula One season|1984 season]], briefly covering his time at [[Toleman]] and [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] before concentrating on his time with the British team [[McLaren]] \u2013 the association that brought his rise to global fame \u2013 and becoming a [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]].  The drama of this period of his career centers on his rivalry with his team mate [[Alain Prost]], and his political struggles with the then head of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]] [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], climaxing during the [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] and [[1990 Formula One season|1990 season]]s, when Senna and Prost were involved in controversial clashes which decided the drivers' world championship title, in 1989 for Prost and in 1990 for Senna.\n\nThe film portrays the increasingly complex dynamics and tumult that characterized Senna's years as world champion, his battle to improve his sport's safety, and his reactions as he witnesses accidents and eventually the death of Austrian fellow-driver [[Roland Ratzenberger]] the day before his own.  We see and hear through Senna's point of view that innovative computerization led in these years to the technological domination of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] cars, with Prost joining Williams and, in a fallout with Senna, refusing to be on a team with Senna anymore. The documentary reaches its finale as Prost retires and Senna takes up a champion driver spot with Williams, the Grove-based team in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]], just as Formula One rules change, disallowing computerization, and the Williams' cars undergo rapid reconfiguration that proves fatal.  In the culminating weekend of his life, at [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|that year's San Marino Grand Prix]], footage shows Senna under extreme stress, troubled as safety conditions reveal their weaknesses in one track accident after another over three consecutive days. [[Rubens Barrichello]] is injured in a crash during Friday qualifying, Ratzenberger is killed in an accident during final qualifying on 30 April, and at the start of the race [[JJ Lehto]] stalls and is hit at high speed by [[Pedro Lamy]]. The [[safety car]] is brought out, and when racing resumes, Senna [[Death of Ayrton Senna|crashes fatally]] on lap 7. The film concludes with the Senna family and his close friends from Formula One mourning his loss at his funeral.\n\n==Style==\n\"''Senna'' has no talking head interviews and no authoritative commentary\".<ref name=\"Moloney\">{{cite web |url=https://thesundae.net/2021/05/10/the-tragic-intimacy-of-asif-kapadias-archival-trilogy/ |title=The tragic intimacy of Asif Kapadia\u2019s archival trilogy |date=10 May 2021 |access-date=4 May 2022 | first = Ciara | last = Moloney}}</ref> It is a [[Collage film|collage]] of private home videos, public TV appearances, press conferences and races. \"Like the [[pop art]] movement decades prior, Kapadia takes existing elements of mass culture and transforms and recontextualises them\".<ref name=\"Moloney\"/> Kapadia was able to \"fashion Senna's story as a live action drama rather than a posthumous documentary.\"<ref name=\"Rose\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/02/senna-film-review |publisher=The Guardian |title=Senna - review |date=2 June 2011 |access-date=4 May 2022 | first=Steve | last=Rose}}</ref> The film \"delivers an unquestionably cinematic experience\", negotiating \"a diffuse line between reality and representation\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternatetakes.co.uk/?2011,7,309 |title=Senna: alternate take |date=2 July 2011 |access-date=4 May 2022 | first=Dario | last=Llinares}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nA special screening of ''Senna'' was held on 7 October 2010 at the [[2010 Japanese Grand Prix]], at the [[Suzuka Circuit]] in [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/news/view/post/192 |title=Senna screened at Japanese Grand Prix |publisher=Working Title Films |date=14 October 2010 |access-date=7 January 2012 |archive-date=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031033947/https://www.workingtitlefilms.com/news/view/post/192 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The official world premi\u00e8re was held at the Cinemark Theatre in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]] on 3 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/news/view/post/195 |title=Senna Premiere S\u00e3o Paulo Brazil |publisher=Working Title Films |date=4 November 2010 |access-date=7 January 2012 |archive-date=31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031032404/https://www.workingtitlefilms.com/news/view/post/195 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was released in Brazil on 12 November 2010 and the UK on 3 June 2011.\n\n===Home media===\nIn Japan and Brazil, the film was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on 21 and 24 March 2011, respectively.
