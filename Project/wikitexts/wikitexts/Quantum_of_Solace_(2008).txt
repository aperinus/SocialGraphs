It is the sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']] (2006). Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neil Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Paul Haggis]], it stars [[Daniel Craig]] as Bond, alongside [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]]. In the film, Bond teams with [[Camille Montes]] (Kurylenko) to stop [[Dominic Greene]] (Amalric) from staging a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in [[Bolivia]] to access the country's natural reserves. \n\nA second Bond film starring Craig was planned before production began on ''Casino Royale'' in October 2005. In July 2006, [[Roger Michell]] was announced to direct with a planned release for May 2008, but he left the project that October after there were delays with the screenplay. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis completed the screenplay by June 2007, after which, Forster was announced as Michell's replacement. Craig and Forster also contributed uncredited rewrites to the film's screenplay. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2007 and lasted until May 2008, with filming locations including [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Chile]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], and [[Wales]], while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film's title is borrowed from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story by Fleming. In contrast to its predecessor, ''Quantum of Solace'' is notable for citing inspiration from early Bond film sets designed by [[Ken Adam]], while it features a departure from tropes associated with [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]]. \n\n''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom two days later and in the United States on 14 November. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise for Craig's performance and the action sequences but was deemed inferior to its predecessor. It grossed $589 million worldwide, becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]] and the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, unadjusted for inflation. The next film in the series, ''[[Skyfall]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nImmediately following the events of ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', James Bond is driving from [[Lake Garda]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] in the trunk of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates White regarding the mysterious organisation [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. When White responds that their operatives are everywhere, M's [[bodyguard]] Craig Mitchell suddenly shoots one of the guards and attacks M. Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him; White escapes in the confusion. Searching Mitchell's flat in London, Bond and M discover Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]] named Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter foiling Camille's assassination attempt on Medrano by \"rescuing\" her, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, along with agent [[Felix Leiter]], strike a [[Nonintervention|noninterference deal]] with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British PM, is thrown off a roof by Bond after refusing to answer his questions. He lands on Greene's car and is shot dead by one of his men. Assuming Bond killed the bodyguard, M orders him back to MI6 for debriefing. When he disobeys, she revokes his passports and credit cards. Bond heads to [[Talamone]] and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene and they leave. The Bolivian police pull Bond and Camille over but discover Mathis unconscious in the car's boot. One of the policemen shoots Mathis before Bond kills both of them. Mathis dies in Bond's arms, urging him to forgive Vesper and himself.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is damaged by a Bolivian fighter plane. They trick the plane into destroying itself, skydive into a sinkhole and discover that Quantum has been secretly damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at a hotel, ''La Perla de las Dunas'', in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalize their agreement, and warns him to escape as the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] arrives.\n\nBond and Camille infiltrate the hotel, where Greene blackmails Medrano into signing a contract that will make Medrano the leader of Bolivia in exchange for the land rights, making Greene Bolivia's sole water provider at significantly higher rates. Bond kills the police chief for betraying Mathis, and after killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. Bond and Camille share a kiss, and she wishes him luck in conquering his demons.\n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], [[Russia]], where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who [[Honey trapping|seduces female agents with valuable connections]] and is indirectly responsible for her death. After saving Kabira's latest target, Corrine, who works in [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian intelligence]], Bond allows MI6 to arrest Kabira, unharmed. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice in the head and some engine oil found in his stomach. Bond admits that M was right about Vesper. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. As he walks away, Bond drops Vesper's necklace behind him in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]]. Craig's physical training for his reprise of the role placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Palmer |first=Martyn |title=The man with the golden touch |work=[[The Times]] |date=24 November 2007|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2900516.ece?token=null&offset=0 |access-date=25 November 2007}}</ref> Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film.<ref name=criminal/> He also practised speedboating and stunt driving.

Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure.

Montes asks Bond to \"let me know what it feels like\" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.\n\nIn a December 2011 interview, Craig stated: \"We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do.

Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', in a reflective review of the film in 2013, was positive. He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other ''Bond'' films run out of steam before the end, and included ''Casino Royale'' in this category.
