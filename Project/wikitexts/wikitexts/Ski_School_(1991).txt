They recruit hotshot newcomer, John Roland (Tom Bresnahan) to help them win an end-of-the-season skiing competition and also play a series of hilarious pranks on Reid and his cronies (especially, Derek and Eric) along the way.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dean Cameron]] as Dave Marshak\n* Tom Bresnahan as John E.
