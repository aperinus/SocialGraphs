Silvanito, the town's innkeeper, tells the Stranger about a feud between two [[Smuggling|smuggler]] families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers (Don Miguel, Esteban & Ram\u00f3n), and the family comprising the town sheriff John Baxter, his matriarchal wife Consuelo, and their son Antonio. The Stranger (in order to make money) decides to play these families against each other. He demonstrates his speed and accuracy with his gun, to both sides, by shooting with ease the four men who insulted him as he entered the town.\n\nThe Stranger seizes an opportunity when he sees the Rojos massacre a detachment of Mexican soldiers who were escorting a chest of gold (which they had planned to exchange for a shipment of new rifles). He takes two of the dead bodies to a nearby cemetery and sells information to each of the two groups, saying that two Mexican soldiers survived the attack. Each faction races to the cemetery, the Baxters to get the supposed survivors to testify against the Rojos and the Rojos to silence them; they engage in a gunfight, with Ram\u00f3n appearing to kill the supposed survivors and Esteban capturing Antonio Baxter.\n\nThe Stranger approaches Marisol, a woman whose family has been caught in the crossfire between the feuding families, to go with Ram\u00f3n, and for her husband Julio to take their young son Jes\u00fas home. He learns from Silvanito that Ram\u00f3n [[false evidence|framed]] Julio was a cheat during a card game and took Marisol prisoner, forcing her to live with him. That night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger rides out and frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house in which she is being held to create the appearance of an attack by the Baxters. He gives money to Marisol, urging her and her family to leave the town.\n\nWhen the Rojos discover the Stranger has freed Marisol, they capture and torture him; nevertheless, he escapes them. Believing he is being protected by the Baxters, the Rojos set fire to the Baxter home, massacring them as they flee the burning building. After pretending he will spare their lives, Ram\u00f3n kills the pleading John and Antonio Baxter. Consuelo, appearing and finding her family dead, curses the Rojos for killing unarmed men. She is then shot dead by Esteban.\n\nWith help from Piripero, the local coffin-maker, the Stranger escapes town by hiding in a coffin. He convalesces inside a nearby mine, but when Piripero tells him that Silvanito has been captured and is being tortured by the Rojos for information on the Stranger's whereabouts, he returns to town to confront them. With a steel chest-plate hidden beneath his [[poncho]], he taunts Ram\u00f3n to \"aim for the heart\" as Ram\u00f3n's shots deflect off until Ram\u00f3n exhausts his [[Winchester Model 1892|Winchester]] rifle's ammunition.\n\nThe Stranger shoots the weapon from Ram\u00f3n's hand and kills Don Miguel, Rubio, and the other Rojo men standing nearby. He then uses the last bullet in his gun to free Silvanito, who is hanging from a rope by his hands. After challenging Ram\u00f3n to reload his rifle faster than he can reload his own revolver, the Stranger shoots and kills Ram\u00f3n. Esteban Rojo aims for the Stranger's back from a nearby building but is shot dead by Silvanito. The Stranger bids Silvanito and Piripero farewell and rides away from town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Clint Eastwood]] as \"Joe\", the [[Man with No Name]]\n*[[Marianne Koch]] as Marisol\n*[[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] as Ram\u00f3n Rojo\n*[[Wolfgang Lukschy|W.

Even though [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] had begun to gear down production of such films, Leone knew that there was still a significant market in Europe for westerns.

Eastwood recalled that he \"remembered sitting there\" and saying, \"Boy, this would be a great western if only someone had nerve enough to do it, but they'd never have enough nerve.\" A few years later, after someone handed him the script for ''A Fistful of Dollars'', \"about five or 10 pages in\" he \"recognized it as an obvious rip-off\" of ''Yojimbo'', which he found ironic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Turan |first1=Kenneth |title=Eastwood says 'Unforgiven' could be his last western |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/427330404/ |access-date=21 April 2022 |work=[[The Paducah Sun]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=3 August 1992 |page=58 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n''A Fistful of Dollars'' was an Italian/German/Spanish co-production, so there was a significant language barrier on set.

Similar to other Italian films shot at the time, all footage was filmed silent, and the dialogue and sound effects were dubbed over in post-production.<ref name=\"Munn48\">Munn, p. 48</ref> For the Italian version of the film, Eastwood was dubbed by stage and screen actor [[Enrico Maria Salerno]], whose \"sinister\" rendition of the [[Man with No Name]]'s voice contrasted with Eastwood's cocksure and darkly humorous interpretation.<ref name=\"Commentary\">[[Christopher Frayling]], For a Few Dollars More audio commentary. Retrieved 25 January 2016.</ref>\n\n==Visual style==\n''A Fistful of Dollars'' became the first film to exhibit Leone's famously distinctive style of visual direction. This was influenced by both [[John Ford]]'s cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction perfected by [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his western, and so there are many examples of extreme close-ups on the faces of different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion, and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leone's meticulous framing of his close-ups.<ref>Frayling 2006. p. 100</ref> Leone's close-ups are more akin to portraits, often lit with [[Renaissance]]-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.<ref>[[Sir Christopher Frayling]], A Fistful of Dollars audio commentary (Blu-ray version). Retrieved on 15 September 2014.</ref>\n\nEastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name's distinctive visual style. He bought black jeans from a sports shop on [[Hollywood Boulevard]], the hat came from a [[Santa Monica]] wardrobe firm, and the trademark cigars from a [[Beverly Hills]] store.<ref>Munn, p. 46</ref> He also brought props from ''Rawhide'' including a Cobra-handled Colt, a gunbelt, and spurs.<ref name=\"Hughes5\">Hughes, p.5</ref> The poncho was acquired in Spain.<ref>Munn, p. 47</ref> It was Leone and costume designer [[Carlo Simi]] who decided on the Spanish poncho for the Man with No Name.<ref name=\"Hughes5\"/> On the anniversary DVD for ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', it was said that while Eastwood himself is a non-smoker, he felt that the foul taste of the cigar in his mouth put him in the right frame of mind for his character.

Although the two themes are similar, Morricone states that he used a [[lullaby]] he had composed before and developed the theme from that. He adds that what makes the two themes similar is the execution, not the arrangement.<ref>{{cite AV media |year=1989 |title=Viva Leone! |medium=Documentary |work=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962 expatriate American folk singer [[Peter Tevis]] recorded a version of [[Woody Guthrie]]'s \"[[Pastures of Plenty]]\" that was arranged by Morricone.

''The Films of Sergio Leone'' Scarecrow Press, 15 February 2008</ref> with Tevis claiming the tune and musical arrangements were copied for the music for the opening title \"Titoli\".\n\n\"Some of the music was written before the film, which is unusual.

Leone asserted that this rooted the origination of ''Fistful''/''Yojimbo'' in European, and specifically Italian, culture. The ''Servant of Two Masters'' plot can also be seen in Hammett's detective novel ''Red Harvest.'' The [[Continental Op]] hero of the novel is, significantly, a ''man without a name.''
