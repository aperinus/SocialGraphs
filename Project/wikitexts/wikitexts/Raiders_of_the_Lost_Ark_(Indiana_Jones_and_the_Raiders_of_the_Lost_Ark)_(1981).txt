It stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Karen Allen]], [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]], [[Ronald Lacey]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], and [[Denholm Elliott]]. Ford portrays [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]], a globe-trotting [[archaeologist]] vying with [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces in 1936 to recover the long-lost [[Ark of the Covenant]], a relic said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former lover [[Marion Ravenwood]] (Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Ren\u00e9 Belloq|Dr. Ren\u00e9 Belloq]] (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.\n\nLucas conceived ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the [[serial film]]s of the early 20th century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. Development on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' resumed that year when he shared the idea with Spielberg, who joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for set pieces and stunts for the film, they hired Kasdan to fill in the narrative gaps between them. [[Principal photography]] began in June 1980 on a $20{{nbsp}}million budget and concluded the following September. Filming took place on sets at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]], England, and on location mainly in [[La Rochelle]], France, Tunisia, and Hawaii.\n\nThough prerelease polling showed little audience interest in the film, especially compared to the [[superhero film]] ''[[Superman II]]'', ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' became the [[1981 in film|highest-grossing film of 1981]], earning approximately $330.5{{nbsp}}million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. It was a critical success, receiving praise for its modern take on the serial film, its non-stop action and adventure, and the cast, particularly Ford, Allen, and Freeman. The film was nominated for several awards and, among others, won [[54th Academy Awards|five Academy Awards]], [[9th Saturn Awards|seven Saturn Awards]], and [[35th British Academy Film Awards|one BAFTA]].\n\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is now considered one of the [[greatest films ever made]] and has had a lasting impact on [[popular culture]], spawning a host of imitators across several media, and inspiring other filmmakers. The United States [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1999. ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is the first entry in what would become the [[Indiana Jones|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]], which includes three more films\u2014''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom|Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008)\u2014a [[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles|television series]], [[Indiana Jones#Video games|video games]], [[Indiana Jones#Comic books|comic books]], [[Indiana Jones#Novels|novels]], theme park attractions, toys, and an [[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation|amateur remake]]. [[Untitled fifth Indiana Jones film|A fifth film]] is scheduled for release in 2023.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. 573 words as of 29AUG21-->\nIn 1936, American [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] recovers a [[Golden Idol|golden idol]] from a [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist [[Ren\u00e9 Belloq]] corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting seaplane. After returning to the United States, Jones is briefed by two [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] agents that [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] forces are excavating at [[Tanis]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and one of their telegrams mentions Jones' old mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis seek the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which [[Adolf Hitler]] believes will make [[Wehrmacht|their army]] invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.\n\nAt a bar in [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]], Jones reunites with Ravenwood's daughter [[Marion Ravenwood|Marion]]\u2014with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship\u2014and learns Ravenwood is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with [[Gestapo]] agent [[Arnold Toht]], who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion take the medallion and escape.\n\nTraveling to [[Cairo]], the pair meet Jones's friend [[Sallah]]. Sallah reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Toht's hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An [[imam]] deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the correct measurements for the \"staff of [[Ra]]\", an item used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly-sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Ark's resting place. They recover the Ark\u2014a golden, intricately decorated chest\u2014but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion\u2014whom Belloq has held captive\u2014are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark. Alongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]]. A German [[U-boat]] intercepts the steamer and seizes the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat.\n\nThe vessel travels to an island in the [[Aegean Sea]], where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. On the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark, but surrenders after Belloq deduces that Jones would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Ark's power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Jones' instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed. Back in Washington, D.C., the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Jones' insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for \"top men\" to study. In a large warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n |direction = horizontal\n |alt footer=Photos of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen |footer = [[Harrison Ford]] (left, in 2017) and [[Karen Allen]] in 2013.

Kasdan had been working as a professional screenwriter for only a month but Lucas agreed to hire him after reading his script for ''[[Continental Divide (film)|Continental Divide]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> In January 1978, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg spent about nine hours a day over three to five days at Lucas' assistant's house in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles]], developing Lucas' outline.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage2\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerSpitball\"/> Several ideas came from these discussions, including the boulder trap, the monkey in Cairo, Toht burning the medallion's imprint into his hand, and government agents locking the Ark away.<ref name=\"NewYorkerSpitball\"/> Kasdan realized Spielberg and Lucas had several [[set piece]]s in mind, but they were looking for someone else to do the hard work of piecing them together.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/>\n\nSpielberg hated the name Indiana Smith, believing it would remind audiences of the [[Steve McQueen]] character Nevada Smith. All three men agreed to use \"Jones\" instead.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerSpitball\"/> Actors [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]], and the [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] character were the basis of Jones' own.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Lucas wanted Jones to be a [[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]] practitioner and a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]], funding his lifestyle with the spoils of his adventures, but Spielberg and Kasdan felt the character was complicated enough being an adventurer and archaeologist.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerSpitball\"/> Spielberg suggested making Jones an avid gambler or an alcoholic, but Lucas wanted Jones to be a role model who is \"honest and true and trusting.\"<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"NewYorkerSpitball\"/> Both men felt it was important Jones be fallible, vulnerable, and as capable of comedic moments as well as serious ones. They intended he be someone the audience could relate to and idolize.<ref name=\"VanityFairSpielberg\"/> Lucas suggested Marion would have a romantic past with the much older Jones at the age of 11; Spielberg replied, \"she had better be older\".<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/>\n\nWhile Spielberg directed ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), Kasdan used his office to write ''Raiders'', taking inspiration from the early 20th-century serials, and adventure films like ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> He wrote Jones as an [[antihero]], an archaeologist reduced to grave-robbing.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> Kasdan wanted a supporting cast with their own unique characteristics and believed it was important these characters had a memorable impact.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> He described the hardest part of writing was explaining how Jones would fall into successive dangerous events and survive, and how he traveled between locations.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/> In August 1978, after approximately five months, Kasdan completed his first draft.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"GRAdarOverview\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\nSpielberg described the draft as good but too long; Kasdan and Lucas collaborated to trim and refine it.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The script was a globe-spanning tale set in the United States, Egypt, [[Greece]], and Nepal.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Several elements were cut, including a journey to Shanghai that would lead to a [[minecart]] chase and Jones using a [[gong]] to shield himself from gunfire, ideas later used in the prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984).<ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/> To his frustration, much of Kasdan's love story between Jones and Marion was trimmed, as were scenes showing the mutual attraction between Marion and Belloq.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> The screenplay was completed by December 1979.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\n===Development and pre-production===\n[[File:Frank Marshall Deauville 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A photograph of producer Frank Marshall|Producer [[Frank Marshall (filmmaker)|Frank Marshall]] in 2012. As well as producing, Marshall had a minor role in the film as a Nazi pilot.]]\nLucas wanted to fund ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' himself, but lacked the money.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> [[Lucasfilm]] offered the project to several [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] studios. They rejected it, in part because of the proposed $20{{nbsp}}million budget,{{efn|The 1981 budget of $20{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|20000000|1981}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} but also because of the deal Lucas offered.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> He wanted the studio to provide the budget, have no creative input and allow him to retain control of the licensing rights and any sequels.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> The studios considered this deal unacceptable.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> They were also hesitant because of Spielberg's involvement due to his having delivered a succession of films over-schedule and over-budget;<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/> his recent effort, ''1941'', was both over-budget and a critical failure. However, Lucas refused to do the project without Spielberg.<ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage2\"/><ref name=\"TelegraphRetro\"/>\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Michael Eisner]] compromised with Lucas, agreeing to his deal in exchange for exclusive rights to any sequels and severe penalties for exceeding the schedule or budget. Lucas reportedly negotiated a salary between $1{{nbsp}}million and $4{{nbsp}}million plus a share of the gross profits, though a separate report stated he received only net profits. Spielberg received up to $1.5{{nbsp}}million as director and a share of the gross profits.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"GRAdarOverview\"/>\n\nProducer Frank Marshall, who had experience on smaller independent films, was hired because Spielberg believed he would keep the film on schedule and budget. Spielberg also hired cinematographer [[Douglas Slocombe]] and production designer [[Norman Reynolds]] because he liked their previous works and his long-time collaborator [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] as editor.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Lucas served as a [[second unit]] director<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage4\"/> and the film's executive producer, along with his acquaintance [[Howard Kazanjian]], whom Lucas believed would be a disciplined influence and not indulge the filmmakers' larger ambitions. He also brought in his long-time collaborator [[Robert Watts]] as associate producer and production manager. Paramount mandated a filming schedule of 85 days; Lucas, Spielberg, and Marshall agreed on a self-imposed 73-day schedule. Spielberg was determined to avoid criticism for another schedule overrun.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\nSix months of pre-production began in December 1979.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> Spielberg preferred to spend a year in pre-production, but worked at a faster pace to keep the budget low.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Spielberg and Lucas were both simultaneously working on other projects.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Artists Ed Verreaux, Dave Negron, [[Michael Lloyd (special effects artist)|Michael Lloyd]], and [[Joe Johnston]] provided extensive [[storyboard]]ing, with over 80% of the script represented, equaling approximately 6,000 images. This helped Spielberg pre-visualize scenes and limit the time taken to set up shots. The script described the opening of the ark only as \"all hell breaks loose\", and the artists were tasked with envisioning what should happen. Each offered different aspects: spirits, flames, and weird light effects; Johnston was tasked with combining all three.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Spielberg also had miniature sets of larger scenes built to plan layouts and lighting, including the Well of Souls, the Tanis dig site, and the Cairo marketplace.<ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> They contained 1-inch tall figurines to suggest how many extras would be required.<ref name=\"NYTimesAD\"/> Among changes made at this stage, Spielberg abandoned his idea for Toht to have a mechanical arm that could be replaced with a machine gun or flamethrower.

The production could afford certain equipment only for a limited time, including a [[Panaglide]] camera stabilizer for smoother shots, and a [[Crane shot|camera crane]] for higher angles.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> To maintain the tight schedule, Spielberg said he \"...didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four... Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie.\"<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage5\"/>\n\nFilming began in La Rochelle, depicting the capture of the ''Bantu Wind'' by a Nazi U-boat.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"LucasFilmProduction\"/> Watts borrowed a submarine from the war film ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981) on condition it not be taken into deep waters.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> [[World War II]] German U-boat pens in La Rochelle represented the U-boat dock.<ref name=\"GRAdarOverview\"/><ref name=\"LucasFilmProduction\"/> An original coal-fired tramp steamer boat could not be found for filming, so an Egyptian boat found in an Irish port was decorated appropriately and sailed to France.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\nThe production moved to Elstree Studios by June{{nbsp}}30. Interiors included the scene featuring an imam deciphering the staff headpiece and the Peruvian temple.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EWOpening\"/> There were repeated delays while filming the Well of Souls scene: there were too few snakes, a lack of anti-venom, and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]]\u2014who was visiting Kubrick on the set of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' \u2014 called the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) about the treatment of the snakes.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> The interior of Jones' school was filmed at [[The Royal Masonic School for Girls]] in [[Rickmansworth]], near Hertfordshire; the exterior was the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in California.<ref name=\"UproxxLocations\"/>\n\n[[File:Sahara close to Tozeur (Tunisia).jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of sand dunes in the Sahara desert near Tozeur in Tunisia|The [[Sahara desert (ecoregion)|Sahara desert]] near the [[Tozeur]] oasis in [[Tunisia]] was the location of the Tanis dig site in the film.]]\nTunisia was used to portray Egypt.<ref name=\"CondeNastLocations\"/> Spielberg described this phase as one of his worst filming experiences: the temperature was often over {{convert|130|F|C}}, and over 150 crew members became sick with [[amoebic dysentery]] from the local food.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/><ref name=\"IndependentRichards\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> Spielberg was one of the few to remain healthy because he ate food and water he brought from England.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> Lucas also suffered a severe sunburn and facial swelling.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> The Cairo village was filmed in the city of [[Kairouan]].<ref name=\"UproxxLocations\"/> A day of filming was lost there because over 300 TV antennas had to be removed from the surrounding houses.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Budget constraints affected Spielberg's desire to have 2,000 extras as diggers; he had to settle for 600.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Stuntman Terry Richards, who portrayed the swordsman nonchalantly dispatched by Jones, spent weeks practicing sword skills for an extended fight scene. Ford was unable to perform for long periods while suffering from dysentery, and it was decided to shorten the fight scene significantly.<ref name=\"IndependentRichards\"/> The Sidi Bouhlel canyon near the city of [[Tozeur]] is where a rocket launcher-equipped Jones confronts the Nazis for the Ark. Lucas had used the canyon in ''Star Wars'' to portray the planet [[Tatooine]].<ref name=\"UproxxLocations\"/><ref name=\"CondeNastLocations\"/><ref name=\"TravelPulseLocations\"/> During the scene, a fly crawled onto Freeman's lip during his dialogue, but he continued to deliver his lines.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> Although it appeared to be eaten, Freeman clarified it flew away.<ref name=\"FreemanFly\"/>\n\nIn late September, filming moved to Hawaii for exterior shots for the film's Peruvian opening.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"UproxxLocations\"/> The Paramount logo dissolving into a natural mountain was an improvisation by Spielberg based on his own childhood habit of doing the same while making films; the mountain is Kalalea Mountain on the island of [[Kaua\u02bbi]].<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/><ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> Though the scene appears to be a single location, it was shot across 10 areas in Hawaii, including the [[Huleia National Wildlife Refuge]].<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/><ref name=\"CondeNastLocations\"/> It was originally more elaborate and longer, featuring an added betrayal by one of Jones' guides, resulting in a fight, and it had more dialogue; this was deemed unnecessary and removed for a tighter paced sequence.<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/> The cave's exterior was considered a perfect location, though a nearby pool was a mosquito breeding ground; even with anti-mosquito equipment the crew was bitten.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> The donkeys used for the trek suffered [[Lameness (equine)|lameness]]. It was difficult to find replacements, and eventually, a pair of grey donkeys were painted brown with colored hairspray and flown by helicopter to the [[N\u0101 Pali Coast State Park]] to finish the scene.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\nThe loosely detailed script led to much improvisation; where the script described three people talking in a room, in the film it would take place in a quarry alongside 500 extras.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> Scenes like the young girl with \"Love You\" written across her eyelids and Marion putting on a dress to conceal a weapon were also improvised.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> Allen believed the latter scene focused on her character seducing Belloq, undermining her loyalty and love for Jones. She and Freeman collaborated to develop the idea of Marion getting Belloq drunk instead.<ref name=\"40thannTHR\"/> Allen, Lacey, Freeman, and Rhys-Davies often spent time together between filming to talk and discuss their characters. Allen described Ford as a private person who would not discuss his character in detail, and it took her a while to adapt to his working style.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> Filming concluded in September 1980, after 73 days.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage5\"/> Lucas described it as the film he had the least problems with because of the lack of studio interference.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nPost-production lasted about two months and focused mainly on special effects and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] shots.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Spielberg's first cut was close to three hours long before he and Kahn re-edited it to just under two hours.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Lucas was happy with this edit, but later asked if he could shorten the ending. He and Kahn collaborated on the edit; Spielberg said he was happy with their changes.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/> The final cut of the film runs for 115{{nbsp}}minutes.<ref name=\"BBFC\"/> Marcia Lucas opined there was no emotional closure for Jones and Marion because she was absent following the closure of the Ark. Marcia is not credited in the film, but her suggestion led Spielberg to shoot a final exterior sequence on the steps of [[San Francisco City Hall]] showing Jones and Marion together.<ref name=\"UproxxLocations\"/><ref name=\"SyFyMarcia\"/>\n\nOther changes included the addition of a scene where the Ark makes a humming noise in the ''Bantu Wind'' hold and the removal of a scene showing Jones holding on to the U-boat periscope to follow the Nazis; Spielberg thought it looked poor and hoped the audiences would not care how Jones accomplished the feat.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> Lucas removed a scene of a man fainting at the sight of Indiana and Marion emerging from the Well of Souls because he thought the joke did not fit with the tone of the movie.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage1\"/> Shots of the [[Douglas DC-3]] in which Jones flies to Nepal were repurposed from the adventure film ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), and a street scene outside Jones' home was taken from ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]]'' (1975). Spielberg said it was cost-effective and only sharp-eyed viewers would ever notice.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage4\"/> Special effects supervisor [[Richard Edlund]] maintained the street scene was done with miniatures.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Raiders of the Lost Ark (soundtrack)|l1=Raiders of the Lost Ark ''soundtrack''}}\n\n[[John Williams]] served as composer for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. He said the music did not have to be serious for the film and was instead theatrical and excessive.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage5\"/> Williams spent a few weeks working on the Indiana Jones theme, more commonly known as \"The Raiders March\" that plays during the main character's heroic scenes. Two separate pieces were played for Spielberg, who wanted to use both. These pieces became the main theme and [[bridge (music)|musical bridge]] of \"The Raiders March\".<ref name=\"EmpireWilliams\"/>\n\nFor the romantic theme, Williams took inspiration from older films like the drama ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942) to create something more emotionally monumental that he felt would contrast well with the film's humor and lighter moments.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage5\"/><ref name=\"EmpireWilliams\"/> Williams used \"dark\" orchestral pieces to represent the actions of the Nazis, using the \"seventh [[Degree (music)|degree]] on the [[scale (music)|scale]] of the bottom\". He said this signified a militaristic evil.<ref name=\"EmpireWilliams\"/> To create something suitably biblical for the Ark of the Covenant, he used a mix of chorus and orchestra.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage5\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Design==\n\n===Stunts===\n[[File:Disneyindytruck1.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a 1930s-era Mercedes-Benz truck used in the film on display at Disneyland in California|A 1930s Mercedes-Benz 2.5 ton diesel truck used in the film on display at [[Disneyland]], California]]\nThe Peruvian temple interiors used in the film were life-sized sets.<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The giant boulder\u2014made of fiberglass, plaster and wood\u2014was designed to be {{cvt|65|ft|m}} wide, but this was reduced to {{cvt|22|ft|m}}, with the resulting prop weighing {{cvt|300|lb|kg}}.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"EWOpening\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Spielberg liked the effect and had its ramp extended to give it more screen time.<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/> The boulder was controlled by a steel rod concealed in the wall by rubber rock outcroppings.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Ford performed the stunt ten times for the different camera angles. Spielberg said he was an idiot for letting Ford do it, but it would not have looked as good with a stuntman concealing their face.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Ford performed as many of his stunts as was allowed throughout ''Raiders'', suffering various injuries.<ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/> The [[tarantula]]s on Molina's body would not move because they were male and non-aggressive. A female spider was put on his chest to encourage movement.<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/><ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/> Abandoned ideas for the temple included a crushing wall trap and a pit concealed by spider-webs. The golden idol also had mechanically operated eyes that could follow Jones.<ref name=\"EWOpening\"/> For the last part of the scene where Jones flees by plane, the first take ended in near-disaster when the plane crashed from a height of {{cvt|20|ft|m}} because Ford's dangling leg was blocking the aircraft's right flap.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\nFilming of the Well of Souls scene was delayed initially by a lack of snakes. There were 500\u2013600 snakes to use for close shots and some mechanical snakes for wider shots, but Spielberg wanted more. A request was made to snake handlers from around London and Europe who produced between 6,000 and 10,000 snakes in a few days.<ref name=\"timeSlambangPage1\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/><ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/> Afterward, they struggled to obtain anti-venom; with local supplies having expired, it had to be imported from India.<ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/> Many of the snakes were harmless [[grass snake]]s or non-venomous [[Pythonidae|pythons]], but the [[cobra]]s were positioned behind [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]] to protect the cast and crew.<ref name=\"40thAnnVariety\"/><ref name=\"40thannTHR\"/> The stage doors were kept open during filming for quick access to a waiting ambulance.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Spielberg recounted that Allen was so scared she could not scream on cue. He dropped a dead serpent on her to elicit a genuine reaction.<ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/> Allen said she got used to the creatures after 3\u20134 days.<ref name=\"WAPOAllen\"/> Animal handler Steve Edge donned a dress and shaved his legs to stand in for Allen at specific points.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Vivian Kubrick's complaint to the RSPCA about the perceived poor treatment of the snakes required production to cease while safeguards were added.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\nReynolds and production artist Ron Cobb created the BV-38 flying wing based on the [[Horten Ho 229]], the [[Northrop N-1M]] and the [[Vought V-173]].<ref name=\"FlyingWing2\"/><ref name=\"FlyingWing\"/> Constructed by the British engineering firm [[Vickers]], it was dismantled and shipped to Tunisia.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> It was not designed to be flight-worthy, only to serve as a source of danger from its propellers.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> The plane was abandoned in Tunisia and slowly dismantled over the following decade by souvenir hunters before being demolished.<ref name=\"FlyingWing2\"/><ref name=\"FlyingWing\"/> The fight between Jones and the German underneath the plane was mainly improvised; Spielberg had to restrain himself from making it too long as each new idea led to another.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/> During the fight, the moving vehicle rolled over Ford's foot and towards his knee before it was stopped. It took 40 crew members to move it off of him. He avoided injury through a combination of the extreme Tunisian heat making the tire soft and the ground being covered in sand.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Dysentery had left the production with a lack of stuntmen, and Spielberg had Marshall stand in as the flying wing pilot. The three-day shoot was one of Spielberg's more difficult scenes to film, and he was reported saying he wanted to go home.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/><ref name=\"LAWeekly\"/>\n\nSecond unit director [[Michael D. Moore]] filmed most of the truck chase. Spielberg had not used a second director before but agreed to it as the scene would take a long time to film being set in multiple locations. Moore completed wider shots where stuntmen stood in for Ford. He closely followed Spielberg's storyboarding but innovated a few shots Spielberg considered improvements.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Stuntman Glenn Randall suggested the scene of Jones traversing the underside of the truck.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Ford sat in a concealed bicycle seat attached to the truck underside when clinging to its front.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> One of the convoy cars going over a cliff was a combination of matte painting background and [[stop motion]] animation of miniature figures falling out of the car.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\n===Special effects===\n[[File:Ark of covenant replica.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of a replica of the Ark of the Covenant on display|A replica of the Ark of the Covenant on display in 2016]]\nLucas' [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) handled the film's special effects, under the supervision of Richard Edlund. The team worked on both ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and the dark fantasy ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> He felt special effects were a financially economical method of delivering a good film; as long as they were emotionally involved in the story, he said audiences would buy into even a poor special effect.<ref name=\"timeSlambangPage4\"/> Spielberg liked practical effects because he could regularly check the [[dailies|raw footage]] during filming, rather than waiting months for the completed [[Compositing|composite effects]].<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\nFreeman said he had no idea what was happening when he opened the Ark. He was told to imagine something coming towards him and to scream.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/> Special effects artist [[Steve Gawley]] created the Ark's spirits by suspending small robed puppets in a clouded water tank in front of a [[Chroma key|blue screen]]. They were shaken to create a natural movement that was composited into the live footage. A Lucasfilm receptionist, dressed in a long white robe, was suspended in the air in front of a blue screen for the close-up of the ghost. She was filmed moving away from the camera and the footage was reversed to create an inhuman movement. Her visage was composited with a skeletal model for the monstrous transformation.<ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/>\n\nFreeman, Lacey, and Kahler's death scenes were created using different models.<ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/><ref name=\"VanityFairToht\"/> A mold was made of Kahler's face; it was lined with bladders filled with air. Controlled by up to ten people, the air was removed to make the head shrivel.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Special effects artist [[Chris Walas]] sculpted Lacey's melting face using different colored layers of gelatin placed over a carved, heat-resistant stone skull. Propane heaters were used to melt the gelatin and filmed using a slower-than-normal camera so the effect appears to take place rapidly when played at normal speed.<ref name=\"VanityFairToht\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantToht\"/> Belloq's head mold contained a thin-plaster skull filled with blood bags and detritus. It was blown up using explosives, shotguns, and an air cannon. It took three attempts to get the desired effect.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> Belloq's death was considered so extreme the Motion Picture Association of America initially classified the film with an [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|R rating]] restricting it to those over the age of 17 without an adult. Flames were superimposed over the scene to conceal the effect.<ref name=\"MovieFone\"/>\n\nKasdan scripted detailed montages during the transition between locations, but Spielberg saved money by showing a map and an animated line traveling between destinations.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/> Skulls and rotting bodies made by chief make-up artist [[Tom Smith (make-up artist)|Tom Smith]] filled the Well of Souls catacombs.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> To get the monkey to perform a [[Nazi salute]], the trainer hit it on the head to make it touch the affected area. When this did not work, the filmmakers hung a grape over its head to encourage it to reach up; it took 50 takes to capture.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> A partially deaf rat was used for the scene of the ark humming in the hold of the ''Bantu Wind'', giving it a unique and unnatural head movement.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage4\"/>\n\n===Visuals and sound===\n[[Matte painting]]s were used to create more elaborate backgrounds: these included the establishing shot of Marion's Nepalese bar and the warehouse where the Ark is later stored, the latter painted by [[Michael Pangrazio]]. Spielberg disliked the painting of the [[China Clipper]] plane (by [[Alan Maley]]) as he did not think it looked real against the water they had filmed.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"Vishi\"/><ref name=\"SlashPangrazio\"/> Jones' attire\u2014a leather jacket and khaki pants\u2014was based on [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948) and [[Charlton Heston]] in ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954).<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"TheRinger\"/> Costume designer [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis]] dumped boxes of hats on the floor for Ford to try on. After picking the right style, she purchased an Australian model she aged with [[Fuller's earth]] and [[mineral oil]], and then scrunched beneath a bed. The hat allowed them to create a recognizable image even in silhouette.<ref name=\"TheRinger\"/> Designer [[Ralph McQuarrie]] was responsible for the Ark decorations.<ref name=\"SyfyArk\"/>\n\nSpielberg wanted a moodier [[film noir]] lighting style like in ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]'' (1935). In contrast, Slocombe wanted to make things brighter and used backlighting to create a greater depth of field; Spielberg preferred his changes. Slocombe often employed natural light, using solar position predictions to plot a scene's layout. Spielberg liked the beams of sunlight glimpsed through scenery and tasked special effects artist [[Kit West]] with using a smoke machine to create artificial sunlight shards. For the bar fight, Spielberg wanted pitch-black shadows on the wall, but the lighting required to achieve this would have shrouded the actors' eyes; he settled for subtler shadings. He also wanted to illuminate the Well of Souls with a lighting effect through the ceiling opening, but once this was sealed it no longer made sense. The flaming torches used in the scene did not provide enough light, so he opted to use an artificial light source. Spielberg noted Allen always looked beautiful in her scenes because Slocombe would spend twice as long setting up her lighting as he would Ford's.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/>\n\nSound effects supervisor [[Ben Burtt]] recorded the film's many sounds. The snake slithering is a mix of Burtt running his hands through cheese casserole and wet sponges being dragged across grip tape; the rolling boulder is a [[Honda Civic]] driving down a gravel hill; and the Ark lid opening is the sound of a [[Cistern#Toilet cisterns|toilet cistern]] being opened.<ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/> The Ark spirits are the cries of sea lions and dolphins filtered through a [[vocoder]]. Jones' revolver is the sound of a [[Winchester rifle]] firing, while his whip-crack was made by recording Ford using the whip.<ref name=\"MentalFloss20\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n===Context===\n{{see also|1981 in film}}\n{{ external media\n| float = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz4crpFaW4M ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' theatrical trailer] at YouTube\n}}\nBy the summer of 1981 (June\u2013September), the film industry had been in decline for over a year.

He described it as having refined the old serial films into their most perfect form for a modern audience.<ref name=\"NYTimesCanbyReview\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] called it a series of \"breathless and incredible\" adventures inspired by and celebrating childhood stories told in comic books and movies. He concluded the film was successful in its singular goal of entertaining, creating an adventure epic in the vein of ''Star Wars'', the [[List of James Bond films|James Bond films]], and ''Superman''.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Arthur Knight said a constant stream of thrills kept the film moving at a steady pace.<ref name=\"ReviewTHR\"/> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Stephen Klain called the film \"exhilarating escapist entertainment\". He continued that the film successfully balanced action, comedy, and suspense with mystical mythologies.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/> [[Michael Sragow]] described it as the \"ultimate Saturday action matinee\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\"/> [[Gene Siskel]] said it was as entertaining as a \"commercial movie\" could be, the kind of film that makes children excited about cinema.<ref name=\"GeneSiskelReview\"/>\n\n[[File:Paul Freeman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A photograph of Paul Freeman|Actor [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] in 2016.

He criticized the film's reliance on nostalgia and updating older films instead of innovating new ideas.<ref name=\"NewRepublicReview\"/> [[Pauline Kael]] was critical of the film, saying Lucas and Spielberg had thought like marketeers, in creating a film that would appeal to the broadest masses. Kael said though ''Raiders'' was a sophisticated update of older serials, avoiding cliches with clever editing, it was too focused on surpassing each previous action spectacle to the detriment of characterization or plot progression. She opined the failure of ''1941'' had made Spielberg too cautious, and scenes evidenced he was rushing and not achieving the best possible take as in his previous work.<ref name=\"PaulineKael\"/><ref name=\"PaulineKaelNYT\"/> Lucas later named a villain in his 1988 fantasy film ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' after Kael.<ref name=\"PaulineKaelNYT\"/> [[Dave Kehr]] said the constant rush between setpieces felt monotonous. He also criticized the story for allowing the hero to choose to rescue the Ark over his romantic interest on multiple occasions, believing it made Indiana Jones difficult to support.<ref name=\"ChicagoReaderReview\"/>\n\nThe principal cast was generally well-received. Ebert said the amusing and unusual characters elevated the film beyond just a technical accomplishment. He described Ford's performance as taciturn and stubborn character in the vein of Humphrey Bogart in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', but with the ability to laugh at himself.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> Klain said Ford's performance was \"riveting\", marking a major career highlight.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/> Canby described Ford and Allen as both \"endearingly resilient\".<ref name=\"NYTimesCanbyReview\"/> Ebert said Allen gives Marion a charming toughness.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> Knight appreciated Marion did not become idiotic when the male star was in danger. His review concluded the character was the definition of an [[Feminism|activist]].<ref name=\"ReviewTHR\"/> Sragow said Allen's physical performance made her every bit the equal of Ford, and her vitality provided a positive counter to Ford's deadpan performance.<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\"/> Kael was critical of many cast performances, feeling they were stilted and heavily scripted. She singled out Freeman for praise, however, for continuing his performance after a fly crawled into his mouth;<ref name=\"PaulineKael\"/> Freeman jokingly called it the best review of his career.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage3\"/> Klain called Lacey's Toht one of the most offensive Nazi stereotypes seen in cinema since World War II.

An intermediate rating between PG and R, PG-13, would not be introduced until 1984, in part a response to the violence of the Indiana Jones prequel, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom''.

''Raiders'' can be seen as a form of revenge for the Jewish people, showing the rejection of the Nazis by God.]]\n''Raiders'' can be interpreted as a Jewish fantasy about punishing the Nazis for [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=\"ebertGreatest\"/> Spielberg is Jewish, and the Ark is a Jewish artifact described as holding the [[Ten Commandments]] passed down to the Jewish people by God.<ref name=\"ebertGreatest\"/><ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> In biblical descriptions, the Ark is a gold-plated wooden box that must be carried with poles because it is too holy to be touched.<ref name=\"EmpireMacGuffins\"/> Although the Nazi regime persecuted the Jewish people, in the film, they needed to use a Jewish artifact to subjugate the world; however, the artifact was too pure and holy for them to touch and actively rejected them by destroying their symbol emblazoned on the Ark's transportation crate while leaving the crate itself unharmed. Eventually, it also destroys the Nazi forces that open it.<ref name=\"ebertGreatest\"/><ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> The Nazis are stopped by the literal intervention of Godly power that leaves the perceived protagonists unharmed.<ref name=\"AVClub1981\"/>\n\nIn another scene, Jones falls underneath a moving truck when its hood-ornament, a Mercedes logo, snaps, mocking Mercedes' involvement in aiding the Nazis.<ref name=\"ebertGreatest\"/><ref name=\"Mercedes\"/> Elizabeth Hirschman identified elements of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], believing the standard heroic quest was offset by the religious importance of the Ark, an item of [[Judeo-Christian]] belief. The image of God is one that is inherently on the side of the good, and the destruction of the Nazi villains draws parallels to [[Yahweh]] visiting [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues on Egypt]] for enslaving the [[Israelites]].{{sfn|Hirschman|2001}}\n\n===Cinematic homage and nostalgia===\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is a pastiche of cinematic history, inspired by and referencing many films. Spielberg stated explicitly the film is about movies and designed as a tribute to filmmaking.<ref name=\"timeSlambangPage3\"/> Alongside directly referenced inspirations like early 20th-century serials,<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"MovieFone\"/><ref name=\"GRAdarOverview\"/><ref name=\"timeSlambangPage1\"/> the film contains references to ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), the film noir ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955), the [[Samurai cinema|samurai film]] ''[[Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and the epic ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), among others.<ref name=\"NYTimesCanbyReview\"/><ref name=\"FSRHomage\"/> ''Citizen Kane'' is referenced directly in ''Raiders''{{'}}s last scene where the Ark is secured in a vast warehouse, a fate similar to that of the beloved childhood sled belonging to ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s principal character.<ref name=\"NYTimesCanbyReview\"/><ref name=\"McGee2011\"/> ''Raiders'' also references several of Lucas' own films: the translation of the German U-boat announcement is \"1138\", a reference to science fiction film ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971); and numerous nods to ''Star Wars'' including the characters of [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] appearing as hieroglyphics inside the Well of Souls.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"MovieFone\"/> Richard Crinkley recounted audience members of ''[[King David (film)|King David]]'' (1985) associated its use of the Ark explicitly with ''Raiders'' instead of its biblical origins. He deemed this an example of \"cinemate visual literacy\", an increasing number of people educated by visual media rather than text.{{sfn|Crinkley|1985|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nA common theme shared by ''Raiders'' and another 1981 film, ''Superman II'', is American security is at risk. These films are emblematic of their time and the contemporary fears of American citizens. The Nazi characters are based on a former threat to America, and like ''Superman II'', ''Raiders'' requires the intervention of a superhuman character to prevent destruction at the hands of enemy forces\u2014a character audiences can admire, but never possibly emulate. Janet Maslin argues the fantasy of these films and the larger-than-life characters are designed to satisfy audiences who do not want to reflect on the world around them.<ref name=\"NYTimesQueue\"/> Jones is striving to recover the Ark both to stop the Nazis but also for personal glory, but the film never dwells on the regular people around the world who would be affected by an invincible Nazi army.<ref name=\"NYTimesQueue\"/>\n\n''Raiders'' offers a counter to the American national embarrassments of its defeat in the [[Vietnam War]] (1955\u20131975), the political scandal of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] (1972), a [[Early 1980s recession|recession]], and the growing influence of foreign nations.<ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/>{{sfn|Hunter|2003}} The period setting of the film also presents audiences with a time tinged in romantic nostalgia and filled with the possibility for adventure.<ref name=\"NYTimesSerials\"/><ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/> Robin Wood wrote that ''Raiders'', ''Superman'', and ''Star Wars'' provide a familiar, comforting content using the nostalgic memories of the older serial films of which they are derivative, presenting an idealized vision of older traditional values. Wood opined the purpose of this was to subdue contemporary radical social movements eager for change.{{sfn|Yockey|2008|pp=32\u201333}} Jennifer Barker suggested ''Raiders'' offers audiences what they want, and does not challenge their values or beliefs as anything but correct.{{sfn|Barker|2008|p=173}}\n\n===Masculinity and colonialism===\nThe macho male action hero archetype of the era, conveyed by Jones, can also be seen as reinforcing traditional masculinity in the face of growing feminism. Describing the typical interpretation of this archetype, Latham Hunter said films such as ''Raiders'', ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' (1987), and ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988) evolve the [[everyman]] character into someone who can overcome impossible odds and promote American might.{{sfn|Hunter|2003}} Jones is an American hero who steps in reluctantly to save the world by overcoming almost exclusively foreign enemies.<ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/><ref name=\"TelegraphRetro\"/> Barker argued Jones is an individualist placed in opposition to a fascist or totalitarian regime, making ''Raiders'' a \"conservative serial fantasy\" film.{{sfn|Barker|2008|p=173}} Hunter believed this focus on masculinity was short-sighted, and these films succeeded because they offered escapism from reality, and presented an outclassed hero who reflected the audiences' own feelings of powerlessness.{{sfn|Hunter|2003}}\n\nJones has been criticized as a poor portrayal of an archaeologist and that his actions amount to theft.{{sfn|McGeough|2006|p=174\u2013177}} Archaeologist Winifred Creamer described Jones as the \"worst thing to happen to archaeology\" as he \"walks a fine line between what's an archaeologist and what's a professional looter.\"<ref name=\"NPRCreamer\"/> Kevin McGeough wrote that the archetypal film archaeologist in older films was never the hero, but often a subject to be saved or conquered by the actual hero. Jones is imbued with the self-reliance and physical competence of the traditional hero, but with an intelligence that is recognized and celebrated, setting him apart from older heroes.{{sfn|McGeough|2006|p=174\u2013177}} Even so, Jones is hunting the Ark, in part, for personal glory attached to its recovery. When given the opportunity to destroy it to prevent its misuse, Belloq calls his bluff and Jones backs down. Belloq suggests he is a skewed reflection of Jones, and only a small change would turn Jones into Belloq.<ref name=\"AVClub1981\"/>{{sfn|McGeough|2006|p=178}}\n\nIn her argument that the film is about [[colonialism]], Tatiana Prorokova identified Jones and the Nazis as all-Caucasian males invading foreign lands, belonging to people of color, to steal a local treasure for their own personal benefit.{{sfn|Prorokova|2020|pp=51\u201352, 56\u201357}} In dismissing the supernatural aspects of the Ark, Jones also dismisses its cultural significance, rendering it a prize to be collected for his sake.{{sfn|Prorokova|2020|pp=58\u201359}} As the hero, Jones represents the United States' unfettered right to protect the Ark from others. Although according to Lucas the character of Indiana is named after his childhood dog, Prorokova insists that the hero is named for the U.S. state of Indiana, a state named after wars against Native Americans by colonizers.{{sfn|Prorokova|2020|p=57}} ''Raiders'' is set at a time when much of the world lived under colonial rule, and the film presents the non-white characters either as subjugated by the Nazis and reliant on a white American for aid or as collaborating with the Nazis.{{sfn|Prorokova|2020|p=56}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' has had a lasting impact on popular culture. It is considered a [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of modern cinema, creating a film framework still emulated by other films.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage5\"/><ref name=\"DOGLegacy\"/> Spielberg has said he considers it the most perfect film of the series because he never wanted to modify it or change anything about it.<ref name=\"EmpireOralHistoryPage5\"/>\n\nFord's performance led to his casting in the 1982 science fiction [[Cult following|cult classic]] film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref name=\"TelegraphRetro\"/><ref name=\"BFIBladeRunner\"/> Kasdan became one of the most in-demand writers in Hollywood, and helped write Lucas' ''Star Wars'' sequel, ''The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980).<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesIndySummerWinner\"/> Despite opening new opportunities for Allen, she expressed disappointment with the film because her character was motivated more by her relationship with Jones and financial gain than with her father and his obsession with the Ark. She unsuccessfully lobbied for rewrites to address this and explore her character further.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/><ref name=\"WAPOAllen\"/> Even so, Allen affirmed that many women and girls had appreciated and been inspired by her character. Forty years after the film's release, Allen affirmed she still received positive feedback from young women.<ref name=\"40thannTHR\"/> Shortly after the film's release, [[Stanley Rader]] and [[Robert Lawrence Kuhn|Robert Kuhn]] filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers for $210{{nbsp}}million alleging the film was based on ''Ark'', a screenplay and unpublished novel by Kuhn. The outcome of this lawsuit is unknown.<ref name=\"NYTimesLawsuit\"/>\n\nThe film led to an increase in students studying archaeology, and many modern archaeologists have cited the film as an inspiration. Rhys-Davies said he had met over 150 lecturers, professors, and archaeologists who told him their interest in the field began with the film.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> The original Indiana Jones costume hat and jacket were stored indiscriminately after filming, at Lucas' [[Skywalker Ranch]], until 2012. Nadoolman Landis recovered the items to be exhibited as part of a Hollywood costume display at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.<ref name=\"TheRinger\"/>\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[File:Indy and Marion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A photograph of a man and woman dressed as Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood respectively at a fan convention|[[cosplay|Fans dressed]] as Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood in 2011 at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] International]]\n\nIn 1999, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film to be preserved in the [[National Film Registry]] for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.<ref name=\"NationalFilmRegistry\"/><ref name=\"NationalFilmRegistry2\"/> Assessing the film's legacy in 1997, [[Bernard Weinraub]], opined \"the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for 'general' audiences, probably began...\" with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. He continued, \"whether by accident or design... the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children\".<ref name=\"WeinraubNYT\"/> Lucas' frequent collaborator [[Gary Kurtz]] said that ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' marked the turning point where Lucas became convinced that audiences cared more about \"the roller-coaster ride\" than the story.<ref name=\"IGNKurtz\"/>\n\nSeveral filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' or cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]],<ref name=\"DOGLegacy\"/> [[Simon Kinberg]], [[Jon Turteltaub]],<ref name=\"EWCultural\"/> [[Dan Brown]],<ref name=\"InverseInfluences\"/> and Joe Johnston. The experience had an explicit influence on Johnston's directorial effort ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011), including character designs.<ref name=\"ASCMag\"/><ref name=\"DOGLegacy\"/> Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] released a black-and-white edit of the film in 2014, removing all the original sounds, intending for viewers to focus on Spielberg's staging and editing.<ref name=\"AVClubSoderbergh\"/> During the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was among the action films director [[James Gunn]] recommended people watch, and one of the 35 films recommended by ''[[The Independent]]''.<ref name=\"IGNGunn\"/><ref name=\"CovidIndependent\"/>\n\nThe film has inspired or been referenced in other media including film,<ref name=\"WAPOInspirations\"/>{{sfn|Schneider|2013}} television shows, and video games.<ref name=\"InverseInfluences\"/><ref name=\"WAPOInspirations\"/> Between 1982 and 1989, in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], children Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb made an amateur remake of the film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation]]''. Spielberg congratulated the trio on their accomplishment.<ref name=\"VanityFairAdaptation\"/>\n\n===Critical reassessment===\n''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is considered one of the greatest films ever made.<ref name=\"Empire500\"/><ref name=\"THRJun14\"/><ref name=\"LastingIGN\"/><ref name=\"ActionBFI\"/> As part of his ''[[The Great Movies]]'' series, Ebert said while the special effects had not aged well, they were perfect for this type of film. He concluded it was a \"whiz-bang slamarama\" made with \"heedless joy\".<ref name=\"ebertGreatest\"/> The [[British Film Institute]] called it one of the 10 greatest action films of all time, saying \"for all its barnstorming staging and [[Boys' Own|boy's-own-adventure]] larks, it's refreshing Indy's greatest foil comes in three dimensions{{nbsp}}... the hard-drinking, wise-cracking, upstagingly brilliant Karen Allen\".<ref name=\"ActionBFI\"/> A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' ranked it the thirteenth best film ever made.<ref name=\"THRJun14\"/> It is also listed in the film reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.{{sfn|Schneider|2013}}\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a {{RT data|score}} approval rating from the aggregated reviews of {{RT data|count}} critics, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The consensus reads, \"Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 85 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> In 2005, the [[Writers Guild of America]]'s (WGA) listed the film's screenplay as the forty-second greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on their 101 Greatest Screenplays list.<ref name=\"WGAGreatest1\"/><ref name=\"WGAGreatest2\"/> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' listed the film at number two on its 2008 list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, behind the 1972 crime film ''[[The Godfather]]''. They said, \"no adventure movie is quite so efficiently entertaining\".<ref name=\"Empire500\"/> In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) ranked ''Raiders'' number{{nbsp}}60 on its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] list recognizing the best American films. They reassessed to number{{nbsp}}66 in the 2007 anniversary edition.<ref name=\"AFI1997andAnniversary\"/> On the AFI's list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills|the 100 Best Thrills]], the film was ranked number{{nbsp}}10,<ref name=\"AFIThrills\"/> and the 2003 list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|100 Best Heroes & Villains]] ranked the Indiana Jones character as the number two hero, behind [[Atticus Finch]] from ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962).<ref name=\"AFIHeroes\"/>\n\nSeveral publications have ranked it as one of the greatest films of all time, including number two by ''Empire'',<ref name=\"Empire500\"/> number five by ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'',<ref name=\"TimeOutBest\"/> and number{{nbsp}}19 by [[MSN]].<ref name=\"BestofalltimeMSN\"/> It has also appeared on lists of the best action films, including number two by ''[[IGN]]'',<ref name=\"LastingIGN\"/> number nine by ''Time Out''<ref name=\"ActionTimeoOut\"/> (down from number two in an earlier ranking<ref name=\"BestActionTimeOut2014\"/>) and number{{nbsp}}11 by ''[[The Guardian]]''<ref name=\"LastingRecGuardian\"/> and ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\"LastingRecTelegraph\"/> ''IGN'' also named it the best action film of the 1980s.<ref name=\"IGNBest80s\"/> Rotten Tomatoes and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' have labeled it one of the greatest adventure films.<ref name=\"BestAdventureRT\"/><ref name=\"BestadventureEsquire\"/>\n\n[[Channel 4]] viewers in the United Kingdom ranked ''Raiders'' as the 20th best family film of all time in 2005.<ref name=\"BBCPublicVoteC4\"/> In the 2010s, ''Empire'' magazine readers named it the seventh-best film of all time,<ref name=\"EmpirePublicVote2018\"/> and it was ranked the sixteenth best film of all time, based on [[IMDb]] and Rotten Tomatoes user votes and critical ratings.<ref name=\"CulturalUserUSAToday\"/> Readers of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' voted it the number one summer film, ahead of competition including ''Jaws'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"LATimes2020TwitterVote\"/>\n\nA 2013 episode of the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' (\"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)|The Raiders Minimization]]\") argues that Jones accomplishes nothing in ''Raiders'', as the Nazis would have eventually found the Ark, opened it, and died regardless of Jones' actions. An essay by ''Esquire''{{'}}s Matt Pomroy agreed, with the caveat that Marion would have almost certainly died at Toht's hands, and the Ark would have been flown successfully to Germany on the Flying Wing and opened for Hitler, likely killing him. However, Jones' involvement ensures the Americans secure the Ark, preventing the Germans from using it.<ref name=\"EsquireHypothesis\"/><ref name=\"AVClubBigBang\"/>\n\n==Sequels and spin-offs==\n{{main|Indiana Jones|l1=Indiana Jones ''franchise''}}\n[[File:Sean Connery (1983).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A photograph of Sean Connery|Actor [[Sean Connery]] in 1983.

''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' was in development by 1982, while the original was still in theaters.<ref name=\"NYTimesSequel\"/> A narrative prequel to ''Raiders'', ''Temple of Doom'' follows Jones's quest to recover [[Lingam|sacred stones]] and liberate the slaves of a [[Thuggee]] cult leader. The film became one of the highest-grossing films of 1984 and broke box office records, but fared less well with critics who accused it of racism, sexism, and containing content inappropriate for child audiences.<ref name=\"TODCSM\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesTempleSuccess\"/><ref name=\"VICETOD\"/><ref name=\"NYTimespG13\"/>\n\nA narrative sequel to ''Raiders'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', was released in 1989.

It features the return of Allen as Marion Ravenwood and introduces [[Shia LaBeouf]] as her and Jones' son. The setting moved from the 1930s to the 1950s, pitting Jones against Russians to recover a [[crystal skull]].<ref name=\"SequelSyFy\"/> The film was a financial success but polarized critics and
