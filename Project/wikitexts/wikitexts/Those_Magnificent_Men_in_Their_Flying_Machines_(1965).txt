Directed and co-written by [[Ken Annakin]], the film stars an international [[ensemble cast]], including [[Stuart Whitman]], [[Sarah Miles]], [[Robert Morley]], [[Terry-Thomas]], [[James Fox]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Benny Hill]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] and [[Alberto Sordi]].\n\nBased on a screenplay entitled ''Flying Crazy'', the fictional account is set in [[Aviation in the pioneer era|1910]], when English press magnate Lord Rawnsley offers \u00a310,000 ({{Inflation|UK|10000|1910|fmt=eq|r=-4|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) to the winner of the ''Daily Post'' air race from London to Paris to prove that Britain is \"number one in the air\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/Those-Magnificent-Men-in-Their-Flying-Machines_1965 |title=Review: 'Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines' |website=Britmovie.co.uk |access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nA brief narration outlines man's first attempts to fly since the [[Stone Age]] inspired by a bird's flight, seen with footage from the [[silent film]] era, and man being represented by a \"test pilot\" ([[Red Skelton]]) encountering periodic misfortune in his attempts.\n\nIn 1910, just seven years after [[Wright Flyer|the first heavier-than-air flight]], aircraft are fragile and unreliable contraptions, piloted by \"intrepid birdmen\". Pompous [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] newspaper magnate Lord Rawnsley ([[Robert Morley]]) forbids his would-be [[aviatrix]] daughter, ardent [[suffragette]] Patricia ([[Sarah Miles]]), to fly. Aviator Richard Mays ([[James Fox]]), a young army officer and (at least in his own eyes) Patricia's fianc\u00e9, conceives the idea of an air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation and his career. With Patricia's support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper.\n\nRawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, and invitations are sent to leading aviators all over the world. Dozens of participants arrive at the airfield at the \"Brookley\" Motor Racing Track, where the fliers make practice runs in the days prior to the race. During this time, a wildly mixed international assembly of aviators begins rubbing shoulders with each other, most of them conforming to national stereotypes: The by-the-book [[Prussia]]n officer Colonel Manfred von Holstein ([[Gert Fr\u00f6be]]), who becomes the victim of [[French Third Republic|Frenchman]] Pierre Dubois' ([[Jean-Pierre Cassel]]) various pranks; the impetuous [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] Count Emilio Ponticelli ([[Alberto Sordi]]), who buys various aircraft from designer Harry Popperwell ([[Tony Hancock]]) and wrecks them in test flights; the unscrupulous British [[baronet]] Sir Percy Ware-Armitage ([[Terry-Thomas]]), aided by his bullied servant, Courtney ([[Eric Sykes]]); and the rugged [[United States|American]] cowboy Orvil Newton ([[Stuart Whitman]]) who falls for Patricia, forming a [[love triangle]] with her and Mays.\n\nAs the teams test their aircraft in the days before the race, Newton gets caught in the rigging of Sir Percy's plane, which crashes in the nearby sewage farm. Newton later stops the German's aircraft after its tail breaks off and runs out of control. This leads to Patricia falling for him even more and Mays to become more jealous. At a celebration in Brighton, Mays confronts Newton, sparking a fierce rivalry between them for Patricia's hand, just before [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] official contestant, naval officer Yamamoto, arrives at the airfield.\n\nAs Yamamoto is officially greeted, Patricia convinces Newton to take her flying and they race back to the airfield, followed by Mays and her father, who are intent on stopping them. Not long after taking off, one of the struts on Newton's plane breaks, and Patricia has to fly the plane while Newton repairs it with his belt. When Newton lands, Lord Rawnsley throws him out of the race. Patricia apologizes to Newton, and Rawnsley gives in after she threatens to start an international incident. Meanwhile, Holstein, insulted by the French team's mockery, challenges Dubois to a duel. Dubois agrees, and opts for gas balloons and blunderbusses as his weapons of choice. Both balloons and their pilots end up in the filthy waters of the adjacent sewage farm.\n\nAt the party the night before the race, Sir Percy sabotages Yamamoto and Newton's planes, and Rumpelstoss, the German pilot, is incapacitated by a [[laxative]] meant for Yamamoto. As the competitors take off the next day, with Holstein standing in for Rumpelstoss, Yamamoto's aircraft crashes and he remains pinned in the wreck for some time, as spectators are unwilling to give him a knife to cut himself free due to fears that he will commit [[seppuku]]. Fuel blockages and other technical mishaps additionally hamper the fliers, until most of them safely arrive at [[Dover]], their checkpoint before the final flight across the [[English Channel]].\n\nThat night, Sir Percy cheats by having his aircraft taken across by boat, but is delayed by excited locals when he arrives. Most other contestants, including Holstein, crash-land in the Channel. Sir Percy gets his comeuppance when he becomes disoriented by the smoke from a locomotive between [[Calais]] and Paris, causing him to jam his landing gear between two of the train cars. As he runs along the top trying to get the driver's attention, the train passes through a tunnel, wrecking his aircraft.\n\nComing into Paris, Ponticelli's plane catches fire, and Newton slows down to rescue him as Mays is landing, winning for Britain. Mays recognises Newton's heroism and shares the glory and the prize with him, while Ponticelli agrees to give up flying for his family. The only other successful aviator is Dubois, completing his race for France. Patricia finally chooses Newton, breaking the love triangle. Their kiss is interrupted by a strange noise: they and the others at the field look up to see a flyover by six [[English Electric Lightning]] jet fighters, as the time period leaps forward to the \"present\" (1965).\n\nOutlined are the still-persisting hazards of modern flying despite today's advanced technology, as a night-time civilian flight across the English Channel is cancelled owing to heavy fog. One of the delayed passengers (Skelton) gets the idea of learning to fly under his own power, perpetuating man's pioneering spirit.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as Orvil Newton\n* [[Sarah Miles]] as Patricia Rawnsley\n* [[James Fox]] as Richard Mays\n* [[Alberto Sordi]] as Count Emilio Ponticelli\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Lord Rawnsley\n* [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] as Colonel Manfred von Holstein\n* [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] as Pierre Dubois\n* [[Irina Demick]] as Brigitte/Ingrid/Marlene/Fran\u00e7oise/Yvette/Betty\n* [[Red Skelton]] as Neanderthal Man, Roman birdman, Middle Ages inventor, Victorian-era pilot, Rocket pack inventor, Modern airline passenger\n* [[Terry-Thomas]] as Sir Percy Ware-Armitage\n* [[Eric Sykes]] as Courtney\n* [[Benny Hill]] as Fire Chief Perkins\n* [[Y\u016bjir\u014d Ishihara]] as Yamamoto\n* [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Flora Robson]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Karl Michael Vogler]] as Captain Rumpelstoss\n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as George Gruber\n* [[Tony Hancock]] as Harry Popperwell\n* [[Eric Barker]] as French Postman\n* [[Maurice Denham]] as Trawler Skipper\n* [[Fred Emney]] as Colonel\n* [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as MacDougal\n* [[Davy Kaye]] as Jean, Chief mechanic for Pierre Dubois\n* [[John Le Mesurier]] as French Painter\n* [[Jeremy Lloyd]] as Lieutenant Parsons\n* [[Zena Marshall]] as Countess Sophia Ponticelli\n* [[Millicent Martin]] as Air Hostess\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] as Italian Mayor\n* [[Marjorie Rhodes]] as Waitress\n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Assistant Fire Chief\n* [[Willie Rushton]] as Tremayne Gascoyne\n* [[Graham Stark]] as Fireman\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] as Photographer\n* [[Michael Trubshawe]] as Niven, Lord Rawnsley's aide\n* [[Cicely Courtneidge]] as Colonel's Wife\n* [[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Reporter\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as French Official\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as French Team Member\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as the voice of the narrator{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\nDirector Ken Annakin had been interested in aviation from his early years when pioneering aviator, [[Alan Cobham|Sir Alan Cobham]] took him up in a flight in a [[biplane]]. Later in the [[Second World War]], Annakin had served in the RAF when he had begun his career in film documentaries. In 1963, with co-writer Jack Davies, Annakin had been working on an adventure film about transatlantic flights when the producer's bankruptcy aborted the production. Fresh from his role as director of the British exterior segments in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), Annakin suggested an event from early aviation to [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], his producer on ''The Longest Day''.<ref name=\"DVD 1\"/>{{#tag:ref|Annakin was born in 1914, just as the era of aviation depicted in this film was ending, and although the film is a farce, the behaviour of the various aviators depicts the tensions between the European countries prior to the [[First World War]]. This sense of civility between European nationalities is remembered as the [[Entente cordiale]].<ref name=\"DVD\"/>|group=Note}}\n\nZanuck financed an epic faithful to the era, with a \u00a3100,000 stake, deciding on the name, ''Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines'' after [[Elmo Williams]], managing director of 20th Century Fox in Europe, told him his wife Lorraine Williams had written an opening for a song that Annakin complained would \"seal the fate of the movie\":<blockquote>Those magnificent men in their flying machines,<br/>They go up, Tiddley up, up,<br/>They go down, Tiddley down, down.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Richard |url=http://www.lyricszoo.com/richard-kaufman/those-magnificent-men-in-their-flying-machines-ron-goodwin/ |title=Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines: Ron Goodwin Lyrics |website=Lyricszoo |access-date=11 May 2013}}</ref></blockquote> After being put to music by [[Ron Goodwin]], the \"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\" song was released as a single in 1965 on the [[Stateside Records|Stateside]] label (SS 422), together with an accompanying soundtrack album (SL 10136).<ref>{{cite web |last=Lysy |first=Craig |url=http://moviemusicuk.us/2011/03/24/those-magnificent-men-in-their-flying-machines-ron-goodwin/ |title=Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines \u2013 Ron Goodwin |website=Movie Music UK |date=24 March 2011 |access-date=8 May 2013}}{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn international cast plays the array of contestants with the film opening with a brief, comic prologue on the history of flight, narrated by [[James Robertson Justice]] and featuring American comedian [[Red Skelton]].<ref>Lee (1974), p. 490.</ref> In a series of silent [[blackout gag|blackout]] vignettes that incorporate [[stock footage]] of unsuccessful attempts at early aircraft, Skelton depicted a recurring character whose adventures span the centuries. The early aviation history sequence that begins the film is followed by a whimsical animated opening credit sequence drawn by caricaturist [[Ronald Searle]], accompanied by the title song.<ref name=\"Articles\">{{cite web |last=Carr |first=Jay |url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93028/those-magnificent-men-in-their-flying-machines-or#articles-reviews|title=Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=11 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n''Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&nbsp;...'' concludes with an epilogue in a fogbound 1960s London airport when cancellation of flights to Paris is announced. The narrator remarks that today a jet makes the trip in seven minutes, but \"it ''can'' take longer\". One frustrated passenger (Skelton, again) starts wing-flapping motions with his arms, and the scene morphs into the animation from the title sequence for the [[closing credits]]. This was Skelton's final feature film appearance; he was in Europe filming the 1964\u201365 season of his television series, ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''.<ref name=\"Articles\"/>\n\n[[File:Magnificent music.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ron Goodwin]]'s music plays an integral part in the film]]\n\nOne of the features of the film was British and international character actors who enlivened the foibles of each contestant's nationality. The entertainment comes from the dialogue and characterisations and the aerial stunts, with heroism and gentlemanly conduct. British comedy actors of the day, [[Benny Hill]], Eric Sykes, Terry-Thomas and [[Tony Hancock]], among others, provided madcap misadventures.<ref>Novick (2002), p. 75.</ref> While Terry-Thomas had a substantial leading role as a \"bounder\", Hill, Sykes and Hancock played lesser cameos.<ref>McCann (2009), p. 190.</ref> Although Hancock had broken his leg off-set, two days into filming, Annakin wrote his infirmity into the story, and his leg bound in a cast figured in a number of scenes.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nIn a [[Running gag|recurring gag]] suggested by Zanuck, [[Irina Demick]] plays a series of flirts who are all pursued by the French pilot. First, she is Brigitte (French), then Ingrid (Swedish), Marlene (German), Fran\u00e7oise (Belgian), Yvette (Bulgarian), and finally, Betty (British).<ref name=\"Articles\"/>\n\nAnother aspect was the fluid writing and directing with Annakin and Davies feeding off each other. They had worked together on ''[[Very Important Person (film)|Very Important Person]]'' (1961), ''[[The Fast Lady]]'' (1962) and ''[[Crooks Anonymous]]'' (1962). Annakin and Davies continued to develop the script with zany interpretations. When the German character played by [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] contemplates piloting his country's entry, he climbs into the cockpit and retrieves a manual. Annakin and Davies devised a quip on the spot, having him read out: \"No. 1. Sit down.\"<ref name= \"Munn\">Munn (1983), p. 161.</ref> Although a comedy, elements of Annakin's documentary background were evident with authentic sets, props and costumes. More than 2,000 extras out in authentic costumes were in the climactic race launch which was combined with entrants in the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]] being invited on set as part of their 1964 annual run, an unexpected coup in gaining numerous period vehicles to dress the set.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nA troublesome on-set distraction occurred when the two lead actors, Stuart Whitman and Sarah Miles, fell out early in the production.<ref>Miles (1994), p. 124.</ref> Director Ken Annakin commented that it began with an ill-timed pass by Whitman. (Whitman was married at the time, although he would divorce in 1966.) Miles \"hated his guts\" and rarely deigned to speak to him afterward unless the interaction was required by the script.<ref name=\"DVD 1\"/> Annakin employed a variety of manipulations to ensure the production still proceeded smoothly. The stars made peace with each other after on-set filming concluded; their interactions were civil during final re-takes of scenes and voice-overs.<ref name=\"DVD\">\"Director's Voice-over Commentary\".

For its first audiences the film's depiction of an international flight competition taking place in an earlier, lower-tech era offered a fun-house mirror reflection of contemporary adventures by Space Age pioneers.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Stuart Whitman]], the American lead, was selected over the first choice, [[Dick Van Dyke]], whose agents never contacted him about the offer.<ref name=\"DVD 12\" /> [[Irina Demick]] was rumored to be romantically involved with Darryl F. Zanuck, who had campaigned for her casting.<ref name=\"DVD bonus2\" />\n\nCharacter actor [[Michael Trubshawe]] and [[David Niven]] served together in the [[Highland Light Infantry]] during the Second World War; they made it a point to refer to uncredited characters in their films as \"Trubshawe\" or \"Niven\" as an inside joke.<ref name=\"DVD2\" />\n\nJapanese actor [[Y\u016bjir\u014d Ishihara]] was [[Dubbing|dubbed]] due to his accent.

A circular, banked track was also built and featured in a runaway motorcycle sequence in the film. In addition, the field adjacent to the windmill was used as the location for a number of aerial close-up shots of the pilots. Hangars were constructed in rows, bearing the names of real and fictional manufacturers: [[Avro|A.V. Roe]] & Co., [[Bristol]]: The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, [[Humber Limited|Humber]], three [[Sopwith Aviation Company|Sopwith]] hangars, [[Vickers]] and Ware-Armitage Manufacturing Co (a British in-joke, as Armitage Ware was the UK's largest manufacturer of toilets and urinals).

The head technical consultant during planning was [[Air Commodore]] [[Allen Wheeler|Allen H. Wheeler]] from the [[Royal Air Force]]. Wheeler had previously restored a 1910-era [[Bl\u00e9riot A\u00e9ronautique|Bl\u00e9riot]] with his son, and provided invaluable assistance in the restoration and recreation of period aircraft for the film.\n\nThe camera platforms included a modified [[Citro\u00ebn]] sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a flying rig constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' (1955). The rig consisted of two construction cranes and a hydraulically operated device to tilt and position a model, along with 200&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m) of cables. Parker's rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further hydraulic platform did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette]] helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an overflight. However, for the majority of flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n==Aircraft==\n\nThe film includes reproductions of 1910-era aircraft, including a [[triplane]], [[monoplane]]s, [[biplane]]s and also [[Horatio Phillips]]'s 20-winged multiplane from 1904.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/phillips/Tech4.htm |title=Horatio Philipps and the Cambered Wing Design |website=The U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |date=2003 |access-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528011715/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/phillips/Tech4.htm |archive-date=28 May 2010  }}</ref> Wheeler insisted on authentic materials but allowed the use of modern engines and modifications necessary to ensure safety. Of 20 types built in 1964 at \u00a35,000 each, six could fly, flown by six stunt pilots and maintained by 14 mechanics.<ref name=\"DVD 1\"/> The race take-off scene where seven aircraft are in the air at once included a composite addition of one aircraft. Flying conditions were monitored carefully, with aerial scenes filmed before 10&nbsp;am or in early evening when the air was least turbulent, as the replicas, true to the originals, were flimsy, and control, especially in the lateral plane, tended to be marginal. When weather conditions were poor, interiors or other incidental sequences were shot instead. Wheeler eventually served not only as the technical adviser but also as the aerial supervisor throughout the production, and, later wrote a comprehensive background account of the film and the replicas that were constructed to portray period aircraft.<ref name=\"Wheeler (1965)\">Wheeler (1965).</ref>\n\nThe following competitors were listed:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n# Richard Mays: [[Antoinette IV]] (Aircraft number 8: flying replica)\n# Sir Percy Ware-Armitage: [[Roe IV Triplane|Avro Triplane IV]] (Aircraft number 12: flying replica)\n# Orvil Newton: [[Bristol Boxkite]], nicknamed \"The Phoenix Flyer\" and inaccurately referred to as a Curtiss (Aircraft number 7: flying replica)\n# Lieutenant Parsons: Picat Dubreuil nicknamed \"HMS Victory\" (Aircraft number 4)\n# Harry Popperwell: [[Dixon Nipper]] \"Little Fiddler\" (Aircraft number 5)\n# Colonel Manfred von Holstein and Captain Rumpelstoss: Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane (Aircraft number 11: flying replica)\n# Mr Wallace: [[Edwards Rhomboidal]] (Aircraft number 14)\n# Charles Wade: (Aircraft number unknown)\n# Mr Yamamoto: Japanese Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane (Aircraft number 1: duplicate flying replica)\n# Count Emilio Ponticelli: Philips Multiplane, Passat Ornithopter, [[Lee-Richards Annular Biplane]] and [http://1000aircraftphotos.com/Contributions/BanhamTony/6580.htm Vickers 22 Monoplane] (Aircraft number 2: flying replica)\n# Henri Monteux: (Aircraft number unknown)\n# Pierre Dubois: [[Santos-Dumont Demoiselle]] (Aircraft number 9: flying replica)\n# Mr Mac Dougall: [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn]] Monoplane nicknamed \"Wake up Scotland\" (Aircraft number 6: original vintage aircraft)\n# Harry Walton (no number assigned).\n\n[[File:BristolBoxkiteReplicaBristolMuseum10March2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1963 replica of the [[Bristol Boxkite]], now hanging in the [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]]]]\nWhile each aircraft was an accurate reproduction, some \"impersonated\" other types.

Annakin had apparently expressed a desire to have a [[Wright Flyer]] in the film.<ref name=\"DVD bonus\">\"Behind the Scenes\" featurette, ''Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines'' (DVD bonus), 20th Century Fox, 2004.</ref> The Bristol (a British derivative of the French 1909 [[Farman]] biplane) was chosen instead, because it shared a common general layout with a [[Wright brothers|Wright]] or [[Glenn Hammond Curtiss|Curtiss]] [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] biplane of the era, and had an excellent reputation for tractability.<ref name=\"Wheeler Boxkite\">Wheeler (1965), pp.44-49.</ref> For the impersonation, the replica had \"The Phoenix Flyer\" painted on its outer rudder surfaces and was also called a \"Gruber-Newton Flyer\" adding the name of its primary backer to the nomenclature; although the American pilot character, Orvil Newton inaccurately describes his aircraft to Patricia Rawnsley as a \"Curtiss with an [[Anzani]] engine.\"<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n[[Frederick George Miles|F. G. Miles]], chiefly responsible for its design and manufacture, built the replica Bristol Boxkite with the original standard twin rudder installation and powered the replica with a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]-manufactured version of the 65&nbsp;hp [[Continental A65]]. In the course of testing, Wheeler had a third rudder inserted between the other two (some original Boxkites also had this fitting) to improve directional control, and substituted a more powerful 90&nbsp;hp [[Continental O-200|Rolls-Royce C90]] that still barely delivered the power of the original 50&nbsp;hp [[Gnome et Rh\u00f4ne|Gnome]] [[Rotary engine|rotary]] at the power settings used for the Boxkite. The replica achieved a 45&nbsp;mph top speed.<ref>Carlson (2012), p. 325.</ref> The Boxkite was tractable, however, and the scene in the film when the aircraft loses a pair of main wheels just after take off but lands smoothly, was repeated 20 times for the cameras. In the penultimate flying scene, a stuntman was carried in the Boxkite's undercarriage and carried out a fall and roll (the stunt had to be repeated to match the principal actor's roll and revival). Slapstick stunts on the ground and in the air were a major element and often the directors requested repeated stunts; the stuntmen were more than accommodating; it meant more pay.<ref name=\"DVD bonus\"/>\n\nThe Eardley Billing Tractor Biplane replica flown by David Watson appeared in two guises, in more or less authentic form, impersonating an early German tractor biplane, and also as the Japanese pilot's mount, modified with boxkite-like side curtains over the [[interplane strut]]s, a covered fuselage, and colourful \"oriental\" decorations.<ref>Carlson (2012), p. 328.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alberto Santos Dumont flying the Demoiselle (1909).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Alberto Santos-Dumont|Santos-Dumont]] flying his Demoiselle in Paris, 1907]]\nIn addition to the flying aircraft, several unsuccessful aircraft of the period were represented by non-flying replicas{{spaced ndash}}including contraptions such as an [[ornithopter]] (the Passat Ornithopter) flown by the Italian contender, the Walton Edwards Rhomboidal, Picat Dubreuil, Philips Multiplane and the Little Fiddler (a canard, or tail-first design). Several of the \"non-flying\" types flew with the help of \"movie magic\". The Lee Richards Annular Biplane with circular wings (built by Denton Partners on [[Woodley Aerodrome]], near Reading) was \"flown on wires\" during the filming.<ref name=\"Wheeler (1965) Lee Richards\">Wheeler (1965), pp. 92-93</ref>\n\nThe flying replicas were specifically chosen to be different enough that an ordinary audience member could distinguish them. They were all types reputed to have flown well, in or about 1910. In most cases this worked well, but there were a few surprises, adding to an accurate historical reassessment of the aircraft concerned. For example, in its early form, the replica of the [[Santos-Dumont Demoiselle]], a forerunner of today's [[ultralight aircraft]], was unable to leave the ground except in short hops. Extending the wingspan and fitting a more powerful Ardem 50&nbsp;hp engine produced only marginal improvement. When Doug Bianchi and the Personal Planes production staff who constructed the replica consulted with Allen Wheeler, he recalled that the Demoiselle's designer and first pilot, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] was a very short, slightly built man. A suitably small pilot, [[Joan Hughes]], a wartime member of the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] who was the Airways Flying Club chief instructor, was hired. With the reduced payload, the diminutive Demoiselle flew very well, and Hughes proved a consummate stunt flyer, able to undertake exacting manoeuvres.<ref name=\"DVD 1\"/>\n\n[[File:Roe IV.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Shuttleworth Collection's replica A.V. Roe IV Triplane]]\nIn 1960, Bianchi had created a one-off Vickers 22 (Bl\u00e9riot type) Monoplane, using Vickers Company drawings intended for the Vickers Flying Club in 1910. 20th Century Fox purchased the completed replica although it required a new engine and modifications including replacing the wooden fuselage structure with welded steel tubing as well as incorporating ailerons instead of wing-warping. The Vickers 22 became the final type used by the Italian contestant.<ref name=\"Wheeler (1965) Vickers\">Wheeler (1965), p. 62</ref> Sometime after the film wrapped, the Vickers was sold to a buyer in New Zealand. It is believed to have flown once, at Wellington Airport in the hands of Keith Trillo, a test pilot involved in a number of aircraft certification programmes, and is now at the [[Southward Car Museum]], Otaihanga, New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwardcarmuseum.co.nz/ |title=Collection |website=Southward Car Museum |access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Hillwood]] of Hampshire Aero Club constructed an [[Roe IV Triplane|Avro Triplane Mk IV]], using drawings provided by Geoffrey Verdon Roe, son of [[Alliott Verdon Roe|A.V. Roe]], the designer. The construction of the triplane followed A.V. Roe's specifications and was the only replica that utilised wing-warping successfully. With a more powerful 90&nbsp;hp Cirrus II replacing the 35&nbsp;hp Green engine that was in the original design, the Avro Triplane proved to be a lively performer even with a stuntman dangling from the fuselage.<ref name=\"DVD bonus\"/>\n\n[[File:Antoinette V.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Original [[Daguerreotype]] of an Antoinette IV c. 1910{{spaced ndash}}note triangular ailerons hinged on trailing edge of wing]]\nThe [[Antoinette IV]] film model closely replicated the slim, graceful monoplane that was very nearly the first aircraft to fly the [[English Channel]], in the hands of [[Hubert Latham]], and won several prizes in early competitions. When the Hants and Sussex Aviation Company from Portsmouth Aerodrome undertook its construction, the company followed the original structural specifications carefully, although an out-of-period [[de Havilland|de Havilland Gypsy]] I engine was used. The Antoinette's wing structure proved, however, to be dangerously flexible, and lateral control was very poor, even after the wing bracing was reinforced with extra wires, and the original wing-warping was replaced with ailerons (hinged on the rear spar rather than from the trailing edge, as in the original Antoinette). Nonetheless, even in its final configuration the Antoinette was marginal in terms of stability and lateral control and great care had to be taken during its flying sequences, most flights being straight \"hops\".<ref name=\"Wheeler (1965) Antoinette\">Wheeler (1965), pp. 27-35</ref>\n\nThe realism and the attention to detail in the replicas of vintage machines are a major contributor to the enjoyment of the film, and although a few of the \"flying\" stunts were achieved through the use of models and cleverly disguised wires, most aerial scenes featured actual flying aircraft. The few genuine vintage aircraft used included a [[Deperdussin]] used as set dressing, and the flyable 1912 Blackburn Monoplane \"D\" (the oldest genuine British aircraft still flying<ref>Ellis (2005), p. 38.</ref>), belonged to the [[Shuttleworth Collection|Shuttleworth Trust]] based at Old Warden, Bedfordshire. When the filming was completed, the \"1910 Bristol Boxkite\" and the \"1911 Roe IV Triplane\" were retained in the Shuttleworth Collection,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airsceneuk.org.uk/airshow06/shuttlemay/avrotriplane.htm |first=Robert |last=Bowles |title=Avro Triplane |website=Airsceneuk.org.uk |date=2006 |access-date=18 February 2010}}</ref> Both replicas are still in flyable condition, albeit flying with different engines.<ref>Ellis (2005), p. 39.</ref> For his role in promoting the film, the non-flying \"Passat Ornithopter\" was given to aircraft restorer and preservationist, [[Cole Palen]] who displayed it at his [[Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome]], New York, where it is still on display.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldrhinebeck.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=55 |first=Barry |last=Dowsett |title=James Henry 'Cole' Palen, (1925\u20131993) |website=Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome |date=2012 |access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the reliance on flying stunts and their inherent danger, the one near-tragedy occurred on the ground when a stunt went wrong. Stuntman Ken Buckle inadvertently turned the throttle to full on a runaway motorbike and sidecar, launching himself through the retaining wall on the sloped Brookley racing track and crashing into the adjoining cesspool, off-camera. Thinking quickly, the special effects man on the other side of the wall saw the motorbike hurtling towards him and set off the accompanying explosion, creating a realistic waterspout. Lucky to escape with only facial bruises and a dislocated collarbone, as he struggled to his feet, Buckle apologised for having messed up, but the shot \"was in the can\".<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nDuring the promotional junkets accompanying the film in 1965, a number of the vintage aircraft and film replicas used in the production were flown in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The pilots who had been part of the aerial team readily agreed to accompany the promotional tour to have a chance to fly these aircraft again.<ref name=\"DVD bonus\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\n''Those Magnificent Men In their Flying Machines ...''  had its Royal World Premiere on 3 June 1965 at the Astoria Theatre in the [[West End of London]] in the presence of H.R.H.
