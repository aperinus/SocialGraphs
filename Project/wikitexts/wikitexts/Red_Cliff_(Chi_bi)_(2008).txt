The film was directed by [[John Woo]], and stars [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]], [[Zhang Fengyi]], [[Chang Chen]], [[Zhao Wei]], [[Hu Jun]], and [[Lin Chi-ling]]. It is Woo's first major film since 2003's ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/review/red-cliff-35582|title=Red Cliff |first=Scott |last=Tobias}}</ref> and his first Chinese-language feature since 1992's ''[[Hard Boiled]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8365/red-cliff-dvd-review |title=Red Cliff DVD review|date=14 December 2009}}</ref> also starring Leung.\n\nIn China and much of Asia, ''Red Cliff'' was released in two parts, totaling over four hours in length (288&nbsp;minutes).

Woo decided to alter the story using modern feelings and his own feelings for a more worldly acceptance.

[[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] reluctantly approves the campaign. Cao Cao's mighty army swiftly conquers [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. The [[Battle of Changban]] is ignited when Cao Cao's cavalry starts attacking civilians on an exodus led by Liu Bei. During the battle, Liu Bei's followers, including his [[sworn brother]]s [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], give an excellent display of their combat skills by holding off the enemy while buying time for the civilians to retreat. The warrior [[Zhao Yun]] fights bravely to rescue Liu Bei's entrapped family but only succeeds in rescuing Liu's infant son.\n\nFollowing the battle, Liu Bei's advisor, [[Zhuge Liang]], goes on a diplomatic mission to [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] to form an alliance between his lord and Sun Quan against Cao Cao. Sun Quan was initially in the midst of a dilemma of whether to surrender or fight back, but his decision to resist Cao Cao hardens after Zhuge Liang's clever persuasion and a subsequent tiger hunt with his viceroy [[Zhou Yu]] and his sister [[Lady Sun|Sun Shangxiang]]. Meanwhile, [[Cai Mao]] and [[Zhang Yun (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Yun]], two naval commanders from Jing Province, pledge allegiance to Cao Cao, who puts them in command of his navy.\n\nAfter the hasty formation of the Sun\u2013Liu alliance, the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan call for a meeting to formulate a plan to counter Cao Cao's army, which is rapidly advancing towards their base at Red Cliff from both land and water. The battle begins with Sun Shangxiang leading some riders to lure Cao Cao's vanguard force into the allies' [[Eight Trigrams Formation|Bagua Formation]]. The vanguard force is defeated by the allies but Cao Cao shows no disappointment and proceeds to lead his main army to the riverbank directly opposite Red Cliff, where they make camp. While the allies throw a banquet to celebrate their victory, Zhuge Liang conceives a plan to send Sun Shangxiang on an espionage mission to Cao Cao's camp. They maintain contact by sending messages via a pigeon. The film ends with Zhou Yu lighting his miniaturised battleships on a map based on the battle formation.\n\n===Part II===\nSun Shangxiang has infiltrated Cao Cao's camp and is secretly noting its details and sending them via a pigeon to Zhuge Liang. Meanwhile, Cao Cao's army is seized with a plague of [[typhoid fever]] that kills a number of his troops. Cao Cao orders the corpses to be sent on floating rafts to the allies' camp, in the hope of spreading the plague to his enemies. The allied army's morale is affected when some unsuspecting soldiers let the plague in. Eventually, a disheartened Liu Bei leaves with his forces while Zhuge Liang stays behind to assist Sun Quan. Cao Cao is overjoyed when he hears that the alliance has collapsed. At the same time, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships with iron beams to minimise rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick.\n\n[[File:Red Cliff.jpg|right|thumb|Sun Quan's forces look on as [[Liu Bei]] leaves the alliance. ''From right to left'': [[Zhou Yu]] ([[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]]), [[Sun Quan]] ([[Chang Chen]]), [[Lu Su]] ([[Hou Yong (actor)|Hou Yong]]).]]\n\nZhou Yu and Zhuge Liang make plans to eliminate Cai Mao and Zhang Yun and produce 100,000&nbsp;arrows respectively. They agreed that whoever fails to complete his mission shall be executed under military law. Zhuge Liang's strategy of letting the enemy shoot 20&nbsp;boats covered in straw brings in over 100,000&nbsp;arrows from the enemy and makes Cao Cao doubt the loyalty of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. On the other hand, Cao Cao sends [[Jiang Gan]] to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender, but Zhou tricks Jiang Gan into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to assassinate Cao Cao. Both Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu's respective plans complement each other when Cao Cao is convinced, despite having earlier doubts about Jiang Gan's report, that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were indeed planning to assassinate him by deliberately \"donating\" arrows to the enemy. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are executed only for Cao Cao to realize his folly afterwards.\n\nSun Shangxiang returns to base from Cao Cao's camp with a map of the enemy formation. Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang decide to attack Cao Cao's navy with fire after predicting that a special climatic condition will soon cause the winds to blow from the southeast \u2013 a direction to their advantage. Before the battle, Sun Quan's forces feast on [[Tangyuan (food)|rice dumplings]] to celebrate the [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice]]. Meanwhile, Zhou Yu's wife, [[Two Qiaos|Xiaoqiao]], after over hearing the battle plan heads towards Cao Cao's camp alone secretly in the hope of persuading Cao to give up his ambitious plans. She fails to convince Cao Cao and decides to distract him with an elaborate [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] to buy time for her side.\n\nThe battle begins when the southeast wind starts blowing in the middle of the night. Sun Quan's forces launch their attack on Cao Cao's navy by ramming smaller boats that are set aflame into Cao's larger battleships. On the other hand, Liu Bei's forces, whose departure from the alliance was a ruse, start attacking Cao Cao's forts on land. By dawn, Cao Cao's entire navy has been destroyed. The allies launch another offensive on Cao Cao's ground army in his forts and succeed in breaking through using [[testudo formation]] despite suffering heavy casualties. Although Cao Cao is besieged in his main camp, he manages to hold Zhou Yu at sword point after ambushing him with the help of [[Cao Hong]]. Xiahou Jun also shows up with Xiaoqiao as a hostage and threatens to kill her if the allies do not surrender. Just then, Zhao Yun manages to reverse the situation by rescuing Xiaoqiao with a surprise attack, while Sun Quan fires an arrow that grazes the top of Cao Cao's head and cuts his topknot loose. Cao Cao is now at the mercy of the allies, but they spare his life and leave. In the final scene, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang have a final conversation before Zhuge walks away into the far distance with the newborn foal Mengmeng.\n\n===Abridged version===\nFor the non-Asian releases, the film was shortened from 288 minutes to 148&nbsp;minutes and was released in some countries under the title ''Battle of Red Cliff''. An opening narration in American English provides the historical background, whereas in the Asian release, a more brief description of the context of the political situation appears in scrolling form ten minutes into the film. Notable cuts include the background and motivations behind Zhuge Liang's plan to obtain 100,000&nbsp;arrows, including the threat to his life, and the early parts of Sun Shangxiang's infiltration, where she befriended a northern soldier Sun Shucai (though the scene where she mourns Sun's death was not cut). The tiger hunting scene was also cut from the non-Asian releases.\n\nThe original two-part 288&nbsp;minute English version was released as a two-disc set on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 5&nbsp;October 2009,<ref name=\"dvdtimes.co.uk\"/> and in the United States and Canada on 23 March 2010.<ref name=\"amazon.com\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] as [[Zhou Yu]]\n* [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] as [[Zhuge Liang]]\n* [[Zhang Fengyi]] as [[Cao Cao]]\n* [[Chang Chen]] as [[Sun Quan]]\n* [[Zhao Wei]] as [[Lady Sun|Sun Shangxiang]]\n* [[Hu Jun]] as [[Zhao Yun]]\n* [[You Yong]] as [[Liu Bei]]\n* [[Lin Chi-ling]] as [[Two Qiaos|Xiao Qiao]]\n* [[Nakamura Shid\u014d II|Shid\u014d Nakamura]] as Gan Xing - Probably based on the Historical [[Gan Ning]]\n* [[Hou Yong (actor)|Hou Yong]] as [[Lu Su]]\n* [[Tong Dawei]] as Sun Shucai\n* [[Batdorj-in Baasanjab]] as [[Guan Yu]]\n* [[Zang Jinsheng]] as [[Zhang Fei]]\n* [[Song Jia (actress, born 1980)|Song Jia]] as Lady Li\n* Zhang Shan as [[Huang Gai]]\n* Wang Hui as [[Cao Hong]]\n* Xie Gang as [[Hua Tuo]]\n* Shi Xiaohong as [[Jiang Gan]]\n* Xu Fengnian as [[Zhang Liao]]\n* Guo Chao as [[Yue Jin]]\n* Hu Xiaoguang as Xiahou Jun - Probably based on the Historical Characters [[Xiahou Yuan]] and/or [[Xiahou Dun]]\n* Cui Yugui as [[Xu Chu]]\n* Jiang Tong as [[Li Tong (Wenda)|Li Tong]]\n* Ma Jing as Wei Ben\n* Yizhen as [[Cai Mao]]\n* Jia Hongwei as Zhang Yun\n* Zhao Chengshun as [[Xun You]]\n* Wang Zaolai as [[Cheng Yu]]\n* Wang Ning as [[Emperor Xian of Han]]\n* Wang Qingxiang as [[Kong Rong]]\n* Li Hong as [[Lady Gan]]\n* He Yin as [[Lady Mi]]\n* Wang Yuzhang as [[Cheng Pu]]\n* Menghe Wuliji as [[Guan Ping]]\n* Sun Xinyu as Cowherd boy\n* Ma Jingwu as Old fisherman\n* Ye Hua as Tiantian\n* Chen Changhai as [[Qin Song]]\n* Zhang Yi as [[Zhang Zhao (Eastern Wu)|Zhang Zhao]]\n* Wu Qi as [[Gu Yong]]\n* He Feng as Man Tun\n* Li Hongchen as Sick soldier\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Conception ===\nIn a 1994 interview with ''Transpacific'' magazine, Woo stated that his dream was to direct a version of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', citing his goal of wanting to bring Chinese people together and diminish political infighting.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Fu |first=Nelson |date=August\u2013September 1994 |title=Woo's on first! |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A15729896/ITOF?u=wikipedia&sid=ebsco&xid=38158af3 |magazine=Transpacific |volume=9 |issue=5 |access-date=2022-07-02 |via=Gale General OneFile}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Ken Watanabe]] was originally selected for the role of [[Cao Cao]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.cri.cn/3086/2007/02/09/63@194602.htm |language=en |title=Zhao Wei to join all-star cast for ''Battle of the Red Cliff'' |website=[[China Radio International]] |date=2007-02-09 |access-date=2007-04-04}}</ref> According to a report, some Chinese fans voiced objections over the choice as they felt that it was inappropriate for a Japanese actor to portray an important Chinese historical figure.
