Gibson portrays [[Sir William Wallace]], a late-13th century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against [[Edward I of England|King Edward I of England]]. The film also stars [[Sophie Marceau]], [[Patrick McGoohan]] and [[Catherine McCormack]]. The story is inspired by [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th century [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Wallace (poem)|The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace]]'' and was adapted for the screen by [[Randall Wallace]].\n\nDevelopment on the film initially started at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) when producer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] picked up the project from Wallace, but when MGM was going through new management, Ladd left the studio and took the project with him. Despite initially declining, Gibson eventually decided to direct the film, as well as star as Wallace. ''Braveheart'' was filmed in Scotland and Ireland from June to October 1994 with a budget around $65\u201370&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"NotesTCM\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69593/Braveheart/misc-notes.html|title=Braveheart (1995) - Misc Notes|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2019-05-11|archive-date=May 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511203232/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69593/Braveheart/misc-notes.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The film, which was produced by Gibson's [[Icon Productions]] and [[The Ladd Company]], was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in North America and by [[20th Century Fox]] internationally.\n\nReleased on May 24, 1995, ''Braveheart'' was praised for its action, drama, and romance,<ref name=rt/> though it was criticized for its numerous historical deviations.<ref name=white>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece|title=The 10 most historically inaccurate movies|last=White|first=Caroline|newspaper=The Sunday Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615070116/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece|archive-date=June 15, 2011|access-date=November 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>[[BBC]]. [[Bitesize]]. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zbrb7nb Eight blockbuster films that got history wrong]. Retrieved on September 29, 2021</ref> Nonetheless, the movie was successful both critically and commercially. A [[stand-alone sequel]], ''[[Robert the Bruce (film)|Robert the Bruce]]'', was released on June 28, 2019, with [[Angus Macfadyen]] reprising his role.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1280, [[Edward I of England|King Edward \"Longshanks\"]] invades and conquers [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland]], who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' execution of several Scottish nobles, suffers the deaths of his father and brother fighting against the English, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal uncle Argyle, who has Wallace educated.\n\nYears later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including [[Droit du seigneur|''jus primae noctis'']]. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as Wallace fights off the soldiers Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to [[Action at Lanark|fight the English garrison]] in his hometown and sends the surviving garrison back to England with a message of rebellion for Longshanks.\n\nLongshanks orders his son [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] to stop Wallace by any means necessary while he visits the French King to secure England's alliance with France. Alongside his friend Hamish, Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] where he decapitates the English commander Cheltham, and sacks [[York, England|York]]  after Prince Edward fails to send reinforcements there, killing Longshanks' nephew whose severed head is sent to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]], the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]], a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his [[leprosy|leper]] father, who wishes to secure the Scottish throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife [[Isabella of France]] to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.\n\nAfter meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. She warns him of the coming invasion, and Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back their country, asking Robert the Bruce to lead. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]]. During the battle, Scottish noblemen Mornay and Lochlan, having been bribed by Longshanks, withdraw their men, resulting in Wallace's army being routed and the death of Hamish's father, Campbell. Wallace is further betrayed when he discovers Robert the Bruce was fighting alongside Longshanks; after the battle, seeing the damage he helped do to his countrymen, Robert reprimands his father and vows never to be on the wrong side again.\n\nWallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father conspires with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns and banishes his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks, who can no longer speak, by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is pregnant with Wallace's child and will ensure that Prince Edward spends as short a time as possible on the throne before Wallace's child replaces him.\n\nIn London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to submit to the king. The watching crowd, deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, begin crying for mercy on Wallace's behalf. The magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy\", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and his cry rings through the square, the dying Longshanks hearing it. Before being [[Decapitation|beheaded]], Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.\n\nIn 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], where he is supposed to formally accept English rule. Instead, he invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Hamish throws Wallace's sword point-down in front of the English army, and he and the Scots chant Wallace's name as Robert leads them into battle against the English, winning the Scots their freedom.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[William Wallace]]\n** James Robinson as young William Wallace\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as Princess [[Isabella of France]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[Robert the Bruce]]\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as King [[Edward I of England|Edward \"Longshanks\"]]\n* [[Catherine McCormack]] as Murron MacClannough\n** Mhairi Calvey as young Murron MacClannough\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Hamish\n** Andrew Weir as young Hamish\n* [[Peter Hanly]] as [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]]\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Campbell\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Stephen of Ireland\n* [[Ian Bannen]] as [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Bruce's father]]\n* [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] as MacClannough\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Argyle Wallace\n* [[Sean Lawlor]] as Malcolm Wallace\n* Sandy Nelson as John Wallace\n* [[Stephen Billington]] as Phillip\n* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as Craig\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Mornay\n* John Murtagh as Lochlan\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Morrison\n* [[Donal Gibson]] as Stewart\n* Jeanne Marine as Nicolette\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Smythe\n* [[Malcolm Tierney]] as Magistrate\n* [[Bernard Horsfall]] as Balliol\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Veteran\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Cheltham\n* [[Richard Leaf]] as Governor of York\n* [[Mark Lees]] as Old Crippled Scotsman\n* [[Tam White]] as MacGregor\n* [[Jimmy Chisholm]] as Faudron\n* [[David Gant]] as the Royal Magistrate\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nProducer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] initially had the project at [[MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications]] when he picked up the script from Wallace.<ref name=\"gaspare88\">{{Citation|last=gaspare88|title=Making Of Braveheart Behind The Scenes Documentary|date=February 7, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X20ii_zg_N4|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529214229/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X20ii_zg_N4|url-status=live}}</ref> When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, including ''Braveheart''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HtZAAAAMAAJ&q=Ladd+takes+Braveheart|title=Robin Hood: A Cinematic History of the English Outlaw and His Scottish Counterparts|last=Nollen|first=Scott Allen|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786406432|access-date=October 26, 2018|archive-date=June 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630022548/https://books.google.com/books?id=_HtZAAAAMAAJ&q=Ladd+takes+Braveheart|url-status=live}}</ref> Gibson came across the script and even though he liked it, he initially passed on it.

But there is a factual strand that historians agree to\", summarized from Scots scholar Matt Ewart:\n\n{{blockquote|Wallace was born into the gentry of Scotland; his father lived until he was 18, his mother until his 24th year; he killed the sheriff of [[Lanark]] when he was 27, apparently after the murder of his wife; he led a group of commoners against the English in a very successful battle at Stirling in 1297, temporarily receiving appointment as [[Guardian of Scotland|guardian]]; Wallace's reputation as a military leader was ruined in the same year of 1297, leading to his resignation as guardian; he spent several years of exile in France before being captured by the English at [[Glasgow]], this resulting in his trial for treason and his cruel execution.<ref>{{cite book | first1=John|last1=Shelton Lawrence|first2=Robert|last2=Jewett |title=The Myth of the American Superhero | url=https://archive.org/details/mythofamericansu00lawr_0| url-access=registration|publisher=Wm.

She finds that in ''Braveheart'', \"any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'\u2014as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate.\"<ref name=\"Canitz\">{{cite book | year=2005 | first=A.E.

She later tells Edward I she is pregnant, implying that her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was a product of the affair.

Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], and as a religious man, he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Furthermore, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.<ref>Traquair p. 147</ref>\n\nThe depiction of the future [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] as an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] homosexual drew accusations of [[homophobia]] against Gibson.\n\n{{blockquote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character [Edward II] and to understand his plight and his pain ...

In the feudal armies of the late 13th and early 14th century, cavalry would have been made up of nobility and knights all in their self-purchased armour and displaying their coat of arms on surcoats and shields. Also the armour shown in the movie, i.e. small metal plates sewn on a fabric did not exist and would have been ineffective since it could have been easily pierced by swords, spears, arrows etc. Indeed, knights of that time period would have worn mail chausses to protect their legs, a mail hauberk over a patted gambeson to protect the upper body and arms as well as a mail coif and a great helm to protect the head. Another layer of protection, the coat-of-plates would have been worn over the hauberk, but under the surcoat. Infantry would have looked very diverse utilizing any kind of armor they could obtain and afford. The Scottish fighters would have been dressed and armed in the same way as their English opponents.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carlin |first1=Martha |title=Clothing, Armor, and Weapons of a Mid Thirteenth-Century English Knight |url=https://sites.uwm.edu/carlin/clothing-armor-and-weapons-of-a-mid-thirteenth-century-english-knight/}}</ref>{{additional citation  needed|date=August 2022}} [[Kilts]] appeared only in the 16th century, so two centuries after the events in the movie.
