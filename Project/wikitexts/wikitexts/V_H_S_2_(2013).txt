It is the [[natural number]] following [[1]] and preceding [[3]]. It is the smallest and only even [[prime number]]. Because it forms the basis of a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]], it has [[Religion|religious]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] significance in many [[Culture|cultures]].\n\n{{anchor|glyph}}\n\n==Evolution==\n===Arabic digit===\n[[Image:Evolution2glyph.png|x50px|right]]\nThe digit used in the modern Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Indic [[Brahmic script]], where \"2\" was written as two horizontal lines. The modern [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] languages (and Korean [[Hanja]]) still use this method. The [[Gupta script]] rotated the two lines 45&nbsp;degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the [[Devanagari|Nagari]] script, the top line was written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic [[Ghub\u0101r numerals|Ghubar]] writing, the bottom line was completely vertical, and the digit looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern digit.<ref>Georges Ifrah, ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' transl. David Bellos et al. London: The Harvill Press (1998): 393, Fig. 24.62</ref>\n\nIn fonts with [[text figures]], digit 2 usually is of [[x-height]], for example, [[Image:Text figures 256.svg]].\n\n===Etymology of ''two''===\nThe word ''two'' is derived from the [[Old English]] words {{lang|ang|tw\u0101}} ([[Grammatical gender|feminine]]), {{lang|ang|t\u016b}} (neuter), and {{lang|ang|tw\u0113\u0121en}} (masculine, which survives today in the form [[wikt:twain|twain]]).<ref name=OED>{{Cite OED|two, adj., n., and adv.}}</ref>\n\nThe pronunciation {{IPA|/tu\u02d0/}}, like that of ''who'' is due to the [[labialization]] of the vowel by the ''w'' (combare from [[womb]]), which then disappeared before the related sound. The successive stages of pronunciation for the Old English {{lang|ang|tw\u0101}} would thus be {{IPA|/tw\u0251\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/tw\u0254\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/two\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/twu\u02d0/}}, and finally {{IPA|/tu\u02d0/}}.<ref name=OED/>\n\n==In mathematics==\nAn [[integer]] is called ''[[Parity (mathematics)|even]]'' if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number, such as [[decimal]], [[hexadecimal]], or in any other base that is even, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit. If it is even, then the whole number is even. In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or&nbsp;8.\n\nTwo is the smallest [[prime number]], and the only even prime number (for this reason it is sometimes called \"the oddest prime\").<ref>John Horton Conway & Richard K. Guy, ''The Book of Numbers''. New York: Springer (1996): 25. {{ISBN|0-387-97993-X}}. \"Two is celebrated as the only even prime, which in some sense makes it the oddest prime of all.\"</ref> The next prime is [[3|three]].

This binary number system is used extensively in [[Computer|computing]].\n\nFor any number ''x'':\n:''x'' + ''x'' = 2 \u00b7 ''x'' [[addition]] to [[multiplication]]\n:''x'' \u00b7 ''x'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> [[multiplication]] to [[exponentiation]]\n:''x''<sup>''x''</sup> = ''x''\u2191\u21912 [[exponentiation]] to [[tetration]]\n\nExtending this sequence of operations by introducing the notion of [[hyperoperation]]s, here denoted by \"hyper(''a'',''b'',''c'')\" with ''a'' and ''c'' being the first and second operand, and ''b'' being the ''level'' in the above sketched sequence of operations, the following holds in general:\n:hyper(''x'',''n'',''x'') = hyper(''x'',(''n'' + 1),2).\n\nTwo has therefore the unique property that {{nowrap|1=2 + 2 = 2 \u00b7 2 = 2{{sup|2}} = 2\u2191\u21912 = 2\u2191\u2191\u21912 = ...}}, disregarding the level of the hyperoperation, here denoted by [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]. The number of up-arrows refers to the level of the hyperoperation.\n\nTwo is the only number ''x'' such that the sum of the reciprocals of the natural powers of ''x'' equals itself.

The countably [[Infinity|infinite]] [[product topology]] of the simplest [[discrete two-point space]], {[[0]], [[1]]}, is the traditional elementary example.  \n\n[[Power of two|Powers of two]] are central to the concept of [[Mersenne prime]]s, and important to [[computer science]]. Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent.\n\nTaking the [[square root]] of a number is such a common mathematical operation, that the spot on the root sign where the index would normally be written for cubic and other roots, may simply be left blank for square roots, as it is tacitly understood.\n\nThe [[square root of 2]] was the first known [[irrational number]].\n\nThe smallest [[field (mathematics)|field]] has two elements.\n\nIn a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] construction of the natural numbers, 2 is identified with the set <nowiki>{{\u2205},\u2205}</nowiki>.

On a circle, it is a [[tessellation]] with two [[antipodal points]] and 180\u00b0 arc edges. \n\nThe simplest tessellation in [[two-dimensional space]], though an improper tessellation, is that of two [[Infinity|<math>\\infty</math>]]-sided [[apeirogon]]s joined along all their edges, coincident about a [[line (geometry)|line]]   that divides the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] in two. This [[order-2 apeirogonal tiling]] is the arithmetic limit of the family of [[dihedra]] {p, 2}.\n\nFor any polyhedron homeomorphic to a sphere, the [[Euler characteristic]] is {{nowrap|1=''\u03c7'' = ''V'' \u2212 ''E'' + ''F'' = 2}}, where ''V'' is the number of [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]], ''E'' is the number of [[Edge (geometry)|edge]]s, and ''F'' is the number of [[Face (geometry)|face]]s.\n\nThere are two known [[sublime number]]s, which are numbers with a [[Perfect number|perfect]] number of factors, whose sum itself yields a [[perfect number]].
