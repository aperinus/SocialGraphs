The [[screenplay]] by [[David Klass]] is based on [[James Patterson]]'s best-selling [[Kiss the Girls (novel)|1995 novel of the same name]]. A sequel titled ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' was released in 2001.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Washington, D.C.]] detective and [[Forensic Psychology|forensic psychologist]] [[Alex Cross]] heads to [[Durham, North Carolina]] when his niece Naomi, a college student, is reported missing. He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home.\n\nWhen she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself [[Casanova]], and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient.\n\nClues lead them to [[Los Angeles]], where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross's efforts to capture and question Rudolph are foiled when Rudolph escapes. In North Carolina, Cross traces Casanova up the river. Alerted by a gunshot, he discovers Casanova's underground hideout. Rudolph is revealed to be Casanova's partner. Casanova escapes, while Rudolph is shot by Cross. Cross rescues the kidnapped women, including Naomi.\n\nLater, Kate invites Cross to dinner at her house. Ruskin drops by Kate's house and sends home the two officers guarding her. While Cross is at home preparing to meet Kate for dinner, he discovers that Ruskin's signature on the arrest warrants matches Casanova's handwriting. Cross tries calling Kate to inform her, but Ruskin has already disconnected her phone line. Kate becomes suspicious of Ruskin while conversing with him. He then drops his accent, revealing he is Casanova. After a fight and attempted rape, Kate manages to handcuff him to the oven. Ruskin slashes Kate's arm with a kitchen knife. In attempting to free himself, Ruskin pulls the oven away from the wall, rupturing the gas pipe. Ruskin takes out a lighter, threatening to cause an explosion due to the leaking gas. Cross shows up and tries to discourage Ruskin. When this fails, Cross shoots Ruskin, firing through a milk carton to avoid igniting the gas. Cross comforts Kate as the police arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Alex Cross|Dr. / Detective Alex Cross]]\n*[[Ashley Judd]] as Dr. Kate McTiernan\n*[[Cary Elwes]] as Detective Nick Ruskin\n*[[Alex McArthur]] as Detective Davey Sikes\n*[[Bill Nunn]] as [[John Sampson (character)|Detective John Sampson]]\n*[[Jeremy Piven]] as Detective Henry Castillo\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Chief Hatfield\n*[[Jay O.

The film shot two weeks on location in North Carolina on the streets of [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], in nearby county parks, and outside a [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] residence. The police station was constructed in a downtown Durham warehouse. The majority of filming occurred in the Los Angeles area, with locations including the Disney Ranch, The Athenaeum at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]], a house in the Adams historic district of Los Angeles, and on the [[campus of the University of Southern California]] in [[University Park, Los Angeles, California|University Park]]. Designed by American production designer Nelson Coates, the majority of the sets, including the tunnels and underground chambers, were constructed in sound stages on the [[Paramount Studios]] lot. Filming was completed on July 10, 1996.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Deauville Film Festival]] in September 1997 before opening on 2,271 screens in the US the following month.

This decision was out of respect for the families and surrounding communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/kiss_girls_pulled_from_virginia_theaters/35260|title=\"Kiss the Girls\" Pulled from Virginia Theaters|publisher=[[E!#E.21 Online|E!

[It] begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic.\" Holden writes of Morgan Freeman that he \"projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie's fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes you want to believe in the movie much more than its gimmicky [[jury rig|jerry-rigged]] ''[sic]'' plot ever permits.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/971003kiss-film-review.html \"'Kiss the Girls': Casanova Complex: Collecting for the Kill\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 3, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half out of four stars and said, \"David Klass, the screenwriter, gives Freeman and Judd more specific dialogue than is usual in thrillers; they sound as if they might actually be talking with each other and not simply advancing plot points.... [They] are so good, you almost wish they'd decided not to make a thriller at all - had simply found a way to construct a drama exploring their personalities.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971003/REVIEWS/710030301/1023 \"Kiss the Girls\"]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', October 3, 1997.</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film \"a tense, scary, perversely creepy thriller\" and added, \"David Klass ... blessedly deletes the graphic descriptions of torture and rape included in the novel. Unfortunately, he also neglects to include any explanation of Casanova's behavior. Otherwise ''Kiss the Girls'' does what it's supposed to do. A solid second film from director Gary Fleder, it's sure to set pulses racing and spines tingling.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/kissthegirlskemp.htm \"'Kiss the Girls': Clever Creep Show \"].

''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 3, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Peter Stack thought \"the story ... goes on too long. It has too many confusing plot twists and keeps losing energy. Blame it on Hollywood excess, or director Gary Fleder's uncertain hand. A cut of 15 minutes would have helped.\" He was more impressed by the film's stars, calling Morgan Freeman \"compelling\" and \"a hero of extraordinary power that comes almost entirely from his unemotional, calculating calm,\" and stating that Ashley Judd \"gives the sometimes plodding drama a dose of intense vitality. This young actress is getting awfully good at turning potentially gelatinous characters into substantive people who spark viewer interest.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/10/03/DD43624.DTL \"Film Review -- Freeman, Judd Save the `Girls' / Creepy thriller about sexual sadist\"].
