It was distributed by [[Screen Gems]].\n\nSet in [[Portland, Oregon]], the film involves a [[serial killer]] who rigs contraptions that kill his victims based on the number of hits received by a [[website]], KillWithMe.com, that features a live [[streaming media|streaming video]] of the victim. Millions of people log on, hastening the victims' deaths.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Jennifer Marsh is a [[widow]]ed [[single parent]] living in a [[suburb]]an [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] home with her daughter, Annie Haskins, and her mother, Stella Marsh. At night, she works in the FBI's [[cybercrime]] division with Griffin Dowd, fighting [[identity theft]] and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a [[cat]] being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a [[mirror website|mirror server]] immediately replaces it.\n\nAfter the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims, kidnapping them and placing them in death traps that are progressively activated by the number of hits the website receives. The first victim is a helicopter pilot Herbert Miller (bled to death by injections of [[anticoagulant]]), followed by a newscaster David Williams (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor). At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared, this only [[Streisand effect|increases the site's popularity]].\n\nGriffin is kidnapped after investigating a lead based on his hunch as to the killer's identity and receiving a phone call from the killer disguising his voice and posing as one of Griffin's jilted blind dates. In the killer's basement, he is submerged up to his neck in a vat of water with his mouth taped shut; the death trap introduces into the water a concentration of [[sulfuric acid]]. After the killer leaves the room, Griffin uses his dying moments to blink a message in [[morse code]], giving the FBI the lead he was following up on.\n\nJennifer follows up on the morse code message to discover that the victims were not random: they were involved in broadcasting or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point: that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death.\n\nThe police raid Owen's house but he is not present. Owen has been following Jennifer because he is now obsessed with her. He captures and places Jennifer in a makeshift death trap: hanging her above a [[cultivator]] and progressively lowering her to her death as more people enter the website. Jennifer escapes by swinging out of the way and grabbing a pillar to pull herself onto the ground. She breaks free and pins down the murderer, fatally shooting Owen as the police arrive. Owen's death was being broadcast, just like his father's. Jennifer then displays her FBI badge to the webcam.\n\nWhile the chatter in the website's [[chat room]] dwindles, statements are made such as \"You go girl!\", \"glad the killer is dead\" and another one saying \"a genius died today\". The final comment asks where the video can be downloaded.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Diane Lane]] as FBI Agent Jennifer Marsh\n* [[Colin Hanks]] as FBI Agent Griffin Dowd\n* [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Detective Eric Box\n* [[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]] as Owen Reilly\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Stella Marsh\n* [[Tyrone Giordano]] as Tim Wilkes\n* [[Perla Haney-Jardine]] as Annie Haskins\n* [[Christopher Cousins]] as David Williams\n* [[Tim De Zarn]] as Herbert Miller\n* Peter Lewis as Richard Brooks\n* Marilyn Deutsch as Marilyn Deutsch\n* [[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]] as Arthur James Elmer\n* [[Dax Jordan]] as Scotty Hillman\n* John Breen as Richard Weymouth\n* Brynn Baron as Mrs. Miller\n* Phil Hamilton as Mr. Miller\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in and around Portland, Oregon.<ref>{{Citation |date=February 9, 2007 |title=Casting officials are seeking extras for film |publisher= [[Statesman Journal]] |page= C3|url= https://www.google.com/search?q=%22open+casting+call+will+be+held+Saturday+for+paid+extras+for+a+feature+film+being+made+in+the+Portland+area%22|access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> A temporary studio was constructed in [[Clackamas, Oregon]],<ref name=\"lure\">{{Citation |date=November 17, 2008 |title=State uses incentives to lure film industry |publisher=[[Statesman Journal]] |page=A1 |url=http://www.allvoices.com/news/1806010/s/23452809--twilight-film-puts-spotlight-on-oregon |access-date=November 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131116143531/http://www.allvoices.com/news/1806010/s/23452809--twilight-film-puts-spotlight-on-oregon |archive-date=November 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> where all non-location photography was done, mostly interiors, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s cyber division, Jennifer Marsh's house, the FBI building elevator, several basements, etc. A scene set on the east end of the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] was shot both on the actual bridge as well as at the studio.<ref>{{Citation |author=Tom Hallman Jr. |date= March 23, 2007|title= Our rain needs a stand-in?
