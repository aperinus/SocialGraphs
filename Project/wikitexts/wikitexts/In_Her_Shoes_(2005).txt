Rose is the elder; an ostensibly plain and serious lawyer who is protective of Maggie despite her flaws. Maggie is a free spirit who is unable to hold a steady job (partly due to her dyslexia) and turns to alcohol and men for emotional and financial support. After Sydelle throws Maggie out, Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in with her in her [[Rittenhouse Square]] apartment in [[Philadelphia]]. Maggie struggles to find a job and soon causes problems for Rose, including getting her car towed. Their already difficult relationship turns worse when Rose catches Maggie in bed with Jim, a man Rose has been dating. A heartbroken and furious Rose throws Maggie out.\n\nA few days before, while secretly looking through her father's desk for money, Maggie had discovered a bundle of old greeting cards for her and Rose, containing cash, from their \"estranged\" grandmother Ella. Homeless and without job prospects, Maggie travels to [[Deerfield Beach, Florida|Florida]] to find Ella. Believing Maggie is on vacation, Ella invites her to stay in her home. Ella admits to her close friend Ethel how Caroline had [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]], and sent Ella a note several days before her death to look after her girls. As time passes, Ella deduces that Maggie has visited to do nothing but sunbathe and try to get money from her. Maggie asks Ella to finance an acting career, but Ella instead proposes to match her salary dollar for dollar if she accepts a job with the [[assisted living]] section of her grandmother's retirement community.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose quits her job and decides to take some time off, becoming a dog-walker. She begins dating Simon Stein, a coworker whom she had previously ignored. They fall in love and get engaged. Maggie is befriended by one of her patients, a blind retired professor of [[English literature]], who has asked Maggie to read works of poetry to him.{{efn|The first poem Maggie is asked to read is \"One art\" by [[Elizabeth Bishop]].}} Because of her dyslexia, she struggles at first, but the professor offers guidance and emotional support and over time she improves.\n\nMaggie also becomes friendly with other residents of the retirement community, and discovers some residents need a [[personal shopper|personal clothing shopper]], an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent. Ella offers to run the financial aspects of the business, which quickly takes off, and in the process she and Maggie become close and resolve their history.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose's reluctance to talk about Maggie is straining her relationships with Simon and her father. While Michael remains oblivious to his daughters' falling out, Simon tries to get Rose to talk about Maggie. When he sees Rose opening up to Jim about her issues instead, Simon breaks off the engagement. Ella contacts Rose and sends her a plane ticket, asking her to come for a visit. Rose confronts her father about hiding their grandmother from her and Maggie, and he reluctantly explains Ella had not approved of Caroline having children because of her mental illness and tendency to neglect her medication, and had blamed him for her death.\n\nRose is excited to meet her long-lost grandmother, but her pleasure quickly sours when she arrives and discovers Maggie already lives there. While reminiscing with Ella and Rose, Maggie tells a story of their mother taking them on a spontaneous trip to New York. Rose and Ella recognize the details of the story demonstrate Caroline was unwell, while Maggie is oblivious. Rose reveals after the trip Michael and Caroline had a huge argument, with Michael threatening to put her in a mental institution and Caroline killed herself two days later. Maggie realizes Rose had shielded her from the truth about their mother, and they reconcile.\n\nSimon arrives in Florida, summoned by Maggie, and he and Rose reconcile. At last, Rose opens up to him about Maggie and her desire to protect her, fearing Simon will come to hate Maggie. Later, Rose's wedding takes place at the Jamaican Jerk Hut in Philadelphia where she and Simon had their first date. Ella and Michael reconcile, and Maggie reads a poem{{efn|The powem Maggie reads at the wedding is \"i carry your heart with me\" by [[E. E. Cummings]].}} to Rose as a wedding gift, which moves Rose to tears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Maggie Feller\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Rose Feller\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Ella Hirsch\n* [[Ken Howard]] as Michael Feller\n* [[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]] as Amy\n* [[Candice Azzara]] as Sydelle Feller\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Jim Danvers\n* [[Anson Mount]] as Todd\n* [[Mark Feuerstein]] as Simon Stein\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Grant\n* [[Francine Beers]] as Mrs. Lefkowitz\n* [[Jerry Adler]] as Lewis Feldman\n* [[Alan Blumenfeld]] as Mr. Stein\n* Andy Powers as Tim\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Caroline, Maggie and Rose's mother (in photos). \n* [[Norman Lloyd]] as The Professor\n* [[Benton Jennings]] as shoe salesman John Johnson\n* [[Jennifer Weiner]] as smiling woman in Italian market\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''In Her Shoes'' has received generally positive reviews from critics.

The emotional payoff at the end is earned, not because we see it coming as the inevitable outcome of the plot, but because it arrives out of the blue and yet, once we think about it, makes perfect sense. It tells us something fundamental and important about a character, it allows her to share that something with those she loves, and it does it in a way we could not possibly anticipate. Like a good poem, it blindsides us with the turn it takes right at the end.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=2005-10-07 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/in-her-shoes-2005 |title=Sole sisters out-step stereotypes |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |via=RogerEbert.com |access-date=2022-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' argues, on the other hand, that the film  \"is almost a true statement, almost an honest rendering of a sibling relationship and almost not a sentimental [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark card]] of a movie.
