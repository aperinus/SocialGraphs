The film was directed by [[Robert Markowitz]] and stars [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[John Lithgow]], and [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nDuring World War II Hannibal \"Iowa\" Lee, Jr. (Laurence Fishburne), traveling by train to [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], is joined by fellow [[flight cadet]] candidates Billy \"A-Train\" Roberts (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Walter Peoples III (Allen Payne), and Lewis Johns (Mekhi Phifer). At the start of their training, they are met by [[Colonel]] Noel Rogers (Daniel Hugh Kelly), the commander of the base; [[Major]] Sherman Joy (Christopher McDonald), director of training; and [[Second Lieutenant]] Glenn (Courtney B. Vance), liaison officer. The cadets are briefed by Rogers and Joy, both with their own views that set the tone for what the cadets would later face in training: Rogers has an optimistic view of the cadets, wanting the cadets to prove the naysayers wrong and letting them know how much of an honor it would be for the cadets to pass the training and earn their wings as aviators. Major Joy, however, reflects the views of most of white America at the time, belittling the cadets and questioning whether they are up to the task. Afterward, Lt. Glenn tells the cadets that he hoped they took note of the differing views of the two different officers. Later that evening, the cadets are chatting among themselves, and begin to introduce themselves and what their college majors were (e.g. \"Lewis Johns, English Literature\"). It is during this time where Walter Peoples \"guarantees\" that no one's name would be called above his on graduation day.\n\nWhile the cadets begin their classes, Major Joy begins his ploy to discredit the cadets. During a classroom session, Joy has them retake the same flight exam they had to take to get into the program. Later, he takes Peoples on a flight after it is revealed that Peoples has a commercial pilot license. Joy takes the training aircraft, a [[PT-17]], through tricky and dangerous moves to try and break People's will, but the tactic doesn't work-which seems to frustrate Joy even more. Afterwards, Major Joy explains to Colonel Rogers why he decided to give the retest and Joy's beliefs that some (if not all) of the cadets may have cheated to get in the program. Rogers informs Joy that no one scored less than a 95 on the retest, and scorns Joy about his tactics.\n\nAfter a briefing with the cadets, Major Joy sends each cadet up on flights in their PT-17 training aircraft with an instructor pilot. It ends tragically for cadet Johns (Pheifer), as he struggles to get his aircraft out of a stall. The instructor also tries to regain control but it is too late, as the plane crashes into a building, exploding on impact and killing both Johns and his instructor. Afterwards, cadet Leroy Cappy (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) begins to let self-doubt creep in after seeing John's deadly crash and watching others leave the program. Cadets Lee and Peoples give Cappy a stern pep talk, telling him not to quit. The cadets continue their training, flying with their instructor pilots and controlling the planes on their own. Major Joy even lets cadet Lee make several solo flights around the Base. While watching a film on air combat, Lt. Glenn steps in and begins to teach the cadets. Peoples questions Lt. Glenn on why he, not Major Joy, is teaching air combat class. At this point, Lt. Glenn reveals to the cadets (most notably Peoples) that he had joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], where he was credited with three kills, making him the only Army Air Corps officer on the base with \"actual\" air combat experience.\n\n[[File:The Tuskegee Airmen (1995 film) screencap.jpg|thumb|left|Training base where Maj. Joy (Christopher McDonald) instructs the trainees for the first time.]] Peoples and Lee, flying solo each in the [[AT-6 Texan]] training plane, take part in a mock dogfight where Peoples gets an edge on Lee and \"shoots him down\". Afterwards, Peoples performs some unauthorized aerobatic maneuvers (buzzing the airfield, barrel rolling) to impress Hannibal, but this also catches the attention of Colonel Rogers and Major Joy, and results in him being removed from the training program. Peoples admits to Colonel Rogers and Major Joy that he made a mistake and pleads with them not to put him out of the program, but to no avail. To avoid going home in disgrace, an emotionally distraught Peoples commandeers an AT-6, takes off with it and commits suicide by deliberately crashing it.\n\nBack at the cadets' barracks, tensions and emotions following Peoples' death begin to reach the boiling point. Cadet Roberts has a heated exchange with cadet Lee on Major Joy's tactics, saying that Joy set out to break Peoples and killed him \"like putting a [[carbine]] to his head\". Cadet Cappy - again letting his own self doubts creep back in - sides with Roberts against Lee, saying that he doesn't see any reason to continue on if Major Joy is going to stick with his attempts to break them as well. Cadet Lee fires back, saying that Major Joy's gameplan was to make them quit, and that he wasn't falling for it. He emphatically says that he isn't going to let Major Joy, anyone else at the Base, or \"the God damned [[Commander-In-Chief]] himself\" stop him from his dreams of flying.\n\nLt. Glenn and cadets Lee, Roberts and Cappy are on a routine training mission when Cappy's plane begins to experience trouble. Cappy and Lee land on a country road where a prison chain gang are out working in a roadside field. As the planes are coming in to land, the prison guards over the gang force the prisoners out of the way to make room for the planes to land. The guards stand with a mixed look of praise and curiosity when the cadets exit the aircraft; their emotions turn to utter shock when Lee and Cappy take their flight masks off, revealing themselves as black aviators.\n\nThe cadets go on to successfully \"earn their wings\" and are commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants in the Army Air Corps. However, they are not deployed to the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre]] due to congressional concerns over their race. Later, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] arrives for an inspection. She chooses Lee to take her up in an aircraft. With the ensuing positive press coverage, the men are deployed to North Africa, as part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, though they are relegated to ground attack missions. During the campaign, Lee's flight encounters a group of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s. Ignoring Lee's orders, Cappy breaks formation and attacks, downing one of them. Another Bf 109 hits Cappy's fighter aircraft numerous times, causing a fire in the cockpit and fatally wounding him. Cappy is then killed when his damaged fighter plane crashes after catching fire.\n\nA congressional hearing of the House Armed Services Committee is convened to determine whether the Tuskegee Airmen \"experiment\" should continue. The men are charged with inherent incompetence: A medical study is used to claim that \"Negroes are incapable of handling complex machinery.\" The hearing decides in the Tuskegee Airmen's favor, due to testimony by their commanding officer, Lt. Col. [[Benjamin O. Davis Jr.|Benjamin O. Davis]] ([[Andre Braugher]]), and the 99th Pursuit Squadron joins three new squadrons out of Tuskegee to form the all-black [[332nd Fighter Group]], under the now Col. Benjamin O. Davis.\n\nThe 332nd is deployed to [[Ramitelli Airfield|Ramitelli]], Italy to provide escort for [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers, which are experiencing heavy losses. During this deployment, Lee and Billy Roberts (Cuba Gooding Jr.) sink a [[destroyer]]. They also rescue a straggling B-17 which is being attacked by two German fighters while returning from a bombing raid, shooting down both of the enemy Bf 109s. When the bomber's pilot and co-pilot travel to Ramitelli to thank them, the B-17 pilot refuses to believe that black pilots saved them. During a subsequent escort assignment, Roberts is shot down. Later, Lee is awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for sinking the destroyer and promoted to captain. Having by then earned the respect and admiration of the white bomber pilots, the Tuskegee Airmen are specifically requested for escort for a raid on Berlin - a request advanced in a mission briefing by the same pilot who originally refused to believe that the 332nd had helped his plane.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

Linking up with [[Frank Price]], owner of Price Productions in 1985 finally gained some traction for the project and when financing was eventually obtained nearly 10 years later, Williams stayed on as co-executive producer and Price as executive producer.<ref name=\"Variety\">Scott, Tony.[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117910076.html?categoryid=32&cs=1&p=0  \" 'The Tuskegee Airmen' review.\"] ''Variety.com.''.

Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson]], the first African American to earn his pilot's license and the first flight instructor of the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) organized at the [[Tuskegee Institute]]. She had the photograph of her in a training aircraft with a black pilot at the controls widely circulated. Other than some differences in physical appearance and profile, Andre Braugher's portrayal of \"B.O.\" Davis and his role as the commanding officer pointedly was an accurate depiction of the unit's first commander's personality and character.\n\nLocation shooting took place at [[Fort Chaffee]], right outside of [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]]. The barracks had been used in the filming of [[Biloxi Blues]] (1988), another wartime story. The principal photography also utilized locations at [[Juliette, Georgia]], [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] as well as studio work in [[Los Angeles]], California. A collection of period aircraft including [[North American T-6 Texan]]s and [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s were representative of the many types flown by the Tuskegee Airmen. A small number of authentic P-51 fighter aircraft in appropriate \"red tail\" colors were employed in the aerial sequences.\n\nIn addition, a limited number of period  gun-cin\u00e9 films were also used,<ref name=\"Variety\"/> as were sequences from the films, ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' (1990) and ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (1969).  The producers also borrowed a technique used in ''Memphis Belle'' by using cutout silhouettes of aircraft to make it appear that there were more aircraft parked at the various airfields. One example of period dialogue that was faithful to the times was Hannibal Lee Jr. (another fictitious composite) singing: \"Straighten up...\" finished by Billy Roberts (fictional character): \"...and fly right.\" (The catchphrase was derived from the 1944 top-40 hit record, [[1944 in country music|\"Straighten Up and Fly Right\"]] by The King Cole Trio led by [[Nat King Cole]].)<ref name=\"Quotes\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114745/quotes \" 'The Tuskegee Airmen' (1995) Quotes.\"] ''IMDb''.

In 2001, a home video/DVD version was also released in  both formats. The transfer was done in 1.78:1 aspect ratio, which exactly fills a 16x9 display, and is anamorphically enhanced.<ref>[https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/tuskegee.php \" 'The Tuskegee Airmen'.\"] ''DVD Verdict''. Retrieved: January 3, 2010.</ref>\n\nAlthough shortcomings were noted by critics generally focusing on clich\u00e9d dialogue and slow, stagy scenes, however, the overall impression by the public was mostly favorable.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nBesides the character of [[Colonel]] [[Benjamin O. Davis Jr.]],(who is actually among the attendees during the wing pinning ceremony scene) played by [[Andre Braugher]], no other actual real-life Tuskegee airmen were portrayed in this film. Other featured Tuskegee Airmen characters are composites of the men with whom Williams served.\n\nAt one point the character Lewis Johns ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), recites \"[[Strange Fruit]]\" to the other recruits in their barracks. \"Strange Fruit\" is a song recorded by [[Billie Holiday]] in 1939, inspired by a poem by [[Abel Meeropol]] after he witnessed the [[lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith]].\n\nAt the end, the film details the unit's accomplishments: 66 out of the 450 Tuskegee Airmen died in battle, they engaged and defeated [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]s, the first operational jet fighters, and they were awarded a total of 850 medals over the course of the war. The credits also note (inaccurately, but a common belief of the time) that the 332nd never lost a single bomber to enemy fighter action. The claim at the end of the film that the 332nd never lost a single bomber to enemy fighter action is a source of [[Tuskegee Airmen#Controversy over escort record|historical controversy]]. This statement was repeated for many years, and not challenged because of the esteem of the Tuskegee Airmen. However, Air Force records and eyewitness accounts later showed that at least 25 bombers were lost to enemy fire.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-01-tuskegee-airmen_N.htm \"Report: Tuskegee Airmen lost 25 bombers.\"] ''USA Today'', April 1, 2007.
