Its title derives from the expression \"[[peeping Tom]]\", which describes a [[voyeur]].\n\nThe film's controversial subject matter and its extremely harsh reception by critics had a severely negative impact on Powell's career as a director in the United Kingdom.

Shown from the point of view of the camera viewfinder, he follows the woman into her flat, murders her, and later watches the film in his den. The following morning, Lewis films the police's removal of Dora's corpse from her home, posing as a reporter.\n\nLewis is a member of a film crew who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. He also works part-time photographing soft-porn pin-up pictures of women, sold under the counter. He is a shy, reclusive young man who hardly socializes outside of his workplace. He lives in the house of his late father, renting most of it via an agent while posing as a tenant himself. Helen Stephens ([[Anna Massey]]), a sweet-natured young woman who lives with her [[blindness|blind]] mother in the flat below his, befriends him out of curiosity after he has been discovered spying on her 21st birthday party.\n\nMark reveals to Helen through home films taken by his father that, as a child, he was used as a [[Human subject research|guinea pig]] for his father's psychological experiments on fear and the nervous system. Mark's father would study his son's reaction to various stimuli, such as lizards he put on his bed and would film the boy in all sorts of situations, even going as far as recording his son's reactions as he sat with his mother on her deathbed. He kept his son under constant watch and even wired all the rooms so that he could spy on him. Mark's father's studies enhanced his reputation as a renowned psychologist.\n\nMark arranges with Vivian ([[Moira Shearer]]), a [[stand-in]] at the studio, to make a film after the set is closed; he then kills her and stuffs her into a prop trunk. The body is discovered later during shooting by Diane, a female cast member who has already antagonized the director by fainting for real at points which are not in the script. The police link the two murders and notice that each victim died with a look of utter terror on her face. They interview everyone on the set, including Mark, who always keeps his camera running, claiming that he is making a documentary.\n\nHelen goes out to dinner with Mark, even persuading him to leave his camera behind for once, and briefly kisses him once they return. Her mother, Mrs. Stephens, finds his behavior peculiar; aware, despite her blindness, how often Mark looks through Helen's window. Mrs. Stephens is waiting inside Mark's flat after his evening out with her daughter. Unable to wait until she leaves due to his compulsion, he begins screening his latest snuff film with her still in the room. She senses how emotionally disturbed he is and threatens to move, but Mark reassures her that he will never photograph or film Helen.\n\nA [[psychiatrist]] is called to the set to console Diane. He chats with Mark and is familiar with his father's work. The psychiatrist relates the details of the conversation to the police, noting that Mark has \"his father's eyes\". Mark is tailed by the police to the newsagents, where he takes photographs of the pin-up model Milly ([[Pamela Green]]). Slightly later, it emerges that Mark has killed Milly before returning home.\n\nHelen, who is curious about Mark's films, finally runs one of them. She becomes visibly upset and then frightened when he catches her. Mark reveals that he makes the films so that he can capture the fear of his victims. He has mounted a round mirror atop his camera so that he can capture the reactions of his victims as they see their impending deaths. He points the tripod's knife towards Helen's throat but refuses to kill her.\n\nThe police arrive and Mark realizes he is cornered. As he planned from the very beginning, he impales himself on the knife with the camera running, providing the finale for his documentary. The last shot shows Helen crying over Mark's dead body as the police enter the room.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Karlheinz B\u00f6hm|Karlheinz \"Carl\" Boehm]] as Mark Lewis\n* Columba Powell as Young Mark Lewis (uncredited)\n* [[Anna Massey]] as Helen Stephens\n* [[Moira Shearer]] as Vivian\n* [[Maxine Audley]] as Mrs. Stephens\n* [[Brenda Bruce]] as Dora\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as Elderly gentleman customer\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Arthur Baden\n* [[Martin Miller (actor)|Martin Miller]] as Dr. Rosan\n* [[Michael Goodliffe]] as Don Jarvis\n* [[Jack Watson (actor)|Jack Watson]] as Chief Insp.

However, several critics argue that the film is as much about the voyeurism of the audience as they watch the protagonist's actions. [[Roger Ebert]], in his 1999 review of the film for his \"Great Films\" series, states that \"the movies make us into voyeurs. We sit in the dark, watching other people's lives. It is the bargain the cinema strikes with us, although most films are too well-behaved to mention it\".<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news | title= Great Movie: Peeping Tom | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-peeping-tom-1960 |work=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC| author-link=Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger |access-date=18 September 2006 |date=2 May 1999}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]], who has long been an admirer of Powell's works, has stated that this film, along with [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8\u00bd]]'', contains all that can be said about directing:\n\n{{blockquote|I have always felt that ''Peeping Tom'' and ''8\u00bd'' say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two. ''8\u00bd'' captures the glamour and enjoyment of film-making, while ''Peeping Tom'' shows the aggression of it, how the camera violates... From studying them you can discover everything about people who make films, or at least people who express themselves through films.<ref name=gritten/>}}\n\nAccording to Paul Wells, the film deals with the anxieties of British culture in regarding sexual repression, patriarchal obsession, voyeuristic pleasure and perverse violence. The impossible task in the film is the quest to photograph fear itself.{{sfn|Wells|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqCRRbx1bsC&pg=PA68 68]}}\n\nIn the opinion of Peter Keough, the death scenes of the film would provide a field day to Freudian [[psychoanalysis]] and deconstructionists. Cinema here is equated to sexual aggression and a death wish, the camera to the [[phallus]], photography to violation, and film to ritualized voyeurism. The emphasis of the film lies on morbidity, not on eroticism. In a memorable sequence, an attractive, semi-nude female character turns to the camera and reveals a disfiguring facial scar. This peeping tom is turned on not by naked bodies, but naked fear. And as Mark laments, whatever he photographs is lost to him. Mark is a loner whose only companion is his film camera. He is also the victim of his father's studies in the phenomenon of fear in children, a human guinea pig subjected to sadistic experiments. His love interest Helen has her own fascination with a morbid gaze. She is a children's writer whose book concerns a magic camera and what it photographs.{{sfn|Keough|2005|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pWH97tY1KfMC&pg=PA219 219\u201321]}}\n\n===Relationship with Hitchcock's films===\nThe themes of voyeurism in ''Peeping Tom'' are also explored in several films by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. In his book on Hitchcock's 1958 film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', film historian Charles Barr points out that the film's title sequence and several shots seem to have inspired moments in ''Peeping Tom''.{{sfn|Barr|2002|p=18}}\n\nChris Rodley's documentary ''A Very British Psycho'' (1997) draws comparisons between ''Peeping Tom'' and Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''; the latter film was given its New York premiere in June 1960, two months after ''Peeping Tom''{{'}}s premiere in London. Both films feature as protagonists atypically mild-mannered serial killers who are obsessed with their parents. However, despite containing material similar to ''Peeping Tom'', ''Psycho'' became a box-office success and only increased the popularity and fame of its director (although the film was widely criticized in the English press). One reason suggested in the documentary is that Hitchcock, seeing the negative press reaction to ''Peeping Tom'', decided to release ''Psycho'' without a press screening.<ref name=british>{{cite AV media|title=Peeping Tom (''A Very British Psycho'' Documentary)|year=1997|people=Rodley, Chris (dir.)|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nIn his early career, Powell worked as a stills photographer and in other positions on Hitchcock's films, and the two were friends throughout their careers. A variant of ''Peeping Tom''{{'}}s main conceit, ''The Blind Man'', was one of [[List of unproduced Hitchcock projects#The Blind Man (1960)|Hitchcock's unproduced films]] around this time. Here, a blind pianist receives the eyes of a murder victim, but their [[retina]]s retain the image of the murder.\n\nAccording to Isabelle McNeill, the film fits well within the [[slasher film]] subgenre, which was influenced by ''Psycho''. She lists a number of elements which it shares with both ''Psycho'' and the genre in general:{{sfn|McNeill|2008|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=r7I7CCd-A9cC&pg=PT103#v=onepage 103-108]}}\n* a recognizably human killer, who stands as the psychotic product of a sick family\n* the victim being a beautiful and sexually active woman\n* the location of the murder being not within a home, but within some other \"terrible place\"\n* the weapon being something other than a [[gun]]\n* the attack registered from the victim's point of view and coming with shocking suddenness\nShe finds that the film actually goes further than ''Psycho'' into slasher territory through introducing a series of female victims, and with Helen Stephens functioning as the bright and sympathetic [[final girl]].{{sfn|McNeill|2008|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=r7I7CCd-A9cC&pg=PT103#v=onepage 103-108]}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[Leo Marks]] based portions of the film on his experience growing up as the son of Benjamin Marks, who owned the [[Marks & Co]] book store in London; elements of ''Peeping Tom'' is based on his observations of inner-city residents who frequented his father's store.<ref name=british/> The prostitute, Dora, who is murdered in the film's opening scene, was based on a real-life prostitute who was a regular patron of the Marks & Co book store.<ref name=british/> Additionally, Marks stated he was inspired to write a horror story and to become a codebreaker after reading \"[[The Gold-Bug]]\" by American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=british/> While writing the script, Marks believed the motivations behind Lewis' murder to be entirely sexual, though he would state in retrospect that he felt the psychological compulsion of the character was less sexual than it was [[unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref name=british/> Prior to writing the screenplay for ''Peeping Tom'', Marks, a [[polymath]], had worked as [[Cryptography|cryptographer]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=british/>\n\n===Casting and filming===\nCohen originally wanted a star to play the lead role and suggested [[Dirk Bogarde]] but the [[Rank Organisation]], who had him under contract, refused to loan him out.

The three films had different production companies but the same distributor. They are connected through their themes of voyeurism, disfigurement, and sadistic figures. Anglo-Amalgamated films were typically released in the United States by [[American International Pictures]] through a deal between the two companies. But AIP was not interested in releasing ''Peeping Tom'', apparently skeptical of its ability to satisfy audiences.{{sfn|Heffernan|2004|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=plztfOxO1HoC&pg=PA128 128\u201331]}}\n\nIn the United States, the film was released by importer and distributor [[Astor Pictures]] in 1962. It was released simultaneously to the markets for genre [[horror film]]s, [[art film]]s, and [[exploitation film]]s. It failed to find an audience and was one of the least successful releases by Astor. The film received a B rating from the [[National Legion of Decency]], signifying \"morally objectionable in part\" content. The organization identified voyeurism and sadism as key elements of the film in its rating.{{sfn|Heffernan|2004|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=plztfOxO1HoC&pg=PA114 114-15]}}\n\n=== Censorship ===\nWhen ''Peeping Tom'' was first released in Italy in 1960 the [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|Committee for the Theatrical Review]] of the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities]] rated it as [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|VM16]]: not suitable for children under 16.

Thompson|David Thompson]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] mentions that he first heard of the film as a film student in the early 1960s, when ''Peeping Tom'' opened in only one theatre in [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]], which, Scorsese notes, was a seedy district of New York. The film was released in a cut black-and-white print but immediately became a cult fascination among Scorsese's generation.{{sfn|Meehan|2010|p=191}} Scorsese states that the film, in this mutilated form, influenced [[Jim McBride]]'s ''[[David Holzman's Diary]]''. Scorsese himself first saw the film in 1970 through a friend who owned an uncut 35mm colour print. In 1978, Scorsese was approached by a New York distributor, Corinth Films, which asked for $5,000 for a wider re-release. Scorsese gladly complied with their request, which allowed the film to reach a wider audience than its initial cult following.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martin Scorsese restores British masterpiece |work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=9 November 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2010/nov/09/martin-scorsese-peeping-tom|access-date=22 November 2017}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] wrote of the film in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1979: {{blockquote|When Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' was originally released in England, in 1960, the critics rose up like a bunch of furious Reverend Davidsons to condemn it on moral grounds. \"It stinks\", one critic wrote. Another thought it should be flushed down the sewer, and a third dismissed it haughtily as \"perverted nonsense\". There is nothing angrier than a critic when he can be safely outraged... ''Peeping Tom''{{'}}s rediscovery, I fear, tells us more about fads in film criticism than it does about art. Only someone madly obsessed with being the first to hail a new auteur, which is always a nice way of calling attention to oneself, could spend the time needed to find genius in the erratic works of Mr. Powell.<ref>{{cite web|author-link=Vincent Canby|last=Canby|first=Vincent|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Film: Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom'|date=14 October 1979|access-date=22 November 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/14/archives/film-michael-powells-peeping-tom-the-cast.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041839/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C00E4D7153EE732A25757C1A9669D946890D6CF|archive-date=16 December 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nFilm theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] echoed a similar sentiment, writing: \"''Peeping Tom'' is a film of many layers and masks; its first reviewers were unable even to see it at face value. Entrenched in the traditions of English realism, these early critics saw an immoral film set in real life whose ironic comment on the mechanics of film spectatorship and identification confused them as viewers. But ''Peeping Tom'' offers realistic cinematic images that relate to the cinema and nothing more. It creates a magic space for its fiction somewhere between the camera\u2019s lens and the projector\u2019s beam of light on the screen\".<ref>{{cite web|author-link=Laura Mulvey|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|date=15 November 1999|access-date=22 November 2017|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/65-peeping-tom|work=The Current|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|title=Peeping Tom}}</ref>\n\nBefore his death in 1990, Powell saw the reputation of ''Peeping Tom'' rise and rise.
