A strange chance causes Hawkins to become a spy in the guise of a [[court jester]] in the usurping King's castle, where there are many people who wish to make use of the Jester for their own villainous ends. The film contains three songs (all sung by Kaye), makes heavy use of [[slapstick comedy]] and quick-witted [[wordplay]], and is best remembered for the [[tongue twister]] \"The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true!\"\n\nThough the film was not financially successful upon release, it has grown to be a beloved classic, earning high scores on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Thanks!-->\nKing Roderick the Tyrant, having sent Lord Ravenhurst to slaughter the Royal Family of [[Medieval England|England]], usurps the throne. The Black Fox and his band of rebels rescue the true king, an infant with the royal \"purple pimpernel\" birthmark on his backside. They harass Roderick and his men while guarding the baby. Lords Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee convince the king to seek alliance with Sir Griswold of MacElwain, by offering him Roderick's daughter Gwendolyn in marriage. Gwendolyn objects, for the castle witch Griselda foretold a more gallant lover.\n\nHubert Hawkins, the Black Fox's [[minstrel]], brings a troupe of acrobat-[[midget]]s from the carnival to replace him so he can fight, but the Black Fox refuses. The King's men find their hideout, so Hawkins and another rebel, Maid Jean, are ordered to disguise themselves as wine merchants and take the baby to safety. They meet the king's newly hired jester, Giacomo, on the road. Jean knocks him out and tells Hawkins to steal his identity. Hawkins heads for the castle, and Jean travels on alone, but is captured by the king's men, who were ordered to bring the fairest wenches to the king's court.\n\nThe Lord Ravenhurst tells a friend that Giacomo is actually an assassin whom he hired to kill Brockhurst, Finsdale, and Pertwee, to prevent the alliance. Gwendolyn decides to kill Griselda for lying to her, until Griselda promises Giacomo as her prophesied lover. Hawkins, unaware of both these things, enters the castle and tries to make contact with a rebel confederate. However, Ravenhurst unwittingly appears at his whistle signal, so Hawkins allies himself with him instead. Prior to his arrival, Fergus the [[Hostler]], the true confederate, met up with Jean and hid the baby in a basket. Jean sneaks into the palace and steals a key to a secret passage from King Roderick's chambers.\n\nHawkins is put under a hypnotic spell by Griselda, and in that state woos the princess, receives his orders to kill the three lords from Ravenhurst, and gets the key from Jean, but loses it back to the king. Hawkins forgets all this once the spell is gone. Fergus gives him the basket with the baby, but before he can get it to safety, Hawkins is called before the king. He manages to distract the king and crowd from noticing the basket with a well-received performance, and Jean rescues the basket. Griselda, meanwhile, poisons the three lords' cups to prevent the alliance. Ravenhurst believes Hawkins killed them.\n\nGriswold arrives, but Gwendolyn declares her love for \"Giacomo\", and Hawkins is arrested and jailed. Ravenhurst learns that Giacomo never arrived and concludes that Hawkins, having 'sabotaged' the alliance, must be the Black Fox. He convinces Roderick to rush Hawkins through the trials to become a knight so he can duel Griswold, ostensibly so Griswold can kill the jester but really so the Black Fox can eliminate Griswold.\n\nJean steals back the key, and Fergus sends it by [[carrier pigeon|pigeon]] to the real Black Fox, but is caught and tortured to death by Ravenhurst's men. At the tournament, Griselda poisons one of the drinks and tells Hawkins which it is. One of Griswold's men overhears and warns Griswold, and he and Hawkins both struggle to remember which of the glasses is poisoned (the famous \"Vessel with the [[Pestle]]\" routine) and end up not drinking the toast. Through sheer luck, Hawkins defeats Griswold in the duel, but spares his life and sends him away.\n\nRavenhurst finds the baby and exposes Hawkins as a traitor. However, the real Black Fox sends the midgets through the secret passage, and they rescue Hawkins, Jean, and the baby. Jean clubs the door guard and lets the Black Fox's army into the castle. Threatened by Gwendolyn, Griselda hypnotizes Hawkins to become a sword master and he duels Ravenhurst, though the spell is accidentally switched on and off several times. Finally, Hawkins and Jean launch Ravenhurst from a catapult into the sea.\n\nGriswold returns with his army, ready to kill the rebels, but Hawkins shows him the purple pimpernel birthmark on the baby. Griswold kneels to the baby, as does everyone else, including Roderick. Hawkins leads everybody in song as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n(as listed in order of appearance in opening credits)\n* [[Danny Kaye]] as Hubert Hawkins, a minstrel who steals Giacomo the Jester's identity\n* [[Glynis Johns]] as Maid Jean, a rebel captain and Hawkins' love interest\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as Lord Ravenhurst, the King's closest adviser\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Gwendolyn, Princess of England\n* [[Cecil Parker]] as Roderick, faux King of England and father of Gwendolyn\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Griselda, a witch and adviser to Gwendolyn\n* [[Robert Middleton]] as Sir Griswold of MacElwain, Gwendolyn's betrothed\n* [[Michael Pate]] as Sir Locksley, Ravenhurst's lackey and ally\n* [[Herbert Rudley]] as the Captain of the Guard, one of Ravenhurst's lackeys\n* [[Noel Drayton]] as Fergus the Hostler, a spy of the Black Fox in Roderick's castle\n* [[John Carradine]] as Giacomo, an Italian jester and assassin, hired by Ravenhurst\n* [[Edward Ashley-Cooper|Edward Ashley]] as the Black Fox, a rebel leader \n* [[Alan Napier]] as Lord Brockhurst, adviser to Roderick\n* [[Lewis Martin (actor)|Lewis Martin]] as Lord Finsdale, adviser to Roderick\n* [[Pat Aherne|Patrick Aherne]] as Lord Pertwee, adviser to Roderick\n* Richard Kean as Archbishop\n* Hermine's Midgets as Hubert Hawkins' acrobatic troupe\n* The American Legion Zouaves (of Richard F.

Film composer [[Elmer Bernstein]] was hired as the assistant musical director to Schoen. ''The Court Jester'' was an enormous challenge for Schoen at the time because it was his first feature film. He was not formally trained on the mechanisms of how music was synchronized to film \u2013 he learned on the job. The film  required 100 minutes of music for Schoen to compose and arrange. Some pieces in the film (also known as \"cues\") were very long, and took many hours for Schoen to finesse. One piece that Schoen was most proud of in his career was the chase music toward the end of the movie when [[Danny Kaye]]'s character engages in a sword fight. Schoen wrote a mini [[piano concerto]] for this scene.\n\nA pleasant surprise happened during the recording session of ''The Court Jester''. The red \"recording in progress\" light was illuminated to ensure no interruptions, so Schoen started to conduct a cue but noticed that the entire orchestra had turned to look at [[Igor Stravinsky]], who had just walked into the studio. Schoen said, \"The entire room was astonished to see this short little man with a big chest walk in and listen to our session. I later talked with him after we were done recording. We went and got a cup of coffee together. After listening to my music Stravinsky told me 'You have broken all the rules'. At the time I didn't understand his comment because I had been self-taught. It took me years to figure out what he had meant.\"\n\nThe film's opening song, \"Life Could Not Better Be\" breaks the [[fourth wall]] by having Kaye make direct references to the cast and crew, at one point also joking about which of the credited songwriters actually wrote the songs. Although not an uncommon trope in musical film comedies of the era (such as [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]]'s \"Road\" films (several of which were also written by Panama & Frank)), in the context of the film these references also hark back to medieval theatrical performances that often began with an actor explaining the plot and how the play came to be made.\n\n==Audio version==\nIn September 1955, Kaye recorded a nine-minute-long, condensed version of ''The Court Jester'' for 1956 release by [[Decca Records]] on the two-part single K 166.<ref>\"Review Spotlight\", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', March 3, 1956.</ref> The simplified version of the storyline features excerpts from several songs from the film, but eliminates the character of Hubert; in the 45 single version, The Fox impersonates Giacomo throughout. Lord Ravenhurst is replaced by an unnamed evil king, and Jean is also dropped from the tale.
