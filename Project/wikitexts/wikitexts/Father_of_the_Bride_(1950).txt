Carroll]]. It was adapted by [[Frances Goodrich]] and [[Albert Hackett]] from [[Father of the Bride (novel)|the 1949 novel]] by [[Edward Streeter]]. ''Father of the Bride'' was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]], [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Father of the bride 1950 promo.jpg|thumb|right|Stanley T. Banks (Tracy) and Kay Dunstan (Taylor) in the wedding scene]]\n[[File:Father of the Bride.JPG|thumb|right|Joan Bennett in the film credits]]\nFollowing the wedding of his daughter Kay ([[Elizabeth Taylor]]), Stanley T. Banks ([[Spencer Tracy]]), a successful suburban [[lawyer]], recalls the day, three months earlier, when he first learned of Kay's engagement to Buckley Dunstan ([[Don Taylor (American actor and director)|Don Taylor]]). At the family dinner table, Kay's casual announcement that she is in love with Buckley and has accepted his proposal makes Stanley feel uneasy, but he soon comes to realize that his daughter has grown up and the wedding is inevitable. While Ellie ([[Joan Bennett]]), Kay's mother, immediately begins making preparations for the wedding, Stanley lies awake at night, fearing the worst for his daughter.\n\nStanley's misgivings about the marriage eventually make Ellie anxious, and she insists that Kay introduce them to Buckley's parents. Kay calls the tradition \"old-fashioned rigamarole,\" but arranges the meeting nevertheless. Before the introduction, Stanley has a private conversation with Buckley, and is pleased to learn that the young man is the head of a small company and that he is capable of providing a comfortable life for Kay. The Bankses' first meeting with Doris and Herbert, Buckley's parents, gets off to an awkward start, and goes from bad to worse when Stanley drinks too much and falls asleep in the wealthy Dunstans' living room.\n\nFollowing Kay and Buckley's [[engagement party]], Stanley, who misses the entire party because he is in the kitchen mixing drinks, realizes that his plans for a small wedding have been swept aside and he will be expected to pay for an extravagant wedding \"with all the trimmings.\"  As costs for the June event spiral out of control, Stanley calculates that he can afford to accommodate no more than one hundred-and-fifty guests. The task of paring down the guest list proves too difficult, however, and Stanley reluctantly consents to a 250-person reception. To save costs, Stanley suggests to Kay that she and Buckley elope. Kay is at first shocked by the suggestion, then reconsiders, supports the idea, and conveys that to her mother. Ellie strongly disapproves of eloping, which causes Stanley to express his disapproval too, making it appear the idea was originally Kay's.\n\nThe plans for a lavish wedding continue until the day that Buckley tells Kay that he wants to take her on a fishing trip in Nova Scotia for their [[honeymoon]]. Kay reacts to the announcement with shock and calls off the wedding, but she and Buckley soon reconcile, and the two families begin their wedding rehearsals. On the day of the wedding, chaos reigns at the Banks home as final preparations are made for the reception. The wedding ceremony brings both joy and sorrow to Stanley, as he realizes that his daughter is now a woman and no longer his child. During the reception, Stanley tries to find Kay so he can kiss the bride but only manages to see her leaving on her honeymoon. Ellie and Stanley survey the mess in their home and concur that the entire affair was a great success. Kay calls and tells her father she loves him and thanks her parents for everything they have done for her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2894/Father-of-the-Bride/|title=Father of the Bride (1950) - Overview|publisher=TCM.com (Turner Classic Movies)|access-date=2011-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]]  as Stanley T.

Minnelli believed Tracy was capable of handling a role that balanced humor with fatherly tenderness. After some miscommunication with the producers, Jack Benny was brought in for a reading. He was too comedic and couldn\u2019t handle the dramatic aspects of the film. When Tracy heard another actor was being tested, he turned down the movie. Minnelli asked Katharine Hepburn to invite Tracy to a dinner party where he later convinced Tracy to join the production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brady |first=Thomas F. |date=January 3, 1950 |title=Billie Burke Cast In Metro Comedy |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=34 }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film premiered on May 18, 1950 at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The premiere of ''Father of the Bride'' took place 12 days after Elizabeth Taylor's real-life marriage to her first husband [[Conrad Hilton Jr.|Nicky Hilton]], an event that MGM exploited in its publicity campaign for the picture.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Laura C. |date=January 26, 1996 |title=Elizabeth Taylor's divorce from Nicky Hilton |url=https://ew.com/article/1996/01/26/elizabeth-taylors-divorce-nicky-hilton/ |access-date=2022-08-06 |website=EW.com |language=en}}</ref> [[Helen Rose]], who designed Taylor's gown for the film, also designed her wedding gown.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Esquevin |first=Christian |date=2014-08-24 |title=ELIZABETH TAYLOR & DESIGNER HELEN ROSE |url=http://silverscreenmodes.com/elizabeth-taylor-designer-helen-rose/ |access-date=2022-08-06 |website=Silver Screen Modes by Christian Esquevin |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nReviews from critics were generally positive.
