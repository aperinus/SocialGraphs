A French-Italian co-production, the film stars [[Pierre Brasseur]] and [[Alida Valli]]. Based on the novel of the same name by Jean Redon, it revolves around a [[plastic surgeon]] who is determined to perform a [[face transplant]] on his daughter, who was disfigured in a car accident. During the film's production, consideration was given to the standards of European censors by setting the right tone, minimizing gore and eliminating the [[mad scientist]] character. Although ''Eyes Without a Face'' was cleared by censors, its release in Europe caused controversy nevertheless. Critical reaction ranged from praise to disgust.\n\nIn the United States, an edited and dubbed version of the film, titled '''''The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus''''', was released in 1962 as a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Manster]]''. The film's initial critical reception was not overtly positive, but subsequent theatrical and home video re-releases improved its reputation.{{sfn|Schneider|2005|p=365}} Modern critics praise ''Eyes Without a Face'' for its poetic nature as well as for being an influence on other filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nAt night just outside Paris, a woman drives along a riverbank and dumps a corpse in the river. After the body is recovered, Dr. G\u00e9nessier identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane, whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance, for which he was responsible. Dr. G\u00e9nessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged [[German Shepherd]]s and other large dogs.\n\nFollowing Christiane's funeral, Dr. G\u00e9nessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to G\u00e9nessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. G\u00e9nessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. G\u00e9nessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fianc\u00e9 Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. G\u00e9nessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.\n\n[[File:Eyes Without A Face (screen capture).png|left|thumb|alt= Black and white screen capture of the film showing character Christiane wearing her white featureless mask that covers her face.|Christiane (\u00c9dith Scob) fails to make a phone call to Jacques Vernon. Scob's face is hidden behind a face-like mask for most of the film.]]\nLouise lures a young Swiss girl named Edna Gr\u00fcber to G\u00e9nessier's home. G\u00e9nessier chloroforms Edna and takes her into his secret laboratory. Christiane secretly watches her father and Louise carry Edna to the lab, and then goes to tenderly caress the dogs her father keeps caged, who eagerly accept her love, and are unaffected by her appearance.\n\nDr. G\u00e9nessier performs [[Skin grafting|heterograft]] surgery, removing Edna's face. The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, G\u00e9nessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being [[Transplant rejection|rejected]] and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise.\n\nJacques reports the call to the police, who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot, an officer investigating Edna's disappearance, hires a young woman named Paulette M\u00e9rodon (recently arrested for shoplifting) to help investigate by checking herself into G\u00e9nessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. G\u00e9nessier. G\u00e9nessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him.\n\nWhile the doctor talks with the police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, while slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and murders Louise by stabbing her in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. G\u00e9nessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an abandoned German Shepherd he had only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit\u2014maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring his face in the process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside G\u00e9nessier's house with one of the freed doves in her hands.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Pierre Brasseur]] as Doctor G\u00e9nessier,  physician and father of Christiane. G\u00e9nessier experiments on his pet dogs and performs heterograft surgeries on women to try and restore the face of his daughter Christiane. Brasseur previously worked with director [[Georges Franju]] in the drama, ''[[La T\u00eate contre les murs]]'' (1958), again in a leading role playing a doctor.<ref name=\"latete\">{{cite web |last=Erickson |first=Hal |url=https://allmovie.com/movie/la-t%C3%AAte-contre-les-murs-v150916 |title=La T\u00eate Contre les Murs: Overview |work=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[\u00c9dith Scob]] as Christiane G\u00e9nessier, Doctor G\u00e9nessier's daughter. Christiane's face was damaged in a car accident caused by her father. For most of the film, her face is covered by a stiff mask that resembles her face before the accident. Like Brasseur, Scob was also cast by Franju in ''La T\u00eate Contre les Murs'', but in a  minor role.<ref name=\"latete\"/> Scob later worked with Franju on four other films.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Louise, a woman who is G\u00e9nessier's assistant, kidnaps young women, assists him in the laboratory and acts as a surrogate mother to Christiane. Louise aids G\u00e9nessier partly because of his help in restoring her damaged face in events that happened before the film begins. \n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Gu\u00e9rin]] as Jacques Vernon, a student of G\u00e9nessier and Christiane's fianc\u00e9. Jacques is unaware of Doctor G\u00e9nessier's criminal activity and believes Christiane is dead. After receiving a phone call from Christiane, he helps the police in investigating the crime. \n* [[Juliette Mayniel]] as Edna Gr\u00fcber, a young woman who becomes a victim of Doctor G\u00e9nessier's experiments after being befriended by Louise in Paris. Edna is the first woman whose face is successfully transplanted to Christiane. While recovering from the surgery, she attacks Louise and then leaps from a window at G\u00e9nessier's home and dies.\n* [[Alexandre Rignault]] as Inspector Parot, a police inspector investigating the disappearances of G\u00e9nessier's victims. Parot ultimately discovers that all of the missing girls have similar features.\n* [[B\u00e9atrice Altariba]] as Paulette M\u00e9rodon, a young woman who is taken into police custody after being caught shoplifting. Due to a resemblance with the women G\u00e9nessier has kidnapped, she is informed by Parot that the charges against her will be dropped if she checks into G\u00e9nessier's clinic. She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have her face transplanted, but is saved by Christiane before G\u00e9nessier is able to perform surgery on her.\n\n== Production ==\nAt the time, modern horror films had not been attempted by French film makers until producer Jules Borkon decided to tap into the horror market. Borkon bought the rights to the Redon novel and offered the directorial role to one of the founders of [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]], Franju, who was directing his first non-[[documentary film|documentary]] feature ''[[La T\u00eate contre les murs]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Ince|2005|p=48}} Franju had grown up during the French [[silent film|silent-film era]] when filmmakers such as [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] and [[Louis Feuillade]] were making [[fantastique]]-themed films, and he relished the opportunity to contribute to the genre.<ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media notes | title = Eyes Without a Face | orig-year = 1959 | others = [[Georges Franju|Franju, Georges]] | type = Booklet | publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]] | location = New York City | id = 260 | year = 2004}}</ref> Franju felt the story was not a horror film; rather, he described his vision of the film as one of \"anguish... it's a quieter mood than horror... more internal, more penetrating. It's horror in homeopathic doses.\"{{sfn|Turan|2005|p=92}}\n\nTo avoid problems with European censors, Borkon cautioned Franju not to include too much blood (which would upset [[Censorship in France|French censors]]), refrain from showing animals getting tortured (which would upset [[Censorship in the United Kingdom|English censors]]) and leave out mad-scientist characters (which would upset [[Censorship in Germany|German censors]]). All three of these were part of the novel, presenting a challenge to find the right tone for presenting these story elements in the film. First, working with [[Claude Sautet]] who was also serving as first assistant director and who laid out the preliminary screenplay, Franju hired the writing team of [[Boileau-Narcejac]] (Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) who had written novels adapted as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]'s ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955) and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Turan|2005|p=92}} The writers shifted the novel's focus from Doctor G\u00e9nessier's character to that of his daughter, Christiane; this shift revealed the doctor's character in a more positive and understandable light and helped to avoid the censorship restrictions.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nFor his production staff, Franju enlisted people with whom he had previously worked on earlier projects. Cinematographer [[Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan]], best remembered for developing the [[Sch\u00fcfftan process]], was chosen to render the visuals of the film. Sch\u00fcfftan had worked with Franju on ''La T\u00eate Contre les Murs'' (1958).<ref name=\"LesTeteProduction\">{{cite web |url=https://allmovie.com/movie/la-t%C3%AAte-contre-les-murs-v150916/cast-crew |title=La T\u00eate Contre les Murs : Production Credits |work=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=May 20, 2008}}</ref> Film historian David Kalat called Sh\u00fcfftan \"the ideal choice to illustrate Franju's nightmares\".<ref name=\"DVD\"/> French composer [[Maurice Jarre]] created the haunting score for the film.{{sfn|Turan|2005|p=92}} Jarre had also previously worked with Franju on his film ''La T\u00eate Contre les Murs'' (1958).<ref name=\"LesTeteProduction\" /> Modern critics have observed the film's two imposing musical themes, a jaunty [[carnival]]-esque waltz (featured while Louise picks up young women for Doctor G\u00e9nessier) and a lighter, sadder piece for Christiane.<ref name=\"dvdjournal\"/><ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web | url = http://slate.msn.com/id/2108869/ | title = Ick Flicks | access-date = October 20, 2008 | author = Edelstein, David | date = October 29, 2004 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080718193718/http://slate.msn.com/id/2108869 | archive-date = July 18, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"culturevulture\">{{cite web |last=Mairs |first=Gary |url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2108869/ |title=Eyes Without a Face (Les Yeux Sans Visage) |work=culturevulture.net |access-date=March 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718193718/http://slate.msn.com/id/2108869 |archive-date=July 18, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:Faustusmansterposter.png|right|thumb|alt= A film poster advertising for the films The Manster on the right and The Horror Chamber of Dr.Faustus on the left.

Franco's version of the story concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon, [[Dr. Orloff]], to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa. Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orloff using his girlfriend, Wanda Bronsky, as an undercover spy. Franco followed the film with several sequels to ''Gritos en la noche''.<ref name=\"allmovieOrlof\">{{Cite web |last=Firsching |first=Robert |url=https://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:88121 |title=The Awful Dr. Orlof |work=AllMovie |access-date=February 2, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/https://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archive-date=April 26, 2006 }}</ref> He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film, ''[[Faceless (1988 film)|Faceless]]'' (1988).
