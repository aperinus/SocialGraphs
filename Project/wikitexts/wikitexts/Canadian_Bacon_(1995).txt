J. Hacker, who had closed down his weapons manufacturing plant, Hacker Dynamics. At a conference held at the former plant, he pins the blame for the shutdown of his business on the [[President of the United States]], who has just arrived. The president defends his own belief that the future of the children is more important than war, which has caused major decline in his approval rating. After the conference, he expresses to confidantes General Dick Panzer and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Stuart Smiley, revealed to have ties with Hacker, his discontent about not having an enemy to engage in war. An attempted negotiation with [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Vladimir Kruschkin to start a new [[Second Cold War|cold war]] with Russia fails, and the president's suggestion of a war on [[international terrorism]] is deemed too absurd.\n\nSerendipitously, American sheriff Bud Boomer offensively criticizes [[Canadian beer]] while attending a hockey game between the neighboring nations in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. The ensuing brawl ends up on the news and catches Stuart's attention; Stuart, in turn, collects more information about Canada from a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent named Gus, and suggests Canada as their new enemy during a cabinet meeting. Before long, television channels are littered with anti-Canada [[propaganda]], which Boomer believes wholeheartedly. He prepares for war by distributing guns to his fellow sheriffs, including his girlfriend Honey and their friends Roy Boy and Kabral Jabar. He also helps form a local [[militia]]. After they apprehend a group of Americans \"dressed as Canadians\" attempting to destroy a hydroelectric plant, despite Gus's protests that they are just Americans, they sneak across the border to litter on Canadian lands, which leads to Honey being arrested by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. In a rescue attempt, Boomer, Roy Boy and Kabral sneak into a Canadian power plant and cause a countrywide blackout. When the president learns of this, Stuart orders the Omega Force to remove Boomer from Canada before it is too late.\n\nHacker, seeking revenge on the President for shutting down his business, uses a software program (\"Hacker Hellstorm\") to activate missile silos across the country. The President learns that the signal causing the activation of the silos originated from Canada, and summons Hacker. Hacker offers to sell a program to the President that can cancel out the Hellstorm\u2014for $1 trillion. Stuart, fed up with the President being too busy to give Hacker the money, realizes that Hacker, getting up to leave, is the one controlling the silos, not Canada, and, after storming up, takes the operating codes from him required to stop the Hellstorm (accidentally killing Hacker in the process). The President orders Stuart's arrest, despite his protests that he is now able to give the codes to the President so they could deactivate the missiles which are aimed at [[Moscow]]. As the launch time approaches the President pleads with [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] Clark MacDonald over the phone to stop the launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Honey was taken to a hospital upon her capture and escaped all the way to the [[CN Tower]]. She discovers the central computer for the Hellstorm and destroys it with a machine gun, aborting the launch sequence. She then reunites with Boomer, and they return to the United States on a speedboat.\n\nAn epilogue reveals the characters' fates: Boomer realizes his dream of appearing on ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''; Honey is named \"Humanitarian of the Year\" by the [[National Rifle Association]]; the president was defeated in the next election by a large landslide and now hosts ''Get Up, Cleveland''; Stuart served eight months in prison, but was pardoned by the new president [[Oliver North]]; Panzer committed suicide after learning that ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' was fictional; Gus was last spotted heading to [[Mexico]] in a tank; Hacker's body has been viewed daily at Republican National Headquarters; Kabral has become a hockey star, winning the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] three years in a row; Roy Boy's whereabouts become unknown; and MacDonald is \"still ruling with an iron fist\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Candy]] as Bud B.
