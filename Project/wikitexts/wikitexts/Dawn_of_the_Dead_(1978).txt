Romero]], and produced by [[Richard P. Rubinstein]]. An American-Italian [[international co-production]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Reel Terror: The Scary, Bloody, Gory, Hundred-Year History of Classic Horror Films |last=Konow |first=David |publisher= St. Martin's Publishing Group |date=October 2, 2012}}</ref> it is the second film in Romero's [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|series]] of [[zombie film]]s, and though it contains no characters or settings from the preceding film ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), it shows the larger-scale effects of a zombie apocalypse on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh. [[David Emge]], [[Ken Foree]], [[Scott Reiniger]], and [[Gaylen Ross]] star as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban [[shopping mall]] amid mass hysteria.\n\nRomero waited to make another zombie film after ''Night of the Living Dead'' for several years to avoid being stereotyped as a horror director. Upon visiting [[Monroeville Mall]] in [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]] with a friend whose company managed the complex, he decided to use the location as the basis for the film's story. The project came to the attention of Italian filmmaker [[Dario Argento]] who, along with his brother [[Claudio Argento|Claudio]] and producer Alfredo Cuomo, agreed to co-finance the film in exchange for its international distribution rights. Argento also consulted with Romero during the scriptwriting phase. [[Principal photography]] on ''Dawn of the Dead'' took place between November 1977 and February 1978 on location in Monroeville and [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/05/08/george-romero-fans-hoping-to-save-dawn-of-the-dead-bridge-at-monroeville-mall/|title=\"Dawn Of The Dead\" Fans Create Online Petition To Save Monroeville Mall Bridge|last=Highfield|first=David|work=[[CBS News]]|date=May 8, 2015|access-date=May 24, 2015|archive-date=May 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525035358/http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/05/08/george-romero-fans-hoping-to-save-dawn-of-the-dead-bridge-at-monroeville-mall/|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[special make-up effects]] were created by [[Tom Savini]], whose work on the film led to an extensive career creating similar effects for other horror films. In post-production, Romero and Argento edited separate versions of the film for their respective markets. Argento's version features a [[progressive rock]] score composed and performed by his frequent collaborators [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], while Romero's cut primarily favors [[Stock music|stock cues]] from the [[De Wolfe Music]] [[Library]].\n\nFollowing its Italian premiere on September 1, 1978, ''Dawn of the Dead'' was released in other markets the following year. Despite facing difficulties with various national censorship boards \u2015 in the United States, it was released unrated to improve its commercial prospects after it was given an [[X rating|X]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], and in Britain it was liable for seizure during the 1980s \"[[video nasties]]\" [[moral panic]] \u2015 the film proved to be a major success at the box office, grossing $66 million worldwide against its estimated budget of $640,000. Noted for its satirical portrayal of [[consumerism]], ''Dawn of the Dead'' has received widespread critical acclaim since its initial release, and is widely considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest horror films ever made]], as well as the greatest zombie film. Like its predecessor, it has garnered a large, international [[Cult film|cult following]].<ref name=afi/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Romero|first1=George|last2=Sparrow|first2=Susanna|title=Dawn of the Dead (Introduction by [[Simon Pegg]])|year=2013 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=9781405528634|pages=vi-viii}}</ref> In 2008, it was chosen by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine as one of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'', along with ''Night of the Living Dead''.<ref name=\"Empire Magazine\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/500-greatest-movies/|title=''Empire's'' The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|publisher=Empire Magazine|access-date=November 8, 2019|archive-date=August 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822120854/http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/500-greatest-movies/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Dawn of the Dead'' was followed by four [[Canon (fiction)|official]] sequels, beginning with 1985's ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', and a separate series of [[Zombi (film series)|unofficial Italian-made sequels]], beginning with 1979's ''[[Zombi 2]].'' It has also inspired a 2004 [[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|remake]] directed by [[Zack Snyder]], as well as numerous parodies and pop culture references.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[United States]] is devastated by a mysterious plague that reanimates recently-dead human beings as flesh-eating [[Zombie (fictional)|ghouls]]. At the dawn of the crisis, it has been reported that millions of people have died and reanimated. Despite the government's best efforts, social order is collapsing. Rural communities and the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban centers descend into chaos.\n\nAt WGON TV, a [[television studio]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[traffic reporting|traffic reporter]] Stephen Andrews and his [[pregnant]] girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station's [[helicopter]] to escape the city. Across town, [[police]] [[SWAT]] officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income [[housing project]], whose mostly African American and Latino tenants are defying the [[martial law]] of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The tenants and the officers exchange gunfire as the officers try to gain entry. Roger unsuccessfully tries to restrain Wooley, a brutal and racist officer, after he maniacally kills several unarmed civilians. Wooley is shot dead by an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team dispatch the reanimated dead that have injured or killed several tenants, a disillusioned Roger suggests that he and Peter [[Desertion|desert]] and join up with Stephen (who is Roger\u2019s friend) in escaping the city. An elderly priest tells them that several zombies are confined in the basement. The two go there and take on the grim job of eliminating all of them.\n\nLater that night, Stephen discovers the dead body of a security operator who had been guarding a traffic helicopter belonging to his employer. Roger and Peter join Fran and Stephen at a [[transit police|police dock]] and then leave Philadelphia in the stolen helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a [[shopping mall]], and decide to remain there since there is plenty of food, medicine, and all kinds of consumables. Peter and Stephen camouflage the entrance to the stairwell which leads to their safe room, and they block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. This involves driving through crowds of zombies who are indifferent to their own injuries and attempt to enter the trucks. Roger survives a particularly dangerous encounter, and becomes reckless as a result. He is soon bitten by the zombies.\n\nAfter clearing the mall's interior of zombies, the four enjoy a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle with all the goods available to them, furnishing their safe room with the mall's many commodities. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; when he reanimates as a zombie, Peter shoots him in the head and later buries his body in the mall. Sometime later, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed. Now isolated, the three load some supplies into the helicopter, in case they might need to leave suddenly.  Fran gets Stephen to teach her how to fly in case he is killed or incapacitated.\n\nA nomadic [[biker gang]] sees the helicopter in flight, and break into the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back inside. Despite having a fallback plan should the mall be attacked, Stephen, consumed by territorial rage over the mall, blindly fires on the looters, beginning a protracted battle. On their way out with whatever goods they could carry, straggling bikers are eventually overwhelmed and eaten by the zombies. Stephen tries to hide in the elevator shaft, but gets shot and subsequently mauled by roaming zombies. When Stephen reanimates, he instinctively returns to the safe room and leads the undead to Fran and Peter. Peter kills the undead Stephen while Fran escapes to the roof. Peter, not wanting to leave, locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide. When the zombies burst in, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the roof, where he joins Fran. Having escaped and low on fuel, the two then fly away in the helicopter to an uncertain future.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[David Emge]] as Stephen \"Flyboy\" Andrews\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Peter Washington\n* [[Scott Reiniger]] as Roger \"Trooper\" DeMarco\n* [[Gaylen Ross]] as Francine \"Fran\" (\"Flygirl\") Parker\n\nDirector [[George A. Romero]] makes an uncredited appearance as a WGON TV director. His future-wife\u2014[[Christine Forrest]]\u2014portrays his assistant. Also featured at the WGON TV station are David Crawford as Dr. James Foster, [[David Early]] as commentator Sidney Berman and Daniel Dietrich as station manager Dan Givens. Future ''[[Romper Room]]'' hostess Molly McClosky makes an uncredited appearance as a station worker. Later sequences depicting an emergency TV network feature [[Howard Smith (director)|Howard Smith]] as an unnamed commentator and recurring Romero collaborator [[Richard France (writer)|Richard France]] as Dr. Millard Rausch, referred to in the credits as \"Scientist\".\n\nFeatured among the motorcycle raiders are Rudy Ricci as their leader, brothers and frequent Romero collaborators [[Tony Buba|Tony]] and [[Pasquale Buba]], and [[Taso N. Stavrakis]]. [[Tom Savini]], the film's make-up artist, also appears as Blades, a machete-wielding raider. [[Joseph Pilato]], who would later be cast in Romero's ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', plays the leader of group of [[police officers]] evacuating by boat, although most of his performance was cut from the theatrical release. Other [[police officers]] in the film include [[James A. Baffico]] as Wooley, with his wife Joey Baffico having an uncredited role as a zombie who attacks Roger. Longtime Romero collaborator [[John Amplas]], who also served as the film's casting director, makes an uncredited appearance as one of the apartment tenants who engages in a gunfight with the [[police]].\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe history of ''Dawn of the Dead'' began in 1974, when [[George A. Romero]] was invited by friend Mark Mason of [[Oxford Development Company]]\u2014who Romero knew from an acquaintance at his alma mater, [[Carnegie Mellon]]\u2014to visit the [[Monroeville Mall]], which Mason's company managed. After showing Romero hidden parts of the mall, during which Romero noted the bliss of the consumers, Mason jokingly suggested that someone would be able to survive in the mall, should an emergency ever occur.<ref name=\"zombiefarm\">{{Cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/noman/mall01.htm |title=The mall at ''The Zombie Farm'' |access-date=April 8, 2006 |archive-date=May 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526133105/http://www2.gol.com/users/noman/mall01.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> With this inspiration, Romero began to write the screenplay for the film.\n\nRomero and his producer, [[Richard P. Rubinstein]], were unable to procure any domestic investors for the new project. By chance, word of the sequel reached Italian horror director [[Dario Argento]]. A fan of ''Night of the Living Dead'' and an early critical proponent of the film, Argento was eager to help the horror classic receive a sequel. He met Romero and Rubinstein, helping to secure financing in exchange for international distribution rights. Argento invited Romero to Rome so he would have a change of scenery while writing the screenplay. The two could also discuss plot developments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biodrowski|first=Steve|title=Dawn of the Dead (1979)|publisher=Cinema Fantastique|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/10/02/dawn-of-the-dead-1979/|access-date=May 4, 2008|archive-date=September 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925163448/http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/10/02/dawn-of-the-dead-1979/|url-status=live}}</ref> Romero was able to secure the availability of the Monroeville Mall as well as additional financing through his connections with the mall's owners at Oxford Development.<ref name=\"zombiefarm\" /> Once the casting was completed, principal shooting was scheduled to begin in [[Pennsylvania]] on November 13, 1977.\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Monroeville Mall Entrance, Monroeville, PA - February 2009.jpg|thumb|Monroeville Mall Entrance in 2009]]\n[[File:Monroeville Mall Escalator, Monroeville, PA - February 2009.jpg|thumb|150px|Escalator in JC Penney that the character Roger ([[Scott Reiniger]]) slides down in the scene where he and Peter ([[Ken Foree]]) are gathering supplies (photo taken in 2009)]]\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Dawn of the Living Dead'' (its working title at the time) began on November 13, 1977, at the Monroeville Mall in [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]]. Use of an actual, open shopping mall during the [[Christmas]] shopping season caused numerous time constraints. Filming began nightly once the mall closed, starting at 11 PM and ending at 7 AM, when automated music came on. As December arrived, the production decided against having the crew remove and replace the [[Christmas decorations]]\u2014a task that had proved to be too time-consuming. Filming was shut down during the last three weeks of the year to avoid the possible continuity difficulties and lost shooting time. Production would resume on January 3, 1978. During the break in filming, Romero took the opportunity to begin editing his existing footage.<ref>''[https://aintitcool.com/?q=node/20526 Quint interviews FX God Greg Nicotero on LAND OF THE DEAD!

The gun store was also not located in the mall\u2014for filming, the crew used Firearms Unlimited, a shop that existed in the [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]] district of Pittsburgh at the time. The [[transit police|police dock]] scene was filmed in downtown Pittsburgh right next the Monongahela River at 1 S. 6th St. The building, landing pad, and pumps are long gone, and the location is now an outdoor art gallery called The Color Park. The truck yard scene was filmed at the B&P Motor Express Co. which is now a First Student school bus company in Irwin, PA, about 22 minutes from the Monroeville Mall.\n\nPrincipal photography on ''Dawn of the Dead'' ended in February 1978, and Romero's process of editing would begin. By using numerous angles during the filming, Romero allowed himself an array of possibilities during editing\u2014choosing from these many shots to reassemble into a sequence that could dictate any number of responses from the viewer simply by changing an angle or deleting or extending portions of scenes. This amount of superfluous footage is evidenced by the numerous international cuts, which in some cases affects the regional version's tone and flow.\n\n==== Alternate ending ====\nAccording to the original screenplay, Peter and Francine were to kill themselves, Peter by shooting himself and Fran by sticking her head into the path of the rotating [[helicopter rotor|main helicopter blades]]. The ending credits would run over a shot of the helicopter blades turning until the engine winds down, implying that the two would not have gotten far if they had chosen to escape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorlair.com/movies/scripts/dawn_of_the_dead_1978.html|title=Dawn Of The Dead|type=working draft|date=1977|first=George A.|last=Romero|website=HorrorLair.com|access-date=April 6, 2020|archive-date=August 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808081503/http://www.horrorlair.com/movies/scripts/dawn_of_the_dead_1978.html|url-status=live}}</ref> During production, it was decided to change the ending of the film.\n\nMuch of the lead-in to the two suicides remains in the film as Francine leans out of the helicopter upon seeing the zombies approach, and Peter puts a gun to his head, ready to shoot himself. An additional scene, showing a zombie having the top of its head cut off by the helicopter blades (thus foreshadowing Francine's suicide) was included early in the film. Romero has stated that the original ending was scrapped before being shot, although behind-the-scenes photos show the original version was at least tested. The head appliance made for Fran's suicide was instead used in the opening SWAT raid, made-up to resemble an African-American male and blown apart by a shotgun blast.<ref>''[http://www.horrorexpress.com/news/465 Alternate ''Dawn'' ending surfaces.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207062023/http://www.horrorexpress.com/news/465 |date=December 7, 2008 }}'' at Horrorexpress.com</ref>\n\n==== Make-up and effects ====\n[[File:Machetezombie.jpg|thumb|left|An example of the bright hue of the fake blood, gray face make-up, and special effects in ''Dawn of the Dead''.]] [[File:Dawn of the Dead Headshot.png|thumb|right|upright|Special effect of an exploding head during the tenement building scene]]<nowiki> </nowiki>[[Tom Savini]], who had been offered the chance to provide special effects and make-up for Romero's first zombie film, ''Night of the Living Dead,'' before being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]], made his debut as an effects artist on ''Dawn of the Dead''.<ref name=\"lord of gore\">''[http://www.slasherama.com/features/savini.HTML Lord of Gore] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517013729/http://www.slasherama.com/features/savini.html |date=May 17, 2008 }}'' Slasherama.com</ref> Savini had been known for his make-up in horror for some time, prior to ''Dawn of the Dead'', and in his book explaining special effects techniques, ''Bizarro'', explains how his time in Vietnam influenced his craft.<ref name=\"Bizarro\">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0911137009 Tom Savini, ''Bizarro!: The Art and Technique of Special Make-Up Effects'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1983), 11.]</ref> He had a crew of eight to assist in applying gray makeup to two to three hundred extras each weekend during the shoot.<ref name=\"pilato interview\">{{cite web|last=Mason |first=R.H. |url=http://www.geocities.com/zodiaczombie/joeinterviews.html |title=An Interview With The Villain |publisher=[[Fangoria]] (reprinted) |access-date=May 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026220308/http://www.geocities.com/zodiaczombie/joeinterviews.html |archive-date=October 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of his assistants during production was [[Joseph Pilato]], who played a [[police captain]] in the film and would go on to play the lead villain in the film's sequel, ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', Captain Henry Rhodes.<ref name=\"pilato interview\" />\n\nThe makeup for the multitudes of extras in the film was a basic blue or gray tinge to the face of each extra.

For Romero's theatrical version, musical cues and selections were chosen from the [[De Wolfe Music]] [[Library]], a compilation of [[stock music]] scores and cues. In the montage scene featuring the hunters and National Guard, the song played in the background is \"'Cause I'm a Man\" by the [[Pretty Things]]. The song was first released on the group's LP ''Electric Banana''.<ref>[http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/raveupwiththeelectricbanana.htm Rave Up With The Electric Banana] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502064456/http://www.moviegrooves.com/shop/raveupwiththeelectricbanana.htm |date=May 2, 2008 }} at ''Movie Grooves''</ref> The music heard playing in a sequence in the mall and over the film's end credits is an instrumental titled \"The Gonk\"\u2014a polka style tune from the [[De Wolfe Music]] [[Library]] written by [[Herbert Chappell]], with a chorus of zombie moans added by Romero.<ref>''[http://www.dewolfe.co.uk/musicsearch/track_detail.php?primaryid=27987 De Wolfe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061620/http://www.dewolfe.co.uk/musicsearch/track_detail.php?primaryid=27987 |date=December 15, 2007 }} track listing''</ref>\n\nFor Argento's international cut, the Italian director used the band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] (incorrectly credited as \"The Goblins\") extensively. Goblin is a four-piece Italian [[progressive rock]] band that mostly provides contract work for film soundtracks. Argento, who received a credit for original music alongside Goblin, collaborated with the group to get music for his cut of the film. Romero used three of their pieces in his theatrical release version. The Goblin score would later find its way onto a ''Dawn of the Dead''-inspired film, ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]''. Many tracks would also appear in the [[Tsui Hark]] film ''[[Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind]]''. The version of ''Dawn'' released on video in the mid-nineties under the label \"Director's Cut\" does not use most of the Goblin tracks, as they had not been completed at the time of that edit.\n\n=== Post-production ===\n''Dawn of the Dead'' has received a number of re-cuts and re-edits, due mostly to Argento's rights to edit the film for international foreign language release. Romero controlled the final cut of the film for English-language territories. In addition, the film was edited further by censors or distributors in certain countries. Romero, acting as the editor for his film, completed a hasty 139-minute version of the film (now known as the Extended, or Director's Cut) for premiere at the 1978 [[Cannes Film Market]]. This was later pared down to 126 minutes for the US theatrical release. The US theatrical cut of the film earned the taboo rating of [[X rating|X]] because of its graphic violence. Rejecting this rating, Romero and the producers chose to release the film unrated to help the film's commercial success.<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/30/the-horror-geek-speaks-document-of-the-dead A review of ''Document of the Dead''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705151141/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/30/the-horror-geek-speaks-document-of-the-dead |date=July 5, 2018 }}, a documentary on the film's production.</ref> United Film Distribution Company eventually agreed to release it domestically in the United States.
