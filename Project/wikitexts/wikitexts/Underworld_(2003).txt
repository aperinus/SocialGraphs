Kevin Grevioux wrote the original screenplay.  The film centers on the [[secret history]] of [[Vampire (Underworld)|vampires]] and [[Lycan (Underworld)|lycans]] (an abbreviated form of ''[[Werewolf|lycanthrope]]'', which means werewolf). It is the first (chronologically, the second) installment in the [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' franchise]]. The main plot revolves around [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] ([[Kate Beckinsale]]), a vampire [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealer]] hunting Lycans. She finds herself attracted to a human, Michael Corvin ([[Scott Speedman]]), who is being targeted by the Lycans. After Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and save him. Alongside Beckinsale and Speedman, the film stars [[Michael Sheen]], [[Shane Brolly]], and [[Bill Nighy]].\n\nAn [[international co-production]] between companies from [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], the film was released on September 19, 2003. Upon its release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, but a smaller number of reviewers praised elements such as the film's stylish [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] visuals, the \"icy English composure\" in Kate Beckinsale's performance, and the extensively worked-out vampire\u2013werewolf [[mythology]] that serves as the film's [[backstory]]. A [[sleeper hit|surprise hit]], the film grossed $95 million against a production budget of $22 million. The film was followed by ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'', released three years later, and by three other films.\n\n==Plot==\nFor generations, a secret war has raged between [[vampires]] and [[Lycanthropy|Lycans]], an ancient species of [[werewolf]]. The vampires gain the upper hand when Lycan leader Lucian seemingly dies at the hands of vampire [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]], who becomes the second-in-command to the vampires' leading elders. [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]], a member of an elite group of vampire assassins known as [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|\"Death Dealers\"]], longs for revenge against the Lycans, who murdered her parents when she was a child.\n\nDuring a clash with the Lycans, Selene discovers that they are looking for Michael Corvin, a seemingly ordinary medical student. After she rescues Michael and takes him under her wing, the pair find themselves pursued by a group of Lycans led by Lucian, who is still alive after all. During their escape, Michael is bitten by Lucian. Since Kraven was the only witness to Lucian's supposed death, Selene comes to suspect that he lied about killing him, and may be working with the Lycans.\n\nShe returns to her coven's mansion and prematurely awakens [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], a hibernating elder vampire. Furious, Viktor refuses to believe Selene's warnings about Kraven's treachery, and reminds her that his fellow elder [[Marcus Corvinus (Underworld)|Marcus]] was supposed to be awakened before him.\n\nWhile awaiting Kraven's judgment for defying him, Selene binds Michael, fearing that the Lycans' bite will transform him into a werewolf when the full moon rises. As the two of them bond, she gradually tells him more about her past, revealing that Viktor adopted her and turned her into a vampire after her parents' death. Selene later manages to capture and abduct the Lycan scientist [[Singe (Underworld)|Singe]], while the Lycans manage to abduct and capture Michael.\n\nWhile held captive in the Lycans' lair, Michael soon learns that Lucian was once in love with Viktor's daughter [[Sonja (Underworld)|Sonja]], and that Viktor murdered her after he discovered their forbidden love affair. Lucian claims that Lycans were once slaves of vampires, and the war began when they rose up against them and fought for their freedom. Meanwhile, at the vampires' mansion, a captive Singe reveals that Selene was telling the truth about Kraven's betrayal, and he reveals why the Lycans want Michael: vampires and Lycans actually have a common ancestor, and Michael is a direct descendant of that ancestor. As an heir to the legendary \"Corvinus\" bloodline, he carries a unique genetic strain that could allow him to become a vampire-werewolf [[Hybrid (Underworld)|hybrid]].\n\nThe vampire elder [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]]\u2014the ruler of the coven\u2014is later ambushed and killed by Lycans while traveling to the mansion to awaken Marcus. In the ensuing showdown between vampires and Lycans, Selene breaks into the Lycans' lair to rescue Michael, Kraven and Lucian turn on each other, Kraven tells Selene that Viktor was the one who really murdered her parents, and Michael allows Selene to bite him - believing that her bite will make him an immortal vampire-werewolf hybrid - while Kraven shoots Lucian, killing him.\n\nWhen Viktor arrives at the Lycans' lair in the aftermath of the battle, he admits to murdering Selene's parents and killing his daughter. He also insists that he killed Sonja for the good of his people and reveals she was pregnant with Lucian's child, an abomination in the eyes of the two species. Lastly, he claims that he made Selene immortal out of love for her. Viktor and Michael fight, but with Michael overpowered and nearly strangled, Selene turns on Viktor and kills him. Now enemies of both the vampires and the Lycans, Selene and Michael flee the Lycans' lair together.\n\nBack at the vampires' mansion, Marcus\u2014now the sole surviving vampire elder\u2014awakens after Singe's blood seeps into his sarcophagus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]], a Death Dealer\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Michael Corvin, a medical student who becomes a hybrid \n* [[Bill Nighy]] as [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], the second most powerful of the vampire elders\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as [[Lucian (Underworld)|Lucian]], the leader of the Lycans\n* [[Shane Brolly]] as [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]], a vampire noble who plots to kill the elders\n* [[Erwin Leder]] as [[Singe (Underworld)|Singe]], a Lycan scientist who plans with Lucian to make a hybrid creature\n* [[Sophia Myles]] as [[Erika (Underworld)|Erika]], a vampire [[courtesan]] who desires Kraven's favor\n* [[Robbie Gee]] as [[Kahn (Underworld)|Kahn]], a vampire warrior who helps Selene\n* [[Kevin Grevioux]] as [[Raze (Underworld)|Raze]], Lucian's right-hand-man\n* [[Zita G\u00f6r\u00f6g]] as [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]], a vampire elder\n* Scott McElroy as [[Soren (Underworld)|Soren]], Kraven's henchman\n* [[Wentworth Miller]] as Adam Lockwood, Michael's colleague\n* Dennis Kozeluh as Dmitri\n* Hank Amos as Nathaniel\n* Sandor Bolla as Rigel\n* Todd Schneider as Trix\n* [[J\u00e1zmin Dammak]] as Sonja\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 2000, Danny McBride met Len Wiseman through Nick Reed, who was the agent for both of them with intent for them to work together on a script the former wrote. While the plans for that film fizzled out, they did set out a plan to work together. [[Kevin Grevioux]] had graduated from [[Howard University]] with a degree in microbiology, but he developed a desire to study film in cinematography and screenwriting. He dropped out of graduate studies and moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he became an actor. He came up with the original concept for the film, which was inspired by ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' alongside his college studies, which based vampirism and lycanthropy on a viral mutagen rather than mythology. McBride and Wiseman soon stepped in to work on the script, which they soon set out to make a trilogy of films. Each received credit for their work on the film, and Grevioux also appeared in the film as an actor.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040710114841/http://www.the-trades.com/column.php?columnid=2573</ref><ref>https://creatorsfortheculture.com/2021/03/08/kevin-grevioux-black-creator-behind-underworld/</ref>\n\n===Legal controversy===\nThe film was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by [[White Wolf, Inc.]] and [[Nancy A. Collins]], claiming the setting was too similar to the ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'' games, both set in the ''[[World of Darkness]]'' setting, and to the ''[[Sonja Blue]]'' vampire novels. White Wolf filed 17 counts of copyright infringement, and claimed over 80 points of unique similarity between White Wolf's gaming systems and the film.  One of those points being that the vampires in Underworld \"drink blood\".  White Wolf, Inc. also said the script was very similar to a story entitled ''The Love of Monsters'' (1994), which they published, written by Nancy A. Collins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.white-wolf.com/News/underworldrelease.html |title=WHITE WOLF, INC. and author NANCY A.

This version of the song, which features [[Maynard James Keenan]] (from [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[A Perfect Circle]]) and guitarist [[John Frusciante]] (of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), was praised by Aicher as \"Dark, brooding, sad, and twitchy\".<ref name=\"Aicher\" />\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 1:07:07\n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1       = Awakening\n| extra1       = [[The Damning Well]]\n| length1      = 4:15\n| title2       = Rev. 22:20\n| extra2       = [[Puscifer]]\n| length2      = 4:39\n| title3       = Throwing Punches\n| extra3       = [[Page Hamilton]]\n| length3      = 3:42\n| title4       = Rocket Collecting\n| extra4       = [[Milla Jovovich]] & [[Danny Lohner]]\n| length4      = 5:42\n| title5       = Now I Know\n| extra5       = [[Renhold\u00ebr]] & [[Amy Lee]]\n| length5      = 0:57\n| title6       = [[Bring Me the Disco King]]\n| note6        = [[Danny Lohner]] Mix\n| extra6       = [[David Bowie]] (featuring [[Maynard James Keenan]] & [[John Frusciante]])\n| length6      = 6:06\n| title7       = Optimissed\n| extra7       = [[Skinny Puppy]]\n| length7      = 3:49\n| title8       = Down in the Lab\n| extra8       = [[Renhold\u00ebr]] & [[Amy Lee]]\n| length8      = 1:46\n| title9       = [[Judith (A Perfect Circle song)|Judith]]\n| note9        = Renhold\u00ebr Mix\n| extra9       = [[A Perfect Circle]]\n| length9      = 4:23\n| title10      = Suicide Note\n| extra10      = [[Johnette Napolitano]]\n| length10     = 5:26\n| title11      = Baby's First Coffin\n| extra11      = [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]]\n| length11     = 4:01\n| title12      = Hover\n| note12       = Quiet Mix\n| extra12      = [[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]]\n| length12     = 3:10\n| title13      = Falling Through the Sky\n| extra13      = [[Renhold\u00ebr]]\n| length13     = 1:01\n| title14      = Weak and Powerless\n| note14       = Tilling My Grave Mix\n| extra14      = [[A Perfect Circle]]\n| length14     = 3:02\n| title15      = Worms of the Earth\n| extra15      = [[Finch (U.S. band)|Finch]]\n| length15     = 2:35\n| title16      = From a Shell\n| extra16      = [[Lisa Germano]]\n| length16     = 2:57\n| title17      = Death Dealer's Descent\n| extra17      = [[Renhold\u00ebr]]\n| length17     = 0:55\n| title18      = On the Lash\n| extra18      = [[The Icarus Line]]\n| length18     = 4:04\n| title19      = All of This Past\n| extra19      = [[Sarah Bettens]]\n| length19     = 4:28\n}}\n\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Underworld (Original Score)\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[Paul Haslinger]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 14, 2003\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 52:20\n| label      = [[Lakeshore Records]]\n| producer   = Paul Haslinger and Lustmord\n| chronology = ''Underworld'' film series score album\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Underworld: Evolution#Score|Underworld: Evolution]]\n| next_year  = 2006\n}}\n\n==Sequels and prequel==\nA sequel, titled ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'', in which Marcus fully awakens, was released January 20, 2006.
