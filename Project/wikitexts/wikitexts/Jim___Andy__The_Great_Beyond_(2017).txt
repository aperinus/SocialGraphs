The film follows actor [[Jim Carrey]] as he remains in character as [[Andy Kaufman]] during the production of the 1999 film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'', directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]. It was released on November 17, 2017, through the streaming service [[Netflix]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film alternates between contemporary interviews with Carrey and firsthand footage of the making of ''Man on the Moon'' almost 20&nbsp;years earlier. According to Carrey, [[Universal Pictures]] had withheld the behind-the-scenes footage (much of it originally shot by Kaufman's former girlfriend, Lynne Margulies) \"so that people wouldn't think [he] was an asshole\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holub |first1=Christian |title=Jim Carrey looks back on Andy Kaufman role in new Netflix documentary |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/19/jim-carrey-andy-kaufman-netflix-doc/ |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 19, 2017|access-date=June 22, 2021 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117001343/https://ew.com/movies/2017/10/19/jim-carrey-andy-kaufman-netflix-doc/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise is that while making the film, Carrey is so committed to the role that, like Andy, he had difficulty separating himself from the character. Carrey's performance becomes so real that people who had known Andy, even family and others close to him, felt like they had him with them again.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gleiberman|first1=Owen|title=Venice Film Review: \u2018Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond&nbsp;\u2013 featuring a very special, contractually obligated mention of Tony Clifton\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/jim-andy-the-great-beyond-review-jim-carrey-andy-kaufman-1202547073/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=September 5, 2017}}</ref> Later that month, streaming service [[Netflix]] acquired the film's distribution rights after a screening at the [[Toronto Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pederson|first1=Erik|title=Netflix Acquires Docu \u2018Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond\u2019; The Orchard Grabs Louis C.K.\u2019s \u2018I Love You, Daddy\u2019; A24 & DirecTV Pick Up \u20181%\u2019&nbsp;\u2013 Toronto|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/netflix-acquires-jim-and-andy-the-great-beyond-jim-carrey-andy-kaufman-making-of-man-on-the-moon-1202167305/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> The film was released on November 17, 2017.<ref name=\"Collin\">{{cite web|last1=Collin|first1=Robbie|title=Jim & Andy: the Great Beyond review: Jim Carrey goes full method in a comedic hall of mirrors|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/jim-andy-great-beyond-review-jim-carrey-goes-full-method-comedic/|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=November 17, 2017|date=November 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Rotten Tomatoes prose|92|7.4|50|''Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond'' offers a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse of method acting in action \u2013 and one star's journey toward something like personal acceptance.|ref=yes|access-date=January 28, 2022}} {{MC film|77|16}}<ref>{{cite Metacritic|title=Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond&nbsp;\u2013 Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton|type=movie|id=jim-andy-the-great-beyond-featuring-a-very-special-contractually-obligated-mention-of-tony-clifton|access-date=January 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s review, the film was awarded 4 out of 5 stars.
