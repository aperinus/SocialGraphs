The film's cast also includes [[Keanu Reeves]] in his first feature film role.\n\n==Plot==\nDean Youngblood, a 17-year-old farmhand from rural [[New York (state)|New York]], has dreams of playing in the [[National Hockey League]]. Dean voices these dreams to his father who disapproves; however, Dean's brother, Kelly, convinces their father to relent. Dean travels to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs where he demonstrates his offensive skills but displays a lack of physical toughness.\n\nDean earns the nickname \"Pretty Boy\" brought on by his rivalry with fellow hockey player Carl Racki. Racki, who is competing for a spot, engages him in a fight and quickly defeats him. Despite this, the Mustangs head coach, a former NHL [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star]], selects Dean for the team. Dean also begins a flirtation with the coach's daughter, Jessie.\n\nAfter his team mentor, Derek Sutton, is deliberately injured by Racki (now with a rival team), Dean returns home. His brother inspires him to keep playing, and his father teaches him some fighting skills. Dean returns to the team, ready to confront Racki in the final game of the [[Memorial Cup]] playoffs.\n\nThe game ends with a winning penalty shot goal by Dean with 3 seconds left. As time expires, he confronts and defeats Racki in a fight and is carried off the ice on the shoulders of his teammates.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Dean \"Pretty Boy\" Youngblood\n** Charlie Wasley as young Dean Youngblood\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Murray Chadwick\n* [[Cynthia Gibb]] as Jessie Chadwick\n* [[Jim Youngs]] as Kelly Youngblood\n** Ricky Davis as young Kelly Youngblood\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Derek Sutton\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Miss McGill\n* Ken James as Frazier\n* [[George Finn (ice hockey)|George J.
