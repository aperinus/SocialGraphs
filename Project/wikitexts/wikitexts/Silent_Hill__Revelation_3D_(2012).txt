A [[sequel]] to  ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'' (2006), it stars [[Adelaide Clemens]], [[Kit Harington]], [[Martin Donovan]], [[Malcolm McDowell]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], with [[Deborah Kara Unger]], [[Sean Bean]], and [[Radha Mitchell]] returning from the previous film.<ref name=\"filming and plot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/silent-hill-2-filming-this-winter|title=Silent Hill 2 Filming This Winter|date=8 November 2010|work=[[IGN]]|access-date=22 December 2010}}</ref> The film follows [[Heather (Silent Hill)|Heather Mason]] (Clemens), who, discovering on the eve of her eighteenth birthday that her presumed identity is false, is drawn to the town of Silent Hill.\n\nTalks for a ''Silent Hill'' sequel began in December 2006, with [[Christophe Gans]] returning to direct and [[Roger Avary]] writing a script for the project. However, after Gans dropped out from directing and Avary was imprisoned for [[vehicular manslaughter]], the project entered [[development hell]]. Later, in early 2010, Bassett was hired to direct and write the film, replacing Gans and Avary. She had expressed her openness to fans' suggestions of actresses for Heather's role. On a total estimated $20 million budget, filming lasted from March to May 2011 in Canada, with the [[3D RED Epic]] camera used for the process; [[Audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] took place in France.\n\n''Silent Hill: Revelation'' was released theatrically in Canada on October 26, 2012, by [[Alliance Films]]; in France on November 28, by [[Metropolitan Filmexport]]; and in Japan on July 12, 2013, by Presidio. The film grossed over $55.9 million worldwide against a $20 million budget and received negative reviews from critics.<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Silent-Hill-Revelation-3D#tab=summary|title=Silent Hill: Revelation|publisher=The Numbers|access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\" />\n\nA sequel, ''Return to Silent Hill'', is in production.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 900 WORDS.

Heather believes that they are on the run from the police because Harry killed a man in self-defense and that her adoptive mother Rose Da Silva ([[Radha Mitchell]]) died in a car crash. In fact, he has been protecting her from the Order, a cult of Silent Hill. Rose was able to free Heather from the fog world using one half of a talisman called the Seal of [[Metatron]], but she remained trapped in Silent Hill.\n\nHeather meets fellow student [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Vincent Smith|Vincent Cooper]] ([[Kit Harington]]), but she is haunted by hallucinations of Silent Hill. She is approached by private investigator [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Douglas Cartland|Douglas Cartland]] ([[Martin Donovan]]) regarding her identity. Heather warns her father, but he is abducted by the Order and taken to Silent Hill. Unaware of this, Heather goes to a mall to wait for him, but enters the mall's Otherworld. Douglas explains he was hired by the Order to find Heather, but decides to help her when he discovered who his clients were. A monster, the Missionary (Liise Keeling), kills Douglas. Heather returns to the real world and flees, unfortunately leaving her a suspect of Douglas' murder.\n\nVincent escorts her home, but they find a message instructing Heather to go to Silent Hill. On the way to rescue her father, Heather reads a letter from her father detailing the truth of her background and lost memories. Heather and Vincent travel to the town, but stop at a motel, where Vincent reveals that he is the son of the Order's leader [[List of Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 characters#Claudia Wolf|Claudia Wolf]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), and was sent by her to ensure Heather came of her own volition to Silent Hill. He reveals that Heather is a part of [[Alessa Gillespie]] ([[Erin Pitt]]), a girl whose immolation 38 years earlier by the Order led to creation of the town's shifting dimensions. The resulting argument triggers a shift to the Otherworld. The Missionary grabs Vincent, but not before he tells Heather to find his grandfather Leonard ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), who possesses the other half of the Seal of Metatron.\n\nHeather ventures into the foggy dimension to find her father. She encounters Alessa's mother [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Dahlia Gillespie|Dahlia]] ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), who reveals that Claudia intends to complete the purpose intended for Alessa at her burning. After a shift to the Otherworld, Heather finds Leonard who, after informing her that the Seal of Metatron will reveal \"the true nature of things,\" fuses Heather's half of the amulet with the one he possesses and becomes a monster. After being knocked out and carried off, Heather regains consciousness and grabs the amulet from within his body, killing Leonard. As she runs away, she summons [[Pyramid Head]] (Roberto Campanella), the entity created to protect Alessa (and by extension Heather), with her pleading and hides from him. Shortly after, she witnesses Vincent being taken away by the Order after being deemed insane by Claudia for betraying them.\n\nHeather saves Vincent and they go to Lakeside Amusement Park where the Order's sanctuary is hidden. Dark Alessa ([[Erin Pitt]] and [[Adelaide Clemens]]), the manifestation of Alessa's wrath, confronts Heather who embraces her counterpart, absorbing her, and making Alessa complete once again. Heather confronts Claudia, who is holding Christopher and Vincent hostage. Claudia explains that Alessa's destiny was to be the incubator for a deity worshiped by the Order, who would punish all sinners upon its birth, completing Heather's destiny as well. Remembering Leonard's words, Heather gives Claudia the Seal of Metatron, revealing her to be the Missionary. Heather summons Pyramid Head, who kills the Missionary, allowing Heather to rescue Vincent and Christopher.\n\nAs the fog fades from the town, Christopher decides to stay in Silent Hill to find and free Rose, leaving Heather and Vincent to care for each other. They manage to hitch a ride away from the place in a truck driven by [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Travis Grady|Travis Grady]] ([[Peter Outerbridge]]). Travis mentions to Heather - now referring to herself as Sharon - and Vincent that they were lucky he was there since [[Silent Hill: Origins | he had not been driving in that direction for a long time.]] A couple of police cars, [[Silent Hill: Downpour | followed by a prisoner transport]], enter the area of Silent Hill, which is then consumed by the fog. In a post-credits scene, Pyramid Head is seen walking through an unknown area in Silent Hill.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- DO NOT INTRODUCE PERSONAL INTERPRETATIONS OR THEORIES ON THE STORY OR THE CHARACTERS.

Gans stated that he would like to return to the franchise, if his commitment to\u00a0''[[Onimusha#Film adaptation project|Onimusha]]''\u00a0did not bar him from participating. Gans also confirmed that\u00a0[[Roger Avary]]\u00a0would be back to write the script.<ref name=\"Boyes, Emma\">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/6163606.html|title=Silent Hill 2 movie confirmed|author=Boyes, Emma|date=30 December 2006|work=[[GameSpot]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609111241/http://au.gamespot.com/news/6163606.html|archive-date=9 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, producer\u00a0[[Don Carmody]]\u00a0stated that a screenplay was slowly being developed and that \"[Gans is] involved pretty heavily in another project right now\" and would likely not return as director. As well, Avary said that he would not be returning to collaborate on the next film on the account that Gans would not be returning, either.<ref name=\"Boyes, Emma\"/> In September 2009, Sony Pictures announced that Roger Avary and producer\u00a0[[Samuel Hadida]] were officially signed on the project and that filming would begin in 2010. Hadida stated that production would begin upon completion of\u00a0''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]''. However, later that month, Roger Avary was sentenced to a 1-year jail term for [[vehicular manslaughter]], and was unable to participate in the film's production.<ref name=\"GameSpot recap\">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/6283501.html|title=Silent Hill: Revelation film detailed|author=Magrino, Tom|date=4 November 2010|work=[[GameSpot]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203034548/http://au.gamespot.com/news/6283501.html|archive-date=3 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Carmody told ''[[Shock Till You Drop]]'' that Gans was unlikely to return for the sequel, and that they were going to make the sequel \"more accessible to a wider audience\". Carmody stated that the film would feature a character from the first movie who is now older, implying that Sharon Da Silva or [[Alessa Gillespie]] would be returning,\u00a0although actress [[Jodelle Ferland]] announced that she had not been contacted for the role.<ref name=\"GameSpot recap\"/>\n\nIn August 2010, Carmody said the sequel had \"stalled\" due to Avary's imprisonment, but that he still wanted to be involved with the film and had a basic outline for it.<ref name=\"GameSpot recap\"/>\n\n===M. J. Bassett's involvement (2010\u2013present)===\nIn November 2010, it was announced that\u00a0[[Lionsgate]]\u00a0had begun pre-sales on the next installment and that [[M. J. Bassett]] would direct the film, titled\u00a0''Silent Hill: Revelation 3D''. Bassett revealed she had written her own screenplay, replacing Roger Avary. She added that she would bring back as many of the core creative team as she could from the first film to keep its look and feel, but add \"more darkness and fear into the mix as well\".\n\nOn July 14, 2012, M. J. Bassett appeared at [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. She showed two clips from the movie. The first was a short clip showing the Mannequin Monster, and the second showed Vincent tied to an operating table surrounded by Nurses.\u00a0A movie trailer was released later that month, and from then on, more TV spots, posters and promotional stills were released in anticipation of the film.\n\n===Direction===\nBassett has stated that while\u00a0''[[Silent Hill 3]]'' would be the best game of choice to adapt from, it is a sequel to the first film first and foremost, and still needed to make sense with what the first film had established, such as the mythology and relations between characters. People who watched the film expecting \"Silent Hill 3: The Movie\" would be disappointed in that it differed from the game in many places, as it took different directions in many areas. The film was supposed to be a sequel to the first film that used\u00a0Silent Hill 3\u00a0as groundwork.\n\nDespite this, there were supposed to be many nods to the games that only gamers would catch, and the way many scenes were shot in the film were supposed to reminiscent of\u00a0Silent Hill 3.{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}\u00a0An example of this is how the filmography is shot during the carousel scene.\n\nIn an interview years after the release of\u00a0''Revelation'', Bassett spoke about her feelings towards the film. She said it felt more like a collaboration and didn't have complete control, but since she wrote and directed it, admits many aspects of its failings are also hers. She felt like she had to satisfy either the gamers or the audience and that it felt impossible to do both. She said shooting in 3D was a pain, and felt obligated to claim it was a great movie for the press, but in the back of her mind, she didn't wholeheartedly agree. She wished she stood up for her vision of the movie and for the fans, and for a more personal, tense, sexual, and less accessible for non-fans. She regretted trying to tie the game and film canons together, as it created contradictions and retcons. She apologized, saying she was very sorry to everyone who did not like the movie.\n\n===Casting===\nBefore filming began, Bassett was open to suggestions in casting the woman to play Heather, allowing fans to post the names of actresses on her blog that they believed could play her, provided that the actress could realistically portray an eighteen-year-old and had experience in other films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaeljbassett.wordpress.com/2010/11/20/casting-heather/|title=Casting Heather|date=20 November 2010|last=Bassett|first=M.

Bassett made another post asking for suggestions for Claudia's actress and some fans suggested\u00a0[[Donna Burke]], but Bassett was disappointed by the suggestions, feeling it was not a \"very imaginative selection\", and removed the post.\n\n[[Kit Harington]] acknowledged Vincent's character had been changed from the game version in order to give some leeway as a support character for Heather. Heather was somewhat less of a \"smartass\" to give her a more realistic personality. Bassett was interested in a character who shows \"some genuine human responses to the terrible things she experiences.\"\n\nOriginal cast, including [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Deborah Kara Unger]], and Roberto Campanella were all contacted to reprise their characters, which they accepted.\n\n===Filming===\nIn March 2011, the production team began filming in\u00a0[[Cambridge, Ontario]], [[Canada]].\u00a0Production was delayed when a freak snowstorm hit the set in Cambridge on March 23, 2011.

He stated the production of\u00a0his [[Silent Hill (film)|previous\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0film]]\u00a0was a beautiful memory for him and he chose not return for the sequel\u00a0''Silent Hill: Revelation''\u00a0because his vision did not match that of the producers. He told the next film could be set in a small American town ruled over by Puritanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2020/02/01/silent-hill-movie-fatal-frame-new-2020/|title=New Silent Hill Movie Announced|website=comicbook.com|author=Tyler Fischer|date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nGans and Hadida developed the concept and pitched it to rights holder\u00a0Konami. According to Gans, the company felt galvanized by the success of [[Capcom]]'s\u00a0[[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|''Resident Evil 2''\u00a0remake]] and greenlit the film as part of an initiative to get\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0back into the public consciousness.\u00a0In June 2022, Gans stated that he finished the script under Konami's supervision while isolated during the\u00a0[[COVID-19 pandemic]]\u00a0and the project was eyeing a 2023 release. He clarified that it is not a direct sequel to the 2006\u20132012 film series and that his sensibilities had evolved since the release of the first film:\n\n{{blockquote|\"''Silent Hill'' is a bit like\u00a0''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'', the\u00a0''[[Dimension|Fourth Dimension]]'', a place where anything and everything can happen. I worked on a new\u00a0''Silent Hill'' which is a\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0of the year 2023 and not a\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0as I imagined it in 2006. It is clear that today's horror cinema no longer resembles the horror cinema of 2006. Good for that matter. Not that 2007 horror cinema wasn't good, but every genre is going through an evolution. I'm trying to take into account what I've been able to see recently, which is more original and more surprising in terms of horror films, and to see if in\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0there are the seeds, or even the expression of that.\u00a0''Silent Hill''\u00a0has always been a game beyond the norm and ahead of its time.\"}}\n\nIn September 2022, Gans told in a interviewer he had finished the planned film's storyboards and it takes inspiration from ''[[P.T. (video game)|P.T.]]'', the playable teaser for the cancelled game ''[[Silent Hills]]''. He said:\n\n{{blockquote|\"There, I have practically finished the storyboards for this new ''Silent Hill'' and there are indeed a few nods to ''P.T.'' because, obviously, it made us all dream.\"}}\n\nBy October 2022, the movie was officially [[Green-light|green-lit]] with the title of ''Return to Silent Hill''.
