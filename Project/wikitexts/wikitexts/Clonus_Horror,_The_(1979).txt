Fiveson, and stars [[Peter Graves]], Tim Donnelly, [[Dick Sargent]], [[Keenan Wynn]], Paulette Breen and [[Frank Ashmore]]. The film is about an isolated community in a remote desert area, where [[Human cloning|clones]] are bred to serve as a source of replacement organs for the wealthy and powerful. The film won a [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]] at the [[7th Saturn Awards]], nationally televised in July 1980, in the category Best Film Produced for Under $1,000,000.\n\n''Parts: The Clonus Horror'' was featured on the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' in 1997. In 2005, the filmmakers filed a lawsuit against [[DreamWorks Pictures]] for [[copyright infringement]], citing numerous similarities between ''Clonus'' and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''. The two parties reached a settlement, with the amount settled being seven-figures and other specific terms being court-sealed.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in an isolated desert compound called ''Clonus'', where clones are bred to be used as replacement parts for the elite, including a soon to be [[President of the United States|president]]-elect Jeffrey Knight ([[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]]). The clones are kept isolated from the real world by workers of the colony, but are promised to be \"accepted\" to move to \"[[United States|America]]\" after they have completed some type of physical training. After a group of clones are chosen to go to \"America\", they are given a party and a farewell [[Party|celebration]] with their fellow clones. The chosen clones are then taken to a lab where they are sedated and placed in an airtight plastic bag, and their bodies are frozen in order to preserve their [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] for harvest.\n\nThe story surrounds clone Richard ([[Tim Donnelly (actor)|Tim Donnelly]]) who begins to question the circumstances of his existence and eventually escapes the colony. Pursued by compound guards, the clone enters a nearby city. The clone is found by a retired journalist, Jake Noble ([[Keenan Wynn]]) who takes him to his sponsor, Richard Knight, who happens to be the brother of Jeffrey Knight. The Knights argue over what to do with the clone (who is revealed to be a clone Jeffrey had secretly made for Richard).\n\nAfter a falling out, Richard's clone returns to the colony to reunite with his love interest, Lena (Paulette Breen). To his horror, the clone finds that Lena has been lobotomized by those running the colony. They had used her for bait to trap the clone. Once they have him in custody, they kill and freeze him. Meanwhile, Clonus completes its cover-up by hiring thugs to murder Richard Knight, his son, and the Nobles. Jeffrey Knight is stabbed through the chest in the ensuing struggle with his brother, but appears fine the next day at a press conference, where he is stunned to find that Noble had, before his death, managed to disseminate a secret tape to the news media, exposing the Clonus project. The final shot shows Richard's frozen corpse with an open chest and a tear coming out of his eye.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Peter Graves]] as Jeff Knight\n*[[Tim Donnelly (actor)|Tim Donnelly]] as Richard\n*[[Dick Sargent]] as Dr. Jameson\n*[[Keenan Wynn]] as Jake Noble\n*[[Paulette Breen]] as Lena\n*[[David Hooks]] as Richard Knight\n*[[James Mantell]] as Richard \"Ricky\" Knight Jr.\n*[[Frank Ashmore]] as George Walker\n*[[Lurene Tuttle]] as Anna Noble\n*[[Eileen Dietz]] as Dana\n*[[Zale Kessler]] as Dr. Nelson\n*[[Rick DiAngelo]] as Guide #1\n*[[Eugene Robert Glazer]] as Guide #2\n*[[Keith Langsdale]] as Guide #3\n*[[Larry Manning]] as Guide #4\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Parts: The Clonus Horror'' was written by Bob Sullivan. The idea for the script came while Sullivan was taking a screenwriting class at the [[University of Southern California]].

In exchange for making a donation to the [[Junior Chamber of Commerce]], the town of [[Simi Valley, California]] was rented for the picture.
