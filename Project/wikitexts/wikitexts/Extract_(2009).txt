K. Simmons]], [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]], and [[Dustin Milligan]].\n\nSaid to be Judge's companion piece to ''[[Office Space]]'', the film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $10.8 million worldwide against a budget of $8 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on September 4, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nJoel Reynolds is the owner and founder of Reynolds Extract, a flavoring extracts company. Although his business is successful, his marriage lacks passion. He is also often accosted by his annoying neighbor, Nathan. One day, a series of mishaps occur at the extract factory, resulting in an employee, Step, losing a testicle. Cindy, a [[con artist]], reads a news story about the accident. Hatching a [[get-rich-quick scheme]], she gets a temporary job at the factory, manipulating Joel into giving her more information about Step. She also begins a series of petty thefts from her co-workers, who openly accuse each other of the thefts. Although Step initially decides not to sue the company, he changes his mind after a meeting with Cindy, which she sets up in order to meet and flirt with him. Under Cindy's influence, Step hires attorney Joe Adler.\n\nJoel, mistaking Cindy's manipulations for genuine attraction to him, entertains the idea of an affair with her; however, he still loves his wife, and wants to avoid actions that would leave him with regrets later. While visiting his friend Dean and complaining about his situation, Dean suggests that Joel hire a gigolo to seduce his wife, so that Joel can then have a guilt-free \"revenge\" affair. Joel initially balks at the idea; but, after his judgment is impaired after ingesting a [[ketamine]] tablet that Dean mistakenly told him was [[Xanax]], Joel agrees. The friends hire Brad to seduce his wife, Suzie, into an affair, while posing as the pool cleaner. The next morning, Joel sobers up, realizes what he has done, and tries to stop Brad from going to his house; by then, Brad and Suzie have already begun an affair. Brad falls in love with Suzie and wants to run away with her. After smoking marijuana with Dean and his friend Willie, Joel attempts to call Cindy, but soon realizes that he is calling Willie's number. Just then, Cindy walks into the apartment. Willie discovers Joel's intentions, and punches Joel in the face.\n\nJoel meets with Adler and his associates to discuss the terms of the settlement for Step. The workers, believing that the meeting is about a buy-out of the factory by [[General Mills]], organize a strike. Frustrated by Adler's uncompromising negotiating style and the growing disrespect from his employees, Joel storms out and goes home\u2014where Suzie admits her affair with Brad. Joel admits to Suzie that he hired Brad to do it, then leaves after arguing with his wife.\n\nJoel moves into a motel, where he spots Cindy, staying in another room. When he goes to her room, he notices a purse stolen from one of his employees, along with other stolen items, and realizes that Cindy is not only a thief, but is also behind many of the company's problems. Joel threatens to call the police, but softens when Cindy breaks down in tears. Cindy promises to talk to Step and get him to drop the lawsuit. Ultimately, the two spend the night together. The next morning, Cindy disappears, but leaves the stolen items behind.\n\nStep meets with Joel at the factory, where he offers to drop the lawsuit if Joel promotes him to floor manager. Meanwhile, Nathan stops by Joel's house, making Suzie lose her temper and finally tell him what she really thinks of him. Just as she finishes her tirade, he collapses and dies; feeling guilty, Suzie attends the funeral, where she runs into Joel. After an awkward moment, the two agree to share a ride. It is revealed that Cindy has stolen Adler's luxury car, leaving him Step's truck in its place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Joel Reynolds\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Dean Slade\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Suzie Reynolds\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Cindy Slade\n* [[J.

Over the next several years he focused his energy on developing ''Idiocracy''. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that ''Office Space'' had struck a chord, and they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor and thus the ''Extract'' script was given new life.<ref name=\"Nasson, Tim\">{{cite web| url = http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES.php| title = Extract-Behind the Scenes| work = wildaboutmovies.com| author = Nasson, Tim| date = August 13, 2009| access-date = February 7, 2019| archive-date = June 30, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630070806/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES/| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nSeeking to keep ''Extract'' below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing\u2014while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. \"I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself,\" the director stated. \"I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world.\" Keeping true to this baseline of reality, ''Extract'' was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref name=\"Nasson, Tim\" />  Judge took the authenticity one step further by using the plant's employees as extras in the scenes' backgrounds. \"Those people were actually running, doing some bottling while we were shooting. There were people working on machines that were so loud in there they couldn't hear anyone call 'action' or 'cut.' They were just doing their job.\" Shooting on the factory set led Judge to some epiphanies about what made the story resonate for him: \"''Office Space'' was told from the point of view of the employees looking up at management as the 'bad guys'. This is told from the point of view of the owner of the place and the workers are the big pain in the butt to him. I think partly it was inspired by that point in my life where I suddenly had a large number of people working for me and realizing you can't be a 'cool guy boss'. It just doesn't work. So this is my more sympathetic take on the boss.\"<ref name=\"Nasson, Tim\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on September 4, 2009 in the United States.\n\n===Marketing===\nLeading up to the film's release, Affleck went on a promotional tour of various cities, starting in [[Vancouver, Washington]], on August 20, 2009, and ending in Los Angeles on September 14, 2009.\n\nIn an effort to promote the film, Judge released a promotional short which featured his characters [[Beavis and Butt-head]] who summarize, and critique, the events depicted in the film.<ref>{{cite magazine| url =https://ew.com/article/2009/09/02/beavis-and-butthead-extract-mike-judge/| title=Beavis and Butthead promo for 'Extract': Huh, huh, huh...you said Mr. Bateman| magazine = Entertainment Weekly | date= September 2, 2009|access-date = October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\n{{Anchor|DVD Release|DVD}}\n''Extract'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on December 22, 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url =https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/805/Extract-(2009).html| title=''Extract'' 2009 | work = DVD Release Dates| date= December 2, 2009|access-date = October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Extract'' made $4.3 million during its opening weekend and $7.1 million in its first week of release, with a total worldwide gross of $10.8 million, against a production budget of $8 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10.
