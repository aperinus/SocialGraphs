O\u2019Toole decreed that they should each play [[Hamlet]] afterwards under the direction of [[John Gielgud]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] in either [[London]] or [[New York City]], with a coin toss deciding who would be assigned which director and which city. O\u2019Toole won London and Olivier in the toss, with Burton being assigned Gielgud and New York.  O\u2019Toole kept his part of the agreement, appearing as Hamlet under Olivier's direction in the premiere production of the [[Royal National Theatre]] later that year, and Burton approached producer [[Alexander H. Cohen]] and Gielgud about mounting a New York production.<ref>Gielgud: A Theatrical Life 1904-2000 by Jonathan Croall, Continuum, 2001</ref>\n\n===Concept===\nBecause Burton disliked wearing period costumes, and for aesthetic reasons of his own, Gielgud conceived of a production performed in a \u201crehearsal\u201d setting with an incomplete set and the actors wearing what appeared to be street clothes (although the costumes were actually the result of continuous trial-and-error in rehearsals, with the actors bringing in countless variations of attire for Gielgud to consider).<ref>''Letters from an Actor'' by William Redfield, Limelight Editions, 1966</ref> Gielgud also opted to depict the Ghost as a shadow against the back of the stage wall, voicing the character himself on tape (since he was unavailable while the production was in performance).\n\n===Reception===\nThe production was a financial smash, achieving the longest run for the play in Broadway history at 137 performances, which broke the previous record set by [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]]'s ''GI Hamlet'' in the 1940s.  The run's popularity was due in no small part to attention Burton received for his romance with [[Elizabeth Taylor]], whom he married while the production was in Toronto pre-Broadway; crowds gathered outside the New York theater to get a glimpse of Burton, and sometimes Taylor, after the show.<ref>Redfield, Limelight Editions, 1966</ref> Burton's reviews in the title role were largely favorable and he received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for his performance, and [[Hume Cronyn]]\u2019s performance as [[Polonius]] won him the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play]]. [[Eileen Herlie]], who played Queen Gertrude, had already played the role in [[Hamlet (1948 film)|Laurence Olivier's Oscar-winning 1948 film version]]. Less favorably received were [[Linda Marsh]] as [[Ophelia]] and [[Alfred Drake]] as [[King Claudius]], whom Gielgud had considered replacing with respectively [[Sarah Miles]] and either [[Harry Andrews]] or himself in rehearsals.<ref>John Gielgud: A life in Letters edited by Richard Mangan, Arcade Publishing, 2004</ref>\n\nInterest in the production inspired books by cast members [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] and [[Richard L. Sterne]]. Sterne went to the length of hiding a tape recorder in a briefcase at rehearsals to get accurate transcriptions of what was said. Stern hid, under a part of the set, for six hours, to record Gielgud and Burton in their private meeting the day before the first performance.<ref>''John Gielgud Directs Richard Burton in Hamlet'' by Richard L.

Show]]'', ''[[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]]'', and ''[[Give 'em Hell, Harry!]]''. ''Hamlet'' played for only two days in theatres to lukewarm reviews. William Redfield wrote that \u201cthe film version played four performances in a thousand theatres and has grossed (to date) a total of $4,000,000. The financial details of this venture involved a mass screwing of the acting company so excruciatingly delicious that only a separate letter could do the tale justice.\u201d<ref>''Letters From an Actor'' by William Redfield (Limelight Editions, 1966) p. 240</ref>\n\n====1995 re-release====\nUpon discovering the lost copy of the film, [[Paul Brownstein]] had it restored and shown in theaters in May\u2013June 1995 at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Manila Standard|date=1995-04-08|access-date=2019-01-10|title=Burton's back on Broadway, but how?|last=Morehouse|first=Ward|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&dat=19950408&id=wIwmAAAAIBAJ&pg=6376,1617677}}</ref>\n\n===Online release===\nAlternative Entertainment Network (aentv.com) publicly streamed a copy of the film in real-time in April, 1997, making it among the first movies to be streamed on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|work=E!
