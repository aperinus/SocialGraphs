The film is a follow-up to the 1974 film ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''.\n\nIt takes place in [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] in 1937, mostly on a period [[paddle steamer]] on the [[Nile]]. Various famous [[Ancient Egyptian]] sights are featured in the film, such as the [[Great Pyramids]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]], and temples at [[Abu Simbel]] and [[Karnak]], sometimes out of sequence (the boat trip scenes start at [[Aswan]], move downstream to Karnak, and then shift upstream to Abu Simbel).\n\n''Death on the Nile'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] at the [[51st Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway agrees to hire her friend Jacqueline \"Jackie\" de Bellefort's unemployed fianc\u00e9, Simon Doyle as her estate manager. Soon after, Linnet and Simon marry after a whirlwind courtship. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually stalked and hounded by the jilted Jackie. To evade her, the Doyles pretend to go to the Aswan railway station before backtracking to board a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. ''Karnak''. Also in Egypt is detective Hercule Poirot, who will slowly learn about the situation.\n\nDuring an on-shore excursion to the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]], a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses the Doyles. The couple is shocked when Jackie joins the cruise, having ignored detective Hercule Poirot's advice to stay away. Jackie also reveals that she carries a small .22 caliber pistol and is a crack shot. That evening, Jackie confronts Simon in a drunken rage and shoots him in the leg, then is escorted away. The next morning, Linnet is found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. The letter \"J\" written in blood on the wall above her bed implicates Jackie, but she has a solid alibi as Miss Bowers sedated her with [[morphine|morphia]] and watched her all night.\n\nPoirot and his friend, Colonel Race, investigate. They discover that numerous passengers had motives to kill Linnet: Louise Bourget, Linnet's maid, was bitter that her mistress refused a promised dowry; Andrew Pennington, Linnet's American trustee, was embezzling from her; Mrs. van Schuyler, an elderly American socialite and a kleptomaniac, wanted Linnet's pearl necklace; van Schuyler's nurse, Miss Bowers, blamed Linnet's father for financially ruining her family; Salome Otterbourne, a romance novelist, was being sued by Linnet for libel; Mrs. Otterbourne's daughter, Rosalie, wanted to protect her mother from financial ruin; Jim Ferguson, an outspoken Communist, resented Linnet's wealth; and Dr. Ludwig Bessner, a Swiss psychiatrist, faced Linnet exposing his unorthodox treatments that harmed some of her friends.\n\nSoon after, the crew pulls a small bundle from the Nile. The missing pistol is wrapped in Mrs. van Schuyler's stole, which has a small bullet hole. There is also a blood-stained handkerchief and a marble ashtray used as a weight. When Linnet's pearl jewelry is missing, Mrs. van Schuyler denies taking them. Soon after, the necklace is found on Linnet's body, causing Poirot to deduce Mrs van Schuyler \"returned\" them.\n\nWhile Poirot and Race conduct their investigation, Louise Bourget is found dead, her throat slit with Dr. Bessner's scalpel, and a fragment of a [[banknote]] clutched in her hand. Poirot deduces she saw the murderer exiting Linnet's cabin and extorted money for her silence. Salome Otterbourne claims she saw Louise's murderer and is about to tell Poirot and Race when she is shot through an open cabin door with Pennington's revolver, which is too large to have been used on Linnet.\n\nPoirot gathers everyone in the saloon and reveals that Simon killed Linnet, with Jackie as his accomplice and the plot's mastermind. She pretended to shoot Simon, drawing attention to herself. After running to Linnet's cabin and shooting her, Simon, returning to the saloon, shot himself in the leg, using Mrs. van Schuyler's stole as a silencer. He then replaced the empty cartridges with a new one should the gun be found. Wrapping the gun in the stole, along with a marble ashtray and the supposed blood-stained handkerchief, he threw the items out the open window, into the Nile. Jackie later killed Louise, who was blackmailing Simon because she witnessed him enter Linnet's cabin, then killed Mrs. Otterbourne, who saw Jackie exiting Louise's cabin. The plan was that Simon would kill Linnet, inherit her money, and, at a later date, marry his old love.\n\nWhen Simon claims Poirot has no proof, Poirot claims that the police can do a gunshot residue test known as a \"moulage\" test on both him and Jacqueline. Realizing they are caught, Jackie confesses and embraces Simon. Poirot suddenly realizes she has reclaimed her pistol but cannot prevent her from fatally shooting Simon and then herself.\n\nThe passengers depart at the next port, and Poirot is congratulated for his work.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Hercule Poirot]]\n* [[Jane Birkin]] as Louise Bourget\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Linnet Ridgeway Doyle\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Marie Van Schuyler\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Jacqueline de Bellefort\n* [[Jon Finch]] as James Ferguson\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Rosalie Otterbourne\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Andrew Pennington\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Salome Otterbourne\n* [[Simon MacCorkindale]] as Simon Doyle\n* [[David Niven]] as Colonel Race\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Miss Bowers\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Dr. Bessner\n* [[I.

They were shifted from hotel to hotel, sometimes on a daily basis. Director Guillermin never was allowed to see the [[dailies|rushes]]. By order of the producers, footage was sent directly to them in London. A lighter moment occurred during a love scene between Chiles and MacCorkindale, when a hostile desert fly landed on Chiles's teeth. The actors carried on as best they could, but the crew burst out laughing when Guillermin thankfully called \"cut\" and ordered another take.<ref name=Bedside/>\n\nGuillermin found the shoot logistically tricky because of the heat and the boat, which sometimes ran aground. But he enjoyed the cast:\n{{bquote|The more experienced people created a very generous atmosphere. They were not impatient at all. I have never worked with Bette Davis before and was told she was professional but not communicative. Well, she was an absolute bastion of support and enthusiasm. During the breaks, the cast would often sit to one side engaged in terrific conversation. There was Ustinov's great wit and Niven's dry humour. Jack Warden is a very funny man and Mia Farrow is a very funny woman.
