Its original Swedish title is '''''H\u00e4rlig \u00e4r jorden''''', which means \"Lovely is the Earth\", and is the Swedish title of the hymn \"[[Fairest Lord Jesus]]\". The narrative portrays a man in white make-up who guides the viewer through his life in a bleakly stylised world, beginning with a scene with soldiers loading nude adults and children into a [[gas van]] for execution. The film was Andersson's critical comeback to cinema, after many years in advertising.<ref name=comment />\n\n==Production==\nIn 1975, Andersson's critical and commercial failure ''[[Giliap]]'' had forced him to disappear from the cinema scene and instead work as a director of advertisements. Several of his commercials eventually gained critical acclaim for their idiosyncratic style. Andersson said it was the Polish director [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]] who finally made him regain faith in cinema and return to filmmaking. ''World of Glory'' was commissioned by the [[Gothenburg Film Festival]] as an entry for a short-film series called ''90 minuter 90-tal'' (\"90 minutes 90s\"). The budget was four million [[Swedish krona|kronor]].<ref name=comment>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?itemid=18377&type=MOVIE&iv=Comments|title=H\u00e4rlig \u00e4r jorden (1991): Kommentar|language=Swedish|work=[[Swedish Film Database]]|publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]]|accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0102083}}\n* {{Sfdb|18377}}\n\n{{Roy Andersson}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roy Andersson]]\n[[Category:1990s Swedish-language films]]\n[[Category:Swedish short films]]\n[[Category:1991 short films]]\n[[Category:1990s Swedish films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-Sweden-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
