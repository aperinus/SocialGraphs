For his next project, Zissou is determined to document the shark's destruction.\n\nThe crew aboard Zissou's aging [[research vessel]] ''Belafonte'' includes his estranged wife Eleanor, chief strategist and financial backer; Pel\u00e9 dos Santos, a safety expert and Brazilian guitarist who sings [[David Bowie]] songs in Portuguese; and Klaus Daimler, the German first mate who views Zissou and Esteban as father figures. Minor crew members include Vikram Ray, cameraman; Bobby Ogata, frogman; Vladimir Wolodarsky, physicist and soundtrack composer; Renzo Pietro, sound man; and Anne-Marie Sakowitz, a script girl who is often seen topless. Also included is a recent group of unpaid interns from the University of North [[Alaska]]. However, the \"Team Zissou\" venture has hit a decline; they have not released a successful documentary in nine years.\n\nNed Plimpton is a longtime Zissou fan whose mother has recently died, and he believes that Zissou is his father. After they meet at Zissou's latest premiere, Ned takes annual leave from his job as an airline pilot in [[Kentucky]] to join his crew. As Oseary Drakoulias, Zissou's producer, cannot find anyone to finance their latest documentary, Ned offers his inheritance. Eleanor feels her husband is taking advantage of Ned and leaves. A pregnant reporter, Jane Winslett-Richardson, comes to chronicle the voyage. Both Ned and Zissou are attracted to Jane, and a competition develops between them. Klaus becomes jealous of the attention Zissou pays to Ned.\n\nOn their mission to find the jaguar shark, the ''Belafonte'' steals tracking equipment from a remote station owned by currently more successful oceanographer (and Zissou's nemesis), Alistair Hennessey. They then sail into unprotected waters and are attacked by Filipino pirates, who steal Ned's money and kidnap Bill Ubell, a \"[[Completion guarantee|bond company]] stooge\" assigned to the project. They are then rescued by Hennessey and towed to [[Ponza|Port-au-Patois]]. Sakowitz, along with all but one of the interns, jumps ship once they reach port.\n\nZissou persuades Eleanor to rejoin the ''Belafonte'', and then leads the crew on a rescue mission. They track Bill to an abandoned hotel on a remote island, saving him along with Hennessey, whom the pirates have also kidnapped. Ned and Zissou then make one last search for the shark in the ship's helicopter, but the aircraft malfunctions and they crash. Ned dies from his injuries and is [[buried at sea]]. Prior to Ned's death, Eleanor revealed to Jane that Zissou is [[Infertility|sterile]]; therefore Ned could not have been his son.\n\nZissou finally tracks down the shark in a [[submersible]] but he decides not to kill it, both because of its beauty and not having any more dynamite. At the premiere of the finished documentary (which is dedicated to Ned), Zissou receives a standing ovation while waiting outside the theater for the premiere to finish. The crew returns triumphantly to the ship the next day.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Steve Zissou\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Edward 'Ned' Plimpton / Kingsley Zissou\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Jane Winslett-Richardson\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Eleanor Zissou\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Klaus Daimler\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Alistair Hennessey\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Oseary Drakoulias\n* [[Bud Cort]] as Bill Ubell, Bond Company Stooge\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Vladimir Wolodarsky\n* [[Seu Jorge]] as Pel\u00e9 dos Santos\n* [[Robyn Cohen]] as Anne-Marie Sakowitz\n* [[Waris Ahluwalia]] as Vikram Ray\n* Niels Koizumi as Bobby Ogata\n* Pawel Wdowczak as Renzo Pietro\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Niko, Intern (credited as Intern #1)\n* [[Antonio Monda]] as Himself\n* [[Isabella Blow]] as Antonia Cook\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Esteban du Plantier\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Literary inspiration===\nThough the characters were inspired by such American novels as ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', the plot has been compared to ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Govender | first=Dyalan | title=Wes Anderson's ''The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'' and Melville's ''Moby Dick'': A Comparative Study | journal=[[Literature/Film Quarterly]] | volume=36 | issue=1 | pages=61\u201367}}</ref>\n\nWriting about the metaphorical aspects of the film's setting\u2014somewhere in the Mediterranean\u2014film critic Elena Past says that the underwater scenes, because they are central to the storyline, make ''The Life Aquatic'' similar in some ways to ''[[Respiro]]''. Both films set out a \"Mediterranean state of being\" where \"having left the security of land, the characters in both films are suddenly confronted with the precarious nature of human existence, as the films that depict them tackle the challenges of representing the submarine world.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last=Past | first=Elena | title=Lives Aquatic: Mediterranean Cinema and an Ethics of Underwater Existence | journal=[[Cinema Journal]] | volume=48 | issue=3 | date=Spring 2009 | pages=52\u201365 | doi=10.1353/cj.0.0104}}</ref>\n\n===Exotic lifeforms===\nIn addition to the luminescent-spotted jaguar shark, other fictional lifeforms (some [[stop motion|stop-motion-animated]]) are cited and appear throughout the film, such as the rhinestone bluefin, crayon ponyfish, wild snow-mongoose, electric jellyfish, and sugar crabs.

[[Mark Mothersbaugh]], a member of [[Devo]], composed the score, as he has for many of Anderson's other films. The film also features many rock songs from the 1960s-1980s, and several instrumental pieces composed by [[Sven Libaek]] for the underwater documentary television series ''Inner Space''. Additionally, the film and soundtrack feature [[Seu Jorge]] performing [[David Bowie]] songs in Portuguese on the acoustic guitar. Jorge, who also plays the character of Pel\u00e9 dos Santos, performs some of these cover songs live, in character during the film, mostly with modified lyrics reflecting Jorge's own experiences working on the film.<ref>{{cite web | date = May 4, 2005 | last = Carle | first = Chris | title = Review: The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou Original Soundtrack | url = http://music.ign.com/articles/604/604056p1.html | work = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] | access-date = May 23, 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223144543/http://music.ign.com/articles/604/604056p1.html | archive-date = December 23, 2007 }}</ref> The ending scene depicting the beauty of the shark features the song \"[[\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun|Star\u00e1lfur]]\" by [[Sigur R\u00f3s]].\n\n''The Life Aquatic'' is Anderson's first film not to feature a [[Rolling Stones]] song.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed a total of $24,020,403 domestically after twelve weeks in release, less than half its $50 million production budget.
