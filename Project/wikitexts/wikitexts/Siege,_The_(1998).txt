The film is about a fictional situation in which [[clandestine cell system|terrorist cells]] have made several attacks in [[New York City]]. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], and [[Bruce Willis]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Rank structure|FBI Special Agent]] Anthony Hubbard and his [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese American]] partner, Frank Haddad intervene at the hijacking of a bus fully loaded with passengers, which contains an [[explosive device]]. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists escape. The FBI receives demands to release Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal, a suspect in an earlier bombing. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative Elise Kraft as he takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Later, another terrorist threat is made and a [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] bus is bombed. FBI captures a man named Samir Nazhde, who admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation.\n\nThe terrorist incidents escalate with the bombing of a bus and a crowded theater and hostage-situation at an elementary school, and culminate in the destruction of One Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, with over 600 casualties. In spite of objections, the [[President of the United States]] declares [[martial law]] and the [[United States Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]], under [[General (United States)|General]] William Devereaux, occupies and seals off Brooklyn in an effort to find the remaining terrorist cells. Subsequently, all young men of Arab descent, including Haddad's son Frank Jr., are rounded up and detained in [[Downing Stadium]]. Haddad resigns in outrage. New Yorkers stage violent demonstrations against the Army and the profiling of the Arabs; the Army fights to maintain control. There are reports of Army killings.\n\nHubbard and Kraft, now revealed to be an intelligence operative named Sharon Bridger, continue their investigation and capture a suspect, Tariq Husseini. Devereaux's men torture and kill Husseini in the course of the interrogation. Afterward, Bridger tells Hubbard that Husseini revealed nothing of value because of the principle of [[Compartmentalization (information security)|compartmentalized information]]. Sickened, she finally admits that she herself provided training and support to militants opposed to [[Saddam Hussein]]'[[Ba'athist Iraq|s regime]], working with Samir to recruit and train the followers of the Sheikh. After the U.S. cut their funding and left them exposed, she took pity on the few of them who had not yet been slaughtered by Hussein's forces, and arranged for them to escape to the United States, ultimately leading to the present situation as they turn their bomb making and covert skills on the country that now holds their leader. She and Hubbard compel Samir to arrange a meeting with the final terrorist cell. Hubbard convinces Haddad to return to the FBI.\n\nA multi-ethnic peace march demonstrates against the occupation of Brooklyn. As the march is getting under way Hubbard and Haddad arrive at the meeting place, but Bridger and Samir have already left. Samir reveals to Bridger that he constitutes the final cell while in another sense he says, \"there will never be a last cell.\" He straps a bomb to his body which he intends to detonate among the marchers. Hubbard and Haddad arrive in time to prevent him leaving but Samir shoots Bridger in the stomach as she struggles to stop him. Hubbard and Haddad kill Samir but despite their best efforts he and Haddad can only watch as Bridger succumbs to her wound after managing to recite certain lines of the second half of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and concluding with \"[[Inshallah]]\" &ndash; the Arabic phrase \"God Willing\".\n\nHubbard, Haddad, and their team raid Devereaux's headquarters to make an arrest for the torture and murder of Husseini. Deveraux insists that under the [[War Powers Resolution]] the authority vested in himself by the President supersedes that of the court which issued the [[arrest warrant]]. He then commands his soldiers to aim their assault rifles at the agents, resulting in a [[Mexican standoff]]. Hubbard reminds Devereaux that the civil liberties and human rights which he took from Husseini are what all his predecessors have fought and died for. Devereaux finally submits and is arrested. Martial law ends and the detainees, including Haddad's son, are given their freedom.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[FBI]] Assistant [[Special Agent in Charge]] Anthony 'Hub' Hubbard\n* [[Annette Bening]] as [[CIA]] Operative Sharon Bridger / Elise Kraft \n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] Bill Devereaux\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as [[FBI]] Special Agent Frank Haddad<ref>{{cite news|title= Caught in the Middle|work= The Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/03/entertainment/ca-38733|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref>\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Khalil Saleh\n* Amro Salama as Tariq Husseini\n* [[Sami Bouajila]] as Samir Nazhde\n* Ahmed Ben Larby as Sheik Akhmed Bin Talal\n* Lianna Pai as FBI Agent Tina Osu\n* [[Mark Valley]] as FBI Agent Mike Johanssen\n* [[David Proval]] as FBI Agent Danny Sussman\n* [[Lance Reddick]] as FBI Agent Floyd Rose\n* [[Lisa Lynn Masters]] as Reporter<ref>{{cite web |title=Actress Lisa Lynn Masters Of 'Gossip Girl' And 'Law & Order: SVU' Reportedly Hangs Herself In Peru |url=https://news.yahoo.com/actress-lisa-lynn-masters-gossip-024021694.html |website=news.yahoo.com |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.

This idea was rejected.  Zwick noted that ''The Siege''{{'}}s villains also include members of the U.S. government, and dismissed the criticism, saying: {{blockquote|Anytime you talk about issues that touch on religion of any kind, you can anticipate this kind of reaction.
