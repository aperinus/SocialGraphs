Day-Day shows Craig around the house and neighborhood. Day-Day explains to Craig that after winning the lottery, all of the taxes and fees that were taken out only left them enough to buy their house and Day-Day's car. A notice arrives informing them that their house could face repossession.\n\nLater, Craig visits Day-Day at work, a record shop. Day-Day hides from his pregnant ex D'Wana and her little sister Baby D who constantly stalk and harass him saying that he is the baby's father. Day-Day's boss Pinky arrives at the store finding it locked. While Day-Day and his co-worker Roach are in the back, a scuffle between Craig and Pinky ensues in which Pinky mistakes him for a robber, while Craig tries to explain that he is Day-Day\u2019s cousin. Pinky then fires Day-Day and Roach.\n\nCraig, Day-Day, and Roach try to figure out how to keep the house. Craig remembers seeing their neighbors, a trio of [[Gang#Street gang|gang member]] brothers known as \"the Jokers\", who live with their sister Karla carrying a hydraulic pump. Suspecting that it may be hiding cash, Craig convinces Day-Day and Roach to help him get inside the Jokers' house and steal the pump.\n\nLater that night, Roach drugs the Jokers' [[Bull Terrier]] Chico with [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] to keep him distracted while Craig sneaks into the Jokers' house. Craig locates the pump finding cash is hidden inside and taking some for himself. He escapes out of a window. Panicking after the eldest Joker closes the window (the way Craig got into the house), Day-Day and Roach knock on the Jokers' door as a diversion for Craig to escape. After discovering money missing, The Jokers take Day-Day and Roach hostage and tie them up.\n\nWillie returns to the neighborhood while unknowingly hauling Deebo and his brother Tyrone in his truck, who snuck in earlier. Craig returns to Elroy's house only to find Day-Day and Roach missing. Craig, Willie, and Elroy decide to investigate the Jokers' house with Elroy's girlfriend Suga saying she will call the police if they aren\u2019t back in ten minutes.\n\nThe trio sneaks into the Jokers' backyard. Joker sends Baby Joker and Lil' Joker to get a chainsaw from the toolshed. Willie knocks Baby Joker with a [[Dimensional lumber|2x4]] and Elroy tackles Lil' Joker. Willie ties the younger Jokers up and puts them in the shed.\n\nJoker goes to look for his brothers and finds Elroy on the ground due to his back giving out after tackling Lil' Joker. Craig then engages him in a fight. As Craig and Joker fight, Elroy unties Day-Day and Roach. Joker gains the upper hand when he picks up an [[AK-47]], Deebo appears and knocks Joker out. Armed with Joker\u2019s rifle, Deebo prepares to shoot but not before he is bitten by Chico. The police arrive and arrest the Joker brothers, Deebo, and Tyrone. Craig leaves with the Jokers' pump.\n\nAfter witnessing D\u2019Wana and Baby D toss a brick at Day-Day\u2019s BMW, Craig returns home with his dad.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Craig Jones, a slacker who relocates to Rancho Cucamonga.\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Daymond \"Day Day\" Jones, the cousin of Craig who lives in Rancho Cucamonga.\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Willie Jones, an animal control officer and the father of Craig who relocates his son to Rancho Cucamonga.\n* [[Tamala Jones]] as D'Wana, the pregnant ex-girlfriend of Day Day who claims that Day Day is the father of her unborn child.\n* [[Tommy Lister Jr.|Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister, Jr.]] as Deebo, the neighborhood bully who escapes from prison to exact revenge on Craig.\n* [[Justin Pierce]] as Roach, a friend of Day Day.\n* [[Don 'D.C.'
