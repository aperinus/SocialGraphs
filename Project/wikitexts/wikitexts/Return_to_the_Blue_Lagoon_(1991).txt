Graham]] and starring [[Milla Jovovich]] and [[Brian Krause]]. The film is a sequel to ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1980). The screenplay by [[Leslie Stevens]] was based on the 1923 novel ''[[The Garden of God]]'' by [[Henry De Vere Stacpoole]]. The original music score was written, composed, and performed by [[Basil Poledouris]]. The film's closing theme song, \"A World of Our Own\", is performed by [[Surface (band)|Surface]] featuring Bernard Jackson. The music was written by [[Barry Mann]], and the lyrics were written by [[Cynthia Weil]].\n\nThe film tells the story of two young children marooned on a [[desert island|tropical island paradise]] in the South Pacific. Their life together is blissful, but not without physical and emotional changes, as they grow to [[sexual maturity|maturity]] and fall in love. The film was [[box-office bomb|not financially successful]], grossing just $2.8 million on a $11 million budget. Like its predecessor, it was panned by critics.  It has an [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|approval rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the South Pacific Ocean in the year 1897, beginning right where the original film left off, a larger ship finds a little dinghy with three passengers. They quickly find out that the two adults are dead, but the infant snuggled between them lives \u2013 a little two-year-old boy who they assume is named \"Richard\" since that's the only name he knows. They take the baby aboard and he is given over to the care of the young widow who already has a young daughter named Lilli. Mrs. Sarah Hargrave, the widow, and the two young children are [[castaway|cast off]] from the ship they are travelling on because the ship's crew are infected with [[cholera]]. After days afloat, Kearney, a sailor who has been sent with them, tries to kill the boy because of his excessive crying. Sarah angrily beats Kearney to death with a harpoon and dumps his body overboard.\n\nThe trio arrive at a beautiful tropical island in the South Pacific. Sarah tries to raise them to be civilized, as the orphaned boy Richard was [[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|born and raised by young lovers on this same island]]. They grow up and Sarah educates them from the [[Bible]], as well as from her own knowledge, including the [[birds and the bees|facts of life]]. She cautiously demands the children never to go to the forbidden side of the island.\n\nEight years later, when Richard and Lilli are 10 and 8 years old, Sarah dies from [[pneumonia]], leaving them to fend for themselves. She is buried on a scenic promontory overlooking the tidal reef area. Together, the kids survive on their resourcefulness and the bounty of their remote paradise.\n\nSix years later, both Richard and Lilli grow into strong and beautiful teenagers. They live in a house on the beach and spend their days together fishing, swimming, and exploring the island. Both their bodies mature and develop and they are physically attracted to each other. Richard lets Lilli win the child's game [[egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]] and dives to find Lilli an adult's pearl as her reward. His penchant for racing a lagoon [[shark]] sparks a domestic quarrel; Lilli thinks he is foolhardy, but the liveliness makes Richard feel virile.\n\nLilli awakens in the morning with her first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]], just as Sarah described the threshold of womanhood. Richard awakens in the morning with an [[erection]] and suffers a nasty mood swing, which he cannot explain. They then get into an argument regarding privacy and their late mother's rules.\n\nOne night, Richard goes off to the forbidden side of the island, and discovers that a group of natives from another island use the shrine of an impressive, [[Viracocha|Kon-Tiki]]-like idol to sacrifice conquered enemies every full moon. Richard camouflages himself with mud and hides in the muck; meanwhile, Lilli worries about his disappearance. Richard escapes unscathed, though he is seen by a lone native.\n\nUltimately, after making up for their fight, Richard and Lilli discover [[Romance (love)|natural love]] and [[Intimate relationship|passion]], which deepens their emotional bond. They fall in love and exchange formal wedding vows and rings in the middle of the jungle. They [[Consummation|consummate]] their new-found feelings for each other for the next months.\n\nSoon after, a ship arrives at the island, carrying unruly sailors, a proud captain, and his beautiful but spoiled daughter, Sylvia Hilliard. The party is welcomed by the young couple, and they ask to be taken back to civilization, after many years in isolation. Sylvia tries to steal Richard from Lilli and seduce him, but as tempted as he is by her strange ways, he realizes that Lilli is his heart and soul, upsetting Sylvia. Richard angrily leaves Sylvia behind in the middle of the fish pond, in plain view of the landing party.\n\nMeanwhile, Quinlan, a sailor, ogles Lilli in her bath and drags her back to the house. He tries to rape her and steal her pearl before Richard comes to her rescue. Quinlan opens fire on Richard, who flees. Richard lures Quinlan to his death in the jaws of the shark in the tidal reef area.\n\nUpon returning, he apologizes to Lilli for hurting her, and she reveals that she is [[pregnant]]. She tells him that if he wants to leave, then she will not stop him, but that she wants to raise their child away from civilization and away from guns. They decide to stay and raise their child on the island, as they feel their blissful life would not compare to civilization. The ship departs and the two young lovers stay on the island and have their baby, a girl.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Lilli Hargrave\n* [[Brian Krause]] as Paddy / Richard LeStrange Jr.\n* [[Lisa Pelikan]] as Mrs. Sarah Hargrave\n* Courtney Barilla as Young Lilli Hargrave (credited as Courtney Phillips)\n* [[Garette Ratliff Henson]] as Young Richard LeStrange \n* Emma James as Infant Lilli\n* Jackson Barton as Infant Richard\n* Nana Coburn as Sylvia Hilliard\n* [[Brian Blain]] as Captain Jacob Hilliard\n* [[Peter Hehir]] as Quinlan\n* Alexander Petersons as Giddens\n* [[John Mann (musician)|John Mann]] as First Captain\n* [[Wayne Pygram]] as Kearney\n* [[John Dicks (actor)|John Dicks]] as Penfield\n}}\n\n==Background and production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Australia]] and [[Taveuni]], [[Fiji]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb]]; on a budget of $11,000,000, it made less than $3,000,000 in the United States.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film exceeded the original for how negatively it was reviewed.
