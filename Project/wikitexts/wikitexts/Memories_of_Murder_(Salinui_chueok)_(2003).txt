It is loosely based on the true story of [[Hwaseong serial murders|Korea's first confirmed serial murders]], which took place between 1986 and 1991 in [[Hwaseong City|Hwaseong]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]]. [[Song Kang-ho]] and [[Kim Sang-kyung]] star as Detective Park and Detective Seo, respectively, two of the detectives trying to solve the crimes.\n\nThe film was the second feature film directed by Bong, following his 2000 debut film ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]''. The [[screenplay]] was adapted by Bong and [[Shim Sung-bo]] from [[Kim Kwang-rim]]'s 1996 [[Play (theatre)|stage play]] ''Come to See Me'' about the same subject. The film has earned critical acclaim for its tone, cinematography, editing, score, Song's performance, and Bong's direction and screenplay. The film received thirty awards and nominations, and is considered by many to be one of the best South Korean films ever made.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=June|title=Memories of Murder Makes Cinema Scope's ''Top Ten Films of the Decade''|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&seq=3384|website=Korean Film Biz Zone|access-date=April 2, 2015|date=April 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-14|title=\ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc0c1\uc790\ub8cc\uc6d0 {{!}} \uc6f9\uc9c4|url=http://koreafilm.or.kr/webzine/section_view.asp?Section=36&UpSeq=1564&downSeq=3055&intGroupNum=4|accessdate=2020-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514125755/http://koreafilm.or.kr/webzine/section_view.asp?Section=36&UpSeq=1564&downSeq=3055&intGroupNum=4|archivedate=2015-05-14}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn October 1986, two women are found [[rape]]d and murdered on the outskirts of a small town. Local detective Park Doo-man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed\u2014evidence is improperly collected, the police's investigative methods are suspicious, and their [[Forensic science|forensic]] technology is near non-existent. Park claims he has a way of determining suspects by eye contact. He decides to first question a scarred [[Mental retardation|mentally handicapped]] boy, Baek Kwang-ho, because he used to follow one of the victims around town. Park uses his eye contact method, thinking Baek is responsible, and has his partner Cho beat confessions out of Baek.\n\nSeo Tae-yoon, a detective from [[Seoul]], volunteers to assist them. However he and Park's methods clash. Seo deems Baek's hands too weak and scarred to be able to commit such an elaborate crime, clearing his name. After more murders are committed, they realize that the killer waits until a rainy night and only kills women wearing red. Officer Kwon Kwi-ok realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed.\n\nAt the latest crime scene, Park, Cho and Seo all arrive to investigate in different ways, but a local man there masturbates in a woman's red lingerie. Park and Cho apprehend the man, brutally beating him. Seo finds a survivor of the killer with Kwon's help. Upon learning that the killer's hands were noticeably soft, Seo clears the man, as his hands are rough. Infuriated that they lost their suspect, Park scuffles with Seo until Kwon alerts them that the song on the radio is playing. They realize it's raining but arrive too late, finding another woman murdered. Park, Seo and Cho finally decide to work together.\n\nUpon doing an autopsy of the latest victim, they discover pieces of a peach in the body. Clues lead them to a factory worker, Park Hyeon-gyu. Seo notes that his hands are soft like the survivor had described. Hyeon-gyu begins to show discomfort when Seo presents the peaches and they think they've found the killer. Cho loses control and beats Hyeon-gyu, prompting their superior to ban him from the interrogation room. Park and Seo listen to Baek's earlier confession. Seo points out that he talks as if someone else did it and they realize he knew details of the murder because he witnessed it. They go to Baek's father's restaurant, only to discover a drunken Cho there. As people watch  news and ridicule police officers, he beats everyone and Baek joins the fray, swinging a wooden board at Cho's leg and accidentally piercing it with a rusty nail. Park and Seo chase Baek and question him, but he gets frightened and runs into the path of an oncoming train, where he is struck and killed.\n\nPark learns that Cho's leg will have to be amputated because the nail caused [[tetanus]], leaving him feeling guilty. They discover semen on one of the bodies, but because of Korea's lack of [[Forensic DNA analysis|DNA analysis technology]], the sample is sent to the [[United States]] to confirm if suspect Hyeon-gyu is the killer. That night, a young girl is killed. At the crime scene, Seo recognizes the girl as the same schoolgirl he had befriended while investigating. Enraged, he attacks Hyeon-gyu until he is interrupted by Park bringing the results from America. The sample is deemed to be inconclusive in relation to Hyeon-gyu's DNA and Park lets Hyeon-gyu go.\n\nIn 2003, the crimes remain unsolved and Park is now a father and businessman. He happens to pass by the first crime scene and decides to visit it, learning from a little girl that the scene had recently been visited by an unknown man who had said that he was reminiscing about something he had done there a long time ago. Park asks the girl what he had looked like, and she tells him that he had a \"normal\" face, and was someone who looked very ordinary. The film ends as [[Breaking the fourth wall|Park looks straight at the camera]], seemingly trying to spot the killer amongst the audience by using his eye contact method.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Song

difficulties of shooting the film, saying that \"even though they avoided the location of the incident, Hwaseong, while filming, it was done carefully since the family of the victims of the real cases were still alive\".<ref name=kumho/> In an interview with South Korean newspaper ''[[Hankook Ilbo]]'' in August 2002, regarding the motivation for making the film, he replied that as a fan of [[detective fiction]] he \"aimed to depict the horror that has not yet been revealed through the emotions evoked through the clash of unmatching concepts of scenic landscapes and grotesque corpses\" along with the limitation of the times.<ref name=hangook>{{cite news|url=https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/200208290017728382|script-title=ko:\"\uc0b4\uc778\uc758 \ucd94\uc5b5\"

and the scenario was written based on real case reports of the incident as well as personal interviews of the detective who was involved in the case.<ref name=hangook/> The film also aimed to reflect his personal reflections from his domestic failure of his previous work ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]'', which he described as an \"enumeration of personal interests\".<ref

screens in the frames of the film as well as the missing information in time, the music was composed in \"almost connected, yet almost disconnected rhythms\".<ref name=iwashi/> The style of the music was also required to be realistic and to contain themes of memory of the times and murder.<ref name=iwashi/>\n\n==Reception==\nWithin a year of its debut, ''Memories of Murder'' was received as a [[cult film]]. Later in the decade, it was praised by numerous international publications, referred to as one of the greatest films of 2000s, one of the best crime films ever made, and one of the best South Korean films of all time. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10.
