It centers on Nick Falzone ([[John Cusack]]), a cocky [[air traffic controller]] who quarrels over proving \"who's more of a man\" with fellow employee Russell Bell ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). The film is loosely based around the real world [[New York TRACON]] radar facility. The film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]] and received mixed reviews. The original music score was composed by [[Anne Dudley]] and [[Chris Seefried]].\n\n==Plot==\nNick \"The Zone\" Falzone and his fellow [[air traffic controller]]s at the [[New York TRACON]] pride themselves on their ability to handle the intense stress of being a controller for one of the busiest airspaces in the country, even boasting of the 50% drop-out rate for new additions to staff unable to cope with the pressure. The group is joined by the quiet and confident Russell Bell, a veteran of TRACONs in the Western [[United States|US]].\n\nRussell quickly proves to be exceptionally capable of handling the increased workload using unorthodox and risky methods. Nick feels challenged by the new controller's ability to out-perform him at seemingly every task. He warns his supervisor Bell is a loose cannon, especially after discovering that Russell once stood on a runway to allow himself to be violently propelled by a landing commercial airliner's [[Wake turbulence|jetwash]].\n\nAt a supermarket, Nick encounters Russell's despondent young wife Mary, who is sobbing over a grocery cart full of alcohol. In consoling her, he ends up at the Bells' house, where they cheat on their respective spouses. Several days later, Mary informs Nick that she immediately told Russell about the affair, and that the confession has actually improved their marriage.\n\nFearing retaliation, Nick confronts Russell at work, and is confused and surprised by his even-tempered response to the situation. Meanwhile, Nick's wife, Connie seems to become more and more intrigued by Russell, and Nick becomes increasingly paranoid that he will eventually seek revenge by having sex with her.\n\nWhile out of town for his father-in-law's funeral, Nick can't bring himself to lie when a grieving Connie challenges him to say that he has never cheated on her. As their flight home approaches New York, she tells him that she has indeed slept with Russell. The plane then makes an odd turn, and he believes Russell is harassing him, or possibly going insane, purposely directing the plane into a dangerous storm.\n\nSoon after going to TRACON to confront Russell, a bomb threat is called in to the facility. The building is evacuated and both Nick and Russell volunteer to stay behind to handle the daunting task of landing all the planes on approach before the alleged bomb is set to go off in 26 minutes. Successfully routing all but one plane that has lost radio contact, Nick leaves the building as the deadline approaches, while Russell remains inside to make contact with the plane by calling one of its passengers via [[Airfone]]. Russell is lauded as a hero for making the effort despite the threat, which turned out to be a hoax.\n\nRussell abruptly quits and he and Mary move to Colorado. Connie leaves Nick, and his performance at work suffers; the once cocky, boastful controller is sent home after being responsible for two \"deals\" (near mid-air collisions) in one shift. After learning that Russell had ordered the diversion of his flight not to provoke him, but to clear a path to make a plane with a medical emergency on board next in line for a landing, Nick impulsively drives out to Colorado to make amends.\n\nNick seeks his advice on how to get his personal life back in order, but Russell is unable to make him understand with words. He instead brings Nick to a runway so that he too can experience being caught in a landing aircraft's turbulence. They engage in the stunt together, and it has a profound effect on Nick, who thanks Russell. He returns to New York, where he regains his form at work, and reconciles with Connie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Nick \"The Zone\" Falzone\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Russell Bell\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Connie Falzone\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Mary Bell\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Barry Plotkin\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Ed Clabes \n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as Tina Leary \n* [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as Ron Hewitt \n* Jerry Grayson as Leo Morton \n* [[Michael Willis]] as Pat Feeney \n* [[Philip Akin]] as Paul \n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Pete \n* [[Neil Crone]] as Tom \n* [[Matt Gordon]] as Ken \n* [[Joe Pingue]] as Mark \n* Dwight McFee as Veteran controller \n* [[Michael Hyatt]] as Trudy\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Doctor Freeze\n* [[Kiersten Warren]] as Karen\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Pushing Tin'' received mixed reviews.
