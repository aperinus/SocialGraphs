The film is set in late 1960s Australia. Four orphan boys from a [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Roman Catholic]] [[orphanage]] in the [[Outback|outback of Australia]] {{spaced ndash}} Maps, Misty, Spark and Spit {{spaced ndash}} were all born in the month of December, and for their birthday, they are sent on a holiday to the beach to stay with Mr. and Mrs. McAnsh. While there, they meet Fearless, a man who claims to be the risk motorbike rider in the nearby carnival, and his wife, Teresa. Misty, Spark and Spit instantly become closer to Teresa, but Maps, eldest of the four, is still reluctant to talk to her. He instead finds more fun in spending time with an older teenage girl named Lucy, who had come to the beach to stay with her uncle. He often goes up to a place with strange rocks, and meets her there.\n\nA few days later, the orphans peek through a window in Fearless' house to see Teresa undressing, but Misty, being the most religious of the four, throws a rock at the wall to make them go away. Misty runs back to Mr. McAnsh's house and looks through the small opening of a door to see someone in the shower, only to find that it is the sickly Mrs. McAnsh. They soon discover that she has [[breast cancer]].\n\nOne night, Misty overhears Fearless talking to his friends about the possibility of [[Adoption|adopting]] one of the orphans. Excited about the opportunity to finally have parents, he keeps it to himself until he decides to reveal it to a priest who has driven to the beach for the orphans' confessions. The other boys realise that he is taking too long, and once he is finished, they force it out of him with the threat of Spit spitting on him while he is pinned to the ground. Misty, Spark and Spit are eager to compete for the love of the seemingly perfect Fearless and Teresa, but Maps is less than excited, even saying to Lucy, \"What's the big deal about parents, anyway?\" Maps experiences his first kiss with Lucy, and soon loses his [[virginity]] to her in one of the caves of the Remarkable Rocks.\n\nThere, she tells him to promise that he will always remember her as his first. The next day, he goes up to the Remarkable Rocks, only to find Lucy is not there. Her uncle tells him that she has left the beach to return to her father, and will not likely be back until next summer. Heartbroken, he goes to the carnival to find Fearless and talk to him, but discovers that he is not a motorbike rider there, and instead cleans up after the animals. Furious that he'd lied all along, he finds a painting made by Misty of him as the son of Fearless and Teresa, and destroys it. Misty attacks him and hits him with the fragments of the frame he had put the painting in, and the bond between the four orphans is broken.\n\nFearless finds Maps in the cave of the Remarkable Rocks, and explains to him what had really happened. It is revealed to that Fearless was formerly a bike rider, and did all of the stunts with Teresa riding on the back of the bike. Then, there was an accident that kept Teresa in the hospital for nearly a year, making her unable to have children. That was the reason they had wanted to adopt one of the orphans.\n\nMaps returns to the beach and finds out from Spark and Spit that Misty has gone into the water, and is drowning. Maps goes after him despite the fact that he cannot swim. Both he and Misty nearly drown. Underwater, they open their eyes to see a vision of the Virgin Mary, possibly meaning that they are dying. Before they can reach out to it, the two boys are grabbed by Fearless and brought back to the shore. Maps and Misty reconcile with each other and the four are friends again.\n\nThe next day, the boys are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He takes leave of his friends and he watches on the front porch with Fearless and Teresa as the other three orphans walk away and begin playing on some rocks down the beach. Misty realises that they are his true family, and asks Fearless and Teresa if he can stay with them instead. They accept, and he returns home with the orphans.\n\nMany decades later, Misty, as an old man, drives to the same beach along with the ashes of Maps, who had recently died while working as a priest in Africa helping refugees, and Lucy's ring that she gave to Maps on that holiday long ago.  He meets up with Spark and Spit, and they toss the ashes and ring loose into the wind from the hill above the beach, remembering Maps and their time there, with a cheer to \"The December Boys.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Maps\n* [[Lee Cormie]] as Misty\n* [[Christian Byers]] as Spark\n* James Fraser as Spit\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Bandy McAnsh\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Lucy\n* [[Sullivan Stapleton]] as Fearless\n* [[Victoria Hill]] as Teresa\n* [[Kris McQuade]] as Mrs. McAnsh\n* Ralph Cotterill as Shellback\n* Frank Gallacher as Father Scully\n\n==Production==\n[[Freddie Highmore]] was considered for the role of Maps, but was replaced by Radcliffe because he would not leave the United Kingdom, as he wanted to be with his sick grandmother.<ref>{{cite web| year =2005| url =http://www.danradcliffe.com/news/fullnews.php?id=950| title =December Boys: Book Summary| work =News| publisher =danradcliffe.com| accessdate =16 October 2007| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035555/http://www.danradcliffe.com/news/fullnews.php?id=950| archivedate =20 May 2006| df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 41% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 70 reviews.<ref name=rottentomatoes>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/december_boys/ | title=December Boys - Rotten Tomatoes | access-date=2022-06-30 | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> Metacritic's score was 56/100 based on 21 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/decemberboys | title=December Boys (2007): Reviews | access-date=2007-10-15 | publisher=Metacritic}}</ref> In Australia several newspapers remarked that ''December Boys'' was a commercial bomb due to its relatively large distribution and advertisement versus its small box office return.\n\n==Box office==\n''December Boys'' grossed $633,606 at the box office in Australia.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf | publisher=[[Film Victoria]] | title=''Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'' | access-date=23 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218045303/http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf | archive-date=18 February 2011 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n* [[South Australian Film Corporation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0465436|title=December Boys}}\n* {{mojo title|id=decemberboys|title=December Boys}}\n\n{{Rod Hardy}}\n\n[[Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:2007 films]]\n[[Category:Australian coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about adoption]]\n[[Category:Films based on Australian novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rod Hardy]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in South Australia]]\n[[Category:Kangaroo Island]]\n[[Category:Films about horses]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 2000s]]\n[[Category:Films set on beaches]]\n[[Category:2007 drama films]]\n[[Category:Warner Independent Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
