Griphook agrees, in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and [[Draco Malfoy]]; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry, who captured it from Draco. A horcrux, [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of [[Lord Voldemort]] at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] is hidden at [[Hogwarts]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]] and are helped by [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], who reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, which [[Neville Longbottom]] guides them through.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] knows Harry has returned and threatens to punish any staff or students who aid Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees during a duel with [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. McGonagall rouses the Hogwarts community for battle. [[Luna Lovegood]] urges Harry to speak to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost. She reveals Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem that is somewhere in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry in the Room of Requirement, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him while Harry, Ron, and Hermione save Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Once outside, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it to the inferno. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. In the boathouse, the trio overhear Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; Nagini then viciously attacks Snape. As Snape dies, he gives Harry one of his memories. Meanwhile, [[Fred Weasley]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry views Snape's memory in the [[Pensieve]]: Snape despised Harry's late father [[James Potter (character)|James]], who bullied him, but he loved his mother [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked with [[Albus Dumbledore]] as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. It was Snape who conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he became an accidental Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Resurrection Stone|Resurrection Stone]] that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he surrenders to Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Voldemort casts the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] upon Harry, who awakens in [[limbo]]. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Harry chooses the former.\n\nVoldemort displays Harry's apparent corpse and demands that Hogwarts surrender. As Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the [[Sorting Hat]] in defiance, Harry reveals he is alive and the Malfoys and many other [[Death Eaters]] abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, Ron's mother, [[Molly Weasley|Molly]], kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, destroying the last of the horcruxes. Harry finally defeats Voldemort after the Expelliarmus charm deflects the Killing Curse, rebounding it onto the Dark Lord. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand. It recognised him as its true master after he had disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, atop the Astronomy Tower. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry destroys it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and his friends proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 17-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. \n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: One of Harry's best friends. \n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: Harry's other best friend. \n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]: A [[Death Eater]] and [[Sirius Black]]'s cousin and murderer. \n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of staff at [[Hogwarts]]. \n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Professor [[Albus Dumbledore]]: The late headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]. \n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]]: The Charms master and Head of the [[Ravenclaw]] house at Hogwarts; and also as [[Griphook]], a [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank. \n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Garrick Ollivander]]: A wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters. \n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]]: Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced Death Eater. \n* [[Helen McCrory]] as [[Narcissa Malfoy]]: Draco's mother and Bellatrix's sister.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]]: Harry's late godfather. \n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Professor [[Severus Snape]]: Former Head of the [[Slytherin]] House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]. \n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]]: The Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the [[Gryffindor]] house at [[Hogwarts]]. \n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]]: A [[werewolf]] member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at [[Hogwarts]]. \n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]]: The Weasley matriarch.\n* [[Tom Felton]] as [[Draco Malfoy]]: A Death Eater and son of Lucius and [[Narcissa Malfoy]].\n* [[Bonnie Wright]] as [[Ginny Weasley]]: Ron's younger sister and Harry's love interest.\n* [[Matthew Lewis (actor)|Matthew Lewis]] as [[Neville Longbottom]]: A schoolfriend and strong supporter of Harry Potter.

The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |access-date=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120201728/http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |archive-date=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really&nbsp;\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white&nbsp;\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |access-date=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913153753/http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |archive-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say: \"It's taken two years&nbsp;\u2013 getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/785760/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_making_the_hogwarts_battle.html |title=Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2: making the Hogwarts battle |publisher=Den of Greek |date=24 February 2011 |access-date=20 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227201728/http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/785760/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_making_the_hogwarts_battle.html |archive-date=27 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn the quality of 3D in film, Burke told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"I think it's good, actually.

We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer [[David Heyman]] spoke to ''SFX'' magazine about the [[2D to 3D conversion|3D conversion]], saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view.
