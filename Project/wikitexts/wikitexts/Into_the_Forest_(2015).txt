There is a massive, continent-wide [[power outage]] that appears to be part of a region-wide technological collapse. The car battery is drained, so they are left stranded for days. Their father eventually gets the car working and they make it to the nearest town, where they buy supplies including gas from a man named Stan. Eva later attends dance class while her sister meets up with her boyfriend, Eli.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott |date=2015-09-13 |title=Toronto Film Review: 'Into the Forest' |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/into-the-forest-review-toronto-film-festival-1201592428/ |access-date=2022-03-06 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> Returning home, they see a stranded car and the girls' father offers to help the passengers, but the family move on after they [[wikt:brandish|brandish]] guns. The father says that they will not return to town until the power is restored. Later, while cutting down a tree, he cuts his leg badly with a [[chainsaw]]. Knowing he is bleeding to death, he tells the girls to take care of each other and love one another. They bury him where he died in the forest.\n\nTwo months pass and the girls are low on food. They are also getting by with the skills that their father taught them, though they miss some of the creature comforts they used to have. For instance, Eva has to dance to a [[metronome]] since she can no longer listen to music.\n\nEli arrives one night, having walked there looking for Nell. He says that all the surrounding houses are abandoned. After Nell and Eli sleep together, he says there may still be power and order in [[Boston]]. He convinces Nell to go with him, but as they leave, Nell turns back after a night away from home, unwilling to leave Eva. Nell researches plants for food and medicine, and [[forages]]. After a night of celebration when Nell confirms she is not pregnant, while Nell is foraging in the forest, Eva is surprised by Stan while she is chopping wood. He assaults and rapes her before stealing most of the remaining gas and the car. The girls board the house up and Eva stays within doors. Eva throws up, and soon realizes she is pregnant. To Nell's surprise, Eva has decided to keep the baby, saying that she doe not want to lose any more. To help nourish Eva during her pregnancy, Nell hunts and [[butcher]]s a pig.\n\nDuring a storm, several beams of the roof break and Eva goes into labor. The sisters flee for a hollowed out tree stump that once served as their [[wikt:play house|play house]], where Eva gives birth to a baby boy. Returning to their ruined home, Eva decides to burn the house down with the remainder of the gas that their father purchased from Stan in case anyone passing will think that they died in a fire. Before setting the house ablaze, they collect a few precious items and [[Souvenir|keepsakes]] such as a family photo, and begin to walk into the darkened forest.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elliot Page]] as Nell\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Eva\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Eli\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Robert, Dad\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Mom\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Stan\n* [[Sandy Sidhu]] as Quiz Woman\n* Jordana Largy as Margot\n* Bethany Brown as Gabs\n* Simon Longmore as Biker\n* Brittany Willacy as Gigi\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Megan Griffiths]] was considered to direct, but was ultimately passed on by the producers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Megan|title=I Wasn't Hired to Direct Into the Forest \u2013 Here's What I Thought of the Film|url=http://thetalkhouse.com/wasnt-hired-direct-forest-heres-thought-film/|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> On October 21, 2013, [[Elliot Page]] and [[Evan Rachel Wood]] joined the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ellen-page-evan-rachel-wood-649787|title=Ellen Page, Evan Rachel Wood Head 'Into the Forest'|date=21 October 2013|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] and production began on July 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-72814-ted-2-starts-for-universal-pictures-the-greens-are-gone-wraps/|title=On The Set For 7/28/14: 'Ted 2\u2032 Starts For Universal Pictures, 'The Greens Are Gone' Wraps \u2039 SSN Insider|accessdate=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704065310/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-72814-ted-2-starts-for-universal-pictures-the-greens-are-gone-wraps/|archivedate=4 July 2017}}</ref> On August 27, 2014, [[Max Minghella]] and [[Callum Keith Rennie]] joined the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/people-news/max-minghella-and-callum-keith-rennie-join-into-the-forest-exclusive-1201291968/|title=Max Minghella and Callum Keith Rennie Join 'Into the Forest' (EXCLUSIVE)|date=27 August 2014|website=Variety|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref> Elliot Page learned how to butcher a pig in order to perform the process well in the movie.<ref>{{Citation |title=Into the Forest (2015) - IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2625810/trivia/ |access-date=2022-03-06}}</ref> Evan Rachel Wood's methodical approach to getting into Eva's character included eating extremely small portions of food.
