Laid off due to budget cuts, she is forced to obtain a job as a [[tour guide]]. She feels she has hit rock bottom, losing her passion in everything, and is told by her boss, Maria, that she has received negative feedback from the tourists who say she is boring. Georgia finds herself leading a tour of misfits around Greece, believing she is a failure as they seem to care more about souvenirs than learning about history and culture. She envies her co-worker's group of Canadians, who seem to be more interested in history and culture than wanting to go shopping and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia, saying they are more intrigued by Nico, as he is more engaging. Georgia's driver is replaced at the last minute by driver Poupi.\n\nEverything seems to go wrong, and is made worse when she complains to Maria for favoring Nico over her, letting his group have better conditions than hers. After feeling ignored again, Georgia sends her a letter saying she is quitting at the end of her tour. The next day, an elderly seasoned traveler, Irv Gideon, helps Georgia see why she is not connecting with the group: she finds them annoying, is sick of her current job and is miserable in her life. He shows her how to have fun, be more engaging to the group and let go of her problems. Georgia learns more about them, and opens her eyes to the different places where they are from. In doing so, she also teaches them the origins of the [[Olympic Games]], in a way that makes them genuinely interested. Georgia takes them to one of the ruins where Irv acts as an Oracle to help others with various problems.\n\nWhile they become more immersed in Greek culture, Poupi shows more interest in Georgia. However, her antics distract him while driving, and he narrowly avoids a major accident on the road. That night, Georgia and her group are given better accommodations in better hotel by Maria. Unfortunately, this is a place Nico and his group are staying at. Attractive female members from Georgia's group distract a hurt Nico as Georgia, Irv and Poupi secretly sabotage his tour bus, stealing the air conditioning and installing it in theirs. The next day, as they enjoy the day at the beach, Irv becomes sick and they take him to the hospital. Georgia is unsure if she should continue, concerned for Irv's health, until Poupi encourages her to do so.\n\nDuring the [[Parthenon]] tour, Georgia shows them why she loves coming here: at the right time, you can feel the wind from the ruins. Many hear the wind and are impressed by its peace. One of the group members named Gator ask Georgia if they can visit the hospital to see Irv. The group thinks it's a great idea and she agrees. While his group looks around, the annoyed Nico confronts Georgia. She realizes she had the better group and that he never got to know his own group. Nico reveals that without air conditioning on his tour bus, he got a serious headache from the constant complaints his group was making and wanted a beach day. When he openly insults his group by calling them Americans, the Canadians are offended and start beating him up. Georgia's group visits the hospital, where Irv is recovering well.\n\nAt the farewell party, Maria confronts Georgia about the letter and convinces her to stay, with a promise of a raise after reading the great reviews from her group. She even admits that she is glad Nico quit as she never liked him and only tolerated him because she knew his parents well. Georgia ends up with Poupi, who gets promoted to full-time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nia Vardalos]] as Georgia Ianakopolis\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Irv Gideon\n* [[Alexis Georgoulis]] as Poupi Kakas\n* [[Alistair McGowan]] as Nico\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Big Al Sawchuck\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Kim Sawchuck\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Dr. Elizabeth Tullen\n* [[Ian Ogilvy]] as Mr. Stewart Tullen\n* [[Sophie Stuckey]] as Caitlin Tullen\n* [[Mar\u00eda Botto]] as Lala\n* [[Mar\u00eda Ad\u00e1nez]] as Lena\n* [[Brian Palermo]] as Marc Mallard\n* [[Jareb Dauplaise]] as Gator\n* Simon Gleeson as Ken\n* Natalie O'Donnell as Sue\n* [[Sheila Bernette]] as [[Dorcas]]\n* [[Ralph Nossek]] as Barnaby\n* Bernice Stegers as Maria\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Elinor\n* [[Ian Gomez]] as hotel clerk\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe script is originally by [[Mike Reiss]], based on his travel experiences, but it was later re-written by Vardalos (''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'') after she became involved.

I didn't hate it so much as feel sorry for it ... The central question posed by \"My Life in Ruins\" is, what happened to the [[Nia Vardalos]] who wrote and starred in ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]''? She was lovable, earthy, sassy, plumper, more of a mess, and the movie grossed more than $300 million. Here she's thinner, blonder, better dressed, looks younger and knows it. She's like the winner of a beauty makeover at a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studio. She has that don't touch my makeup! look ... Now she is rich, famous and perhaps taking herself seriously after being worked over for one too many magazine covers ... There is, in short, nothing I liked about \"My Life in Ruins,\" except some of the ruins.</blockquote>\n\nScott Foundas, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (June 2, 2009), agreed:\n\n<blockquote>My Life in Ruins Is Nia Vardalos' Strangely Self-Loathing Anti-Comeback: Substitute \"career\" for \"life\" in the title of this stillborn travelogue comedy, and you'll have a succinct verdict on ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' writer/star [[Nia Vardalos]], whose efforts to prove herself more than a one-megahit wonder have been greeted by audiences with an apathy previously reserved for the post\u2013[[Crocodile Dundee]] oeuvre of [[Paul Hogan]] ... the result, written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' alum [[Mike Reiss]] and directed (in a manner of speaking) by ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men's]]'' [[Donald Petrie]], is a strangely self-loathing affair that paints Vardalos's tour group as a uniformly ill-mannered, culturally illiterate bunch, while rendering [[Greece]] itself as a badly plumbed third-world hellhole run by lazy, [[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba]]-dancing louts.</blockquote>{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[Lou Lumenick]], of the ''[[New York Post]]'', also wrote on June 5, 2009:\n\n<blockquote>BEWARE Greek-Canadians bearing comeback vehicles. At least if they're [[Nia Vardalos]], who quickly disappeared from sight after improbably turning 2002's ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' into the most successful romantic comedy of all time. Notably thinner, less awkward and a lot less charming, Vardalos is back with \"My Life in Ruins,\" a desperate, crass and probably futile attempt at replicating the earlier movie's fluke success. This limp [[souvlaki]] of a movie is served without any noticeable enthusiasm by director [[Donald Petrie]] (''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'').</blockquote>{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[David Stratton]], of ''[[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|At the Movies]]'', gave the film 1 out of 5 stars and said:\n\n<blockquote> ... maybe they [the Greek Government] read the script and they thought, 'This is a shocker'. And it is so bad, this film ... the Australian characters are unbelievable throwbacks to another era ... everybody is awful. And, unfortunately, she's [Vardalos] disconcertingly like Sarah Palin, and this really threw me during the film. But it's just such a crass [film] - and all these jokes about Poupi's name. That's supposed to be funny.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2616193.htm |title=At the Movies: My Life In Ruins |publisher=Abc.net.au |access-date=2011-01-02}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nThe film was nominated for Choice Summer Movie: Romance at the [[2009 Teen Choice Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teenchoiceawards.com/vote-summer-post.php |title=Teen Choice 09 |publisher=Teenchoiceawards.com |access-date=2011-01-02 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0865559}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|my_life_in_ruins}}\n\n{{Donald Petrie}}\n{{Portal bar|Film}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2009 independent films]]\n[[Category:2009 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language Greek films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Donald Petrie]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in Greece]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Ciudad de la Luz]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Greece]]\n[[Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Greek romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Spanish romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Playtone films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Athens]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
