The directorial debut of the [[Brothers Strause]], the film was written by [[Shane Salerno]] and is a direct sequel to ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) as well as the second and latest installment in the [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise]], continuing the crossover between the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' franchises.\n\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the film begins with a Predator ship crashing into a forest outside of [[Gunnison, Colorado]], where an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]]-[[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] known as the [[Predalien]] escapes and makes its way to the nearby small town. A skilled veteran \"[[Crime scene cleanup#In popular culture and the media|cleaner]]\" Predator is dispatched to kill the Predalien, and the townspeople try to escape the ensuing carnage.\n\n''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' premiered on November 4, 2007 in Los Angeles. It was released theatrically on December 25 in the United States. The film was panned by critics for its poor lighting, editing, and lack of originality.<ref name=\"tomatoes\"/> It grossed $130.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million. Plans for another sequel were abandoned, with further independent entries in both franchises released in 2010 and 2012 respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the events of [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|the previous film]], a [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] ship leaves Earth carrying [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] facehuggers. A chestburster with traits of both species quickly matures into an adult [[Predalien]] and starts killing the Predators on board. The hull gets punctured and the ship crashes in a forest outside of [[Gunnison, Colorado]], killing all but one of the Predators. Severely injured, the Predator sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien.\n\nThe Predalien and several facehuggers escape, implanting embryos into several humans. On the Predator homeworld, a skilled veteran Predator, Wolf, receives the signal and decides to kill all the Xenomorphs on Earth. He arrives at the crashed ship, uses an acid-like liquid to dissolve evidence of Aliens' presence, and triggers an implosion to destroy the vessel.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-convict Dallas Howard returns to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He reunites with his younger brother Ricky, who is in love with his classmate Jesse but is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale and his two friends. Kelly O'Brien also returns to Gunnison after serving in the [[US Army]], and reunites with her husband Tim and daughter Molly. Another woman, Darcy Benson, begins searching for her missing husband and son, unaware that they were killed by the Xenomorphs. Meanwhile, local waitress Carrie Adams discovers she is pregnant.\n\nWolf starts killing Xenomorphs in the sewer, but four manage to escape. He pursues some to the power plant, where [[collateral damage]] from the fight causes a citywide [[power outage]]. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out. A Xenomorph then appears and kills Dale's friends. Another Xenomorph invades the O'Brien's home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. Xenomorphs also attack the diner where Carrie works, and she is impregnated by the Predalien. Darcy discovers her body in horror. Sheriff Morales then arrives and brings her with him.\n\nKelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the [[Colorado Army National Guard]] arrive but are quickly slaughtered by Xenomorphs. Wolf captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure Xenomorphs, but Dallas escapes. Several Xenomorphs arrive, but Wolf defeats them. Dale is killed during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma casters is damaged.\n\nAs the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they learn Colonel Stevens is staging an air evacuation at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly, however, are skeptical since going there would cause them to become surrounded by Xenomorphs. They, along with Ricky, Jesse, Molly, and a few others go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town, while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded by Xenomorphs and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Xenomorphs. Wolf arrives at the hospital and dispatches more Xenomorphs. During the battle, he accidentally kills Jesse. Distraught, Ricky rushes Wolf with rifle fire only to be injured by the Predalien. The Predator is attacked by a Xenomorph and both tumble down an elevator shaft. Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster.\n\nDallas, Ricky, Kelly, and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Xenomorphs before escaping in the helicopter. Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien on the roof in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The two mortally wound each other just as an [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]] arrives. Rather than a rescue mission, an F-22 executes a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] strike that levels the entire city to ensure the aliens' deaths, instantly killing Sheriff Morales, Darcy and everyone else gathered at ground zero. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Main|List of Alien vs. Predator (franchise) characters}}\n* [[Steven Pasquale]] as Dallas Howard, a recently released [[convict]], Ricky's brother.\n* [[Reiko Aylesworth]] as Kelly O'Brien, a soldier returning to her family.\n* [[John Ortiz]] as Eddie Morales, the [[sheriff]] of Gunnison.\n* [[Johnny Lewis]] as Ricky Howard, student and younger brother of Dallas.\n* [[Sam Trammell]] as Tim O'Brien, husband to Kelly and father of Molly.\n* [[Ariel Gade]] as Molly O'Brien, daughter of Kelly and Tim O'Brien.\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Colonel Stevens, commander of the military forces.\n* [[Kristen Hager]] as Jesse Salinger, love interest of Ricky, angering her boyfriend, Dale.\n* [[David Paetkau]] as Dale Collins, Jesse's boyfriend who bullies Ricky.\n* Matt Ward as Mark, one of Dale's friends.\n* [[Michal Such\u00e1nek]] as Nick, one of Dale's friends.\n* [[David Hornsby]] as Drew Roberts, a pizza parlor supervisor.\n* [[Gina Holden]] as Carrie Adams, a pregnant waitress; Deputy Ray Adams' wife.\n* [[Chris William Martin]] as Deputy Ray Adams, Carrie's husband.\n* [[Chelah Horsdal]] as Darcy Benson, a mother searching for her son and husband.\n* [[Liam James]] as Sam Benson\n* [[Kurt Max Runte]] as Buddy Benson\n* James Chutter as Deputy Joe\n* Tim Henry as Dr. Lennon\n* [[Tom McBeath]] as Karl\n* [[Ty Olsson]] as Nathan\n* [[Rainbow Sun Francks]] as Earl\n* Juan Riedinger as Scotty\n* Dalias Blake as Lieutenant Peter Wood\n* Curtis Caravaggio as Special Forces Commander\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Yip]] as Ms. Yutani, the CEO of the Yutani Corporation.\n{{div col end}}\n* [[Tom Woodruff Jr.]] as the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] and the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]].

After an unsuccessful attempt to find employment at [[Industrial Light & Magic]], the brothers worked on [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' film]] and founded their own special effects company, [[Hydraulx]]. The company produced special effects for films such as ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'', ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and the brothers began a career directing commercials and music videos.

Colin estimates Hydraulx produced 460 of the 500 visual effects shots including the nuclear explosion which was created using [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] fluids and BA Volume Shader. The interior of the Predator ship was created using CGI, as the brothers felt it would be more cost effective than building a set.<ref name=\"AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2\"/> The visual effects team peaked at 110 people for several months and averaged 70, almost all of the entire Hydraulx staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back Page 3|author=McLean, Thomas|publisher=Vfxworld|date=December 21, 2007|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3501&page=3|access-date=February 21, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306040032/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3501&page=3| archive-date= 6 March 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nUsing their knowledge in visual effects and making use of principal photography, the brothers tried to film as much as they could on camera without resorting to CGI, Colin said \"other than the exterior spaceship shots, there are no pure CG shots.\" CGI was used for the Alien tails and inner jaws, whereas they required puppeteers and wire removal on previous films. The main visual effects of the film included set design, a nuclear explosion, the Predator's ship crashing and the Predator cloak, about which Colin stated: \"We wanted to make sure it didn't look too digital.\"<ref name=\"AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2\"/>\n\nAs a side-note, in the DVD commentary the brothers explained that they wanted actor [[Adam Baldwin]] to reprise his role as Garber in ''[[Predator 2]]'', but were unable to do so, instead using Robert Joy as a new character. Additionally, while the previous installment attracted casual moviegoers as well as fans of the franchises, the film catered exclusively to ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' fans with many references to the previous films appearing in the film.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (soundtrack)}}\nComposer [[Brian Tyler]] was hired to write the score for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=502|title=Brian Tyler to score \"Alien vs. Predator 2\"|last=Carlsson|first=Mikael|date=September 26, 2006|access-date=November 30, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack album was released on December 11, 2007, by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000751482|title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 15, 2018}}</ref> Despite not appearing in the CD soundtrack, the song \"[[Wach auf!]]\" (\"Wake Up\") by German band [[Oomph!]], was released as a promo in January 2008, with the music video using clips from the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na7DsaJSA0Q |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/Na7DsaJSA0Q |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=OOMPH! \u2013 Wach Auf|work=YouTube|access-date=June 19, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The song was appeared on the band's album ''[[Monster (Oomph! album)|Monster]]''.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical===\n''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' had its premiere at the Los Angeles Comic Book and Sci Fi Convention in Los Angeles on November 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/aliens-vs-predator-requiem-makes-its-first-appearance/|title=Aliens Vs.
