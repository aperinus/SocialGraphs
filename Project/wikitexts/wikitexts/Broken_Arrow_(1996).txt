The film was a commercial success despite mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nMajor Vic \"Deak\" Deakins and Captain Riley Hale, pilots in the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), are assigned to a secret exercise flying a stealth bomber with two [[B83 nuclear bomb]]s. After successfully evading Air Force radar, Deakins suddenly attacks Hale and ejects him from the plane. Deakins releases the bombs without activating them, then reports that Hale has gone rogue. He ejects from the plane, leaving it to crash in a Utah state park.\n\nA USAF team led by Lt. Colonel Rhodes is sent to find the missing warheads, declared as a \"[[United States military nuclear incident terminology#Broken Arrow|Broken Arrow]]\" situation. The search team eventually locates the warheads in a canyon, but is ambushed by mercenaries. Rhodes tries to disable the warheads but is killed by the other search team survivor, Master Sergeant Kelly, who is serving as a mole for Deakins. Deakins arrives and plots his next move with Pritchett, the mercenaries' financier. They plan to blackmail the US government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a populated area.\n\nHale, who survived the ejection, is arrested by park ranger Terry Carmichael, who had been investigating the unusual events in the park. He instead convinces her to help him track down Deakins. Deakins' mercenaries commandeer a USAF search and rescue helicopter to kill Hale, but Hale and Terry manage to bring it down. The loss of the helicopter forces Deakins' men to continue in [[Humvee]]s.\n\nHale and Terry carjack the Humvee with the warheads, escaping to a nearby abandoned copper mine, where Hale starts to disable one, only for Deakins to reveal via radio that he has programmed it so that Hale\u2019s attempts to disarm it will cause the bomb to activate. Hale and Terry take the armed warhead down the shaft, where the mine is deep enough to contain the nuclear blast. Before they can bring down the second warhead, Deakins' team arrives and secures it. After a gun battle deep in the mines, Deakins shortens the countdown of the armed warhead while leaving Hale and Terry trapped.\n\nThey escape via an underground river just before the bomb detonates. The bomb's [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]] disables an approaching [[Nuclear Emergency Support Team|NEST]] helicopter, allowing Deakins to escape. Deakins then kills Pritchett, having grown tired of his complaints and for straying from the mission plan. Terry and Hale track the mercenaries to a motorboat used for transporting the warhead down the river. While trying to steal the boat, Terry is forced to hide onboard, while military forces rescue Hale.\n\nHale deduces that Deakins intends to use a train to transport the warhead. Colonel Max Wilkins decides to disobey orders to help Hale. Stowing on the train, Terry tries to sabotage the warhead but is caught by Deakins, who arms the bomb. Catching up on a USAF helicopter, Hale saves Terry before Deakins can throw her off the train. A gunfight ensues, killing Wilkins and causing the helicopter to crash, and most of the mercenaries die in the aftermath.\n\nDeakins has prepared a remote control that can either disarm or detonate the warhead and gets ready to depart the train on his own getaway helicopter. Hale's sabotage of the helicopter's fuel pump causes it to explode, leaving Deakins and Kelly stranded with the ticking bomb. With his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to shorten the countdown timer out of spite. Not wanting to die, Kelly holds Deakins at gunpoint and orders him to disarm the weapon. Hale sneaks up on them during their bickering and kicks Kelly out of the boxcar to his death, then engages in a gun battle with Deakins.\n\nTerry detaches the section of the train containing the bomb but gets into a shootout with the engineer. The latter is shot and falls on the train brakes, allowing the detached boxcars to catch up, at increasingly higher speed. Deakins still has the remote detonator, so he forces Hale to drop his gun and challenges him to a fight. Hale eventually overpowers Deakins, acquires the remote detonator, disarms the warhead and leaps out of the train. As the detached boxcars slam into the halted front half, the warhead flies through Deakins, while the entire train derails and explodes.\n\nHale finds Terry and the dormant warhead. The two formally introduce themselves amidst the wreckage.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[John Travolta]] as [[United States Air Force]] Major Vic \"Deak\" Deakins\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[United States Air Force]] Captain Riley Hale\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as [[United States Park Service]] Park Ranger Terry Carmichael\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as [[United States Air Force]] Colonel Max Wilkins\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Giles Prentice\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Mr. Pritchett\n* [[Howie Long]] as [[United States Air Force]] Pararescueman Master Sergeant Kelly\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Baird\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[United States Air Force]] Pararescueman Lieutenant Colonel Sam Rhodes\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as [[United States Air Force]] General Creely\n* Jeffrey Stephan as Shepherd\n\n==Music==\nThe original music score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]]. An expanded double-disc limited set of the music score was released by La-La Land Records in February 2011. Also credited for additional music are Zimmer-regulars [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] and [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]].\n\nThe score is considered to be one of Zimmer's best action scores by fans and film critics. The opening track \"Rope-A-Dope\", also known as \"Deakin's Theme\" has been widely used in other films and media, including ''[[Scream 2]]'' and ''[[Speed 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hans Zimmer tracks |url=http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=605 |publisher=Han Zimmer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Review of Soundtrack for ''Broken Arrow'' | publisher=Filmtracks.com | url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/broken_arrow.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Why Get a New Score If a Used One Will Do? | first=Jon | last=Burlingame | date=December 27, 1997 | work=Los Angeles Times | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-dec-27-ca-2475-story.html}}</ref> The famous riff from \"Rope-A-Dope\" was played by legendary guitarist [[Duane Eddy]], who Zimmer brought in for the entire ''Broken Arrow'' scoring session.<ref>{{cite web |title=Broken Arrow score notes |url=https://fromthebalcony.com/movie-music/broken-arrow-1996-hans-zimmer/ |publisher=From The Balcony}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography began on April 26, 1995. Some filming took place in and around the mountain areas of [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] in [[Kane County, Utah]]. The lake scene with Hale and Carmichael was filmed at [[Lake Powell]]. The desert sequences were shot in the [[Mojave Desert]] near [[Barstow, California]], and in [[Coconino County]] near [[Page, Arizona]]. The final climax scenes with Deakins and his men on the train, including the action sequence with Deakins and Hale fighting in the train car, were filmed on the privately owned Central Montana Rail, Inc. (CM) in [[Fergus County]] between [[Lewistown, Montana]], and [[Denton, Montana]].\n\nIn July 1995, a number of elaborate train cars were sent to the location in Lewistown, including several custom-built cars. Six weeks of filming on the forty mile track were required to capture all the stunts, helicopter action, gun battles, high falls and special effects sequences. Production photography was completed on August 28, 1995.\n\n[[John Travolta]] was originally the choice to portray Riley Hale (finally played by [[Christian Slater]]), but was chosen instead to portray Major Vic Deakins.\n\n==Release==\n''Broken Arrow'' was No. 1 at the North American box office on its opening weekend grossing $15.6 million.<ref>{{cite news|title= Arrow' Flies High as Oscar Nods Boost 'Babe,' 'Sense'; Box office: The action adventure is No. 1, with 'Muppet Treasure Island,' 'Happy Gilmore' dueling for second.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 19, 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-19/entertainment/ca-37593_1_broken-arrow|access-date=2010-12-26|first=Judy|last=Brennan}}</ref> It stayed on top for a second week and ultimately had a domestic gross of $70,770,147 and an international gross of $79,500,000, for a total worldwide gross of $150,270,147.<ref>{{cite web |title = Broken Arrow (1996) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brokenarrow.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date = January 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nBased on 35 reviews collected by the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 54% of critics gave ''Broken Arrow'' a positive review (19 \"Fresh\"; 16 \"Rotten\"), with an [[weighted mean|average]] rating of 5.7 out of 10.

Instead, he talks, and talks, until his target escapes from his predicament.\" Ebert queried the \"purpose of a digital readout on a bomb.
