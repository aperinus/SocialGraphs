Directed by [[Harold Becker]], the movie is based on [[Ryne Douglas Pearson]]'s 1996 novel originally published as [[Simple Simon (novel)|''Simple Simon'']], which was the [[working title]] of the film. Willis plays Art Jeffries, an [[undercover]] [[FBI]] agent who protects a nine-year-old [[autism|autistic]] boy, Simon Lynch (played by [[Miko Hughes]]), who is targeted by government [[Assassination|assassins]] after he cracks a [[top secret]] government [[code]].\n\nThe film was released on April 3, 1998. It received mostly negative reviews and grossed $93 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2017}} \n\nA nine-year-old autistic boy, Simon Lynch, is given a sophisticated puzzle book by his teacher. Simon quickly solves a particular puzzle and phones a number encoded in the solution. This call reaches two National Security Agency cryptographers, Dean Crandell and Leo Pedranski, who created the new cypher Simon has cracked. Pedranski and Crandell report the situation to their boss, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Kudrow, who severely rebukes the pair for their unauthorized actions, describing Simon and his abilities as a national security threat. Two assassins, Peter Burrell and Shayes, are sent by Kudrow to terminate the boy and his parents, Martin and Jenny. Posing as a police detective, Burrell murders both Simon's mother and father, but is unable to find Simon.\n\nFBI agent Art Jeffries, who was recently demoted to a desk job after an unsuccessful negotiation during a bank robbery hostage situation, is sent to investigate and finds Simon in a hidden crawl space in his bedroom closet. Simon is taken to a protection ward at the hospital, where a nurse explains to Art about Simon's autism, and probably can't be questioned. Burrell impersonates a doctor and makes another attempt on Simon's life. Art saves Simon and flees the premises, and tries unsuccessfully to convince Simon that he is a friend instead of a stranger. Later, while on a train, Burrell\u2019s partner, Shayes, tries to kill Simon, but Art intervenes, eventually managing to knock him off the train and onto the tracks just before another locomotive passes, running Shayes over and instantly killing him.\n\nThe NSA, under Kudrow's direction, frames Art as the kidnapper of Simon. However, fellow agent and friend Tommy Jordan doesn't believe the story and assists Art, who borrows Jordan's car and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written into the code and Art is able to talk to Crandell and Pedranski. As Crandell arranges a meeting at the Wrigley Building by the next morning, Art goes to the meeting, leaving Simon under the care of a woman in a coffee shop, Stacey Siebring, who later reluctantly agrees to help Art take care of Simon. Art and Dean meet and Crandell tells Jeffries about Mercury and Kudrow, but is shot dead by Burrell before he can reveal everything.\n\nMeanwhile, Pedranski, having learned Crandell's fate, tries to reveal Kudrow's unlawful actions by writing letters on a typewriter: one to Art and a carbon copy for the Senate Oversight Committee, but Burrell tracks Pedranski down and kills him as well, confiscating the letters. However, the assassin overlooks Pedranski's carbon copies, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang, takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Art to show them the carbon copies; covered in Pedranski\u2019s fingerprints, they become crucial evidence. Art then goes to Kudrow\u2019s home during his birthday party, and demands that Kudrow announce on national TV that the Mercury Encryption Project is a failure.\n\nUnder Art's suggestion, Jordan arranges for Simon to go into the Witness Protection Program, but Kudrow, unwilling to reveal his failure and determined to kill Simon, forcibly takes charge of the Witness Protection while revealing to Lomax, the FBI Special Agent in charge, that Jordan forged the witness protection documents. However, unknown to Kudrow, Tommy shows the carbon paper evidence to Lomax and confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski's, now fully validating the evidence against Kudrow. Stacey and Simon leave for the pick-up point, at the top of a skyscraper, where Kudrow and Burrell prepare to take Simon away on a helicopter, but Jeffries, with Jordan and an FBI task force's help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. A gunfight ensues between Burrell and the FBI, ending with Burrell being slashed to death by glass shards, while Art fights Kudrow one-on-one, and Simon assists him by retrieving his gun. In a last-ditch effort, Kudrow attempts to throw Simon off the roof, but Jeffries shoots him multiple times, and the corrupt NSA chief falls to his death.\n\nArt and Siebring later visit Simon (now living with foster parents) at his school. Simon embraces the FBI agent as a welcome friend, having finally accepted him as a person he trusts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as FBI Special Agent Arthur \"Art\" Jeffries\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas \"Nick\" Kudrow\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Simon Lynch\n* [[Chi McBride]] as FBI Special Agent Thomas \"Tommy\" Jordan\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Stacey Siebring\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Dean Crandell\n* [[Bodhi Elfman|Bodhi Pine Elfman]] as Leo Pedranski\n* [[Carrie Preston]] as Emily Lang\n* [[Lindsey Ginter|L.

Once again, certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled, and not to good effect.
