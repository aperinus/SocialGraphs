The film was co-written, directed, and produced by [[Charles Shyer]].\n\n==Plot==\nAlfie Elkins is a [[Cockney]] limo driver in [[Manhattan]]. A [[sex addict]], he regularly beds women on [[one-night stands]]. In addition, he maintains a casual relationship with single mother Julie, his \"semi-regular-quasi-sort-of-girlfriend thing\", and unhappily married Dorie. Once Dorie wants more than casual sex, he stops calling.\n\nAlfie and his coworker and best friend Marlon want to open a company together, but Marlon needs to get back with his ex, Lonette. When Alfie goes to put in a good word for him, he finds her at her bar. But after getting drunk, they have sex. Alfie meets Marlon the next day, terrified he knows about it, but is relieved when Marlon says he and Lonette got back together and are getting married.\n\nWhen Alfie goes to Julie's for a [[booty call]], she throws him out, confronting him as she had discovered Dorie's panties in her rubbish bin\u2014he had discarded them after finding them in his pocket. Intending to reconcile with her at her son's birthday, Alfie sees Julie has returned to her estranged husband. He later discovers Lonette is pregnant with his child, and (without telling Marlon) they go to a clinic for an [[abortion]]. Soon afterward, Marlon and Lonette unexpectedly move [[Upstate New York|upstate]], without saying goodbye.\n\nFollowing repeated failures to achieve an [[erection]], Alfie sees a doctor, who tells him he is perfectly healthy, and his impotence is due to stress. However, he finds a lump on Alfie's [[penis]]. They immediately run a test at the clinic and he spends a few anxious days awaiting the results. On a trip to the hospital, Alfie meets Joe, a widower, in the bathroom. Joe gives life advice to the [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] Alfie: \"Find somebody to love, and live every day like it's your last\". Soon afterward, Alfie finds out he's cancer-free.\n\nBelieving he's been given a second chance, Alfie decides to \"aim higher\" in his love life. He meets Nikki, a beautiful but unstable woman, and they quickly embark on a passionate, turbulent relationship. Moving in together, Alfie finds it hard to put up with her mood swings, especially after she goes off her medication. Distancing himself, he focuses on an older woman, Liz. A sultry cosmetics mogul, she inspires him to \"aim higher\". He becomes infatuated, but she wants to keep it strictly sexual. Alfie then ends it with Nikki.\n\nRunning into Julie in a coffee shop, Alfie realizes he has feelings for her; however, she's now with someone else. On a trip upstate to visit Marlon and his now-wife, Lonette, she reveals she never had the abortion, and, Marlon knows Alfie is the father, but nonetheless decided to stay. Upon seeing Marlon with hurt in his eyes, Alfie visits Joe, who tells him to get his life together. Alfie turns to Liz for comfort but is crushed that she has an even younger man in her life.\n\nAlfie has a chance meeting with Dorie late one night. As he tries to get back into her life, she wants no part of him. Apologizing for not calling, he admits he has trouble expressing himself, running from relationships when they become too serious. She wishes him luck. The film ends with Alfie talking about genuinely changing his ways.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing| \n* [[Jude Law]] as Alfie Elkins Jr.\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Julie\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Liz\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] as Lu Schnitman\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Dorie\n* [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Phil\n* [[Kevin Rahm]] as Terry\n* [[Omar Epps]] as Marlon\n* [[Nia Long]] as Lonette\n* Max Morris as Max\n* [[Tara Summers]] as Carol\n* [[Jefferson Mays]] as Dr. Miranda Kulp\n* [[Dick Latessa]] as Joe\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Nikki\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Wing\n* [[Sondra James]] as Mrs. Liberman\n* [[Stephen Gaghan]] as Adam\n}}\n\nA black and white photograph of [[Michael Caine]] representing Alfie Elkins Sr. appears during the film's credits.\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nThe film was shot throughout England, mostly locations doubling for [[New York City]], along with on-set shooting in [[Manhattan]].\n* [[Liverpool]], England\n* [[Manchester]], England\n* [[Port of Tilbury]], England (some dock scenes)\n* [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]], Manhattan, New York City, US\n* [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], Manhattan, New York City, US\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Alfie (2004 film soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Film score|music score]] was composed by [[Mick Jagger]], [[David A.

The story's observations about male behavior aren't earth shattering...but what gives it its kick is how Alfie takes the film audience into his confidence. In both films, the character talks directly into the camera, a disarming strategy that brings us closer to this serial seducer than we might want. Playing narrator turns Alfie into a tour guide and something of his own defense attorney; it also means he has to enrapture the audience along with his conquests.<ref>{{cite news |title = Film Review; A Modern-Day Charmer Who Lives for the Chase |first = Manohla |last = Dargis |author-link= Manohla Dargis |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/movies/a-modernday-charmer-who-lives-for-the-chase.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = November 5, 2004 |access-date = July 11, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Original Literary Source: [[Bill Naughton]], Alfie, (London, UK), {{ISBN|0-7490-8387-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7490-8387-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n\n{{Alfie}}\n{{Charles Shyer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American remakes of British films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Casual sex in films]]\n[[Category:Films about abortion]]\n[[Category:Films about adultery in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about narcissism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Charles Shyer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Powell]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Essex]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Merseyside]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Shyer]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
