A standalone film and the seventh installment in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], it is not part of the same continuity as previous films, instead portraying [[Freddy Krueger]] as a fictional movie villain who invades the real world and haunts the cast and crew involved in the making of the films about him. In the film, Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended, being much more menacing and less comical, with an updated attire and appearance.\n\nThe film features various people involved in the [[Film industry|motion picture industry]] portraying themselves, including [[Heather Langenkamp]], who is compelled by events in the narrative to reprise her role as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]. ''New Nightmare'' features several [[Homage (arts)|homage]]s to the original film such as quotes and recreations of the most famous scenes. The film won an International Fantasy Film Award from [[Fantasporto]] for Best Screenplay by Craven.\n\n''New Nightmare'' was released on October 14, 1994, grossing $19.8 million at the box office on a budget of $8 million, making it the poorest-performing film in the ''Nightmare'' series. However, it received positive reviews from critics, and is considered by many as one of the best ''Nightmare'' movies and one of Wes Craven's most enduring films.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/every-wes-craven-movie-ranked-best-worst/ | title=Every Wes Craven Movie Ranked, Worst to Best | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=August 7, 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://movieweb.com/best-wes-craven-movies/ | title=These Are the Best Wes Craven Films, Ranked | date=February 2, 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://creepycatalog.com/wes-craven-movies/ | title=Every Wes Craven Movie, Ranked | date=September 28, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/wes-craven-movies-ranked-scream | title=Every Wes Craven movie, ranked from Freddy to Ghostface | date=April 5, 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.slashfilm.com/658607/every-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-movie-ranked-worst-to-best/ | title=Every a Nightmare on Elm Street Movie Ranked Worst to Best - /Film | date=November 11, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://collider.com/nightmare-on-elm-street-movies-ranked-worst-to-best/ | title='Nightmare on Elm Street' Movies Ranked from Worst to Best | website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] | date=October 8, 2019 }}</ref> It was followed by 2003's ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', a crossover with the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]] set in the same continuity as the other ''Nightmare'' films.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Heather Langenkamp]] lives in [[Los Angeles]], California, with her husband Chase and their young son Dylan. She is recognized for her role as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] from the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series]] before focusing her career on television. One night, she has a nightmare that her family is attacked by a set of animated [[Freddy Krueger]] claws from an upcoming ''Nightmare'' film, where two workers are brutally killed on set. Waking up to an earthquake, she spies a cut on Chase's finger exactly like the one he had received in her dream, but she quickly dismisses the notion that it was caused by the claws.\n\nHeather receives a call from an obsessed fan who quotes Freddy Krueger's nursery rhyme in an eerie, Freddy-like voice. This coincides with a meeting she has with [[New Line Cinema]] where she is pitched the idea to reprise her role as Nancy in a new ''Nightmare'' film, which, unbeknownst to her, Chase has been working on. She returns home, and sees Dylan watching her original film, and Dylan has a severely traumatizing episode where he screams at her. The frequent calls and Dylan's strange behavior cause her to call Chase, and he agrees to rush home from his workplace at [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] as the two men from the opening dream did not report in for work. Chase falls asleep while driving and is slashed by Freddy's claw and dies. His death seems to affect Dylan even further, which concerns Heather's long-time friend and former co-star [[John Saxon]]. He suggests she seek medical attention for Dylan and herself after she has a nightmare at Chase's funeral in which Freddy tries to take Dylan away.\n\nDylan's health continues to deteriorate, becoming increasingly paranoid about going to sleep, and fearing Freddy Krueger, even though Heather has never shown Dylan her films. She visits ''Nightmare'' creator [[Wes Craven]], who admits to having [[precognition|precognitive]] nightmares that the films captured an ancient supernatural entity, which has now been freed after the film series ended with the release of ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''. In the guise of Freddy, the entity now focuses its primary foe on Heather, as killing her will allow it into the real world. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the films, also has a strange knowledge of it, describing the new Freddy to Heather, then disappearing from all contact shortly thereafter.\n\nFollowing another earthquake, Heather takes a traumatized Dylan to the hospital, where Dr. Heffner, suspecting abuse, suggests he remain under observation. Heather returns home for Dylan's stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter Julie tries unsuccessfully to keep the nurses from sedating the sleep-deprived boy. After Dylan falls asleep from the sedative, Freddy brutally kills Julie in Dylan's dream. Capable of [[sleepwalking]], Dylan leaves the hospital of his own accord while Heather chases him home across the interstate as Freddy taunts and dangles him before traffic. Upon returning home, Heather realizes that reality is starting to overlap with Freddy's make-believe realm, with Saxon as Nancy's father [[Donald Thompson (film character)|Don Thompson]], and her street, the exterior of her house, and her clothes have all transformed into Nancy's. When Heather embraces Nancy's role, Freddy emerges completely into reality and abducts Dylan to his world. Heather finds a [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|trail]] of Dylan's sleeping pills and follows him to a hellish construct of Freddy's boiler room. Freddy fights off Heather and chases Dylan into a furnace. Dylan escapes the furnace, doubles back to Heather, and together they push Freddy into the furnace and light it, destroying both the monster and its reality.\n\nDylan and Heather emerge from under his blankets, and Heather finds a copy of the recent events in a [[screenplay]] at the foot of the bed. Inside is written thanks from Wes for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Her victory helps imprison the entity of the film franchise's fictitious world once more. Dylan asks if it is a story, and Heather agrees before opening the script and reading from its pages.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n* [[Heather Langenkamp]] as herself and [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]. Following her initial success in both the original ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''The Dream Warriors'', Langenkamp took on the role of Marie Lubbock in the ABC sitcom ''[[Just the Ten of Us]]'', however she was later stalked by an obsessed fan who was unhappy the series was cancelled, leading to her temporarily moving to England. In the film, Langenkamp's character is also stalked through harassing phone calls.\n* [[Robert Englund]] as himself and [[Freddy Krueger|The Entity / \"Freddy Krueger\"]]. Englund's performance as Freddy is notably toned down in this film compared to its predecessors, with less focus on comedic quips and more on the sinister aspect of his character. The Krueger costume was also altered to become darker with more \"organic\" makeup and a revised glove. In the film, Englund also plays himself as both an actor and painter. According to the 2010 documentary ''[[Never Sleep Again]]'', a scripted but ultimately unfilmed sequence would have seen Englund transformed into a fly and trapped in the web of a giant \"Freddy-spider\" in an homage to the 1958 film The Fly. The sequence was not shot due to time and budgetary constraints.\n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Dylan Porter. Hughes plays the son of Heather Langenkamp and Chase Porter whose mental health begins to deteriorate after his encounters with Freddy. Hughes was no stranger to horror films, having previously acted in the role of Gage Creed in the 1989 film ''[[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|Pet Sematary]]''. \n* [[John Saxon]] as himself and [[Donald Thompson (film character)|Donald Thompson]]. Since his previous appearances in the ''Elm Street'' films, Saxon had kept himself busy primarily with lower budget movies and TV work; he was keen to appear in ''New Nightmare'' as he thought it likely to be the last film in the ''Elm Street'' saga. In the film, Saxon plays himself and gives onscreen daughter Langenkamp some advice about how to best treat her son Dylan. \n* [[Tracy Middendorf]] as Julie. Middendorf plays Julie, Dylan's babysitter and Heather's best friend. According to Middendorf in the ''Never Sleep Again'' documentary, she was created in part to act as a red herring regarding Heather's stalker; film editor Patrick Lussier revealed in the same documentary that Julie was originally scripted to be working as an avatar for Freddy but this was ultimately changed to her being killed by him. Julie's death mimics that of Tina Grey from the original film, with a rotating room again being used to simulate Freddy dragging her across the ceiling. \n* [[David Newsom]] as Chase Porter. In the film, Newsom plays Chase Porter, Heather's husband and a special effects artist working for New Line Cinema. The role of Chase was originally offered to Heather Langenkamp's real life husband [[David LeRoy Anderson]] but he declined as it would be \"too close to the bone\". Newsom recalled in 2010 how he looked nothing like a typical special effects artists who tended to be bigger than him with longer hair.\n* [[Fran Bennett]] as Dr. Christine Heffner. Bennett, an accomplished film and theatre actress, plays Dr. Heffner who initially suspects that Heather may be inadvertently harming her child herself. Wes Craven named Bennett's character after former MPAA ratings chief [[Richard Heffner]], with whom he had clashed many times over the censorship of his films. \n* [[Wes Craven]] as himself. Director Craven initially scripted himself as a man driven insane by nightmares, who had cut off his own eyelids to stay awake and was being driven by Michael Berryman's character from ''[[The Hills Have Eyes]]''. Craven decided to opt for a more comforting setting of being in an opulent house in the Hollywood Hills. \n* [[Robert Shaye]] as himself. Shaye appears as himself in order to convince Heather Langenkamp to take part in the new ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film. Shaye would later remark in the ''Never Sleep Again'' documentary, \"I don't think I did a particularly good job, but I was okay\". Shaye had previously appeared as a bartender at an S&M themed bar in ''Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge'', as a ticket seller in ''Freddy's Dead'' and a funeral minister in the ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]'' episode \"Killer Instinct\" (credited as L.E Moko). \n* [[Marianne Maddalena]] as herself\n* [[Sam Rubin]] as himself\n* Sara Risher as herself\n* Claudia Haro as a [[New Line Cinema]] receptionist\n* [[Matt Winston]] and Rob LaBelle as Charles \"Chuck\" Wilson and Terrance \"Terry\" Feinstein, two special effects workers\n* [[W. Earl Brown]] as Morgue attendant\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Nurse with pill; Shaye played the teacher in [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original film]] and, according to ''Never Sleep Again'', was pleased to return as another \"generic public servant\". \n* [[Jsu Garcia|Nick Corri]] as himself; Corri played Rod in the original film and is silently present during the funeral scene.\n* [[Tuesday Knight]] as herself; Knight played [[Kristen Parker]] in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master|fourth film]] and is silently present during the funeral scene.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:New nightmare freddy krueger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Freddy Krueger]]'s appearance in ''New Nightmare'' was the original concept Wes Craven had for the character in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984).]]\nWritten under the working title ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension'', Wes Craven set out to make a deliberately more cerebral film than recent entries to the franchise\u2014which he regarded as being cartoonish, and not faithful to his original themes. The basic premise originated when Craven first signed on to co-write ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors|Dream Warriors]]'', but [[New Line Cinema]] rejected it then.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''New Nightmare'' DVD commentary with Wes Craven</ref>\n\nIn ''New Nightmare'', Krueger was portrayed closer to what Craven had imagined: darker and less [[Comedy|comical]].<ref>Robb, Brian J.

Reflecting on the filming in [[Never Sleep Again]] some sixteen years after the movie was released, Risher commented \"all of the other directors had to be guided through but Wes by then was the master\". The film's self-referential style would be explored further in the following year's ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', also directed by Craven.\n\nThe film was made for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the original film's release. Both ''New Nightmare'' and the 1995 comedy film ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' were dedicated to the production designer of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', Gregg Fonseca (1952 - 1994), who died shortly before the release of ''New Nightmare''.\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nThis film was released on January 27, 1995,[[VHS]] by [[New Line Home Video]], was released on August 22, 2000, [[DVD]], by [[New Line Home Entertainment]].\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\nOn the film's opening weekend it made $6.6 million, ranking third at the box office.

It was interesting because all my scenes are kind of alone, and I was acting against this tension and this idea of Freddy that we all had at that time. We all knew what I was afraid of and that Freddy might be back, but you never really saw Freddy that much, and I was really amazed that the movie was about Wes [Craven] creating this relationship with that idea that Freddy is here, and the audience has it too.
