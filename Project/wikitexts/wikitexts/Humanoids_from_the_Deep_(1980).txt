The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun, but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach.\n\nThe following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson ([[Lynn Schiller]]) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach, but a monstrous figure drags her across the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her bikini and rapes her.\n\nThat night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy ([[David Strassman]]) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him, and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant, but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter.\n\nA company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon. The salmon escaped from Canco's laboratory into the ocean during a storm and were eaten by large fish that then mutated into the brutal, depraved humanoids that have begun to terrorize the village.\n\nBy the time Jim and Canco scientist Dr. Susan Drake (Turkel) have deduced what is occurring, the village's annual festival has begun. At the festival, many humanoids appear, murdering the men and raping every woman they can grab. Jim devises a plan to stop the humanoids by pumping gasoline into the bay and setting it on fire, cutting off the humanoids' way of retreat. Meanwhile, Carol is attacked at home by two of the creatures, but manages to kill them before Jim arrives.\n\nThe morning after the festival, normality seems to have returned to the village. Jim asks the sheriff about Dr. Drake. The sheriff mumbles that she went back to the lab, where she is coaching a pregnant Peggy, who has survived her sexual assault. Peggy is about to give birth when her monstrous offspring bursts from her womb, with Peggy screaming at the screeching baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Doug McClure]] as Jim Hill\n* [[Ann Turkel]] as Dr. Susan Drake\n* [[Vic Morrow]] as Hank Slattery\n* Cindy Weintraub as Carol Hill\n* [[Anthony Pena]] as Johnny Eagle\n* [[Denise Galik]] as Linda Beale\n* [[Lynn Schiller]] as Peggy Larson\n* Meegan King as Jerry Potter\n* Breck Costin as Tommy Hill\n* Hoke Howell as Deke Jensen\n* Don Maxwell as Dickie Moore\n* [[David Strassman]] as Billy\n* Lisa Glaser as Becky\n* Julie Kestel as Seaweed Hag\n* [[Greg Travis]] as Mike Michaels, Radio Announcer\n* [[Linda Shayne]] as Sally, Miss Salmon\n* Bruce Monette as Jake Potter\n* Shawn Erler as Shawn Hill\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Humanoids from the Deep'' was originally offered to [[Joe Dante]], who turned it down. Peeters accepted the film, and shooting commenced in October 1979.<ref name=\"New World\"/> Executive producer Corman said Peeters' version of the film lacked the required exploitative elements needed to satisfy its intended audience. In an interview included on the 2010 [[Blu-ray]] release by Shout! Factory, Corman stated Peeters and he had discussed his expectations of the film regarding B-movie exploitation \u2013 this being to fulfill Corman's maxim that monsters \"kill all the men and rape all the women\". In postproduction, Corman said Peeters had done an outstanding job in filming the death scenes involving male characters, but all of the rape scenes had been left \"shadowy\" or used cutaways before the attacks occurred.<ref name=\"Hardy\"/> Portions of the film were directed by an uncredited Murakami, who directed the Corman-produced sci-fi cult classic ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' the same year.\n\nThe film's budget was $2.5 million.<ref name=\"New World\"/> The monster costumes were designed and created by [[Rob Bottin]].<ref>Stephen Jones. ''The Essential Monster Movie Guide''. Billboard Books. 2000. Pg. 190</ref>\n\n[[Second unit director]] James Sbardellati, who later directed ''[[Deathstalker (film)|Deathstalker]]'', was hired to enliven the film; he filmed explicit scenes in which the humanoids rape women. These changes were not communicated to most of the people who had made the film with the working title ''Beneath the Darkness''; several of them expressed shock and anger at the released film, its changed title, and the nudity and sexual exploitation. After Peeters and Turkel saw the additional sequences, they asked for their names to be removed from the film, but were refused. Turkel appeared on television talk shows and castigated Corman for his actions.<ref name=\"New World\">Koetting, Christopher T (2009).
