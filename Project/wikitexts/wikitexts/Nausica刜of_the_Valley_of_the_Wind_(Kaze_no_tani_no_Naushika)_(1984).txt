It was animated by [[Topcraft]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]] and [[Hakuhodo]], and distributed by the [[Toei Company]]. [[Joe Hisaishi]], in his first collaboration with Miyazaki, composed the score. The film stars the voices of [[Sumi Shimamoto]], [[Goro Naya]], [[Yoji Matsuda]], [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] and [[Iemasa Kayumi]].<ref name=\"bcdb\">\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/20626-Kaze_No_Tani_No_Naushika.html Kaze No Tani No Naushika]\". ''bcdb.com'', 13 May 2012</ref> Taking place in a post-nuclear futuristic world, the film tells the story of [[Nausica\u00e4 (Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind)|Nausica\u00e4]] (Shimamoto), the young teenage princess of the Valley of the Wind. She becomes embroiled in a struggle with Tolmekia, a kingdom that tries to use an ancient weapon to eradicate a jungle full of giant mutant insects.\n\n''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'' was released in Japan on 11 March 1984. A [[Editing of anime in distribution|heavily edited]] adaptation of the film created by [[Manson International]], ''Warriors of the Wind'', was released in the United States and other markets throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. The Manson cut was derided by Miyazaki and eventually replaced in circulation by an uncut, redubbed version produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 2005. Though it was made before [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded, it is often considered a Ghibli work, and was released as part of the ''Studio Ghibli Collection'' DVD and Blu-ray range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/ghibli/ghibli101.html#what |title=Ghibli 101 FAQ // Studio Ghibli // |publisher=Nausicaa.net |access-date=28 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604174519/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/ghibli/ghibli101.html#what |archive-date=4 June 2011 }}</ref> The film received critical acclaim, with praise being directed at the story, themes, characters and animation.

The Japanese name, {{Nihongo|\u014c mu(shi)|\u738b\u87f2}}, consists of the [[kanji]] for king and insect or bug. Transliterated as ''Ohmu'' in manga translations and as ''Ohm'' in the film's subtitles.}} She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co-exist.\n\nOne day at dawn, a massive cargo aircraft from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley despite Nausica\u00e4's attempt to save it. Its sole survivor, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausica\u00e4 to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal, gargantuan humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and poises to attack, but Nausica\u00e4 uses a [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]] to calm it and guides it away from the village.\n\nSoon after, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana, invade the Valley, execute Nausica\u00e4's father and capture the embryo. Enraged, Nausica\u00e4 assaults and kills several Tolmekian soldiers and is about to be overwhelmed when the Valley's swordsmaster, Lord Yupa, soothes the belligerents. Kushana plans to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants reared by Nausica\u00e4; according to her findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by pollution.\n\nKushana leaves for the Tolmekian capital with Nausica\u00e4 and five hostages from the Valley, but a Pejite interceptor shoots down the Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausica\u00e4, Kushana and the hostages crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohms, which Nausica\u00e4 soothes. She leaves to rescue the Pejite pilot Asbel, twin brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausica\u00e4 realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.\n\nNausica\u00e4 and Asbel return to Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. A band of survivors explains that they lured the insects to eradicate the Tolmekians, and are doing the same to the Valley. They capture Nausica\u00e4 to prevent her from warning the Valley, but with the help of Asbel, his mother, and a number of sympathizers, Nausica\u00e4 escapes on her glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohms into the Valley using a wounded baby Ohm. The people of the Valley take shelter while the Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior, but tank-fire does not deter the Ohms, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.\n\nNausica\u00e4 liberates the baby Ohm and gains its trust. She and the Ohm stand before the herd but are run over. The Ohms calm down and use their golden tentacles to resuscitate her. Nausica\u00e4, her dress drenched blue with Ohm blood, walks atop golden Ohm tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the savior prophecy. The Ohms and Tolmekians leave the Valley, and the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{see also|List of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind characters}}\n{{Multiple image|align=right | total_width =
