They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing after a lost kite. The children ask their father to help them build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new [[nanny]], Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. In contrast, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. (\"Perfect Nanny\") Winifred tries to keep the peace.  Mr. Banks rips up the letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but a strong wind draws the fragments up through the chimney and into the air.\n\nThe next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home for Ellen to show them all in, but a strong gust of wind blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young magical nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks, [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] calmly produces the children's restored advertisement and agrees with its requests but promises the astonished banker she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and she convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children and helps them magically tidy their nursery by snapping her fingers, before heading out for a walk in the park (\"[[A Spoonful of Sugar|Spoonful of Sugar]]\").\n\nOutside, they meet Mary's old friend, Bert, working as a [[street painting|street painter]]; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings. While the children ride on a [[carousel]], Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll. Together, they sing (\"Jolly Holiday\"), and Bert flirts with Mary Poppins. After the duo meets up with the children, Mary Poppins enchants the carousel horses; Bert rescues a fox from a fox hunt; they take part in a horse race which Mary wins. Describing her victory, Mary Poppins uses a [[nonsense word]] (\"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]\"). The outing is ended when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London.\n\nThe next day, the three meet Bert's odd Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air because of his uncontrollable laughter and they join him for a tea party on the ceiling with lots of jokes (\"I Love to Laugh\"). Afterward, Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary Poppins, but she persuades him to take the children to his workplace the next day. That evening, Mary sings to the children a [[hymn]]-like [[lullaby]]<ref name=hymn>{{cite web |url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/julie-andrews/feed-the-birds |title=Feed The Birds by Julie Andrews |publisher=SongFacts  |access-date=January 29, 2022}}</ref> about the woman who sits on the steps of the [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] selling [[bird food]] (\"[[Feed The Birds]]\"). The next day at the bank, the children meet Mr. Dawes. Mr. Dawes aggressively urges Michael to invest his [[twopence (British pre-decimal coin)|tuppence]] in the bank, ultimately snatching the coins from Michael (\"[[Fidelity Fiduciary Bank]]\").  Michael demands them back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a [[bank run]].\n\nJane and Michael flee the bank, getting lost in the [[East End of London]] until they again meet up with Bert, now working as a [[chimney sweep]], who escorts them home (\"Chim Chim Cheree\"). The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home (\"Step in Time\") after their neighbor Admiral Boom shoots fireworks at them, mistaking them for robbers. Mr. and Mrs. Banks return to home to find Bert's friends dancing in their home and sends them away. Mr. Banks then gets a phone call from the bank requesting a meeting with him about what the children did. The children overhear the phone call and realize that their father is in trouble. Bert tells Mr. Banks that he needs to spend more time with his children before they grow up (\"A Man Has Dreams\"). Michael gives his father the tuppence in the hope to make amends.\n\nMr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating [[cashiering]] and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", tells Uncle Albert's \"Wooden leg named Smith\" joke the children told, and happily heads home. Mr. Dawes mulls over the joke and, finally understanding it, floats up into the air, laughing.\n\nThe next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Banks family meets Mr. Dawes' son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals his father died laughing from the joke (\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\"). Mr. Dawes Jr. says he had never seen his father happier in his life and re-employs Mr. Banks as a [[Partner (business rank)|junior partner]]. With her work done, Mary Poppins ends the movie by flying away, with Bert telling her from afar not to stay away too long.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Mary Poppins5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julie Andrews]] as Mary Poppins]]\n[[File:Mary Poppins3.jpg|thumb|[[Dick Van Dyke]] as Bert]]\n[[File:Mary Poppins11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karen Dotrice]] and [[Matthew Garber]] as Jane and Michael Banks]]\n[[File:Mary Poppins4.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Tomlinson]] as Mr. Banks]]\n[[File:Mary Poppins12.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hermione Baddeley]] and [[Reta Shaw]] as Ellen and Mrs. Brill]]\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]], a magical and loving woman who descends from the clouds in response to the Banks children's advertisement for a nanny.

According to the 40th Anniversary DVD release of the film in 2004, Disney's daughters fell in love with the ''Mary Poppins'' books and made him promise to make a film based on them. Disney first attempted to purchase the film rights to ''Mary Poppins'' from [[P. L. Travers]] as early as 1938. However, Travers refused; she did not believe a film version of her books would do justice to her creation.\n\nIn addition, Disney was then known primarily as a producer of cartoons and had yet to produce any major live-action work. For more than 20 years, Disney periodically made efforts to convince Travers to allow him to make a ''Poppins'' film, which included making visits to Travers' home in [[Chelsea, London]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Saving Mr Banks: the true story of Walt Disney's battle to make Mary Poppins |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/saving-mr-banks-true-story-walt-disneys-battle-make-mary-poppins/ |access-date=April 14, 2022 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> He finally succeeded in 1961 although Travers demanded and obtained script approval rights. The [[Sherman Brothers]] composed the [[film score|music score]] and were also involved in the film's development, suggesting the setting be changed from the 1930s to the [[Edwardian era]]. Pre-production and song composition took about two years.\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nTravers was an adviser to the production, even being billed as the film's Consultant. However, she disapproved of the dilution of the harsher aspects of Mary Poppins' character, felt ambivalent about the music, and hated the use of animation so much that she ruled out any further adaptations of the later ''Mary Poppins'' novels.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Melinda|title='Poppins' Author a Pill No Spoonful of Sugar Could Sweeten|url=https://variety.com/2013/music/features/poppins-author-a-pill-no-spoonful-of-sugar-could-sweeten-1200802019/|access-date=November 7, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=November 7, 2013|archive-date=November 11, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111182813/http://variety.com/2013/music/features/poppins-author-a-pill-no-spoonful-of-sugar-could-sweeten-1200802019/|url-status=live}}</ref> She objected to a number of elements that made it into the film. Rather than original songs, she wanted the soundtrack to feature known standards of the Edwardian period in which the story is set. However, due to contract stipulations citing that he had [[final cut privilege]] on the finished print, Disney overruled her.\n\nMuch of the Travers\u2013Disney correspondence is part of the Travers collection of papers in the [[State Library of New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The relationship between Travers and Disney is detailed in ''Mary Poppins She Wrote'', a biography of Travers by Valerie Lawson.

Rather than using the more common [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] process to insert the actors into the animated footage, the actors were filmed against a white screen lit with sodium vapor lights, which have a yellow hue. A special camera was fitted with a prism that filtered this light to a separate reel of film, creating a highly accurate matte that could be used to isolate the actors from the background. This created a crisp, clean image and even allowed the partially transparent veil of Mary Poppins's costume to let through light from the background.

Some profits from this movie were taken to help fund the Disney World Monorail system. Disney's monorail system pays homage to this film by naming the [[Walt Disney World Monorail System|MAPO]] (MAry POppins) safety system included on all Disney monorails. Also, all Walt Disney World Railroad steam locomotives are fitted with a boiler safety device marked \"MAPO.\"\n\nNever at ease with the handling of her property by Disney or the way she felt she had been treated, Travers never agreed to another Poppins/Disney adaptation. So fervent was Travers' dislike of the Disney adaptation and of the way she felt she had been treated during the production that when producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] approached her about the [[Mary Poppins (musical)|stage musical]] in the 1990s, she acquiesced on the conditions that he use only English-born writers and that no one from the film production be directly involved.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ouzounian|first=Richard|title=P.L.
