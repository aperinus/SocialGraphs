Starring [[Maxim Gaudette]], [[Sebastien Huberdeau]], and [[Karine Vanasse]], the film is based on the 1989 [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre]] (also known as the \"Montreal Massacre\") and re-enacts the events of the incident through the eyes of two students (Huberdeau and Vanasse) who witness a [[Marc L\u00e9pine|gunman]] (Gaudette) murder fourteen young women.\n\nAfter a release in Quebec in February 2009, it was featured in the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]]. It received numerous honours, including nine [[30th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], notably [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Marc L\u00e9pine|young man]] prepares his rifle and leaves a message for his mother. He then goes to [[Polytechnique Montreal]], an engineering school, and enters a classroom during class with a rifle. He orders the men to leave and the women to stay. They comply after he shoots into the ceiling to show that he is serious. He tells the women that he hates [[Feminism in Canada|feminists]]. Although the women deny being feminists, he shoots at them, killing some and wounding others. He then moves through corridors and the cafeteria, specifically targeting women.\n\nOne of the male students is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, who was ordered to leave the classroom. Instead of fleeing the scene, he returns to try to stop the killer and/or help the victims. Val\u00e9rie and St\u00e9phanie, two surviving women, play dead thinking the killer has returned, although St\u00e9phanie later dies of her injuries.\n\nFinally, the killer reaches another classroom where he kills a female lecturer. He then commits suicide, and his blood mixes with the blood of his victim.\n\nSome time after the massacre, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, feeling guilty for complying with the order to leave the classroom and abandoning the women, commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. Val\u00e9rie, wearing the [[Iron Ring]], the professional ring of Canadian engineers, learns she is pregnant.  She makes plans to tell a potential son to be loving or a potential daughter that the world belongs to her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maxim Gaudette]] as [[Marc L\u00e9pine|The Killer]]\n* [[S\u00e9bastien Huberdeau]] as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Karine Vanasse]] as Val\u00e9rie\n* [[Evelyne Brochu]] as St\u00e9phanie\n* [[Johanne-Marie Tremblay]] as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois' mother\n** Natalie Hamel-Roy as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois' mother (voice)\n* [[Pierre-Yves Cardinal]] as \u00c9ric\n[[File:Karine Vanasse.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Karine Vanasse]] stars as Val\u00e9rie and helped produce the film.<ref name=\"Patriquin\"/>]]\nThe rest of the cast listed alphabetically:\n{{Cast listing|\n* Marie-Evelyne Baribeau as Student\n* Mireille Brullemans as Admission Office's secretary\n* [[Larissa Corriveau]] as the Killer's neighbour\n* Sophie Desmarais as Female Student (3rd floor corridor)\n* Jonathan Dubsky as Frightened Student\n* Marina Eva as Student at the party\n* Emmanuelle Girard as Student behind speakers\n* Nathalie Girard as Injured student\n* Adam Kosh as the Killer's roommate\n* Manon Lapointe as the Killer's mother\n* Pierre-Xavier Martel as Security Agent\n* Anne Trudel as Student behind speakers\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Karine Vanasse]], who played Val\u00e9rie, helped produce ''Polytechnique'', and wanted to make a film about the massacre for years.
