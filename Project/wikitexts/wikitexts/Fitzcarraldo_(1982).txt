The film is derived from the historic events of Peruvian rubber baron [[Carlos Fitzcarrald]] and his real-life feat of transporting a disassembled [[steamboat]] over the [[Isthmus of Fitzcarrald]].\n\nThe film had a troubled production, chronicled in the documentary ''[[Burden of Dreams]]''. Herzog had his crew attempt to manually haul the 320-ton steamship up a steep hill, leading to three injuries. The film's original star [[Jason Robards]] became sick halfway through filming, so Herzog hired Kinski, with whom he had previously clashed violently during production of ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'', ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' and [[Woyzeck (1979 film)|''Woyzeck'']]. Their fourth partnership fared no better. When shooting was nearly complete, the chief of the [[Machiguenga]] tribe who were used extensively as extras, asked Herzog if they should kill Kinski for him. Herzog declined.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\n==Plot==\nBrian Sweeney \"Fitzcarraldo\" Fitzgerald is an Irishman living in [[Iquitos]], a small city east of the Andes in the Amazon Basin in [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, when the city grew exponentially during the [[rubber boom]]. He has an indomitable spirit, but is little more than a dreamer with one major failure already behind him \u2013 the bankrupted and incomplete Trans-Andean railways. A lover of opera and a great fan of the internationally known Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], he dreams of building an [[opera house]] in Iquitos.\n\nNumerous Europeans and North African [[Sephardic Jewish]] immigrants have settled in the city at this time, bringing their cultures with them. The opera house will require considerable amounts of money, which the booming [[rubber]] industry in Peru should yield in profits. The areas in the Amazon Basin known to contain [[rubber trees]] have been parceled up by the Peruvian government and are leased to private companies for exploitation.\n\nFitzcarraldo explores entering the rubber business. A helpful rubber baron points out on a map the only remaining unclaimed parcel in the area. He explains that while it is located on the [[Ucayali River]], a major [[tributary]] of the Amazon, it is cut off from the Amazon (and access to Atlantic ports) by a lengthy section of [[rapids]]. Fitzcarraldo sees that the [[Pachitea River]], another Amazon tributary, comes within several hundred meters of the Ucayali upstream of the parcel.<ref>This is [[fictional]]. The Pachitea is a tributary of the Ucayali, not a third river, and their [[confluence]] is nearly 500 kilometers south of Iquitos. The true map looks nothing like the one Fitzcarraldo draws.</ref> He plans to investigate that.\n\nHe leases the inaccessible parcel from the government. His paramour, Molly, a successful [[brothel]] owner, funds his purchase of an old [[riverboat|steamship]] (which he [[Ceremonial ship launching|christens]] the SS ''Molly [[Aida]]''). After recruiting a crew, he takes off up the Pachitea, the parallel river. This river has dangerous interior areas because of its [[Jivaroan peoples|indigenous people]] hostile to outsiders.\n\nFitzcarraldo plans to go to the closest point between the two rivers and, with the manpower of impressed natives (who are nearly enslaved by many rubber companies), physically pull his three-deck, 320<!--ARTICLES SAY 320/340/350/360, CONSERVATIVE VALUE PICKED-->-ton steamer over the muddy 40\u00b0 hillside across a [[portage]] from one river to the next.<ref name=\"Blank-1-11-25\">{{Cite web\n| author      = Blank, Les\n| year        = 1982\n| title       = English captions of documentary ''Burden of Dreams'' from 1:11:25 to 1:12:40\n| work        = [[Burden of Dreams]]\n| url         = http://www.cswap.com/1982/Burden_of_Dreams/cap/en/25fps/a/01_11\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061101001108/http://www.cswap.com/1982/Burden_of_Dreams/cap/en/25fps/a/01_11\n| archive-date = 2006-11-01\n| quote       = [Werner Herzog:] Well, the boat that [Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald] actually pulled across was only 30 tons. ...

Impressed by Fitzcarraldo and his ship, the natives start working for him without fully understanding his goals. After great struggles, they successfully pull the ship over the mountain with a complex system of pulleys, worked by the natives and aided by the ship's anchor [[windlass]]. When the crew falls asleep after a drunken celebration, the chief of the natives severs the rope securing the ship to the shore. It floats down the river. The chief wanted to appease the river gods, who would otherwise be angered that Fitzcarraldo defied nature by circumventing them.\n\nThough the ship traverses [[Pongo de Mainique|the Ucayali rapids]] without major damage, Fitzcarraldo and his crew are forced to return to Iquitos without any rubber. Despondent, Fitzcarraldo sells the ship back to the rubber baron, but first sends the captain on a last voyage. He returns with the entire cast for the first opera production, including Caruso. The entire city of Iquitos comes to the shore as Fitzcarraldo, standing on top of the ship, proudly displays the cast.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Klaus Kinski]] as Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald (Fitzcarraldo)\n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Molly\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy]] as Don Aquilino\n* [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Fuentes (actor)|Miguel \u00c1ngel Fuentes]] as Cholo\n* [[Paul Hittscher]] as Captain (Orinoco Paul)\n* [[Huerequeque Enrique Boh\u00f3rquez]] as Huerequeque (The Cook)\n* [[Grande Otelo]] as Station master (as Grande Othelo)\n* [[Peter Berling]] as Opera Manager\n* [[David P\u00e9rez Espinosa]] as Chief of Campa Indians\n* [[Milton Nascimento]] as Black Man at Opera House\n* [[Ruy Polanah]] as Rubber Baron\n* [[Salvador God\u00ednez]] as Old Missionary\n* [[Dieter Milz]] as Young Missionary\n* William \"Bill\" Rose as Notary \n* [[Le\u00f4ncio Bueno]] \n* [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] as one of the Opera Singers (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Fizzcarraldo.jpg|thumb|The remains of the steamer used in the movie, in [[Madre de Dios Region]].

In the 1890s, Fitzcarrald arranged for the transport of a steamship across an isthmus from one river into another, but it weighed only 30 tons (rather than over 300), and was carried over in pieces to be reassembled at its destination.<ref name=\"Blank-1-11-25\" /><ref>{{Cite web\n |author      = Blank, Les\n |year        = 1982\n |title       = English captions of documentary ''Burden of Dreams'' from 0:02:09 to 0:02:36\n |work        = [[Burden of Dreams]]\n |url         = http://www.cswap.com/1982/Burden_of_Dreams/cap/en/25fps/a/00_01\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061031232330/http://www.cswap.com/1982/Burden_of_Dreams/cap/Burden\n |archive-date = 2006-10-31\n |quote       = [Werner Herzog:] There was a historical figure whose name was Carlos Ferm\u00edn Fitzcarrald, a 'caucho' baron.

The film production was an incredible ordeal, and famously involved moving a 320<!--SEE NOTE ABOVE-->-ton steamship over a hill. This was filmed without the use of special effects. Herzog believed that no one had ever performed a similar feat in history, and likely never will again, calling himself \"Conquistador of the Useless\".<ref>{{Cite book\n | last      = Herzog\n | first      = Werner\n | title      = Herzog on Herzog\n | publisher      = [[Faber and Faber]]\n | year      = 2001\n | isbn      = 0-571-20708-1\n | url-access      = registration\n | url      = https://archive.org/details/herzogonherzog00herz\n }}</ref> Three similar-looking ships were bought for the production and used in different scenes and locations, including scenes that were shot aboard the ship while it crashed through rapids.

[[Jason Robards]] was originally cast in the title role, but he became ill with [[dysentery]] during early filming. After leaving for treatment, he was forbidden by his doctors to return. Herzog considered casting [[Jack Nicholson]], or playing the role of Fitzcarraldo himself, before [[Klaus Kinski]] accepted the role. Herzog had done considerable film work with Kinski. By that point, forty percent of shooting with Robards was complete. For continuity, Herzog had to begin a total reshoot with Kinski. [[Mick Jagger]] as Fitzcarraldo's assistant Wilbur and [[Mario Adorf]] as the Ship's captain were originally cast, but due to the delays, their shooting schedule expired. Jagger parted to tour with [[the Rolling Stones]]. Herzog dropped Jagger's character from the script altogether as he reshot the film from the beginning. Brazilian actor [[Grande Otelo]] and singer [[Milton Nascimento]] play minor parts.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\nKinski displayed erratic behavior throughout the production, and fought virulently with Herzog and other members of the crew. A scene from Herzog's documentary of the actor, ''[[My Best Fiend]]'', shows Kinski raging at production manager Walter Saxer over trivial matters, such as the quality of the food. Herzog notes that the native extras were greatly upset by the actor's behavior. Kinski claimed to feel close to them. In ''My Best Fiend'', Herzog says that one of the native chiefs offered in all seriousness to kill Kinski for him, but that he declined because he needed the actor to complete filming. According to Herzog, he exploited these tensions: in a scene in which the ship's crew is eating dinner while surrounded by the natives, the clamor the chief incites over Fitzcarraldo was inspired by their hatred of Kinski.<ref>Herzog, Werner (1999). ''[[My Best Fiend]]'', 59:20-59:50</ref>\n\nLocations used for the film include: [[Manaus]], Brazil; [[Iquitos]], Peru; [[Pongo de Mainique]], Peru; an [[isthmus]] between the [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]] and the Camisea rivers, Peru at [http://maps.google.es/maps?q=-11.737294,-72.934542&hl=es&sll=-11.738723,-72.918663&sspn=0.074708,0.132093&t=h&z=11 -11.737294,-72.934542], 36 miles west of the actual historical fiction, the [[Isthmus of Fitzcarrald]].\n\nHerzog's first version of the story was published as ''Fitzcarraldo: The Original Story'' (1982) from Fjord Press ({{ISBN|0-940242-04-4}}). He made alterations while writing the screenplay.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n===Deaths, injuries and accusations of exploitation===\nThe production was also affected by the numerous injuries and deaths of several indigenous extras who were hired to work on the film as laborers, and two small plane crashes that occurred during the film's production which resulted in a number of injuries, including one case of paralysis.<ref name=\"filmsranked.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.filmsranked.com/its-past-time-we-condemned-fitzcarraldo/|title=It's past time we condemned Fitzcarraldo|newspaper=Films Ranked|access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref> Another incident during the production included a local Peruvian logger who was bitten by a venomous snake, who made the dramatic decision to cut off his own foot with a chainsaw to prevent the spread of the venom, thus saving his own life.<ref name=\"filmsranked.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/09/11-craziest-things-that-have-happened-during-the-making-of-werner-herzogs-films-58559/|title=11 Craziest Things That Have Happened During the Making of Werner Herzog's Films|first1=Anya|last1=Jaremko-Greenwold|first2=Anya|last2=Jaremko-Greenwold|date=4 September 2015|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nHerzog has been accused of exploiting indigenous people in the making of the film and comparisons have been made between Herzog and Fitzcarrald himself. In 1982 Michael F. Brown, now a professor of anthropology at [[Williams College]], claimed in the magazine ''[[The Progressive]]'' that while Herzog originally got along with the [[Aguaruna people]], some of whom were hired as extras for the film and for construction, relations deteriorated when Herzog began the construction of a village on Aguaruna land. He allegedly failed to consult the tribal council and attempted to obtain protection from the local militia when the tribe turned violent. Aguaruna men burned down the film set in December 1979, reportedly careful to avoid casualties.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michael F.|title=Art of Darkness|journal=The Progressive|date=August 1982|page=20|url=http://lanfiles-vm.williams.edu/mbrown/Brown_ArtOfDarkness_1982.pdf|access-date=4 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002057/http://lanfiles-vm.williams.edu/mbrown/Brown_ArtOfDarkness_1982.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack album (released in 1982) contains music by [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], taken from the albums ''[[Die Nacht der Seele]]'' (1979) and ''[[Sei still, wisse ich bin]]'' (1981),<ref>[http://www.enricobassi.it/popolvuhmiscelanea.htm#FITZCARRALDO enricobassi.it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404003752/http://www.enricobassi.it/popolvuhmiscelanea.htm |date=2011-04-04 }} Fitzcarraldo soundtrack album</ref><ref>{{discogs master|52077|Fitzcarraldo soundtrack album}}</ref> performances by [[Enrico Caruso]], and others.
