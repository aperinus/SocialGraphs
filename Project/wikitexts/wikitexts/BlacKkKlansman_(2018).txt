The film stars [[John David Washington]] as Stallworth, along with [[Adam Driver]], [[Laura Harrier]], and [[Topher Grace]]. Set in the 1970s in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]], the plot follows the first African-American detective in the [[Colorado Springs Police Department|city's police department]] as he sets out to infiltrate and expose the local [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter.\n\nThe film was produced by Spike Lee, Raymond Mansfield, Shaun Redick, [[Sean McKittrick]], [[Jason Blum]], and [[Jordan Peele]].

Much of the cast joined the following month, and filming began in [[New York (state)|New York State]].\n\n''BlacKkKlansman'' premiered on May 14, 2018, at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]. It was theatrically released in the United States on August 10, 2018, a day before the first anniversary of the [[Unite the Right rally]]. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised Lee's direction, the performances (particularly of Washington and Driver) and timely themes, as well as noting it as a return to form for Lee. It received six nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Lee's first directing nomination), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Driver, and won for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], making it Lee's first competitive Academy Award. The [[American Film Institute]] also selected it as one of the [[American Film Institute Awards#2018|top 10 films of 2018]], and at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] it earned four nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, [[Ron Stallworth]] is hired as the first [[African Americans|black]] officer in the [[Colorado Springs Police Department]]. Assigned to work in the records room, he tires of being harassed and applies to be an undercover officer. He is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader [[Stokely Carmichael|Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael)]] is speaking. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, president of the Black Student Union at [[Colorado College]]. While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and gropes Patrice.\n\nFollowing the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division. After reading about a local division of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the newspaper, he calls posing as [[White Americans|white]]. He speaks with Walter Breachway, the president of the [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] chapter, but soon realizes that not only did he use his real name, but he must also meet the Klan members. Stallworth recruits his [[Jewish Americans|Jewish]] coworker, Flip Zimmerman, to impersonate him and meet the Klan members while he continues posing as white on the phone. Under Stallworth's identity, Zimmerman meets Walter, the slightly more reckless Felix Kendrickson (and later his wife Connie), and Ivanhoe, who cryptically refers to an upcoming attack.\n\nCalling Klan headquarters in [[Louisiana]] to expedite his membership, Stallworth begins regular phone conversations with [[Grand Wizard]] [[David Duke]]. Kendrickson suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and tries to force him to take a [[polygraph]] test at gunpoint, but Stallworth, overhearing everything on the [[covert listening device|wire]] Zimmerman is wearing, breaks the Kendricksons' kitchen window as a distraction. Stallworth begins dating Patrice without telling her that he is a police officer. After passing information to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army CID]] about active-duty members, he learns from an [[FBI]] agent that two members are personnel stationed at [[NORAD]].\n\nDuke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan. Over the real Stallworth's protests, he is assigned to a protection detail for Duke. Once Zimmerman, masquerading as Stallworth, is initiated, Connie leaves the ceremony to place a bomb at a local civil rights rally. The real Stallworth realizes her intentions and alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she puts Felix's backup plan into action and plants the bomb at Patrice's house, leaving it under her car when it will not fit into the mailbox. Stallworth tackles her as she tries to flee, but uniformed officers detain and beat him despite his protests that he is working undercover.\n[[File:Birth of a Nation (1915).webm|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Scenes from ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) are used in the film]]\n\nThe bombmaker, Walker, recognizes Zimmerman from a prior arrest and informs Felix. He, Felix, and Ivanhoe drive to the house and park next to Patrice's car without realizing that the bomb is hidden underneath. When they detonate it, the explosion kills all three. Zimmerman arrives, frees Stallworth, and arrests Connie. While Stallworth is celebrating the closed case that night with Patrice, Landers arrives and harasses the two, remorselessly admitting to his assault on Patrice; Stallworth then reveals he is wearing a wire, and Police Chief Bridges arrives and arrests Landers for [[police brutality]].\n\nBridges congratulates the team for their success but orders them to end their investigation and destroy the records. Stallworth receives a call from Duke, and he insultingly tells Duke he is black before hanging up. While Patrice and Stallworth discuss their future, they are interrupted by a knock on the door. Through the window in the hallway, they see a [[cross burning|flaming cross]] on a hillside surrounded by Klan members. The film then cuts to actual footage of the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]], the [[Charlottesville car attack|hit and run]] that followed, and where a still-respected Duke is a speaker, and ends with a dedication to Heather Heyer (the only person killed in the attack), and an upside-down American flag that fades to black and white.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John David Washington]] as Detective [[Ron Stallworth]]\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Detective Philip \"Flip\" Zimmerman\n* [[Laura Harrier]] as Patrice Dumas\n* [[Topher Grace]] as [[David Duke]]\n* [[Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen]] as Felix Kendrickson\n* [[Ryan Eggold]] as Walter Breachway\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as Ivanhoe\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Connie Kendrickson\n* [[Corey Hawkins]] as [[Stokely Carmichael|Kwame Ture]]\n* Michael Buscemi as Jimmy Creek\n* Ken Garito as Sergeant Trapp\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Chief Bridges\n* [[Fred Weller]] as Patrolman Andy Landers\n* [[Nicholas Turturro]] as Walker\n* [[Harry Belafonte]] as Jerome Turner\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Kennebrew Beauregard \n* [[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]] as Mr. Turrentine\n* [[Damaris Lewis]] as Odetta\n}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn July 2015, screenwriters/co-producers Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz discovered the book ''Black Klansman'' by [[Ron Stallworth]].

The most shocking thing about Flip's (Adam Driver's undercover detective role) imposture is how easy it seems, how natural he looks and sounds.

There was also a second white officer (\"Jim\") who also went undercover alongside Chuck.\n* Stallworth and other officers never worked to secretly expose and arrest a racist cop (as depicted in the film), although he does mention in the memoir an officer who shot and killed a young boy but was protected by fellow law enforcement officers. \n* Stallworth did work security, meet, and take a photo with Duke when he visited Colorado, although it was a much more intimate gathering than the large ceremony depicted in the film, and his partner's cover was never blown.\n* The bomb plot against the Black Student Union is fictional, although Stallworth noted the local chapter did at one point have plans to attack a local gay bar.\n* The character of Patrice is fictional, although Stallworth does mention dating a young woman while doing the investigation.\n* Stallworth never called Duke to admit he was actually a black man; Duke did not find out until he was asked to fact-check the story by a reporter in 2006.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of black films of the 2010s]]\n* [[Race (human categorization)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official site|http://www.blackkklansman.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|7349662}}\n* {{AllMovie title|694434}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|m/blackkklansman}}\n* [http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/blackkklansman/ ''BlacKkKlansman''] at ''[[History vs. Hollywood]]''\n\n{{Spike Lee}}\n{{Jordan Peele}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = [[List of accolades received by BlacKkKlansman|Awards for ''BlacKkKlansman'']]\n|list =\n{{BET Award for Best Movie}}\n{{Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix}}\n{{Satellite Award Best Motion Picture}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:African-American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Blaxploitation films]]\n[[Category:Blumhouse Productions films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Donald Trump]]\n[[Category:Films about the Ku Klux Klan]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Spike Lee]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jason Blum]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jordan Peele]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Terence Blanchard]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1972]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2017]]\n[[Category:Films set in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films about antisemitism]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Legendary Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Cannes Grand Prix winners]]\n[[Category:40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
