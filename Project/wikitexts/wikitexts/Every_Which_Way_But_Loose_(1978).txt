It stars [[Clint Eastwood]] in an uncharacteristic and offbeat comedy role as Philo Beddoe, a trucker and bare-knuckle brawler roaming the [[American West]] in search of a lost love while accompanied by his brother/manager, Orville, and his pet [[orangutan]], [[Manis (orangutan)|Clyde]]. In the process, Philo manages to cross a motley assortment of characters, including a pair of police officers and an entire [[motorcycle gang]] (the Black Widows of Pacoima), who end up pursuing him for revenge.\n\nEastwood's appearance in the film, after his string of [[Spaghetti Western]] and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' roles, somewhat startled the film industry and he was reportedly advised against making it. Although it was poorly reviewed by critics, the film went on to become an enormous success and became, along with its 1980 sequel ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', two of the highest grossing Eastwood films. When adjusted for inflation, it ranks as one of the top 250 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nPhilo Beddoe is a truck driver living in the San Fernando Valley. He lives in a small house, with an [[orangutan]] named Clyde, behind that of his brother, Orville Boggs, and his mother. Philo makes money on the side as a bare-knuckle fighter; he is often compared to a legendary fighter named Tank Murdock.\n\nOne night Philo becomes smitten with Lynn Halsey-Taylor, an aspiring [[country music]] singer he meets at the [[Palomino Club (North Hollywood)|Palomino Club]], a local [[honky-tonk]]. His relationship with her seems to be going well until one day she and her camper disappear from the trailer park. Believing that he is falling for her, Philo decides to set off for Lynn's home in Denver, Colorado.\n\nAlong the way, he has a run-in with a motorcycle gang called the Black Widows, who incur Philo's wrath after two gang members insult him and Clyde at a traffic light. Philo chases them down and takes their bikes (which he repaints, repairs, and resells), and every attempt they make to get even results in disaster. Philo also incurs the wrath of an LAPD cop named Putnam, with whom he gets into a fight at the Palomino. Both the officer and the Widows learn of Philo's trip to Colorado and head off to find him.\n\nOrville and Clyde accompany Philo to Denver, and on the way, they meet a woman named Echo who becomes Orville's girlfriend. They earn money along the way by booking fights for Philo. After a fight in a slaughterhouse, the man holding the money tries to stiff Philo. Echo fires two shots from a .38, dead center into a side of beef. She lets the crowd know she knows how to shoot, saying, \"The second shot was to let you know the first was no accident.\" The man hands over the money.\n\nKnowing that Philo has come to look for her, Lynn helps the Black Widows lure him into a trap. Philo sees Lynn and attempts to talk to her, but finds himself surrounded by the Black Widows. He manages to fight most of them until Orville intervenes. Using a garbage truck with a dumpster hoist, he dumps all the motorcycles into the back of the truck. The Widows charge the garbage truck, but Orville gets away. Philo, Echo, and Orville then escape.\n\nPhilo finally finds Lynn and she reveals her true nature to him. Hurt by her callousness, Philo says that he is the only one dumb enough to want to take her further than her bed. Lynn erupts in a fit of rage, striking him repeatedly until she collapses in tears.\n\nOrville learns that Tank Murdock, based in the area, is ready to retire after one more fight. Orville makes the arrangements, and Philo faces his elderly nemesis. During the fight, the crowd, initially pro-Murdock, begins to insult him, with some murmurs that Philo is going to be the next Murdock. Philo lets his guard down, intentionally giving Murdock a clear shot, knocking Philo down for the count. Murdock, having regained the crowd's esteem, is allowed to retire undefeated, although he knows Philo let him win. Clyde, Orville and Echo head home the next day.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Philo Beddoe\n* [[Sondra Locke]] as Lynn Halsey-Taylor\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Orville\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Echo\n* [[Ruth Gordon]] as Ma\n* [[Walt Barnes|Walter Barnes]] as Tank Murdock\n* [[George Chandler]] as D.M.V.

Eastwood unexpectedly took a liking to the project himself, seeing it as a way to broaden his appeal to the public.<ref>{{cite book |last=Freese |first=Gene |date=2017 |title=Classic Movie Fight Scenes: 75 Years of Bare Knuckle Brawls, 1914-1989 |location=Jefferson, NC |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |page=259 |isbn=978-1-4766-2935-3 }}</ref> Most of Eastwood's production team and his agents reportedly thought it was ill-advised.<ref>McGilligan (1999), p. 293</ref> Bob Hoyt, whom Eastwood had contacts with (through his Malpaso secretary Judy Hoyt and Eastwood's long-term friend Fritz Manes), thought it showed promise and eventually convinced Warner Brothers to buy it. An orangutan named [[Manis (orangutan)|Manis]] was brought in to play Clyde; also cast were Geoffrey Lewis as the dimwitted Orville, [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as his girlfriend, and Sondra Locke as Lynn Halsey-Taylor, the country and western barroom singer. Eastwood spoke about using the orangutan for the main role, \"Clyde was one of the most natural actors I ever worked with! But you had to get him on the first take because his boredom level was very limited.\"<ref>Munn, p. 166</ref>\n\nThe film has a contemporary [[western movie|western]] theme, displaying the [[blue collar]] aspects of the western United States, with many scenes shot in rural locations, cheap [[motel]] rooms, industrial facilities, and [[honky-tonk]] bars. The film was shot on location, including the [[California]] communities of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]], [[Sun Valley, California|Sun Valley]], [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]], and [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]].

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"the slackest and most harebrained of Mr. Eastwood's recent movies. It's overlong and virtually uneventful, even though there are half a dozen cute characters and woolly subplots competing for the viewer's attentions.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (December 20, 1978).

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 26.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"Eastwood must have thought of his blundering new vehicle, 'Every Which Way but Loose,' as a change of pace, designed to align his career in a direction similar to that of Burt Reynolds. Casual, knockabout farce seems to be the general idea, but perhaps Eastwood should have borrowed the director and writers who helped shape '[[Smokey and the Bandit]]' and '[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]' for Reynolds. 'Every Which Way but Loose' certainly isn't loose. It's a sluggish shambles.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (December 20, 1978). \"He-Man Hijinks\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. E1.</ref> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"One can forgive the orangutan's participation - he couldn't read the script - but what is Eastwood's excuse? That a star with his power in Hollywood would choose to litter the screen with this plotless junk heap of moronic gags, sour romance and fatuous fisticuffs can be taken either as an expression of contempt for his huge audience or as an act of masochism.\"<ref>Ansen, David (January 8, 1979). \"Wrong-Way Clint\".
