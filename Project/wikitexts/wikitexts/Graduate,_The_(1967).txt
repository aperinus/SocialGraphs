The film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life, who is seduced by an older married woman, Mrs. Robinson ([[Anne Bancroft]]), but then falls for her daughter Elaine ([[Katharine Ross]]).\n\n''The Graduate'' was released on December 21, 1967, to critical and commercial success, grossing $104.9{{nbsp}}million worldwide, making it the [[1967 in film|highest-grossing film of 1967]].

During his graduation party, he is urged to join a business dealing in plastics - the material of the future. Benjamin cringes as his parents deliver accolades during the party and retreats to his bedroom until Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. He initially resists her advances, but after his parents continue to make him feel isolated and desperate for any kind of connection, he invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym \"Mr. Gladstone\".\n\nBenjamin spends the summer relaxing in his parents' pool by day and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that her loveless marriage resulted when she accidentally became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it. However, Benjamin's parents, unaware of the affair, are eager for their son to date Elaine and relentlessly pester him to ask her out, as does Mr. Robinson. Benjamin gives in and reluctantly takes Elaine on a date.\n\nWhen he sees how upset Mrs. Robinson is, Benjamin attempts to sabotage his date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly, and taking her to a [[strip club]]. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin, feeling remorseful, runs out after her, apologizes, and kisses her. They eat at a [[drive-in]] restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair with a married woman. Benjamin swears that the affair is over and makes plans for another date with Elaine for the following day.\n\nTo prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin reveals to Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she refuses to see Benjamin again and returns to school at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]].\n\nBenjamin follows her to Berkeley hoping to regain her affections. Elaine is aghast because her mother told her that Benjamin raped her when she was drunk. After Benjamin explains what really happened and apologizes, Elaine forgives him and they rekindle their relationship. He asks her to marry him, but she is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Later, an angry Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and confronts Benjamin in his boarding room, where he informs him that he and his wife will be divorcing soon, and threatens to have Benjamin jailed if he continues to see Elaine. He then forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl Smith, a classmate whom she briefly dated.\n\nBenjamin drives back to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home in search of Elaine. Instead, he finds Mrs. Robinson who calls the police and claims that her house is being burglarized. She then tells Benjamin that he cannot prevent Elaine's marriage to Carl. Before the police can arrest him, Benjamin flees the Robinson home and drives back to Berkeley. There, he visits Carl's fraternity and discovers from one of Carl's fraternity brothers that the wedding will take place in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] that day. He rushes towards the area near the church, when his [[Alfa Romeo Spider#In The Graduate|Alfa Romeo]] runs out of gas, causing him to jog towards the church and arrives just as the ceremony ends. Overlooking the sanctuary, he bangs on the glass separating him from the wedding and shouts Elaine's name. After surveying the angry faces of Carl and her parents, Elaine shouts \"Ben!\" and flees the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large [[Christian cross|cross]], which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping them inside. Elaine and Benjamin escape aboard a bus and sit among startled passengers. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly fade away and they begin to look toward an uncertain future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Mrs. Robinson\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Benjamin Braddock\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as Elaine Robinson\n* [[William Daniels]] as Mr. Braddock\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Mrs. Braddock\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Room Clerk\n* Brian Avery as Carl Smith\n* [[Walter Brooke]] as Mr. McGuire\n* [[Norman Fell]] as Mr. McCleery\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Mrs. Singleman\n* [[Marion Lorne]] as Miss DeWitte\n}}\nAdditionally, [[Richard Dreyfuss]] makes an uncredited appearance in one of his early roles as one of the tenants in Mr. McCleery\u2019s building.\n\n==Production==\nGetting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer [[Lawrence Turman]], who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. Turman also said that every studio turned down the project saying they read the book and hated it.<ref>https://nypost.com/2017/04/20/50-years-later-the-graduate-cast-reveals-behind-the-scenes-secrets/</ref> He then contacted producer [[Joseph E. Levine]], who said he would finance the film because he had associated with Nichols on the play ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It|The Knack]]'',<ref name=fee/> and because he heard that Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (film)|Virginia Woolf]]''.<ref name=\"Kashner\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of The Graduate|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/graduate200803|magazine=Vanity Fair|access-date=November 21, 2014|date=March 2008|archive-date=November 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121115808/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/graduate200803|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith financing assured, Nichols suggested [[Buck Henry]] for screenwriter, although Henry's experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and had no writing background.

Numerous actors were considered for or sought roles in the film. [[Doris Day]] turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her.<ref name=mcgee>{{cite book| title=Doris Day: Sentimental Journey| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfbcA3zFlNgC&q=doris+day+graduate&pg=PT326| last=McGee| first=Garry| date=November 22, 2011| page=160| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0-7864-6107-3| access-date=2014-03-03}}</ref><ref>https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/13/18617650/doris-day-life-films-legacy-rock-hudson-terry-melcher-manson</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/obituaries/doris-day-death.html</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] inquired about the part, while [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] both wanted the role. [[Patricia Neal]] turned down the film as she had only recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. [[Geraldine Page]] also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included [[Claire Bloom]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Eleanor Parker]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Angela Lansbury]] also asked about playing the part. [[Ava Gardner]] sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this ''Graduate'' thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, [[Natalie Wood]] turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine.\n\nFor the character of Elaine, casting was also an issue. [[Patty Duke]] turned down the part as she did not want to work at the time. [[Faye Dunaway]] was also considered for Elaine, but had to turn it down, in favor of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. [[Sally Field]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]] refused the role as well. [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Joan Collins]] both wanted the role, but did not succeed in getting it. [[Carroll Baker]] tested, but was said to have been too old to portray Anne Bancroft's daughter. [[Candice Bergen]] screen-tested as well, as did [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Additionally, [[Ann-Margret]], [[Elizabeth Ashley]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Sue Lyon]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Pamela Tiffin]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Tuesday Weld]] were all on the director's shortlist before [[Katharine Ross]] was cast.\n\nDustin Hoffman was cast as Liebkind in the [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]]'' (1967), but before filming began Hoffman begged Brooks to let him go to audition for ''The Graduate''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/the-producers-mel-brooks-interview-tcm-film-festival-1201957140/|title='The Producers' Turns 50: Mel Brooks Explains Why His Subversive Comedy Is Still Relevant|first=Bill|last=Desowitz|date=April 25, 2018|access-date=October 23, 2022}}</ref> When [[Dustin Hoffman]] auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one during his acting classes and believed that, as he said later, \"a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years.\" Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman \"look[ed] about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.\" Producer [[Joseph E. Levine]] later admitted that he at first believed that Hoffman \"was one of the messenger boys.\" Despite&mdash;or perhaps because of\u2014Hoffman's awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.<ref name=\"life19671124\">{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA111| title=The Graduate| magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]| date=24 November 1967| access-date=2014-03-03| last=Zeitlin| first=David| page=111| archive-date=May 10, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510020202/http://books.google.com/books?id=eEkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA71&pg=PA111| url-status=live}}</ref> \"As far as I'm concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,\" said Hoffman. \"In fact, many of the reviews were very negative.

After spending that money, Hoffman filed for New York State [[unemployment benefits]], receiving $55 per week while living in a two-room apartment in the [[West Village]] of Manhattan.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Dan|date=1967-12-30|title=New-Found Stardom Worries Dustin Hoffman|page=15|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nBefore Hoffman was cast, [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Charles Grodin]] were among the top choices. Beatty turned the film down, as he was occupied with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. Redford tested for the part of Benjamin (with [[Candice Bergen]] as Elaine), but Nichols thought Redford did not possess the underdog quality Benjamin needed.<ref name=\"Kashner\" /> Grodin turned down the part at first because of the low $500/week salary offered by producer [[Lawrence Turman]]. Grodin was offered more money but declined again because he didn't believe he could prepare for a screen test for the film overnight. \"If they had given me three days to prepare, I think I would have gotten the role,\" he said.<ref name=\"vulture\">Evans, Bradford, \"The Lost Roles of 'The Graduate',\" ''Vulture'', Dec. 20, 2012. https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/the-lost-roles-of-the-graduate.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124063548/https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/the-lost-roles-of-the-graduate.html |date=November 24, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Harrison Ford]] also auditioned for the role of Benjamin Braddock but was turned down.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McqLdkUnTVgC&pg=PA144|title=Harrison Ford: The Films|isbn=9780786440481|last1=Duke|first1=Brad|date=July 2008|access-date=May 30, 2021|archive-date=June 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602233120/https://books.google.com/books?id=McqLdkUnTVgC&pg=PA144|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Burt Ward]] was informally offered Hoffman's role, but was already committed  to the role of Robin in the [[Batman television series]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Huver |first1=Scott |title=Holy Hollywood Star, Batman: Burt Ward Talks Road to Walk of Fame Honor |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/batman-burt-ward-hollywood-walk-of-fame-interview-1203453454/ |website=Variety |language=en |date=January 9, 2020 |access-date=2020-10-01 |archive-date=February 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226132451/https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/batman-burt-ward-hollywood-walk-of-fame-interview-1203453454/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Jack Nicholson]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], [[Keir Dullea]], [[Brandon deWilde]] and [[Michael Parks]] were also considered for the role of Benjamin Braddock.<ref name =\"vulture\" /><ref name=\"Kashner\" />\n\nIn the role of Mr. Robinson, [[Gene Hackman]] was originally cast, but just before filming began, the director decided he was too young and decided to replace him.

[[Susan Hayward]] was the first choice for Benjamin's mother, Mrs. Braddock, but the role was given to [[Elizabeth Wilson]]. For the role of Mr. Braddock, [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Karl Malden]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] (who had been [[Governor of California]] for nearly a year when the film was released) were all considered before [[William Daniels]] secured the part.<ref name=\"Kashner\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe quality of the [[cinematography]] was influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]] to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', said later, \"It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job.

In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the [[Church (building)|church]] had been watching the filming disapprovingly.

A parody of Hollywood [[high concept]] films, Henry describes the plot as Ben and Elaine living in a haunted house in Northern California, with an invalid Mrs. Robinson living in the attic.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{In popular culture|section|date=July 2021}}\nThe final act of the film ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' begins with an extended parody of the climactic sequence of ''The Graduate'', where Wayne pulls into a gas station to get directions, eventually asking for [[Charlton Heston|a better actor]], and eventually stops Cassandra's wedding and barricades the door with an electric guitar. This scene is also parodied in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]\" and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]\".\n\nThe music video for \"[[If You Go (song)|If You Go]]\" by [[Jon Secada]] also imitates the film's wedding crash scene.\n\nThe song \"[[Crashed the Wedding]]\" by [[Busted (band)|Busted]] was inspired by the film's wedding crash scene.\n\nThe wedding crash scene was parodied for the finale of the [[Papa and Nicole]] advertising campaign in the 1990s for the MK1 [[Renault Clio]]. The advert, aired in 1998, featured [[Reeves and Mortimer]] and tied in with the release of the MK2 Renault Clio.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwqEpwO-5PE |title=Renault Clio advert with Vic and Bob - YouTube |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=June 6, 2021 |archive-date=June 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606154954/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwqEpwO-5PE |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe wedding crash scene was parodied in the film ''Other Sister'' (1999), where Giovanni Ribisi and Juliette Lewis manage to tie the knot despite their developmental disabilities.\n\nA sixth-season episode of the television series ''[[Roseanne]]'' includes a fantasy scene where Jackie assumes the Bancroft role and attempts to seduce David, with the famous shot of Benjamin seen between the leg of Mrs. Robinson replicated. This scene is also parodied in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Lisa's Substitute]]\" when Mrs. Krabappel tries to seduce Mr. Bergstrom, who was voiced by Hoffman.\n\nThe film ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' parodied ''The Graduate'', showing [[Woody Harrelson]] framed by his repulsive landlady's leg, and features an excerpt of \"The Sound of Silence\" after Harrelson's character has sex with his landlady to make up for back rent, and is so sickened by the act that he repeatedly vomits afterwards.\n\nThe car that Benjamin drives in the movie is an [[Alfa Romeo Spider#In The Graduate|Alfa Romeo Spider]]. Based on its iconic role, Alfa Romeo sold a version of the Spider in the United States from 1985 to 1990 under the name \"Spider Graduate\".<ref name=\"conceptcarz.com/vehicle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z1351/Alfa-Romeo-Spider-Graduate.aspx |title=1986 Spider Graduate |website=conceptcarz.com |access-date=24 October 2020 |archive-date=August 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817191824/http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z1351/Alfa-Romeo-Spider-Graduate.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHoffman later recreated the wedding scene at the same church for an [[Audi]] commercial, in which he stops his daughter (played by [[Lake Bell]]) from getting married and tells her \u201cyou're just like your mother\u201d as they drive off, implying that he is an older Benjamin who has a daughter with Elaine.\n\nThe ending of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' [[Archer (season 3)|season 3, episode 11]] features an homage to the ending of ''The Graduate'' in which [[List of Archer characters#Recurring characters|Katya Kazanova]], a cyborg engaged to be married to the main character [[Sterling Archer]], leaves the wedding in the company of another cyborg, [[List of Archer characters#Barry Dylan|Barry Dylan]], after he crashes it. Following their departure on a bus, music reminiscent of \"The Sound of Silence\" plays as the characters' faces change from excitement to uncertainty.\n\nThe 1992 song, \"[[Too Funky]],\" by [[George Michael]] features a clip of the following [[Anne Bancroft]] lines \"I am not trying to seduce you... Would you like me to seduce you? Is that what you're trying to tell me?\" as an intro of the song and is repeated during the final crescendo.\n\n''[[(500) Days of Summer]]'' features a scene where the protagonist, Tom, watches ''The Graduate'' with his then girlfriend Summer. He is said to misinterpret the ending, a fact which serves to characterise his naivety concerning relationships. This moment can be considered a turning point in the film, as it reveals to her the issues with their relationship.\n\nThe plot of the 2005 [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]] ''[[Rumor Has It (film)|Rumor Has It]]'' directed by [[Rob Reiner]], and starring [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Mark Ruffalo]] revolves around a story where a woman learns that her mother and grandmother may be the inspiration for ''The Graduate'' and the [[The Graduate (novel)|1963 novel of the same name]] it was based on.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1967 in film]]\n* [[List of American films of 1967]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite web | last=Kashner | first=Sam | title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of The Graduate | website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/03/graduate200803 | date=February 25, 2008 }}\n* Whitehead, J.
