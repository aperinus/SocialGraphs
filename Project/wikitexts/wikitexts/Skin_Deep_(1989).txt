Zach's mistress walks in on him in the process of cheating on her with her attractive [[hairdresser]], followed by his estranged wife Alex discovering his mistress about to shoot him with his revolver. Following the breakup of those relationships, Zach engages in a long period of binge-drinking and solace-seeking with a string of women. He avoids work, continues to strain relations with his ex-wife and drunkenly attends a formal party dressed in a genie's costume.\n\nZach's affairs include one with a volatile woman named Molly who deliberately leaves him hooked up too long to a skin-treatment electro-therapy machine that gives his body quivering spasms from head to toe. He also has a one-night stand with a remarkably muscular female bodybuilder named Lonnie, telling her before sex that he feels \"like Mrs. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" One gag scene is portrayed in total darkness, with Zach wearing a luminous condom as he prepares to have sex with yet another woman he has just met, Amy. When her boyfriend returns to the hotel room similarly equipped, the two men engage in a frantic fight, their glow-in-the-dark attire bouncing crazily across the darkened room.\n\nAfter disrupting his ex-wife's wedding day, it finally dawns on Zach just how out of control his lifestyle has become. He sobers up, abstains from womanizing, and begins to write again. Achieving the trifecta of recovery that Alex predicted he couldn't achieve, he wins back her love.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[John Ritter]] as Zachary \"Zach\" Hutton\n*[[Vincent Gardenia]] as Barney the Barkeeper\n*[[Alyson Reed]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" Hutton\n*[[Joel Brooks]] as Jake Fedderman\n*[[Julianne Phillips]] as Molly\n*[[Chelsea Field]] as Amy McKenna\n*[[Peter Donat]] as Leon \"Sparky\" Sparks\n*[[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as Curt Ames\n*[[Nina Foch]] as Marge, Alex's Mother\n*[[Denise Crosby]] as Angela \"Angie\" Smith\n*[[Michael Kidd]] as Dr. Westford\n*[[Dee Dee Rescher]] as Bernice Fedderman\n*Bryan Genesse as Rick Curry\n*Bo Foxworth as Greg\n*[[Raye Hollitt]] as Lonnie Jones\n*Brenda Swanson as Emily\n*Jean Marie McKee as Rebecca \"Becky\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews.
