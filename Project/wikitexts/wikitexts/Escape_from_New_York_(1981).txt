It stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].\n\nThe film's storyline, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden [[United States]], which has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into the country's sole [[Types of US federal prisons|maximum-security prison]]. [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by anti-government insurgents who deliberately crash it into the walled borough. Ex-soldier and current federal prisoner [[Snake Plissken]] (Russell)<ref>[https://mubi.com/specials/john-carpenter-80s MUBI Special: John Carpenter's 1980s: A Double Bill|MUBI]</ref> is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the [[President of the United States]], after which, if successful, he will be pardoned.\n\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on an estimated budget of $6 million.<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/><ref name=\"Phantom\">{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | pages=M24 | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | date=December 11, 2003}}</ref> [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J. Franco]] served as the producers. The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] in ''Halloween''.\n\nReleased in the United States on July 10, 1981, the film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $25.2 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"thenumbers\"/> The film was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film became a [[cult classic]] and was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a dystopian 1988, amidst [[total war]] against an alliance of [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States government]] has turned [[Manhattan]] into a giant maximum-security prison to deal with a 400% increase in crime. A {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wall surrounds the island, bridges have been [[Land mine|mined]], rivers are patrolled by helicopters and all prisoners unlucky to be alive are sentenced to life terms in Manhattan.\n\nIn 1997 while flying [[President of the United States|President]] John Harker to a peace summit in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by a [[guerrilla]] fighter of the \"National Liberation Front of America\" (named in reference to the \"[[Viet Cong]]\") posing as the stewardess. Unable to regain control, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents attach a tracking device to the President's arm and handcuff him to a briefcase of sensitive documents before putting him in the plane's [[escape pod]]. The aircraft crashes while the pod is ejected.\n\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the [[Duke]] of New York, a powerful [[crime boss]], shows them a severed finger with the President's [[signet ring]] and warns that he will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Meanwhile, former [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces]] soldier Snake Plissken is about to be sent into Manhattan after being convicted of robbing the [[Federal Reserve]]. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake: if he rescues the President in time for the summit, Hauk will arrange a full [[presidential pardon]]. To keep Snake from going rogue, Hauk has him injected with micro-explosives that will sever his [[Common carotid artery|carotid arterie]]s in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\n\nUsing a stealth glider to land atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], Snake follows the President's tracker to a [[vaudeville]] theater only to find it on the wrist of a deluded vagrant. Convinced the President is dead, Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he returns without the President. Inspecting the escape pod, Snake is ambushed by dozens of starving \"Crazies\", and accidentally drops and destroys his radio while trying to flee. He is rescued by \"Cabbie\", a jovial old man who drives an armored taxi.\n\nCabbie takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake's. Brain, a brilliant engineer, has established a small gasoline refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars and tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] by using the President as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's hideout at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Snake finds the President but gets shot in the leg with a [[crossbow]] bolt and overpowered by the Duke's men.\n\nWhile Snake is forced to fight against Duke's champion Slag in a [[deathmatch]], Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag and finds Brain, Maggie and the President at the top of the World Trade Center trying to escape in the glider. The inmates drop it off the roof, so the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie who offers to take them across the bridge. Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the contents of the briefcase: a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] which contains information about [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion]], intended to be an international peace offering. The President demands the tape but Snake claims it.\n\nThe Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized [[Cadillac]], setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake but they hit a mine and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain accidentally stumbles into another mine. A distraught Maggie sacrifices herself to slow down the Duke. Snake and the President reach the containment wall and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens fire with Snake's [[MAC-10]], killing the guards before Snake subdues him. He attempts to shoot Snake as he is being lifted up by the rope but the President takes up a dead guard's rifle, violently guns down the Duke and hoists Snake to safety. Hauk's doctor saves Snake's life with just seconds to spare.\n\nAs the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. Snake then asks how he feels about the people who died saving his life. The President offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice, and Snake walks away in disgust. An impressed Hauk offers him a job as his deputy but Snake just keeps walking. The President's live speech commences and he plays the cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's favorite song, \"[[Bandstand Boogie]]\". As Snake walks away a free man, he tears the [[magnetic tape|magnetic]] strip out of the real tape.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and roles as credited, top billed up to gypsy #x and #x indian --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Snake Plissken|Lieutenant S.D. \"Snake\" Plissken]]\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Police Commissioner Bob Hauk\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as \"Cabbie\"\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as President John Harker\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as \"The Duke\"\n* [[Season Hubley]] as Girl in [[Chock Full o' Nuts]] (Maureen)\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Harold \"Brain\" Hellman\n* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Maggie\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Captain Rehme\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Secretary of State\n* [[Frank Doubleday (actor)|Frank Doubleday]] as Romero\n* John Strobel as Cronenberg, the doctor\n}}\n\nIn addition, frequent Carpenter collaborators [[Nancy Stephens]] appeared as the \"Hijacker\" and [[George Buck Flower|Buck Flower]] appeared as the \"Drunk with the president's tracker\", respectively, while then-active professional wrestler \n[[Ox Baker]] played \"Slag\".

Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the film with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of [[Bruce Lee]], [[The Exterminator]], and [[Darth Vader]], with [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood]]'s vocal-ness.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hogan |first=Richard |title=Kurt Russell Rides a New Wave in ''Escape'' Film |journal=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |year=1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |access-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172535/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |archive-date=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds.

He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the [[eyepatch]] between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his [[depth perception]].<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Kurt Russell&nbsp;\u2014 Two-Fisted Hero |journal=[[Starlog]] |number=108 |date=July 1986 }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nCarpenter had just made ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making ''Escape'' later. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', Avco-Embassy signed producer Debra Hill and him to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was ''[[The Fog]]''. Initially, the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (movie)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight [[action film]]. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\">{{cite journal|last=Swires |first=Steve |title=John Carpenter |journal=[[Starlog]] |date=July 1981 |number=48 }}</ref> He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at [[University of Southern California]], who played \"[[Michael Myers (Halloween)|The Shape]]\" in ''Halloween''.

The film's production designer [[Joe Alves]] and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea \"because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.\"<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\">{{cite news | last = Beeler\n | first = Michael | title = ''Escape from N.Y.'': Filming the Original | publisher = [[Cinefantastique]]\n }}</ref> They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), \"on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,\" producer Debra Hill remembers.<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/>\n\nBernardi suggested [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] because it was filled with old buildings \"that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality\" that the team was looking for.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=From ''Forbidden Planet'' to ''Escape from New York'': A candid conversation with SFX & production designer Joe Alves |journal=[[Starlog]] |number=46 |date=May 1981 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |access-date=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172834/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |archive-date=March 17, 2007 }}</ref> East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous [[St. Louis, Missouri]], had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire.

In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.\"<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/> Also, Alves found an old bridge to serve as the \"69th St. Bridge\". The filmmaker purchased the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge|Old Chain of Rocks Bridge]] for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, \"so that they wouldn't have any liability,\" Hill remembers.<ref name=\"Beeler, Michael\"/> Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] and the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]], both of which have since been renovated,<ref>{{cite news|title=Show Me the movies|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=April 17, 2005|author=Williams, Joe|page=C1}}</ref> as well as the building that would eventually become the [[Saint Louis Brewery#Downtown|Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery]].\n\n===Filming===\nCarpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> The [[gladiatorial]] fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, \"That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in [[Los Angeles]]. Various interior scenes were shot on a [[sound stage]]; the final scenes were shot at the [[Sepulveda Dam]], in [[Sherman Oaks]]. New York served as a location, as did [[Atlanta]], to use their [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|futuristic-looking rapid-transit system]] (the latter scenes were cut from the final film).<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Q&A|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|author=Berger, Jerry|date=February 5, 1995|page=17}}</ref> In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to [[Liberty Island]]. \"We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the [[Statue of Liberty]] at night.

That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England\".<ref name=\"Osborne, Robert\"/> Certain [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]] were rendered by [[James Cameron]], who was at the time a special-effects artist with [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]]. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under [[black light]], with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional [[Wire frame model|wireframe animation]].<ref>{{cite video|title=Escape from New York (Special Edition)|date=2003|people=Atkins, Tom; Barbeau, Adrienne}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19140_8-movie-special-effects-you-wont-believe-arent-cgi.html|title=8 Movie Special Effects You Didn't Know Weren't CGI: Classic|website=Cracked.com|date=April 18, 2011 |access-date=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{main|Escape from New York (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n\n====LaserDisc releases====\n''Escape from New York'' was released on [[LaserDisc]] 10 times between 1983 and 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=LaserDisc Database - Search - Advanced Search|url=https://www.lddb.com/search.php?adv_search=Escape+from+New+York&adv_reference=|website=LaserDisc Database|publisher=LaserDisc Database|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> A 1994 Collector's Edition includes a [[commentary track]] by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell that is still included on more recent DVD releases of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=LaserDisc Database - Escape from New York: Collector's Edition [ID2330SU]|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/05738/ID2330SU/Escape-from-New-York:-Collector's-Edition|website=LaserDisc Database|publisher=LaserDisc Database|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====DVD releases====\n''Escape from New York'' was released on DVD twice by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK).

The novel includes significant scenes that were cut from the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides background on the relationship between Snake and Hauk\u2014presenting the characters as disillusioned war veterans, and deepening the relationship that was only hinted in the film. The novel also explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for [[Leningrad]] in [[World War III]], how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazed son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel gives greater detail on the world in which these characters live, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. It explains that the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is a no-man's land, and the nation's population is gradually being driven insane by nerve gas as a result of World War III. The novel also clarifies that the president's plan for the cassette tape is not benevolent. Rather than presenting to the world a new energy source in the form of nuclear fusion (as claimed in the film), the tape actually reveals the successful development of a \"[[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]-free [[thermonuclear weapon]], which would grant the US supremacy in the global conflict.<ref name=\"McQuay\">{{cite book |last=McQuay |first=Mike |title=Escape from New York |publisher=Bantam Books |date=May 1981 |isbn=0-553-25375-1}}</ref><ref name=\"roberts\">{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=K.E. |title=\"A Little Human Compassion\": John Carpenter's 'Escape from New York' as Anti-Fascist Satire |url=https://wearethemutants.com/2016/09/12/a-little-human-compassion/ |website=wearethemutants.com |publisher=We Are the Mutants |access-date=29 April 2020 |date=12 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite web |last1=Barr |first1=Clayton |title=The Snake Plissken Chronicles |url=http://snake.popapostle.com/html/episodes/Escape-from-New-York.htm |website=popapostle.com |publisher=Pop Apostle |access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Comic books===\n[[Marvel Comics]] released the one-shot ''The Adventures of Snake Plissken'' in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between ''Escape from New York'' and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.'' Snake has robbed [[Atlanta]]'s [[Centers for Disease Control]] of some engineered [[metavirus]]es and is looking for buyers in [[Chicago]]. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, \"Why?\" Snake just walks off, answering, \"I don't need the competition\".\n\nIn 2003, [[CrossGen]] published ''[[John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)|John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles]]'', a four-part [[comic book]] miniseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2168 |title=Snake Strikes Early!

Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double-crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.\n\nIn 2014, [[BOOM!
