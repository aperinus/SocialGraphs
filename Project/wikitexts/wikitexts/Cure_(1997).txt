The story follows a detective investigating a string of gruesome murders where an X is carved into the neck of each victim, and the murderer is found near the victim of each case and remembers nothing of the crime. It is considered a progenitor of the explosion of [[Japanese horror]] media in the late 1990s and early 2000s, preceding other releases like [[Hideo Nakata]]'s ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' and [[Takashi Shimizu]]'s ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/arts-music/article/2122223/flashback-cure-1997-kiyoshi-kurosawas-daring|title=Cure (1997) \u2013 Kiyoshi Kurosawa's daring psychological thriller|date=2017-12-02|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released to strong critical acclaim in Japan and internationally, with critics praising Kurosawa's direction as well as the visuals and atmosphere.<ref name=rotten>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cure_1997|title=Cure (1998)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> In 2012, South Korean film director [[Bong Joon-ho]] listed the film as one of the greatest films of all time, citing it as having had a strong impact on his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/902|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825221053/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/902|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-25|title=Bong Joon-ho - BFI - British Film Institute|publisher=[[Sight & Sound]]|first=Bong|last=Joon-ho|year=2012}}</ref> This is [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] and lead actor [[K\u014dji Yakusho|Yakusho]]'s first collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2018.tiff-jp.net/news/en/?p=14792|title=Kurosawa, Yakusho Discuss the Monsters Within Us [Cure: Q&A]|website=\u6771\u4eac\u56fd\u969b\u6620\u753b\u796d|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nKenichi Takabe ([[K\u014dji Yakusho]]) is a police detective with a mentally unstable wife ([[Anna Nakagawa]]). Takabe investigates a series of bizarre murders in which each victim is killed in the same way, with a large \"X\" carved into their neck, but the perpetrator is different each time. In every case the murderers are caught close to the scene of the crime, and although they readily confess to committing the crimes, they never have a substantial motive and cannot explain what drove them to kill.\n\nTakabe, together with a psychologist named Sakuma ([[Tsuyoshi Ujiki]]), eventually determines that one man is the common thread among the murders, as each person he comes in contact with commits a killing shortly thereafter. The man, called Mamiya ([[Masato Hagiwara]]), appears to have extreme short-term memory loss; he seems constantly confused about what day it is, where he is, and what his name is. He claims to recall nothing of his past. Mamiya constantly counters Takabe's interrogation with evasive questions regarding Takabe's identity. This drives Takabe nearly insane as he gradually loses his initial calmness. The futility of the case starts to affect his psyche as he becomes more and more volatile, exploding into violent fits of anger.\n\nTakabe discovers that Mamiya used to be a student of psychology who researched [[mesmerism]] and [[hypnosis]]. He comes to realize that Mamiya has no memory problems, and is instead a master of hypnosis, capable of planting criminal suggestions in strangers' minds by exposing them to repetitive sounds, the motion of water, or the flame of a lighter.\n\nIn an archive, Sakuma finds a videotape of a mysterious man, speculated to be the originator of Japanese mesmerism, and shows it to Takabe. The man is depicted hypnotizing a woman in the late 1800s. She had been under treatment for [[hysteria]] and was hypnotized by the man who gestured an \"X\" midair. The woman later killed her son in a manner similar to Mamiya's crimes. Sakuma believes the current crimes have a connection to the earlier events, describing Mamiya as a missionary of ceremonial murders. After showing the tape, Sakuma is revealed to have unconsciously drawn an X on his wall, and starts to experience hallucinations of Takabe menacingly cornering him. Several days later, the police discover Sakuma's body in his home, and conclude that he committed suicide. Meanwhile, Mamiya is jailed and charged with incitement to murder.\n\nMamiya finds Takabe fascinating, possibly because he cannot force Takabe to kill. Takabe is tormented by visions of his wife dead, however, and the more he studies Mamiya, the more he feels that he might be losing his mind. The detective grows frustrated with his wife's helplessness and even expresses murderous intent towards her at one point. His wife's strange behavior and concerns about his own mental stability lead him to have her committed to a mental hospital.\n\nWhen Mamiya escapes, killing a policeman and a doctor in the process, Takabe tracks him to a deserted building in the wilderness and shoots him, but not before Mamiya, moments before dying, draws an X in the air with his finger in front of Takabe. Exploring the building, Takabe finds and listens to an old [[phonograph cylinder]] that contains a scratchy recording of a male voice repeating what seem to be cryptic hypnotic instructions.\n\nThe next scene cuts to the mental hospital where Takabe has had his wife committed. A nurse hears a squeaking sound behind her and turns to see Takabe\u2019s wife\u2019s lifeless body in a wheelchair with an \u201cX\u201d carved into her neck.\n\nThe film ends ambiguously at a restaurant where a waitress serves Takabe, then suddenly draws out a knife after speaking to the detective \u2014 suggesting that the phonograph\u2019s hypnotic power continues to spread.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[K\u014dji Yakusho]] as Takabe\n* [[Masato Hagiwara]] as Mamiya\n* [[Tsuyoshi Ujiki]] as Sakuma\n* [[Anna Nakagawa]] as Takabe's wife\n* [[Yoriko D\u014dguchi]] as Dr. Akiko Miyajima\n* [[Yukijir\u014d Hotaru]] as Ichiro Kuwano\n* [[Denden]] as Oida\n* [[Ren Osugi]] as Fujiwara\n* [[Masahiro Toda]] as T\u014dru Hanaoka\n*[[Misayo Haruki]] as Tomoko Hanaoka\n*[[Shum Nakayama|Shun Nakayam]] as Kimura\n*[[Akira Otaka]] as Yasukawa\n*[[Shogo Suzuki (actor, born 1989)|Sh\u00f4go Suzuki]] as Tamura\n*[[Touji Kawahigashi]] as Psychiatrist\n*[[Hajime Tanimoto]] as Takabe no shach\u00f4\n\n==Release==\n''Cure'' was released in 1997.{{sfn|Murguia|2016|p=40}} It was later screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 1999 as part of a career retrospective on Kurosawa.<ref name=\"CrowTIFF\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/cure-v160659|title=Cure (1997)|access-date=2 May 2018|last=Crow|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[AllMovie]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ClarkAllMovie\" /> It received a wider release in the West in 2001.<ref name=\"ClarkAllMovie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/cure-v160659/review|title=Cure (1997)|access-date=2 May 2018|last=Clark|first=Jason|publisher=AllMovie}}</ref> The film was released on home video for the first time in the UK as part of The Masters of Cinema Series on April 23, 2018.<ref>{{Citation|title=Kiyoshi Kurosawa's CURE [Kyua] (Masters of Cinema) New & Exclusive UK HD Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwl9bfy4qKg |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/gwl9bfy4qKg |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Cure'' has a 93% approval rating based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 7.34/10.
