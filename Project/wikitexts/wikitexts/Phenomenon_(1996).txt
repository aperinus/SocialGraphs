The original music score was composed by [[Thomas Newman]].\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge Malley is a kind, average man who works as an auto mechanic in a small town in [[Northern California]]. \nIt's clear George has a crush on a single mother in town, Lace. He lets her sell her handmade chairs at his shop, but he secretly buys them and keeps them at his house. She's very closed off and rebuffs George's advances.\n\nAfter celebrating his 37th birthday at a local bar with his best friend, Nate, and father figure, Doc Brunder, he goes outside to see some guests off, and notices a ball of shining bright white lights in the sky. It grows closer and appears to hit him, making a loud sound and knocking him down. When he comes to and re-enters the bar, he learns that nobody else saw the lights, nor did they hear the sound. Doc notices something is amiss when George quickly achieves a checkmate in their chess game.\n\nGeorge begins to exhibit remarkable levels of intelligence. He easily absorbs vast amounts of information, formulates new, revolutionary ideas, as well as developing [[telekinesis]]. Not needing sleep, he spends each night reading multiple books.\n\nGeorge tries to use his new intelligence [[altruism|for the good of his community]]. He develops a new powerful fertilizer. He improves solar panel designs. He correctly predicts an earthquake without any equipment. When Doc is called to aid a sick Portuguese man, George learns the language in minutes and helps translate. He then uses his telekinesis to rescue the man's young relative. George also sets a plan in place to help Nate get together with the mother of the Portuguese boy he rescued.\n\nHis friend Nate has a shortwave radio hobby. One day while visiting him, George decodes and responds to a signal, though Nate asks him to forget about it out of fear that they might be picking up information from a nearby air force base.\n\nDuring this time of upheaval, the townsfolk become wary, but George finds support from Doc, Nate and from a growing relationship with Lace, and her children, Al and Glory.\n\nGeorge invites Lace to join him on a trip to [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] to meet with [[seismologist]] Professor Ringold about George's earthquake prediction. But before he can go, the FBI takes George and Nate into custody over his code-breaking. He breaks more codes, then astounds Dr. Nierdof by easily answering a series of difficult quizzes and exams, and shows him his telekinesis. When George threatens to talk to the press, he is finally released. However the FBI instructs Dr. Ringold not to let George meet with anyone at Berkeley.\n\nReturning to the local bar, George becomes frustrated with friends' questions about his abilities, and he causes a large mirror to break via telekinesis. Al admits to Lace that he bought a piece of the mirror at school where it's all being sold.\n\nLace visits him to provide a shave and a haircut. Their innocent intimacy scares her since she has tried so hard to not like him, but it encourages him to stop avoiding the townsfolk. He goes to the county fair to ease fear with a demonstration of his powers, but the crowd goes into a frenzy, demanding his attention and his perceived healing powers. George is knocked to the ground, where he again sees the flashing balls of light before losing consciousness.\n\nGeorge awakens in a hospital. With Lace and Nate there for support, Doc explains that George has a deadly [[astrocytoma|brain tumor]]. This has caused the lights and stimulated George's phenomenal brain functions. They have called Dr. Wellin, a leading brain surgeon, to see if an operation can save George's life. Dr. Wellin later determines there is only a 1 in 500 chance of survival but wants to proceed with an invasive operation solely to do research on George's living brain. When George refuses, saying he still has work to do, the doctor has him declared mentally unfit and held against his will.\n\nGeorge escapes from the hospital and returns home. He spends time with Nate, then goes to Lace's to spend time with her and her children. The FBI agent shows up, but Lace persuades him to let George die in peace. George and Lace share a romantic and intimate time, but he informs her that he is about to die and she cries as she holds him.\n\nProfessor Ringold arrives at Lace's house, only to learn that he is too late. Lace gives him George's research materials, so he can finish George's breakthrough work.\n\nA year later, George's friends are gathered for what would have been his 38th birthday. Nate, now fluent in Portuguese, is married to a visibly pregnant Ella. Other signs of George's phenomenal impact on the town and its people are seen all around.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as George Malley\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Lace Pennamin\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Nate Pope\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Doc Brunder\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Prof. John Ringold\n* [[Richard Kiley]] as Dr. Wellin\n* [[David Gallagher]] as Al Pennamin\n* [[Ashley Buccille]] as Glory Pennamin\n* [[Brent Spiner]] as Dr. Bob Nierdof\n* Elisabeth Nunziato as Ella\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed more than $16,000,000 on its opening weekend, debuting in third position and later climbing up to second.
