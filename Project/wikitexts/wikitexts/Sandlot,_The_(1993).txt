He tries to join a group of boys who play baseball daily in a local [[Sandlot ball|sandlot]], but is embarrassed by his inability to catch or throw the ball. An attempt to learn to play catch with his stepfather, Bill, results in a [[black eye]]. Nevertheless, he is invited to join the team by their leader and best player, Benny Rodriguez, who teaches him the basic skills needed to play the game. He is able to learn to quickly and earns everyone's respect.\n\nWhen catcher Hamilton \"Ham\" Porter hits a [[home run]] into an adjacent [[backyard]], Smalls attempts to retrieve the ball but is stopped by the other boys, who tell him of \"the Beast\", a large and highly territorial [[English Mastiff]] which the boys' imaginations have transformed into a kid-eating \"giant gorilla-dog thing\". Many baseballs hit into the yard over the years have all been claimed by the Beast, which is kept chained up by its owner, Mr. Mertle.\n\nOne particularly hot day, the boys visit the community [[Swimming pool|pool]]. Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous has a crush on [[lifeguard]], Wendy Peffercorn, and fakes [[drowning]] in order to get her to administer [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]], then [[kiss|kisses]] her. Wendy kicks the sandlot team out of the pool. While Squints realizes what he did was wrong and made Wendy visibly angry, he is elated when Wendy smiles and waves at him as he leaves. On Independence Day, the team plays a night game by the light of the [[fireworks]], and Smalls observes that although to the rest of them baseball is just a game, \"to Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez, baseball was life.\" Later, they are challenged to play against a local [[Little League Baseball|Little League]] team, whom they handily defeat. To celebrate, they visit a fair, where they try [[chewing tobacco]] obtained by Bertram Grover Weeks, then ride the [[Wipeout (ride)|Trabant]]; the combination causes them to fall ill and vomit all over themselves and others.\n\nOne day, Benny hits the team's only baseball so hard that he knocks the cover off. With Bill away on business in [[Chicago]], Smalls borrows from his trophy room a baseball which was autographed by legendary player [[Babe Ruth]]. Being ignorant of baseball history, Smalls does not realize the ball's value, and hits his first home run, sending it into the Beast's yard. When the other boys learn of the autograph, they educate Smalls about Babe Ruth and make several attempts to get the ball out of the yard by using makeshift retrieval devices, with each one becoming more advanced than the last, but each is destroyed by the Beast. That night, Benny has a dream in which the spirit of Babe Ruth advises Benny to retrieve the ball himself. \"Heroes get remembered,\" says the Babe, \"but legends never die. Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.\"\n \nThe next day Benny, wearing a pair of new [[PF Flyers]], goes over the fence and \"[[Rundown|pickles]]\" the Beast to retrieve the ball, but the dog breaks its chain and leaps over the fence in pursuit. It chases Benny through town, leaving a trail of destruction, and eventually they end up back at the sandlot. Benny jumps back into Mr. Mertle's yard, but the Beast crashes through the fence, which falls down on top of it. Smalls and Benny lift the fence to free the dog, who shows gratitude by thoroughly licking Smalls' face and leading them to its stash of baseballs. They meet Mr. Mertle, who turns out to have been a baseball player and good friend of Babe Ruth (whom he refers to by his given name, George), but who lost his sight after being [[Hit by pitch|struck]] in the head by a fast ball. He kindly trades them the chewed-up ball for one autographed by all of the [[1927 New York Yankees season|1927 New York Yankees]] (known as [[Murderers' Row]]), and asks them to visit every week to talk baseball with him.\n\nSmalls gives this ball to Bill, and their father-son relationship improves, though Bill does ground Smalls for a week for taking his autographed baseball without his permission. The boys continue to play baseball on the sandlot, with the Beast \u2013 whose real name is Hercules \u2013 as their mascot.\n\nOver the next few years, the sandlot kids go their separate ways. Only three go on to careers related to pro baseball: Kenny DeNunez, the [[pitcher]], plays [[Triple-A (baseball)|triple-A baseball]] for a time, but never gets to the Major Leagues, so he now owns a business and coaches a Little League team his own sons play on;  Benny's exploit with the Beast earns him the nickname \"the Jet\", and he goes on to play for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]; and since Smalls becomes a [[sports commentator]] covering the Dodgers' games, they are able to maintain their friendship into adulthood. The movie then moves to the present day with the now adult Smalls doing the play-by-play for a Dodgers game where Rodriguez has come in as a [[pinch runner]] at [[Baseball field#Third base|third base]] in the ninth inning, and promptly steals [[Baseball field#Home base|home]] to win the game. The movie ends with the celebrating Rodriguez on the ballfield and Smalls in the [[press box]] giving each other the same [[Thumb signal|thumbs-up]] sign that they had used since childhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as Scott \"Scotty\" Smalls\n* [[David Mickey Evans]] as adult Scott Smalls (narrator, voice-only)\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as adult Scott Smalls (live action, uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metsmerizedonline.com/2018/07/mmo-exclusive-director-writer-and-narrator-of-the-sandlot-david-mickey-evans.html/ |title=MMO Exclusive: Director, Writer and Narrator of \"The Sandlot,\" David Mickey Evans &#124; Metsmerized Online |date=July 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n* [[Mike Vitar]] as Benjamin \"Benny\" Franklin Rodriguez\n* Pablo Vitar as adult Benny \"The Jet\" Rodriguez\n* [[Patrick Renna]] as Hamilton \"Ham\" Porter\n* [[Chauncey Leopardi]] as Michael \"Squints\" Palledorous\n* Marty York as Alan \"Yeah-Yeah\" McClennan\n* [[Brandon Adams (actor)|Brandon Quintin Adams]] as Kenny DeNunez\n* Grant Gelt as Bertram Grover Weeks\n* Victor DiMattia as Timmy Timmons\n* Shane Obedzinski as Tommy \"Repeat\" Timmons\n* [[Karen Allen]] as Mrs. Smalls\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Bill\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Mr. Mertle\n* [[Marley Shelton]] (credited as Marlee Shelton) as Wendy Peffercorn\n* [[Art LaFleur]] as [[Babe Ruth|The Babe]]\n* [[Wil Horneff]] as Phillips\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10.
