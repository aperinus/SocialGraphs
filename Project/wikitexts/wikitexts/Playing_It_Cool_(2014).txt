The film stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Patrick Warburton]], [[Ioan Gruffudd]], and [[Topher Grace]]. The film was released on [[video on demand]] on March 31, 2015 before a [[limited release]] on May 8, 2015 by [[Vertical Entertainment]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/PlayingItCoolTheMovie {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref> It received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nMe [[Chris Evans (actor)|(Chris Evans)]] is a screenwriter in LA who wants to write action flicks, but his agent, Bryan ([[Anthony Mackie]]), needs him to write a [[romcom]] first. Due to mother abandonment issues from his childhood, he doesn't let love in or believe in it, so finds writing about romance difficult. Having writer\u2019s block, he talks to people, hearing their anectdotes. Then he places himself in those stories in his mind.\n\nHis buddy Scott ([[Topher Grace]]) is obsessed with romantic books and movies. He\u2019s had a crush for ages on a regular client at the bookshop. He is tortured, hoping the feelings could be reciprocated. \n\u2018He\u2019 wants to show love as it is in his perspective, not funny nor romantic. Every time anyone has told him they love him, he says he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to reciprocate. So, he constantly hooks up and then says he doesn\u2019t see a future with them\n\nThen he meets Her ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) at a charity event with Scott, bantering together with ease. Doing a social experiment at the event (her idea), they each use clich\u00e9 bad lines of the opposite sex, flirting badly with the other attendees to put them off. He finds himself really drawn to her, but suddenly they meet her boyfriend \u2018Stuffy\u2019 (Ione Gruffudd), and she gets whisked away. When he tries to get her out of his head by hooking up quickly with anyone else, for the first time it doesn\u2019t work. He goes back to the venue to see if he can get her name, but there is no one left to ask. Desperate, he grabs the guest book to try and find her name.\n\nHis misfit group of friends are all writers: Lyle (Martin Starr) prolific yet still unpublished, Samson (Luke Wilson) a married graphic novelist, Mallory (Aubrey Plaza) writes and performs one woman shows she makes them attend and of course Scott. Meeting up at the shooting range, he tells them he is trying to find Her. Most are cynical about marriage and love, so Scott is the supportive one.\n\nEverywhere he goes now he sees other seemingly misfits, paired off. When he goes to see his granddad (Philip Baker Hall), he tells him he must \u2018Columbo\u2019 it (research Her like a p.i.) The plan becomes, going the rounds of charity events, hopefully to run into her. He coincides with Dick ([[Patrick Warburton]]) at a Save the Oceans benefit, who then forces him to get up and speak (as on a former occasion, he made up several charities he was involved in). She actually is there, so they reconnect, and he gets her to agree to a \u2018friend date\u2019. Afterwards, when he gives her a lift home, she mentions a charity event on Thursday.\n\nAt bowling the next day, his friends are unsupportive. Mallory is hostile, only Scott is rooting for love. When he shows up, she instead invited him to her yoga class. Afterwards, they are chatting in a caf\u00e9, and he asks her about \u2018Stuffy.\u2019 She describes him as stable, safe and liked by her family and friends. Her dream wedding is at one of the heart sculptures in San Francisco. And he finally confesses that he \u2018likes\u2019 her, which she says won\u2019t change her plan.\n\nAt home, he takes out his shoebox, looking at the goodbye postit note his mother had left him. At handball the next day his granddad and Scott convince him not to give up on Her. That evening, he convinces her to go out, she talks about her dad\u2019s suicide when she was young, and they kiss.\n\nShe calls him up because she can\u2019t get him out of her head, and before long, they end up in bed together. For the first time, he doesn\u2019t feel guilty, and he can eat the cereal he couldn\u2019t for years. She, on the other hand, leaves feeling badly. She calls again, everything is going well, until his dishonesty about the charities surfaces and she stomps away. Mallory finally confesses she loves him when he asks her for help. The next morning, She wakes him with a call, only to confess she is already engaged.\n\nA night of binging, followed by making a fool of himself at her apartment and his granddad dying, gets him back on track. His [[writer's block]] melts away and the rom-com gets done. Scott finally gets a date with that guy, Mallory gives the \u2018friend\u2019 a chance. He realizes he has to try to stop the wedding. A flight, clich\u00e9 run through an airport and a taxi ride, checking all of the heart sculptures later, he finds Her\n\nThe ending message: Love isn\u2019t a thinking thing, it\u2019s a feeling thing. Live your own story.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Me<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Her<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Mallory<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as Stuffy<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Bryan<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Scott<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Dick \n* [[Martin Starr]] as Lyle<ref name=HWR />\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Samson<ref name=ScreenRant />\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Granddad<ref name=IndieWire>{{cite web|author1=Kevin Jagernauth|title=First Trailer For Rom-Com 'Playing It Cool' With Chris Evans, Michelle Monaghan, Aubrey Plaza & More|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-first-trailer-for-rom-com-playing-it-cool-with-chris-evans-michelle-monaghan-aubrey-plaza-more-20140912|publisher=Indie Wire|access-date=23 September 2014|date=12 September 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Ashley Tisdale]] as Herself\n* [[Matthew Morrison]] as Himself\n* [[Scott Evans (actor)|Scott Evans]] as Blissful Boy\n* [[Sarah Dumont]] as Cute Girl\n* [[Jaeden Martell]] as 6 Year Old Me\n* Carmina Garay as 6 Year Old Her\n* [[Tony Cavalero]] as Charity Waiter\n* [[Kyle Mooney]] as Other Dude\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Lyle's Girlfriend\n* [[Mikaela Hoover]] as Lacey\n* [[Abby Ryder Fortson]] as Little girl\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe script for the film was originally titled ''A Many Splintered Thing'' and was first on [[The Black List (survey)|The Black List]] and was a 2011 finalist for the [[Nicholl Fellowship]].<ref name=HWR>{{cite web|author1=Ryan Gajewski|title=Chris Evans Has Complicated Feelings for Michelle Monaghan in 'Playing It Cool' Trailer|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-evans-has-complicated-feelings-732696|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=23 September 2014|date=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film began filming in late 2012 in [[Los Angeles]] and completed in early 2013.
