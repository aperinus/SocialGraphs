One of the magazine's writers, Jeff Schwensen, proposes to investigate a newspaper [[Classified advertising|classified ad]] that reads:<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowe|first=Rachel|title=Movie Trailer: \"Safety Not Guaranteed\"|url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/1097/movie-trailer-safety-not-guaranteed/|work=EntertainmentTell|publisher=www.technologytell.com|access-date=May 7, 2012}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me.

SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED.}}\n\nJeff's boss Bridget approves of his story idea and Jeff selects his team: Darius and Arnau, a studious UW student interning at the magazine to diversify his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for [[medical school]] applications. They travel to the seaside community of Ocean View to find and profile the person who wrote the ad. Jeff's ulterior motive for this out of town assignment is to track down his long-lost love interest who lives in town.\n\nDarius discovers the ad was placed by Kenneth Calloway, a stock clerk at a local grocery store. Jeff's attempt to approach Kenneth alienates him, so Jeff orders Darius to make contact. Darius' disaffected attitude serves her well, and she quickly endears herself to Kenneth as she poses as a candidate to accompany him on his mission. While Kenneth is paranoid and believes secret agents are tracking his every move, Darius gains his trust as she participates in a series of training exercises in the woods around his house and she begins to develop feelings for him. She tells Kenneth about losing her mother when she was young and her mission is to prevent her mother's death. Kenneth says his mission is to go back to 2001 and prevent the death of his old girlfriend, Belinda, who was killed when someone drove a car into her house.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff tracks down Liz, a fling from his teenage years. Although she is not as attractive as he recalls, they reconnect and sleep together. He asks her to come back with him to Seattle, but she believes this is just another fling for him, so she refuses. Upset by her rejection, Jeff takes Arnau out on the town and they pick up some young women. Jeff tells Arnau to not waste his youth and convinces him to spend the night with one of the women.\n\nThe next morning, Jeff receives a phone call from Bridget, who has been following up the team's notes on the story. She informs Jeff that Belinda is still alive and lives an hour away from where they are. During an interview, Darius learns Belinda was only friends with Kenneth and Kenneth actually was the one who drove into her then-boyfriend's house, yet no one was injured. After the interview, Darius is questioned by two government agents who have been following Kenneth and believe that he may be a spy because of his communication with government scientists. They know Kenneth has been breaking into labs and stealing equipment.\n\nDarius returns to Kenneth's house to confront him, but Kenneth rationalizes Belinda is now alive because his time travel mission succeeded. Jeff runs in to warn them that the government agents are also on the property. Kenneth panics and runs into the woods. Darius follows Kenneth, who has boarded his time machine, which has been integrated into a small boat on the lake. Darius apologizes for lying to Kenneth, tells him everything else they shared was real, and joins him on the boat. Kenneth tells Darius that his mission is now only to go back for her. Jeff, Arnau, and the agents watch as Kenneth and Darius activate the time machine and vanish. A filmed interview, presumably from earlier, shows Kenneth explaining why he chose to enlist a partner for his time travels.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Darius Britt\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Kenneth Calloway\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Jeff Schwensen\n* [[Karan Soni]] as Arnau\n* Jenica Bergere as Liz\n* [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Bridget\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Belinda\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Darius's father\n* [[William Hall Jr.]] as Shannon\n\n==Production==\nIn the September/October 1997 issue of ''Backwoods Home'', Senior Editor John Silveira wrote a joke ad as filler for the magazine's classified ad section:\n{{blockquote|Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me.

However, the \"Safety Not Guaranteed\" ad became a cultural phenomenon. The address received thousands of letters in response to the time travel ad. The ad was featured on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and discussed repeatedly on the ''[[Car Talk]]'' radio series.<ref name=Silveira125/>\n\nConolly came across references to the ad in 2007, and initially assumed it was genuine: \u201cThere was something really sad about it all. What if he is really lamenting something from his past that he wants to go back and fix. That\u2019s what drew my attention.\u201d Conolly wrote a first draft of the script as a [[buddy comedy]] but later  re-wrote the lead role with Plaza in mind, after seeing her performance in ''[[Funny People]]''. Wanting to gain permission of the ad's writer to adapt the concept into a film, Conolly eventually tracked down Silviera who gave his blessing.<ref>{{cite web | title=About the Production | website=Safety Not Guaranteed | date=Dec 28, 2016 | url=https://safetynotguaranteedmovie.com/about-the-production/}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Seattle]] and [[Ocean Shores, Washington]], and other locations within 30 miles of Seattle.
