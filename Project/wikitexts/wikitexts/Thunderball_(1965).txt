It is an adaptation of the 1961 novel [[Thunderball (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]], which in turn was based on an original screenplay by [[Jack Whittingham]] devised from a story conceived by [[Kevin McClory]], Whittingham, and Fleming. It was the third and final Bond film to be directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], with its screenplay by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[John Hopkins (screenwriter)|John Hopkins]].\n\nThe film follows Bond's mission to find two [[NATO]] atomic bombs stolen by [[SPECTRE]], which holds the world for ransom of \u00a3100 million in diamonds under its threat to destroy an unspecified metropolis in either the United Kingdom or the United States (later revealed to be [[Miami]]). The search leads Bond to the [[Bahamas]], where he encounters [[Emilio Largo]], the card-playing, [[eyepatch]]-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]] and Largo's mistress, [[Domino Vitali|Domino Derval]], Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen. The film's complex production comprised four different [[second unit|units]] and about a quarter of the film comprises underwater scenes.<ref name=\"making of\" /> ''Thunderball'' was the first Bond film shot in [[widescreen]] [[Panavision]] and the first to have a running time of over two hours.\n\nAlthough planned by Bond film series producers [[Albert R.

To facilitate Largo's plans, SPECTRE operative Count Lippe recruits Angelo Palazzi to oversee the theft of the bombs.  With help from SPECTRE agent [[Fiona Volpe]], Lippe has Palazzi [[plastic surgery|surgically alter]] his face to match that of [[French Air Force]] pilot Fran\u00e7ois Derval, who is assisting in the exercise. Volpe and Palazzi murder the real Derval, while they are staying at the Shrublands health resort, only for the latter to demand more money. Volpe acquiesces, merely to have him continue with their operation. Following the plan, Palazzi successfully hijacks the bomber, killing its crew, and lands it in shallow waters within the [[Bahamas]]. While the bombs are recovered by his men, Largo murders Palazzi for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.\n\nBritish secret agent James Bond, recuperating at Shrublands after a previous assignment, notices Lippe's presence and keeps him under observation, discovering Derval's body. Upon being urgently recalled to London, Bond finds himself targeted by Lippe for trying to interfere. Before he can defend himself, Volpe kills Lippe for jeopardizing Largo's scheme. Once back in London, Bond learns that all 00 agents are being put on high alert following the theft of the bombs, after being informed a major city in the [[United States]] or the [[United Kingdom]] will be destroyed unless \u00a3100 million is paid to SPECTRE within seven days. While in talks with M on his assignment, Bond requests he be assigned to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to contact Derval's sister [[Domino Vitali|Domino]], after recognising Derval from the photo given to the agents in their main briefing as the body he found at the resort.\n\nBond meets with Domino, who he learns is the mistress of Largo when he visits a local casino. Both men recognise each other as adversaries and engage in a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Following their initial meeting, Bond meets with his friend, CIA agent [[Felix Leiter]], fellow agent Paula Caplan, and MI6 quartermaster [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], to receive equipment to help with finding the bombs, including an underwater infrared camera and miniature underwater breathing apparatus. Investigating Largo's ship, ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Disco Volante]]'', he notices an underwater hatch beneath her that intrigues him. The next day, he visits Largo at his estate during the night, only to find that Paula had been abducted and committed suicide before she could talk. Forced to escape, Bond evades Largo's men during a [[Junkanoo]] celebration. Volpe catches up to Bond, but is accidentally shot by a henchman aiming for Bond.\n\nSuspecting the bombs were brought to the area, Bond and Leiter search for the Vulcan and find it camouflaged underwater, along with the body of Palazzi. Upon returning to the island, Bond reveals to Domino that her brother was killed by Largo and gets her to help him search ''Disco Volante''. However, Largo catches her in the act and has her imprisoned. Meanwhile, Bond replaces one of Largo's men as SPECTRE prepares to move the bombs, and manages to learn where one of them is being moved to before being discovered and left behind. Reuniting with Leiter, the pair gets the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] to intercept ''Disco Volante'' crew and recover one of the bombs in an underwater battle. Bond pursues Largo and grabs hold of ''Disco Volante'' as she sheds the rear half to become a [[hydrofoil]] to escape. Bond gets on deck and sends the ''Disco Volante'' out of control whilst he defeats Largo's men and fights Largo. Largo gets the upper hand and is about to shoot Bond when Domino kills Largo in revenge after his hired nuclear physicist frees her. The trio quickly flees ''Disco Volante'' just barely before her destruction, whereupon Bond and Domino are retrieved by a plane with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|Fulton system]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent assigned to retrieve two stolen nuclear weapons\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Claudine Auger]] as [[Domino (James Bond)|Domino]] (voice dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkivanderzyl.co.uk/bond/|title=Film Industry Tricks OR How to fool most of the people most of the time!|publisher=Official Nikki van der Zyl website|author=George A.

In 1961, Ian Fleming published his novel based upon a television screenplay that he and others developed into the film screenplay; the efforts were unproductive, and Fleming expanded the script into his ninth James Bond novel. Consequently, one of his collaborators, Kevin McClory, sued him for plagiarism; they settled out of court in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/bondvsony.shtml|title=The Battle for Bond: Sony vs. MGM|date=20 February 1997|access-date=15 January 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203914/http://www.ianfleming.org/007news/articles/bondvsony.shtml |archive-date = 27 September 2007}}</ref>\n -->\nLater, in 1964, Eon producers Broccoli and Saltzman agreed with McClory to cinematically adapt the novel; it was promoted as \"Ian Fleming's ''Thunderball''\". Yet, along with the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|official credits]] to screenwriters [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[John Hopkins (screenwriter)|John Hopkins]], the screenplay is also identified as 'based on an original screenplay by [[Jack Whittingham]]' and as 'based on the original story by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham, and Ian Fleming'.<ref name=\"mkbb\" /> To date, the novel has twice been adapted cinematically; the 1983 [[Jack Schwartzman]]-produced ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' features Sean Connery as James Bond, but is not an Eon production.\n\n===Casting===\nBroccoli's original choice for the role of Domino Derval was [[Julie Christie]] following her performance in ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' in 1963. Upon meeting her personally, he was disappointed and turned his attentions towards [[Raquel Welch]] after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of [[Life magazine|''Life'']].

Eventually, former [[Miss France]] [[Claudine Auger]] was cast, and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian, although her lines were dubbed in the final cut by [[Nikki van der Zyl]], who had voiced several previous Bond girls. Nevertheless, director Young cast her once again in his next film, ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966). One of the actresses who tried for Domino, [[Luciana Paluzzi]], later accepted the role as the redheaded ''femme fatale'' assassin Fiona Kelly, who originally was intended by Maibaum to be Irish.

Years later, Young said ''Thunderball'' was filmed \"at the right time\",<ref name=\"TerenceYoung\"/> considering that if it was the first film in the series, the low budget (''Dr. No'' cost only $1 million) would not have yielded good results.<ref name=\"TerenceYoung\">{{cite AV media |people = [[Terence Young (director)|Young, Terence]] |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 4 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment}}</ref> ''Thunderball'' was the final James Bond film directed by Young.\n\nFilming commenced on 16 February 1965, with principal photography of the opening scene in Paris.

The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack.<ref name=\"ttp\"/> Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',\n\n<blockquote>We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in ''Thunderball'' was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the ''Disco Volante'', was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water.<ref>{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features |date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location= London |access-date= 10 March 2016 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160310085950/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features |archive-date= 10 March 2016 |df= dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen special-effects coordinator [[John Stears]] provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of \u00a3250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.<ref name=\"mi6\" />\n\nThe climactic underwater battle was shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert [[Ricou Browning]], who had worked on ''[[Creature From the Black Lagoon]]'' in 1954 and other films. He was responsible for the staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath ''Disco Volante'' and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught.
