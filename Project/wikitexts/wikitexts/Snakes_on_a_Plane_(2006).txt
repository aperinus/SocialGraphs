Jackson]]. It was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on August 18, 2006, in North America. The film was written by [[David Dalessandro]], John Heffernan, and [[Sebastian Gutierrez]] and follows the events of dozens of venomous snakes being released on a passenger plane in an attempt to kill a trial witness.\n\nThe film gained a considerable amount of attention before its release, forming large [[fanbase]]s online and becoming an [[Internet phenomenon]], due to the film's title, casting, and premise. In response to the Internet fan base, [[New Line Cinema]] incorporated feedback from online users into its [[Film production|production]], and added five days of reshooting. Before and after the film was released, it was parodied and alluded to on television shows and films, fan-made videos, [[video games]], and various forms of [[fan fiction|literature]].\n\nReleased in the United States and [[United Kingdom]] on August 18, 2006, the film received mixed reviews and was a \"box office disappointment\".<ref name=\"NYT-letdown\"/><ref name=\"EW-nobite\" /> Despite the immense [[Media circus|Internet buzz]], the film's [[gross revenue]] did not live up to expectations; it earned [[United States dollar|US$]]15.25 million in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"NYT-letdown\">{{cite news|last=Waxman|first=Sharon|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/movies/21box.html |title=After Hype Online, \"Snakes on a Plane\" Is Letdown at Box Office|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 21, 2006|access-date=May 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"EW-nobite\">{{cite magazine|last=Rich|first=Joshua|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1229136,00.html|title=Oh Sssssnap!

Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). To ensure the snakes indiscriminately attack everybody without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' [[Lei (garland)|lei]]s with a special [[pheromone]] which makes the snakes highly aggressive.\n\nThe crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin, with a viper attacking an electric panel in the process, thus shutting down the power. A couple having sex in a bathroom and a man using another bathroom are the first people killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates the power outage and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the [[Viperidae|viper]] that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snakes, believes Sam has suffered a [[heart attack]] and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing most of the snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin.\n\nThe surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a [[Airline service trolley|food trolley]] to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable [[life raft]]. Flynn and flight attendant Claire regain control of the plane while Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with [[Ophiology|ophiologist]] Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases.\n\nBased on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, a tactical interrogation occurs wherein the dealer is injured by a snakebite. With Harris withholding the antivenom, the dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane and make them aggressive. Price injects the injured dealer with the antivenom and commandeers his supply of antivenom for the victims on the plane based on the list given to him.  Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested and tried on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder, with the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] as an option.\n\nHarris contacts Flynn, telling him that antivenom will be ready for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on experience playing a flight simulator. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to [[Uncontrolled decompression|depressurize]]. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Despite his lack of real-world experience, Troy makes an emergency landing and the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers exit the plane and antivenom is given to those who need it.\n\nJust as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark, a remaining snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed, but traumatised, due to a [[ballistic vest]] he wore throughout the ordeal after his rescue from Kim's henchmen. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to [[Bali]] and teaches him how to surf.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Below are listed in the order of the opening credits. -->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Samuel L.
