The film stars [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], [[Hugo Weaving]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]].\n\nThe film was released simultaneously in 108 territories on November 5, 2003, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. While being the final entry in the original trilogy of the series, the ''Matrix'' storyline was continued in ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' video game. It was the first live-action feature film to be released in both regular and [[IMAX]] theaters at the same time. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $427.3 million worldwide. A fourth film, titled ''[[The Matrix Resurrections]]'', began production in February 2020, and was released on December 22, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILM PLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS.-->\nPicking up immediately where ''Reloaded'' ended, [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] still lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship ''Hammer''. Inside the Matrix, Neo is trapped in a [[subway station]] named Mobil Ave, a [[limbo|transition zone]] between the Matrix and the machine world. He meets a \"family\" of programs, including a girl named Sati. The \"father\" tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, a program loyal to the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.\n\n[[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] contacts [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] on behalf of the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter [[Club Hel]], where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that [[Agent Smith|Smith]] intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She tells him that \"everything that has a beginning has an end.\" After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati and Seraph. The Oracle does not resist assimilation and Smith gains her powers of [[precognition]].\n\nIn the real world, the crews of the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' and the ''Hammer'' find and reactivate [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe's]] ship, the ''Logos''. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her [[Enter the Matrix|encounter with the Oracle]], Niobe offers him the ''Logos''. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the ''Logos'', takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane burns Neo's eyes with a power cable, blinding him. Neo discovers that he can still \"see\" machine source code in the real world and uses this ability to kill Bane. Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.\n\nNiobe and Morpheus rush toward Zion in the ''Hammer'' to aid the human defenses. Zion's shipyard is overwhelmed by a horde of Sentinels, and the fatally wounded [[Captain Mifune]] instructs [[List of Matrix series characters#Kid|Kid]] to open the gate for the ''Hammer'', which he does with the aid of [[List of Matrix series characters#Zee|Zee]]. When it arrives, it discharges its [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], disabling all the Sentinels present but also Zion's remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking it will be their last stand.\n\nThe ''Logos'' is attacked by a wave of machines outside of the Machine City. To avoid the onslaught, they fly above them to open sky, and then crash into a building, fatally wounding Trinity. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters the leadership of the machines in the form of the \"[[Deus Ex Machina]].\" Neo warns that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world and offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The Deus Ex Machina agrees, and the Sentinels shut down, stopping the attack on Zion.\n\nThe Machines plug Neo into the Matrix, whose population has now been entirely assimilated by Smith. The Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, telling Neo that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted fight, Neo appears to concede defeat and allows himself to be assimilated. Outside the Matrix, the machines send a surge of energy into Neo's body, which inside the Matrix causes the Neo-Smith clone, then all the other Smith clones to be destroyed, leaving the Oracle lying there, and causing Neo's life to be sacrificed. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo's body is carried away by the machines.\n\nThe Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect meets the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last \"as long as it can\" and that those humans who desire it will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. The Oracle tells Sati (who created a beautiful sunset for Neo) that she thinks they will see Neo again. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen. She replies that she did not know, but she believed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith|Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as the Merovingian\n* [[Mary Alice]]{{efn|[[Gloria Foster]], who played the Oracle in the first two films, died before the completion of her filming for the third.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/theater/gloria-foster-stage-actress-is-dead-at-64.html|title=Gloria Foster, Stage Actress, Is Dead at 64|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 5, 2001|access-date=January 26, 2015}}</ref> She was replaced by [[Mary Alice]].

Aside from [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]]' score, again collaborating with [[Juno Reactor]], only one external track (by [[Pale 3]]) is used. Although Davis rarely focuses on strong melodies, familiar [[leitmotif]]s from earlier in the series reappear. For example, Neo and Trinity's love theme\u2014which briefly surfaces in the two preceding films\u2014is finally fully expanded into \"Trinity Definitely\"; the theme from the Zion docks in ''Reloaded'' returns as \"Men in Metal\", and the energetic drumming from the ''Reloaded'' tea house fight between Neo and Seraph opens \"Tetsujin\", as Seraph, Trinity and Morpheus fight off Club Hel's three doormen. The climactic battle theme, named \"Neod\u00e4mmerung\" (in reference to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]''), features a choir singing extracts ([[shlokas]]) from the [[Pavamana Mantra]], introduced in the [[Upanishad]]s. The chorus can be roughly translated from [[Sanskrit]] as follows: \"lead us from untruth to truth, lead us from darkness to light, lead us from death to immortality, peace peace peace\". The extracts were brought to Davis by the Wachowskis when he informed them that it would be wasteful for such a large choir to be singing simple \"ooh\"s and \"aah\"s (according to the DVD commentary, Davis felt that the dramatic impact of the piece would be lost if the choir was to sing 'This is the one, see what he can do' in plain English). These extracts return in the film's denouement, and in ''Navras'', the track that plays over the closing credits (which may be considered a loose [[remix]] of \"Neod\u00e4mmerung\").\n\n==Release==\n''The Matrix Revolutions'' was released in theaters roughly three weeks after ''The Matrix Reloaded'' arrived on DVD, October 14, 2003.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Kipnis|first=Jill|date=March 1, 2003|title=Blockbuster sales ensure DVD's sales saga|pages=1, 66|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66|access-date=February 12, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Matrix Reloaded DVD Release Date October 14, 2003|url=https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/2586/The-Matrix-Reloaded-(2003).html|access-date=2022-02-13|website=DVDs Release Dates|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film had the [[wide release|widest release]] ever opening simultaneously in 108 territories at 1400 [[Greenwich Mean Time]] on November 5, 2003.<ref name=\"open\">{{cite book|first1=Dade|last1=Hayes|first2=Jonathan|last2=Bing|title=Open Wide: How Hollywood Box Office Became a National Obsession|publisher=Miramax Books|year=2004|isbn=1401352006|pages=372}}</ref><ref name=\"wwopen\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 17, 2003|page=17|title='The Matrix' Takes Over the World|last=Groves|first=Don|quote=10,013 prints in its first five days in 107 territories [excluding the US/Canada]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nOn opening day, ''The Matrix Revolutions'' scored $24.3 million, becoming the third-highest Wednesday opening, behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106815568915328400|title='Matrix Revolutions' Opens Big, But 'Reloaded' Still Is the King|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=November 6, 2003 }}</ref> During its three-day opening weekend, it would earn $48.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2003-11-12-0311110289-story.html|title=AT THE BOX OFFICE}}</ref> In its first five days of release, the film grossed $83.8 million in the United States and Canada from 3,502 theaters,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=matrixrevolutions.htm|title=The Matrix Revolutions (2003) \u2013 Weekend Box Office Results |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref> but dropped 66% during the second week.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=wechart>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 17, 2003|page=15|title=Variety Box Office|quote=3,502 engagements [United States and Canada]}}</ref> It had the highest five-day Wednesday opening for any [[Warner Bros.]] film until it was taken by ''[[Superman Returns]]'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2006/jul/04/superman-controls-weekend-box-office/|title='Superman' controls weekend box office}}</ref> The film would even compete against the newly released family films ''[[Brother Bear]]'' and ''[[Elf (film)|Elf]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holson|first=Laura|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/10/business/media/10matrix.html|title=An Elf and a Bear Trip Up the Final 'Matrix'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 10, 2003|access-date=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nInternationally, the film grossed $119 million in its first 5 days from 10,013 prints in 107 territories, with the third-biggest opening ever in Japan and Spain and the fourth biggest in the United Kingdom, Italy and Mexico.<ref name=wwopen/> Combined, it grossed $203 million in its first five days.<ref name=wechart/> This made it the highest worldwide opening weekend for any film, holding the record until it was beaten by ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' a month later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1286&p=.htm |title='King' of the World: $250M in 5 Days |date=22 December 2003 |first=Brandon |last=Gray |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=20 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619042637/http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=1286&p=.htm |archive-date=19 June 2012}}</ref> ''The Matrix Revolutions'' would also achieve the record for having the biggest international opening weekend for an R-rated film until 2015 when it was surpassed by ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/fifty-shades-of-grey-international-box-office-first-day-1201372179/ |title='Fifty Shades' Higher In Global Bow At $266.6M;
