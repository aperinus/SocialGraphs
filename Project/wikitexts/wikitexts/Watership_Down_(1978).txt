Released on 19 October 1978, the film was an immediate success and it became the sixth-most popular film of 1979 at the UK box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toonhound.com/watershipdown.htm | title=''Watership Down'' | access-date=2006-12-18 | publisher=Toonhound}}</ref>\n\nIt features the voices of [[John Hurt]], [[Richard Briers]], [[Harry Andrews]], [[Simon Cadell]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]] and [[Roy Kinnear]], among others, and was the last film work of [[Zero Mostel]], as the voice of Kehaar the gull. The musical score was by [[Angela Morley]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]]. [[Art Garfunkel]]'s hit song \"[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]\" was written by songwriter [[Mike Batt]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Lapine language]] mythology, the world was created by the god Frith. All animals were grass eaters, living harmoniously. The rabbits multiplied, and their appetite led to a food shortage. Frith ordered the rabbit prince, El-Ahrairah, to control his people, but was scoffed at. In retaliation, Frith gave special gifts to every animal, making some into predators to hunt the rabbits. Satisfied that El-Ahrairah has learned his lesson, Frith gives rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning.\n\nIn the present, in a [[Burrow|warren]] near [[Sandleford]], a [[European rabbit|rabbit]] [[Clairvoyance|seer]] named Fiver has an apocalyptic vision and takes his older brother Hazel to beg the chief for evacuation. The chief dismisses them, and orders Captain Holly, the head of the warren's Owsla police force, to stop those trying to leave. Fiver and Hazel along with other rabbits named Bigwig, Blackberry, Pipkin, Dandelion, Silver, and Violet manage to escape, passing a sign (meaningless to them) confirming that a residential development is coming.\n\nThey journey through the woods, avoiding several dangerous situations; until Violet - the group's only [[Rabbit#Terminology|doe]] - is killed by a [[hawk]]. The others eventually meet a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites them to his warren, where a farmer leaves Cowslip's group ample vegetables. They are grateful, but Fiver leaves when he senses something unsettling in the atmosphere. Bigwig follows, berating Fiver for causing tension when a [[Trapping|snare]] catches Bigwig. Bigwig's friends manage to free him, and Fiver learns that the farmer is protecting and feeding Cowslip's warren so that he can snare rabbits for his own meals. The group returns to its journey.\n\nThe rabbits discover Nuthanger Farm, which contains a [[Hutch (animal cage)|hutch]] of domesticated does. Before they can free the females, the farm cat and dog chase them away. Later, they are found by Captain Holly, who recounts the destruction of Sandleford by humans as well as vicious rabbits called the \"Efrafans\". Fiver finally finds the hill he envisioned, [[Watership Down, Hampshire|Watership Down]], where the group settles in with Hazel as their new chief.\n\nThey soon befriend an injured [[Black-headed gull|black-headed seagull]] named Kehaar, who flies out in search of does. That night, the rabbits return to Nuthanger Farm to free the does, but an attempt to free them fails which ends with Hazel getting shot. Fiver follows a vision of the mythical Black Rabbit to his injured brother. Kehaar returns and, while pecking out [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshot]] from Hazel's leg with his beak, reports of the many does at the large Efrafa warren. Captain Holly describes it as a dangerous totalitarian state, but Hazel feels they must go there. Bigwig infiltrates the warren and is made an Owsla officer by their cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Blackavar and Hyzenthlay. With Kehaar's help, the escapees find a boat to float down the river. That night, Kehaar leaves for his homeland with the gratitude of the warren.\n\nEfrafan trackers eventually find Watership Down. Woundwort rejects Hazel's offer of peace and demands that all deserters must be turned over or Watership Down will be wiped out. While the Watership rabbits barricade their warren, Fiver slips into a trance, in which he envisions a dog running loose in the woods. His mumblings inspire Hazel to try and release the farm dog and lead it to the Efrafans. When they arrive at the farm, Hazel unties the dog and releases it while Blackberry, Dandelion and Hyzenthlay use themselves as bait to make the animal follow them. Meanwhile, when the Efrafans break through the warren's defences, Woundwort goes in alone; Blackavar attacks him but is easily killed. Bigwig ambushes Woundwort and they fight to a standstill. When the dog arrives and starts attacking the Efrafans, Woundwort abandons Bigwig and fearlessly attacks the dog. However, no trace of Woundwort is ever found, which leaves his fate a mystery.\n\nSeveral years later, an elderly Hazel is visited by a strange ghostly rabbit, who invites him to join his own Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down's perpetual safety. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies peacefully. His spirit follows the visitor through the woodland and trees towards the Sun, which metamorphoses into Frith, and the [[afterlife]], as Frith's parting advice to El-Ahrairah is heard once more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[John Hurt]] as Hazel\n*[[Richard Briers]] as Fiver\n*[[Michael Graham Cox]] as Bigwig\n*[[John Bennett (actor)|John Bennett]] as Captain Holly\n*[[Ralph Richardson]] as the Chief Rabbit of Sandleford\n*[[Simon Cadell]] as Blackberry\n*[[Roy Kinnear]] as Pipkin\n*[[Terence Rigby]] as Silver\n*Mary Maddox as Clover\n*[[Richard O'Callaghan]] as Dandelion\n*[[Denholm Elliott]] as Cowslip\n*[[Zero Mostel]] as Kehaar\n*[[Harry Andrews]] as General Woundwort\n*[[Hannah Gordon]] as Hyzenthlay\n*[[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Campion\n*[[Lynn Farleigh]] as Tab the cat\n*[[Clifton Jones]] as Blackavar\n*[[Derek Griffiths]] as Vervain and Chervil\n*[[Michael Hordern]] as Frith\n*[[Joss Ackland]] as the Black Rabbit\n*Michelle Price as Lucy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilm rights were purchased by producer Martin Rosen.<ref>{{cite news|title=Against the totalitarian military machines of the Axis powers is pitted a civilian army of docent, easy-going, liberal English rabbits who believe in parliamentary democracy. .

The option for the film rights was \u00a350,000.<ref>Eberts pp. 11\u201312</ref>\n\nRosen estimated the budget at $2.4 million. Eberts raised $1 million from the Pearson company and clients of the merchant bank Lazard.<ref>Eberts p 14</ref>\n\nProduction of the film began in 1975 by a new animation studio, formed in London by Rosen.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=31 May 1978|page=44|title='Watership Down' Goes Avemb; Pending For N.Y.

His work can still be found in the film, most notably in the \"fable\" scene.<ref>[https://chicagoreader.com/film/watership-down/ Chicago Reader]</ref> He was replaced by Rosen who thereby made his directorial debut.\n\nAfter the genesis story, which was rendered in a narrated simple cartoon fashion, the animation style changes to a detailed, naturalistic one. There are concessions to render the animals [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] only to suggest that they have human voices and minds, some facial expressions for emotion, and paw gestures. The animation backgrounds are watercolors. Only one of the predators, the farm cat Tab, is given a few lines, the rest remaining mute.\n\nThe backgrounds and locations, especially Efrafa and the nearby railway, are based on the diagrams and maps in Richard Adams's original novel. Most of the locations in the movie either exist or were based on real spots in [[Hampshire]] and surrounding areas.\n\n===Music===\nThe musical score was by [[Angela Morley]] and [[Malcolm Williamson]], Morley replacing Williamson after the composer had fallen behind and only composed the prelude and main title theme in sketch form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelamorley.com/site/watercues.htm|title=Angela Morley \u2013 Watership Down cue sheets|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> A list of the musical cues for the film can be found on the composer's website, which also gives information about the different composers working on the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelamorley.com/site/wd-cue1.htm|title=Angela Morley \u2013 Watership Down music cues (page 1)|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack includes [[Art Garfunkel]]'s British No. 1 hit, \"[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]\", which was written by the British singer and songwriter [[Mike Batt]]. He also wrote other songs for the film which were not used. The composer recorded three songs with vocals by Garfunkel, but only \"Bright Eyes\" made it to the film. The song \"When You're Losing Your Way in the Rain\" has a very similar feeling and arrangement, and was recorded by the former Zombies vocalist [[Colin Blunstone]] in 1979. Garfunkel's version was heard years later, on the [[Watership Down (TV series)|''Watership Down'']] TV series [[Watership Down (TV series)#Soundtrack|soundtrack released in 2000]]. The song, like many others which appeared on the TV soundtrack, was never used in the show.\n\n==Release and reception==\n\n''Watership Down'' was first released to the UK on 19 October 1978, and was later released in the United States on 1 November 1978, for the latter, the movie was distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]].\n\n===Box office===\nWhen ''Watership Down'' was released, the film was very successful at the box office. According to financier [[Jake Eberts]], the investors who put up the $50,000 development finance \"got their money back with interest, plus an additional $450,000, making a total of ten times their investment\".<ref>Eberts pp. 17\u201318</ref> Other investors in the film reportedly received a return of 5,000% on their investment.<ref name=\"icon\">Alexander Walker, ''Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984\u20132000'', Orion Books, 2005 p6</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe film was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1979-hugo-awards|title=1979 Hugo Awards|date=2007-07-26|work=The Hugo Awards|access-date=2018-12-25|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Reception and legacy===\n[[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] were divided on their opinions of ''Watership Down'' on their show ''[[Sneak Previews]]''. Siskel thought that the film was too long, but that otherwise he found \u201cmost of it very effective\u201d due to the film\u2019s success at situating the audience in the rabbits\u2019 point-of-view which put him \u201cin touch with the delicate and brutal balance of nature\u201d. He also called the film \u201cmore mature than what we usually expect or get from an animated feature film\u201d. However, Ebert felt that the realism of the story, which he liked, did not match with the style of animation which he described as \u201csoft-edged, cuddly and like a cartoon\u201d.<ref>[https://siskelebert.org/?p=8038 Paradise Alley, Magic, Midnight Express, Watership Down, Comes a Horseman, 1978 Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews]</ref>\n\nSome critics commented on the film\u2019s success as an adaptation, such as [[The Observer]]\u2019s [[Philip French]], who wrote that \u201cthe novel\u2019s texture isn\u2019t there and the characters never take on strong pictorial identities.\u201d Later in the review he elaborated that the rabbit characters are \u201cblandly drawn\u201d and concluded that the film as a whole is \u201cdifficult to enthuse over.\u201d<ref name=\"French review\">{{cite news |last1=French |first1=Philip |title=Bunnies in the molehill |work=The Observer |date=22 October 1978  |page=32}}</ref> In [[The Times]], [[David Robinson (film critic)|David Robinson]] also criticised the film\u2019s translation to the screen as inaccessible for \u201cPeople who come to the film without the assistance of the book\u201d, as they \u201cmay well have a little difficulty with the special lore and language of Richard Adams\u2019 rabbit civilisation\u201d and with the fictional Lapine language spoken by the rabbits.

[[The Guardian]]\u2019s [[Derek Malcolm]] also complimented Kehaar the seagull\u2019s \u201cmost Disney-like\u201d animation style even though he found the film as a whole to be \u201cold-fashioned\u201d and the song \u201cBright Eyes\u201d to be \u201cmore than a trifle bland.\u201d<ref name=\"guardian review\">{{cite news |last1=Malcolm |first1=Derek |title=The buck stops here |work=The Guardian |date=19 October 1978 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn a joint review of ''Watership Down'' and [[Ralph Bakshi]]\u2019s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', animation historian [[Michael Barrier]] described both films as \u201cvery stupid movies, of a special kind\u201d and that \u201cthe films themselves show no sign that any intelligence was at work in making them\u201d due to their \u201cgrim literalism\u201d in adapting their source texts. He did describe ''Watership Down'' as the \u201cleast offensive\u201d of the two but nevertheless characterised the animation style as \u201cgraceless\u201d and expressed disappointment that the vision of the film\u2019s original director John Hubley was never fully realised.<ref name=\"Barrier review\">{{cite web |last1=Barrier |first1=Michael |title=Funnyworld Revisited: Going by the Book |url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Funnyworld/LOTR/LOTR.html |website=www.michaelbarrier.com |access-date=28 June 2022}}</ref> [[Newsweek]]\u2019s [[David Ansen]] also drew comparisons with ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', but while he disliked Bakshi\u2019s film he was more effusive about ''Watership Down'', which he said \u201chas the relentless momentum of a good war movie\u201d and \u201cis swift of foot, graced with wit, and capable of touching the hearts of both children and adults\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ansen |first1=David |title=Hobbits and Rabbits |work=Newsweek |date=20 November 1978}}</ref>\n\nIn a review of the DVD edition, Film Freak Central\u2019s Walter Chaw praised the film for offering an \u201cunusually thoughtful\u201d alternative to Disney animated films of the era: \u201c''Watership Down'' arose in that extended lull between Disney\u2019s heyday and its late-Eighties resurrection. [\u2026] ''Watership Down'' points to the dwindled potential for American animation to evolve into what [[anime]] has become: a mature medium for artistic expression of serious issues.\u201d Chaw commended the film\u2019s frankness, honesty, and themes of friendship and loyalty, concluding that, in spite of the film\u2019s violent elements, \u201cthe picture may be ''more'' appropriate for young children than a legion of condescendingly sugarcoated Disney fare.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaw |first1=Walter |title=Watership Down (1978) [The Criterion Collection] - Blu-ray Disc |url=https://www.filmfreakcentral.net/ffc/2015/02/watership-down-1978-the-criterion-collection-blu-ray-disc.html |website=Film Freak Central |access-date=28 June 2022 |date=8 May 2002}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on children and BBFC classification===\n''Watership Down'' has developed a reputation as a distressing children\u2019s text, with Ed Power of [[The Independent]] describing the film in a 40th anniversary retrospective as a \u201cclassic\u201d but which \u201carguably traumatised an entire generation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Power |first1=Ed |title=How Watership Down terrified an entire generation |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/watership-down-film-bright-eyes-rabbits-disease-martin-rosen-richard-adams-disney-a8590226.html |website=The Independent |access-date=28 June 2022 |language=en |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> In 2016, the British broadcaster [[Channel 5 (British TV channel)|Channel 5]] faced criticism after broadcasting the film in a pre-[[Watershed (broadcasting)#United Kingdom|watershed]] slot on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], which was seen to be in poor taste due to the film\u2019s representations of violence inflicted upon rabbits, and with many people on social media expressing concern about child viewers being distressed (though it is unclear whether any children were actually negatively affected).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Denham |first1=Jess |title=Channel 5 criticised for airing 'traumatic' Watership Down at Easter |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/watership-down-parents-left-horrified-1978-animated-film-traumatises-children-easter-sunday-a6956061.html |website=The Independent |access-date=28 June 2022 |language=en |date=30 March 2016}}</ref> Despite the criticism, Channel 5 broadcast ''Watership Down'' on Easter Sunday again the following year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bunny bloodbath on Easter Sunday sparks outrage as Channel 5 air Watership Down |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/bunny-bloodbath-easter-sunday-sparks-10238663 |website=Daily Record |access-date=28 June 2022 |language=en |date=16 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the film\u2019s reputation as traumatising, regulators and critics in 1978 expressed little concern about the film\u2019s potentially negative effects on children. When the film was first submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification]], the BBFC passed the film with a 'U' certificate (suitable for all ages), deciding that \"Animation removes the realistic gory horror in the occasional scenes of violence and bloodshed, and we felt that, while the film may move children emotionally during the film\u2019s duration, it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken, and that a \u2018U\u2019 certificate was therefore quite appropriate.\u201d<ref name=\"BBFC Examiners Report 15th February 1978\">BBFC Examiners Report 15 February 1978 [https://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Watership-Down-report.pdf]</ref> This choice has been quite controversial though, and in 2012, the BBFC acknowledged that it had \"received complaints about the suitability of Watership Down at 'U' almost every year since its classification\".<ref name=\"BBFC Centenary Archive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/2012/04/from-the-archive-viewing-a-repressive-rabbit-regime|title=From the Archive\u2026 viewing a \"repressive rabbit regime\" \u00ab British Board of Film Classification|access-date=29 March 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409195521/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/2012/04/from-the-archive-viewing-a-repressive-rabbit-regime|archive-date=9 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2022, the BBFC re-classified the film with a PG rating for \"mild violence, threat, brief bloody images, language\".<ref name=\"bbfc webpage\">{{cite web |title=Watership Down |url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/release/watership-down-q29sbgvjdglvbjpwwc0yotyxnjm |website=www.bbfc.co.uk |access-date=13 September 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nLike the BBFC, film critics in 1978 characterised ''Watership Down'' as suitable for children in spite of its potentially distressing aspects. [[The Spectator]]\u2019s Ted Whitehead described it as \u201ca straightforward children\u2019s adventure story\u201d.<ref name=\"spectator review\">{{cite news |last1=Whitehead |first1=Ted |title=Sententious |work=The Spectator |date=21 October 1978 |page=30}}</ref> Scott in The Globe and Mail wrote that \u201cParents are more apt to feel squeamish about this than their children: there is nothing as devastating as the death of Bambi's mother. In Watership Down, some of the rabbits are unlucky and some live to old age. When they do die, the deaths are treated with sympathy but not morbidity.
