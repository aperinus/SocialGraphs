Members of the Klump family, including Sherman's parents, also provide an increased level of [[comic relief]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nProfessor Sherman Klump has created a new [[Fountain of Youth|de-aging]] formula. He is also in love with [[DNA]] researcher, Denise Gaines, developer of a method to isolate genetic material. Despite his good fortune, Sherman's major problem is his [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] alter ego, Buddy Love. He is still ingrained inside him and has begun to periodically take control of his body. Starting at Cletus\u2019 retirement dinner, Buddy takes over Sherman\u2019s body and reveals to everyone that Cletus didn\u2019t retire. He actually got laid off. The next day, Denise tells Sherman that she got a phone call offering her a full professorship at the University Of Maine. Denise goes on to tell him that she\u2019s hasn\u2019t taken the job yet because there\u2019s something very important to her at Wellman that she\u2019s unsure if she can leave behind: Sherman. Denise reveals to Sherman that she has feelings for him and that his size doesn\u2019t matter to her. She loves him for him. Sherman tries to propose to Denise but Buddy once again takes over , humiliating Sherman and mortifying Denise.\n\nDetermined to be rid of Buddy permanently, and despite his assistant, Jason, warning him of potential consequences, Sherman uses Denise's methodology to isolate and remove the [[DNA]] where Buddy has manifested. However, the Buddy genetic material grows into a sentient being when a hair from Jason's [[Basset Hound]], Buster, accidentally lands in it. Sherman apologizes to Denise and proposes to her again and she says yes. Later, Dean Richmond informs them that Phleer Pharmaceuticals has offered Wellman College $150 million for the youth formula.\n\nSherman and Denise then encounter the newly reformed Buddy at a [[movie theater]]. Buddy pickpockets Sherman and learns of the $150 million offer. He subsequently visits the pharmaceutical company, making a rival bid of $149 million with Leanne Guilford, President of Acquisitions, for the youth formula. Sherman learns that the extraction has altered his body chemistry and that he is losing his intelligence. Realizing he needs to keep the youth formula out of Buddy's hands, Sherman stashes it at his parents'.\n\nSherman's father, Cletus, sexually insulted and frustrated by his mother-in-law, Ida Mae Jensen, regarding his age and impotence, accidentally drinks some of the youth formula. He goes out for a night on the town and attempts to seduce his wife and Sherman's mother, Anna, but she is horrified. Buddy witnesses Cletus changing and realizes that the youth formula is being stored in the Klump household. Meanwhile, Sherman's condition causes him to act like a fool in front of Denise's parents, concerning her.\n\nBuddy steals some of the youth formulae from the Klump household, filling the vial the rest of the way with fertilizer. This sabotage causes chaos at a demonstration the next day as Petey, the male hamster Sherman uses to demonstrate the formula, mutates into a giant monster who violates Richmond as he is trying to escape under a fur coat, as Petey confuses him for Molly, the female hamster that escaped during the event. The humiliated and enraged Richmond fires Sherman, who soon learns from Jason that his brain's deterioration has worsened, so he decides to break up with Denise. While Cletus consoles a depressed Sherman, Sherman realises that, as much as he despises Buddy Love, the two of them must get back together for the sake of the professors health and his intelligence.\n\nSherman quickly works on a newer, much more potent formula while his mental faculties allow him. Richmond confronts him about Buddy's actions, believing that they are working together. Sherman leaves with Richmond and a tennis ball covered in the youth formula and heads to a presentation at Phleer Pharmaceuticals that Buddy is giving about the youth formula. Meanwhile, a worried Denise discovers what has happened and that Sherman's brain damage is progressing. With Cletus' help, Denise goes after him. Sherman takes advantage of the canine DNA crossed with Buddy's and uses the tennis ball to distract him. Buddy catches the ball in his mouth, and the youth formula transforms him back into a glowing mass of sentient genetic material.\n\nSherman chases the genetic material, intent on drinking it to correct his condition. However, it evaporates on the edge of a fountain before he can. Cletus and Denise arrive too late to save him, and Denise breaks into tears, which hit the genetic material and fall into the fountain. As they go to leave, Sherman looks into the fountain, remarking that it is \"pretty\". Seeing the water is glowing, Denise realizes the genetic material has reconstituted thanks to her tears and that if Sherman drinks the fountain water, he will be restored to normal. When he drinks it, he is able to restore his intelligence.\n\nSherman and Denise later get married, while Cletus and Anna reconcile with each other.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Sherman Klump|Professor Sherman Klump]] / Buddy Love / Papa Cletus Klump / Young Papa Cletus Klump / Ernie Klump Sr. / Mama Anna Klump / Grandma Ida Jenson / Lance Perkins\n* [[Janet Jackson]] as Denise Gaines-Klump\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Dean Richmond\n* [[John Ales]] as Jason\n* [[Richard Gant]] as Mr. Gaines\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Mrs. Gaines\n* [[Melinda McGraw]] as Leanne Guilford \n* [[Jamal Mixon]] as Ernie Klump Jr.\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Chantal\n* [[Freda Payne]] as Claudine\n* [[Nikki Cox]] as Miss Taylor Stamos (Credited as Bright Student)\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Restaurant Manager\n* [[Earl Boen]] as Dr. Knoll\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Four Star General\n* Gabriel Williams as Isaac\n\nAdditionally, [[Kathleen Freeman]] makes an uncredited appearance as Denise's neighbor who witnesses Sherman proposing to her.
