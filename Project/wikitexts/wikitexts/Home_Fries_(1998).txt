The script was originally penned by writer [[Vince Gilligan]] for a film class at [[New York University]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens at Burger-Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be a Cobra [[attack helicopter]], which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack.\n\nThroughout the attack, Dorian and Angus hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they hear the helicopter pilots on headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death. They quickly deduce that Burger-Matic is the only location close enough to have been on the same frequency. Angus goads Dorian into getting a job there to ensure that no one is wise to their crime.\n\nSally is heartbroken at the news about Henry. At work, Dorian bonds with her quickly. He gives her a model helicopter for her baby, and he explains that he and Angus fly them as [[reservists]] for the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. She asks him to accompany her to [[lamaze]] class, since she doesn't have a partner. Eventually, he takes her to the base to see the helicopter that he flies. As she sits in the cockpit, she tells him about Henry.\n\nKnowing that his mother is still furious about Henry's affair and that Angus would hurt Sally if he knew her identity, Dorian frantically tries to keep the truth from his family. When Angus discovers Sally's identity, Beatrice visits her under the pretense of making amends. Dorian is terrified of what Angus might do out of a misplaced loyalty to their crazy mother. Sure enough, he arrives at Sally's house in the attack helicopter. She, Dorian, and Beatrice escape in a truck. He eventually forces them to stop on the road. Beatrice pretends to be unaware of what is going on and leaves the truck. Dorian gradually convinces Angus to stop his attack.\n\nThe stress of the chase triggers Sally's labor, and Dorian drives her to the hospital. After she has a boy, he talks to him. He struggles to explain how they are related, and he tells him that he is lucky to have the best mother in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Sally Jackson\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Beatrice Lever\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Dorian Montier\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Angus Montier\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as Mrs. Jackson\n* Kim Robillard as Billy\n* [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]] as Roy\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Red Jackson\n* [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as Henry Lever\n* [[Blue Deckert]] as Sheriff\n* Mark Walters as Deputy\n* Shane Steiner as Soldier in Jeep\n* [[Theresa Merritt]] as Mrs. Vaughan (Final Film Role)\n* Jill Parker-Jones as Lamaze Instructor\n* Morgana Shaw as Lucy Garland\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 31% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a mixed review, writing, \"''Home Fries'' is not a great movie, and as much as I finally enjoyed it, I'm not sure it's worth seeing two times just to get into the rhythm. More character and less plot might have been a good idea. But the actors are tickled by their characters and have fun with them, and so I did, too.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981125/REVIEWS/811250303/1023 Ebert, Roger].
