The film was directed by [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] and [[Brenda Chapman]] (in the former's [[directorial debut|feature directorial debut]]), co-directed by [[Steve Purcell]], and produced by [[Katherine Sarafian]], with [[John Lasseter]], [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]] serving as executive producers. The story was written by Chapman, who also wrote the film's screenplay with Andrews, Purcell, and [[Irene Mecchi]]. The film stars the voices of [[Kelly Macdonald]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Kevin McKidd]], and [[Craig Ferguson]]. Set in the [[Scottish Highlands]], the film tells the story of Princess [[Merida (Brave)|Merida]] of DunBroch (Macdonald) who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed. When Queen Elinor (Thompson), her mother, falls victim to a beastly curse and turns into a bear, Merida must look within herself and find the key to saving the kingdom. Merida is the first [[Disney Princess]] created by Pixar. The film is also dedicated to Pixar chairman and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder and CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died before the film's release.\n\n''Brave'' is Pixar's first film with a female protagonist, and the first one animated with a new proprietary animation system, called [[Presto (animation software)|Presto]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 27, 2021|title=Our Story|url=https://www.pixar.com/our-story-pixar|website=www.pixar.com}}</ref> Originally titled ''The Bear and the Bow'', the film was first announced in April 2008 alongside ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Cars 2]]''.

While venturing into the woods to fetch an arrow, Merida encounters a [[will-o'-the-wisp]]. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon [[bear]], attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida discovers that she is to be [[Marriage of state|betrothed]] to the son of one of her father's allies. Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch, reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom.\n\nThe allied [[Scottish clan chief|clan chieftains]] and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the [[Highland games]] for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her [[Courtship|suitors]] in an [[archery]] contest, shaming the other clans, and after a heated disagreement with Elinor, runs away into the forest. Wisps appear, leading her to the hut of an elderly witch. Merida bargains for a spell to change Elinor, and the witch gives her an enchanted cake.\n\nWhen Merida gives Elinor the cake, it transforms her into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond, torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family [[tapestry]] she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to relent and declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but Elinor prompts her instead to insist that the firstborns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor, while Fergus, looking for his wife finds out she's gone. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the Queen for Mor'du, and thinking it has eaten his wife, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her identical [[Multiple birth|triplet]] brothers, Harris, Hubert, and Hamish, who have also eaten the enchanted cake and are now bear cubs. Merida repairs the tapestry and rides out after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives. Mor'du battles with the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling [[menhir]] (standing stone). This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp. Merida covers her mother in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message and reversing the spell's effects on her mother and brothers.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses together.\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not add the post-credits scene to the plot summary.
