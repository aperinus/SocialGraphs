[[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Kristin Davis]], and [[Cynthia Nixon]] reprised their roles as friends [[Carrie Bradshaw|Carrie]], [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha]], [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte]], and [[Miranda Hobbes|Miranda]], while [[Chris Noth]] co-stars as Carrie's husband [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]]. It features [[cameo appearance|cameos]] from [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Tim Gunn]], [[Ron White]], [[Omid Djalili]], [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Norm Lewis]], and [[Kelli O'Hara]].\n\n''Sex and the City 2'' was released theatrically on May 27, 2010, in the United States and the following day in the United Kingdom. It was panned by critics but was a commercial success grossing $294 million on a $95 million production budget.\n\nA sequel television series, titled ''[[And Just Like That...]]'', premiered on [[HBO Max]] in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Carrie Bradshaw|Carrie]], [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha]], [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte]], and [[Miranda Hobbes|Miranda]] attend the wedding of their friends Stanford and Anthony. Three of the four women are now married themselves but Samantha, aged 52, is desperately trying to keep her [[libido]] alive as she enters [[menopause]]. The wedding is officiated by [[Liza Minnelli]] who also performs a musical number, and Carrie serves as Stanford's \"best man\". Back home, Miranda quits her job after her firm's [[misogynistic]] new managing partner disrespects her once too often. Charlotte's two children are a handful, mostly her two-year-old daughter Rose's extreme and constant crying, and she is worried that her husband Harry is attracted to their [[busty|buxom]] Irish nanny, Erin. Carrie's marriage to [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] has settled down, although they differ on how to spend their spare time. Carrie wants to go out often to dinner, parties and big events, whereas Big prefers to stay in and relax on the couch.\n\nFor their anniversary, Carrie gives Big a vintage [[Rolex]] watch engraved with the message \"Me and You, Just Us Two\" while he, much to her dismay, shows her a new TV in their bedroom as his gift, which Big says they can use to watch old films together, something they did at the hotel at Anthony and Stanford's wedding and seemed to enjoy. She is disappointed with Big's gift, as she had hoped for something more personal to show he realizes they must maintain the spark in the marriage. However, Big starts to watch TV more often, making Carrie feel unappreciated. In response she stays at her old apartment for two days to write an article, after which Big acts the way he did while they were first dating and they both enjoy a romantic night out. He enjoys it so much he suggests to Carrie that they take two days off every week, he can go somewhere for those two days to relax, watch TV and lie on the couch, and the rest of the time he will have more energy to do what she wants to do. Carrie does not dismiss this, but is hurt by the suggestion and worries it means they will drift apart.\n\nMeanwhile, Samantha is to devise a [[Public Relations|PR]] campaign for an [[Arab]] [[sheikh]]'s business. He flies her and her friends on an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to [[Abu Dhabi]]. Carrie is happy she will have time to think about Big's suggestion. Charlotte is worried about leaving her husband alone with the nanny. But Miranda, unfettered by a job for the first time in her life, is especially excited. Upon entering Abu Dhabi, Samantha's hormone-enhancing drugs are confiscated under [[United Arab Emirates]] law, rendering her devoid of estrogen and hindering her libido. Charlotte tries to call Harry every few minutes; Miranda revels in the culture surrounding her; and Carrie befriends her manservant, Gaurau, who is an underpaid [[Indians in the United Arab Emirates|temporary worker from India]]. He warns Carrie of men with watches trying to take advantage of her.\n\nOn a visit to a local [[souq]] (market), Carrie runs into her former lover, [[Sex and the City characters#Aidan Shaw|Aidan]]. He proposes dinner ''[[\u00e0 deux]]'' at his hotel, and she accepts. The dinner is very enjoyable, with the two discussing old times. Aidan remarks on the ways Carrie is \"not like other women\". In a moment of remembered passion, they kiss. Carrie runs away in panic and returns to her hotel, where Miranda and Charlotte are having drinks together and discussing the difficulties of motherhood. When Carrie wonders whether she should tell Big about the kiss, as they have no secrets between them, Miranda reflects on when her husband [[Steve Brady|Steve]] told her about his affair. Samantha counsels Carrie to wait before deciding anything. Carrie opts to call Big to tell him. Big is silent upon hearing the news, and after saying a few words, hangs up.\n\nThe four women find their Western style and attitudes clash with [[Muslim]] customs. For example, while on a date with a handsome Danish architect, Samantha is arrested for [[public display of affection]] after fondling him at a restaurant, giving him an erection in public and making out with him on the beach. With the Sheikh's intervention, Samantha is released but is left with a permanent police record. To make matters worse, the Sheikh cancels the PR meeting and ceases paying for the remainder of the women's luxurious stay. They quickly pack their bags and leave, but must return to the souq to find Carrie's passport that she accidentally left there when she ran into Aidan. When Charlotte is conned into going into a building to buy fake goods, Carrie, Samantha and Miranda save her. However one of the men chase after them and rips Samantha's purse, causing condoms to fall on the ground. When Samantha's liberal dress and western attitude incites an outraged mob among the local men, the women are rescued by a group of local [[Emirati women|Emirati]] women who share their sense of style hidden underneath their customary [[Abaya|black robes]]. The Emirati women help to disguise the four American women in robes and veils so they can escape and make it to the airport in time.\n\nWhen Carrie returns home, she finds the bedroom TV removed and Big gone. She passes an anxious day, at the end of which he returns. Big tells her that although he was torn, he realizes that what she needs is something to remind her at all times that she is married. He hands her a jewelry box, which reveals an engagement ring set with a black diamond. When Carrie asks him why a black diamond, he says she is not like anyone else, echoing Aidan's earlier comment, showing he does appreciate her and they have not lost their spark.\n\nBig and Carrie combine their interests; Charlotte's nanny, Erin, turns out to be a lesbian and no threat to her marriage; Miranda finds a new job at a more laid-back and diverse [[law firm]] where she is appreciated; and Samantha remains unchanged, and even meets for sex on the beach with the Danish architect, this time in [[the Hamptons]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n* [[Kristin Davis]] as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt]]\n* [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n* [[Chris Noth]] as [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|John James \"Mr. Big\" Preston]]\n* [[John Corbett]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Aidan Shaw|Aidan Shaw]]\n* [[David Eigenberg]] as [[Steve Brady]]\n* [[Evan Handler]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Harry Goldenblatt|Harry Goldenblatt]]\n* [[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Smith Jerrod|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod]]\n* [[Willie Garson]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Stanford Blatch|Stanford Blatch]]\n* [[Mario Cantone]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Anthony Marentino|Anthony Marentino]]\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as [[Sex and the City characters#Magda|Magda]]\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Erin, Charlotte's Irish Nanny\n* [[Noah Mills]] as Nicky Marentino\n* [[Megan Boone]] as Allie\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Rikard Spirt\n* [[Raza Jaffrey]] as Gaurau\n* [[Viola Harris]] as Gloria Blatch\n* [[Omid Djalili]] as Mr. Safir, Hotel Manager\n* [[Dhaffer L'Abidine]] as Mahmud\n* [[Art Malik]] as Sheikh Khaled\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Carmen Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n\n* [[Andrew Rannells]] as Wedding Chorus\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Herself\n* [[Miley Cyrus]] as Herself\n* [[Tuesday Knight]] as Herself\n* [[Tim Gunn]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sarah Jessica Parker on the set of \"Sex and the City II\".jpg|thumb|[[Sarah Jessica Parker]] at the movie set.]]\n\n===Development===\nAfter months of speculation, the cast confirmed in February 2009 that a sequel was in the works.
