The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|37th Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the 1912 story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Kevin Lima]] and [[Chris Buck]] (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by [[Tab Murphy]], [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|via=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|access-date=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in [[California]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Paris]], with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its voice performances, music, and animation (particularly its action sequences). Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive traditionally animated film ever made until ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' in 2002), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the [[1999 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of 1999]], the second highest-grossing animated film of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] followups, ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1880s, a British couple and their infant son are shipwrecked in [[Africa]]. The adults build a treehouse but are killed by [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]], an [[African leopard]]. [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], a [[gorilla]] who lost her son to Sabor, adopts the human infant and names him Tarzan; although Kerchak, her mate and the gorilla leader, objects.\n\nYears later, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala\u2019s niece Terk and the paranoid [[African bush elephant|elephant]], Tantor. Tarzan finds himself treated differently because of his different physique, so he makes valiant efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to kill Sabor with a [[spear]], gaining Kerchak's reluctant approval.\n\nMeanwhile, a team of human explorers from England, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter Jane, and their hunter escort Clayton, are looking to study the gorillas. Jane accidentally becomes separated from the group and is chased by a [[baboon]] troop, until Tarzan saves her out of sheer curiosity. After comparing her to himself, he realizes they are similar. Jane leads Tarzan back to their camp, where Porter and Clayton both take interest in him; the former in terms of scientific progress, while the latter hopes to have Tarzan lead the group to the gorillas. Despite Kerchak's warnings to avoid the strangers, Tarzan repeatedly returns to the camp. Porter, Clayton, and Jane teach him how to speak English properly, and tell him what the human world is like. Tarzan and Jane begin to fall in love; however, she has difficulty convincing Tarzan to lead the humans to the gorillas, as Tarzan fears Kerchak's fury.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan, in turn, asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him forever as long as he leads them to the gorillas; Tarzan agrees, and leads the trio to the nesting grounds while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak. Porter and Jane are excited to mingle with the gorillas, but Kerchak returns and attacks the humans on sight. Tarzan restrains Kerchak while the humans escape; afterwards, Kerchak furiously accuses Tarzan of betraying his family, causing Tarzan to flee in shame. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him, reveals his true past, and says that she wants him to be happy whatever he decides. Tarzan puts on his late father's suit, signifying his decision to go to England.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter the next day, they are ambushed by Clayton and his traitorous band of stowaway [[Hooliganism|thugs]]. Now aware of the location of the nesting grounds, Clayton reveals his plans to capture and sell the gorillas for a fortune, and imprisons Tarzan, Jane, and Porter to prevent them from interfering. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor, and he returns to the jungle, rallying the animals to come to the aid of the gorillas and scare off the thugs. Clayton then mortally wounds Kerchak and battles Tarzan across the treetops. Although Tarzan spares Clayton's life and breaks his rifle, Clayton tries to kill him with his [[machete]]. Their battle comes to a cluster of vines, and Clayton tries to cut free when a vine becomes tangled around his neck, [[hanging]] him to death. Kerchak, with his dying breath, finally accepts Tarzan as his son, and names him the leader of the gorilla troop.\n\nThe next day, Porter and Jane prepare to leave on the ship while Tarzan stays behind with the gorillas. As the ship's rowboat leaves shore, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with the man she loves, and Jane jumps overboard, followed soon after by her father. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and his family, and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan#Tarzan in other media|Tarzan]], a 20-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation, while Glen Keane used movements of a gibbon and used it for the animation of adult Tarzan, he also watched his son Max Keane do his skateboarding and snowboarding and used surfers moves in the scenes where Tarzan is sliding through the trees.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Goldwyn provided adult Tarzan's speaking voice, but his co-star [[Brian Blessed]] (the voice of Clayton) provided the [[Tarzan yell]].<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/bp/-throwbackthursday--welcome-to-tony-goldwyn-s-jungle-222220130.html|title=#ThrowbackThursday: Welcome to Tony Goldwyn's Jungle|first=Victoria|last=Leigh Miller|website=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation.

He had desired to have the film animated through the [[Disney Television Animation]] division with a new animation studio established in [[Canada]]. Lima was reluctant to the idea because of the animation complexities being done by inexperienced animators. Following Katzenberg's resignation from the [[Walt Disney Company]], Lima was again contacted about the project by [[Michael Eisner]], who decided to have the film produced through the Feature Animation division, by which Lima signed on.<ref>{{cite interview|title=Get Enchanted!

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burroughs' novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe. Also the [[Mangani]], the apes that raised Tarzan in the original book were changed and portrayed as gorillas which were called Bolgani in the original story. Originally Sabor was portrayed as a [[Lion|lioness]] but was changed to a leopard due to the fact the film takes place in the jungle a place where leopards hunt rather than lions who roam in open grasslands, also leopards in the original novel where called Sheeta.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" />\n\nIn January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" /> Comedy writer [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|Dave Reynolds]] was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"Animation Artist\">{{cite news| url=http://www.animationartist.com/movies/tarzan/Production/production.html | title=Disney's Tarzan Adventure: Two Worlds Merge | last=Tracy | first=Joe | website=Animation Artist | access-date=October 16, 2014}}</ref> \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up\", Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished. Either they liked my work, or I was very bad at time management.\"<ref name=\"Green\" /> One challenge the writers faced was how Tarzan should learn about his past. \"When Kala takes Tarzan back to the tree house, she is essentially telling him that he was adopted\", [[Bonnie Arnold]], the producer for ''Tarzan'', said, \"This is necessitated by him encountering humans and recognizing he is one of them.\"<ref name=\"Green\" /> As a way to explore the feelings in that scene, Arnold brought in adoptive parents to talk with the story team.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Another issue was the inherent and overt racism in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan.

However, Katzenberg persuaded Allen to leave the project for [[DreamWorks Pictures]]' ''[[Antz]]'' (1998) and in exchange, the studio would distribute his next four films. Agreeing to the deal, Allen departed from ''Tarzan'' in 1996 and was replaced by [[Wayne Knight]].<ref name=\"WoodyAllen\" />\n\n===Animation===\nThe animators were split into two teams, one in Paris and one in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]. The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1999-06-08-9906070397-story.html|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 7, 1999|access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|access-date=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|via=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}}</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] backgrounds that look like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |access-date=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104012559/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archive-date=January 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003. After ''Tarzan'', ''Deep Canvas'' was used for a number of sequences in ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (2001), particularly large panoramic shots of the island and several action sequences.

The series picks up where the film left off, with Tarzan adjusting to his new role as leader of the apes following Kerchak's death, and Jane (whom he has since married) adjusting to life in the jungle. In July 1999, Disney announced that they were planning a sequel for ''Tarzan''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilmer|first=David|title= TARZAN 2 is in the works|url=http://www.awn.com/news/tarzan-2-works|website=Animation World Network|date=July 12, 1999|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> In 2002, ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' was released as a [[direct-to-video]] sequel, with [[Michael T. Weiss]] replacing Goldwyn as the voice of Tarzan. ''[[Tarzan II]]'', a direct-to-video follow-up, was released in 2005.\n\nA [[Broadway musical]] produced by [[Disney Theatrical]], also titled ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', began previews on March 24, 2006. It had an official opening night on May 10 of the same year. After running for over a year on Broadway, the show closed on July 8, 2007.<ref>{{cite news | title=Disney's 'Tarzan' to close July 8 on Broadway | url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/theater/news/2007-06-23-tarzan_n.htm | publisher=USA Today | date=June 24, 2007 | access-date=March 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFive ''Tarzan'' video games have been released on various platforms. Tarzan's home is also featured as a playable world, \"Deep Jungle\", in the 2002 game ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', and in the 2013 HD remaster ''[[Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix]]'', in which Goldwyn and Blessed were the only actors from the film to reprise their roles, while Jane was voiced by Naia Kelly and [[Audrey Wasilewski]] reprised her role as Terk from the 1999 video game based on the film. The world was originally meant to return in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', but ultimately did not appear and has not appeared in any subsequent ''Kingdom Hearts'' games.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/tarzan}}\n* {{IMDb title|0120855|Tarzan}}\n* {{AllMovie title|180151|Tarzan}}\n* {{mojo title|tarzan|Tarzan}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|tarzan|Tarzan}}\n* {{MobyGames|id=/disneys-tarzan|name=''Disney's Tarzan''}}\n* {{MobyGames|id=/gameboy-color/disneys-tarzan_|name=''Disney's Tarzan'' (Game Boy Color)}}\n* {{MobyGames|id=/disneys-tarzan-untamed|name=''Disney's Tarzan Untamed''}}\n* {{MobyGames|id=/disneys-tarzan-return-to-the-jungle|name=''Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle''}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = ''Tarzan''\n|list =\n{{Tarzan movies}}\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n{{Disney Renaissance}}\n{{Chris Buck}}\n{{Kevin Lima}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarzan (1999 Film)}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 animated films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1999 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s action adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American musical fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Animated musical films]]\n[[Category:Animated romance films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on novels]]\n[[Category:Animated films about gorillas]]\n[[Category:Animated films about elephants]]\n[[Category:Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Disney Renaissance]]\n[[Category:Films about animals]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into plays]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television shows]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Buck]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Lima]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bonnie Arnold]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Mancina]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1889]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1896]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1910]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films set in jungles]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Song Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Tab Murphy]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Noni White]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Bob Tzudiker]]\n[[Category:Musicals by Phil Collins]]\n[[Category:Tarzan films]]\n[[Category:Tarzan (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
