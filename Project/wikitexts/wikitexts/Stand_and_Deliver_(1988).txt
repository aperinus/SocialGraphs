For portraying Escalante, [[Edward James Olmos]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[61st Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Rain Man' Given 8 Oscar Nominations; Sigourney 2 : Hoffman Wins 6th Acting Nod|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-15/news/mn-2644_1_rain-man|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=3 September 2017}}</ref> The film won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film|Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature]] in 1988. The film's title refers to the 1987 [[Mr. Mister]] [[Stand and Deliver (Mr. Mister song)|song of the same name]], which is also featured in the film's ending credits.\n\nIn 2011, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn the early 1980s, Jaime Escalante becomes a mathematics teacher at [[Garfield High School (California)|James A. Garfield High School]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. The school is full of [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] students from working-class families whose academic achievement is far below their grade level. Two students, Angel and another gangster, arrive late and question Escalante's authority. Escalante demonstrates how to multiply numbers using one's fingers and appeals to the students' sense of humor. After class, some gangsters threaten Escalante. After school, he stops the gangsters from fighting. He then introduces himself as a 'one-man gang' with the classroom as his domain. Escalante tells the students that he's decided to teach the students [[algebra]].\n\nAt a meeting, Escalante learns that the school's accreditation is under threat, as test scores are not high enough. Escalante says that students will rise to the level that is expected of them. Escalante gives the students a quiz every morning and a new student joins the class. He instructs his class under the philosophy of ''ganas'', roughly translating to \"desire\".\n\nEscalante tells other faculty that he wants to teach the students calculus. He seeks to change the school culture to help the students excel in academics, as he has seen the untapped potential of his class. Other teachers ridicule him, as the students have not taken the prerequisites. Escalante states that the students can take the prerequisites over the summer. He sets a goal of having the students take [[AP Calculus|Advanced Placement Calculus]] by their senior year.\n\nThe students sign up for the prerequisites over the summer. There is no air conditioning, but Escalante is able to teach the class, giving them oranges and telling them to focus so they can get good jobs and take vacations. In the fall, he gives the students contracts to be signed by the parents; they must come in on Saturdays, show up an hour early to school, and stay until 5pm in order to prepare for the AP Calculus exam.\n\nTwo weeks before the students' exam, Escalante is teaching an ESL class to some adults. He suddenly clutches at his torso in pain, stumbles into the hallway, and falls. A substitute teacher is found for the students while Escalante recovers in the hospital, but the substitute teacher is a music teacher. Soon after, Escalante escapes from the hospital and shows up at school to continue teaching. After taking the exam, the students head to the beach and celebrate. All 18 students who took the exam pass it. At a meeting to congratulate the students, a plaque of appreciation is presented to Escalante.\n\nTo the dismay of both Escalante and the students, the [[Educational Testing Service]] questions the students' exam scores. Escalante finds an anonymous letter of resignation in his school mail and has to walk home that evening, as his car has been stolen from the school parking lot. Dismayed, he confides in his wife that he regrets having taught the students calculus, because they did well but nothing changed for them. The boys of the class show up at Escalante's house; they have fixed up his car as a way to thank him. Escalante meets with the investigators from Educational Testing Service, argues with them, but ultimately offers to have the students retake the test. Despite having only one day to prepare, all the students pass, and Escalante demands that the original scores be resubmitted.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as [[Jaime Escalante]]\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as Secretary\n* Virginia Paris as Raquel Ortega\n* Will Gotay as Francisco \"Pancho\" Garcia\n* [[Ingrid Oliu]] as Guadalupe \"Lupe\" Escobar\n* [[Carmen Argenziano]] as Jesse Molina\n* [[Rosanna DeSoto]] as Fabiola Escalante\n* [[Vanessa Marquez]] as Ana Delgado\n* [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Angel Guzman\n* Karla Montana as Claudia Camejo\n* [[Lydia Nicole]] as Rafaela Fuentes\n* [[James Victor (actor)|James Victor]] as Ana's Father\n* Mark Eliot as Armando \"Tito\" Guitaro\n* Patrick Baca as Javier Perales \n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Ramirez\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\n\nThe film is accurate in that students in Escalante's class had to retake the test, and all who retook the test passed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nThe movie gives the impression that the incident occurred in the second year Escalante was teaching, after students from his first year took a summer session for the calculus prerequisites. In fact, Escalante first began teaching at Garfield High School in 1974 and taught his first Advanced Placement Calculus course in 1978 with a group of 14 students, and it was in 1982 that the exam incident occurred. In the first year (1978), only five students remained in the course at the end of the year, only two of whom passed the AP Calculus exam.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=2010-03-31 |title=Jaime Escalante dies at 79; math teacher who challenged East L.A. students to 'Stand and Deliver' |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/31/local/la-me-jaime-escalante31-2010mar31/ |access-date=2012-01-16}}</ref> ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' stated, \"Unlike the students in the movie, the real Garfield students required years of solid preparation before they could take calculus...

He said that several points were left out of the film. He pointed out that no student who did not know multiplication tables or fractions was ever taught calculus in a single year. Also, he suffered [[cholecystitis|inflammation of the gall bladder]], not a heart attack.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nTen of the 1982 students signed waivers to allow the [[College Board]] to show their exams to [[Jay Mathews]], the author of ''Escalante: The Best Teacher in America''. Mathews found that nine of them had made \"identical silly mistakes\" on free response question six. Mathews heard from two of the students that during the exam, a piece of paper had been passed around with that flawed solution.<ref name=\"retest\" /> Twelve students, including the nine with the identical mistakes, retook the exam, and most of them received the top four and five scores. Mathews concluded that nine of the students did cheat, but they knew the material and did not need to.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nMathews wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that the Ana Delgado character \"was the only teenage character in the film based on a real person\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mathews |first=Jay |author-link=Jay Mathews |date=2010-04-04 |title=Lessons For a Lifetime |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/04/opinion/la-oe-mathews4-2010apr04 |access-date=2015-11-12}}</ref> and that her name had been changed.\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the movie holds a score of 90% from 61 reviews.
