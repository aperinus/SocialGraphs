It stars [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Dennis Quaid]] as an estranged couple, [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Roberts' sister, and [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Gena Rowlands]] as their parents.\n\nThe film's title stems from the [[Bonnie Raitt]] [[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|song of the same name]]. It was shot in various locations around [[Savannah, Georgia]] and [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].\n\n==Plot==\nGrace discovers that her husband, Eddie, is having an affair with another woman. After a wildly public confrontation with Eddie and his mistress, Grace packs up their daughter and returns home to her parents' horse farm to regroup. To her surprise and dismay, everyone around her is still mired in old fashioned ideals and believes she should forgive and forget Eddie's indiscretion. Her sister, Emma Rae, who is furious at Eddie and lets him know it, is also unwilling to let Grace pretend this has come out of nowhere, or that she did not make choices that led to her current predicament. Eddie, too, confronts Grace about her withdrawal from their life, and his feelings of abandonment after what started out as an affectionate, loving marriage. Her father feels the whole affair is dragging focus from an upcoming horse-jumping competition, but he and Grace's mother, Georgia, face their own set of problems with fidelity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Grace King Bichon - wife of Eddie, mother of Caroline, youngest daughter of Wyly and Georgia and younger sister of Emma Rae.
