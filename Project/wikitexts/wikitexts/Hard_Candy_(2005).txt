The film was directed by [[David Slade]], written by [[Brian Nelson (screenwriter)|Brian Nelson]], and stars [[Elliot Page]]{{efn|name=Elliot}} and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]. It was the first feature film for Slade, who had primarily directed [[music video]]s.\n\n''Hard Candy'' premiered at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]], and was screened at the [[Florida Film Festival]] in April 2006. It had a limited release in two theaters in the United States. The film made over $8 million at the box office, including $1 million domestically, on a budget of under $1 million.\n\n''Hard Candy'' won three awards at the 2005 [[Sitges Film Festival]], four awards at the [[M\u00e1laga Film Festival]], and was also awarded Overlooked Film of the Year at the 2006 Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards. Page won Best Actress at the [[Austin Film Critics Association Awards 2006|2006 Austin Film Critics Association Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n14-year-old Hayley Stark and 32-year-old photographer Jeff Kohlver engage in a sexually charged, flirtatious [[online chat]]. They then meet at a coffeehouse before going to Jeff's home. When they arrive, Jeff makes them drinks, but Hayley refuses by saying she was taught to never take a drink she has not mixed herself. Hayley goes to the kitchen and makes them both [[Screwdriver (cocktail)|screwdrivers.]] As Jeff shows her around his house, she notes the photographs hung on his walls, all of which seem to be of underage half clothed girls. Hayley asks Jeff to photograph her. He gets out his camera and Hayley begins to pose but before Jeff can take any photos, he loses consciousness.\n\nWhen Jeff wakes, he is bound to a desk chair. Hayley explains she has been tracking and baiting him through online chats and drugged him because she knows he is a [[sexual predator]] and murderer. Jeff denies these allegations, claiming he had innocent intentions. Hayley searches Jeff's house and finds a gun and a safe. In the safe, Hayley finds pictures, including a photo of Donna Mauer, a local girl who has been kidnapped and remains missing. Jeff continues to deny the accusations and kicks Hayley to the ground, temporarily knocking her out. He rolls the chair into his bedroom and manages to retrieve his gun, which Hayley left out on his bed. He returns to the living room to see that Hayley is no longer there; she comes up from behind him and wraps his face in plastic wrap, choking him unconscious.\n\nWhen Jeff wakes, he finds himself bound to a steel table with a bag of ice on his genitals, making them numb. Hayley tells him that she intends to [[Castration|castrate]] him and sets up his camera to take pictures of his genitals beforehand. Jeff attempts to dissuade her, including by telling her he was abused as a child in a play for sympathy, but fails. Hayley consults a medical book to guide her through the procedure, describing it to Jeff as she performs the operation. Once it is finished, Hayley puts down the scalpel and walks away, saying she needs a shower.\n\nJeff frees himself, only to realize that the \"surgery\" was a trick and he is unharmed. He picks up the scalpel and storms into the bathroom, where the shower is running. He slashes at the shower curtain, but finds the shower empty. Hayley attacks him from behind, and as they struggle, Hayley incapacitates him with a stun gun.\n\nHayley calls Jeff's ex-girlfriend Janelle and, posing as a police officer, asks her to come immediately to Jeff's house. Jeff regains consciousness to find that Hayley has bound his wrists and hoisted him to stand on a chair in his kitchen with a noose around his neck. Hayley makes Jeff an offer: if he commits suicide, she promises to erase the evidence of his crimes, but if he refuses, she will expose his secrets. The conversation is interrupted when a neighbor knocks on the front door, selling [[Girl Scout]] cookies. When Hayley returns, Jeff breaks from his bindings and pursues her to the roof of his house. Hayley has brought her rope from the kitchen and fashioned it into a noose secured to the chimney. Hayley keeps Jeff at bay with his gun.\n\nJeff confesses that he watched while another man raped and murdered Mauer. Jeff promises Hayley that, if she spares his life, he will tell her the other man's name so she can exact her revenge. Hayley reveals that she already knows his name, Aaron, and that Aaron said Jeff did it before he killed himself. Janelle arrives, and Hayley once again urges Jeff to hang himself, promising that she will destroy the evidence. Defeated, Jeff lets Hayley slide the noose around his neck, and steps off the roof. After he falls, Hayley says'' \"Or not\";'' \u2013 then gathers her belongings and walks away through the woods.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elliot Page]]<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Elliot\" /> as Hayley Stark\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Jeff Kohlver\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Judy Tokuda, the neighbor\n* Odessa Rae as Janelle Rogers\n* Erin Kraft as Donna Mauer in photos\n* Gabe Kerr as Nighthawks Clerk\n* Cori Bright as Girl in Nighthawks\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for ''Hard Candy'' came from a news story producer David W. Higgins saw on ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' about young Japanese girls who would lure older businessmen to a location with the promise of meaningful conversation, only to [[assault]] and [[Robbery|mug]] the men with a gang of other girls. This led him to wonder, \"What if the person you expect to be the predator is not who you expect it to be? What if it's the other person?\" He shared this question with writer [[Brian Nelson (screenwriter)|Brian Nelson]] who worked out a treatment and then a script on spec, and then Higgins and Nelson approached David Slade to direct. Due to the controversial nature of the work, the budget was kept under $1 million so that the production company would not ask to change anything.<ref name=\"MakingOf\"/>\n\nVery little [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] was used in the film, with only a couple of lines modified in post-production. Only nine minutes of music are present in the film, with ambient sounds, such as heavy breathing, making up most of the [[soundtrack]]. The film was shot in 18 days, largely in sequence, and mostly on a [[soundstage]]. Hayley wears a red hooded sweatshirt that is often seen as an [[allusion]] to \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\". However, this was a serendipitous wardrobe choice by the creative team that was not realized until later on.<ref name=\"MakingOf\"/> International marketing for the film made  use of this allusion. For example, a tagline on the Japanese site for the film reads: \"Red Hood traps [[Big Bad Wolf|the Wolf]] in his own game.\"<ref>Original Japanese text:\u8d64\u305a\u304d\u3093\u304c\u4ed5\u639b\u3051\u308b\u30aa\u30aa\u30ab\u30df\u3078\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemarise.com/theater/archives/films/2006016.html|title=\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9 \u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3 Hard candy |work=cinemarise.com |access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nJean-Clement Soret was the [[Color grading|digital colorist]] for the film, this being one of the few instances in which a colorist received a spot in the opening credits.<ref name=\"commentary1\">{{cite AV media |people= [[David Slade]] (director) |year=2006 |title= DVD audio commentary with director David Slate and writer Brian Nelson|medium= DVD|publisher=Lions Gate |id= B000GI3KGC }}</ref> The film contains many coloring effects and \"density shifts\" of lighting to reflect the moods of the characters. For example, when Hayley gets angry, the colors would be edited to be of lower frequency. One effect used which, as far as the director is aware, had not been done in cinema before, was to brighten the lighting in filming and correct everything down in post-production. This allowed for facial details to be visible even while having a darkened atmosphere.<ref name=\"MakingOf\"/> According to the DVD extras, the process required a custom-built [[digital intermediate]] to be made and proved to be extremely difficult, with corrections having to be made frame-by-frame in some instances. This technique, known as [[ETTR]], is a standard procedure in digital photography and cinematography to minimize the amount of noise in shadows and midtones.\n\nNelson's early [[working title]]s of the script were ''Vendetta'' and ''Snip Snip''. When Higgins asked for a title with a \"sugar and spice combination and a mixture of harsh roughness, innocence, and vulnerability\", Nelson proposed the title ''Hard Candy''.<ref name=\"commentary1\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film premiered at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]] with a midnight screening. The [[Dolby Surround]] System failed before the screening and the audience was kept out until it was repaired.<ref name=\"MakingOf\" /> ''Hard Candy'' was also screened at the [[Florida Film Festival]] on April 1, 2006.<ref name=\"FFF\">{{cite news |last= Schneider |first= Steve |title= CLOSING FRAMES \u2013 What to watch for in the final weekend of the Florida Film Festival |work= [[Orlando Weekly]] |date= March 30, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213212816/http://www2.orlandoweekly.com/film/story.asp?id=10590 |url=http://www2.orlandoweekly.com/film/story.asp?id=10590 |archive-date=December 13, 2013 |access-date= December 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Hard Candy'' opened in two theaters in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]] on April 14, 2006<ref name=\"MakingOf\" /> in a [[limited release]].
