The screenplay, [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from the 2004 [[The Jane Austen Book Club|novel of the same name]] by [[Karen Joy Fowler]], focuses on a [[Book discussion club|book club]] formed specifically to discuss the six novels written by [[Jane Austen]]. As they delve into Austen's literature, the book club members find themselves dealing with life experiences that parallel the themes of the books they are reading.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorc\u00e9e Bernadette ([[Kathy Baker]]), who develops the idea when she meets Prudie ([[Emily Blunt]]), a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Bernadette plans to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels ([[Pride and Prejudice]], [[Sense and Sensibility]], [[Emma (novel)|Emma]], [[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]], [[Mansfield Park]], and [[Northanger Abbey]]), with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia ([[Amy Brenneman]]), a librarian recently separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel ([[Jimmy Smits]]) after over two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra ([[Maggie Grace]]); Jocelyn ([[Maria Bello]]), a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]]s, and Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg ([[Hugh Dancy]]), a science fiction fan invited into the group by Jocelyn with the hope to match him with Sylvia.\n\nAs the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters, and reacts to events in their lives similarly to their fictional counterparts. Bernadette is the matriarchal figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion (eventually reconciling with Daniel). Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie is encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean ([[Marc Blucas]]), and free-spirited, [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-smoking, aging [[hippie]] mother Mama Sky ([[Lynn Redgrave]]), who dies in a car accident. Prudie also finds herself desperately trying to resist her feelings for seductive student Trey ([[Kevin Zegers]]), meanwhile accusing Dean of coming on to her high-school acquaintance at Mama Sky's funeral. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed because her partner, aspiring writer Corinne ([[Parisa Fitz-Henley]]), uses Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]] novels he hoped would interest her. He also serves as the comedic [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Jocelyn's and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.\n\nThe last book club meeting is held on the beach. Daniel wants to join the book club after reading ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' with Allegra at the hospital after suffering a [[concussion]] from an [[Climbing wall#Indoor climbing|indoor climbing]] accident. Sylvia lets Daniel into the book club. Grigg brings his elder sister Cat Harris ([[Nancy Travis]]), who persuades Jocelyn to take a chance on Grigg because he loves her. Allegra brings Dr. Yep ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), who treated her concussion. Prudie, the scheduled host, does not attend. Instead, she goes to meet Trey, but reconsiders after considering what Jane Austen would do. Prudie goes home to Dean and reads ''Persuasion'' with him, helping them rediscover their love. Daniel leaves a letter for Sylvia at her doorstep. Upon reading it, she accepts Daniel back.\n\nJocelyn finally reads the books Grigg gave to her and is surprised to find that she loves them, cannot sleep, and finishes them in a single night. Jocelyn drives to Grigg's house, realises the very early time, and snoozes in her car. When Grigg exits his house, he sees Jocelyn's car and knocks on her window. Jocelyn finally gives in to her feelings and they both passionately kiss.\n\nOne year later, the book club meets at Sylvia's library charity dinner. Grigg and Jocelyn are together, Sylvia and Daniel have reconciled, Prudie, who is pregnant, attends with Dean (who appears more enthusiastic about Austen), and Bernadette introduces her (seventh) husband.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Jocelyn\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Prudie\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Bernadette\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Grigg\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Sylvia\n* [[Maggie Grace]] as Allegra\n* [[Jimmy Smits]] as Daniel\n* [[Marc Blucas]] as Dean\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Mama Sky\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Trey\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Cat Harris\n* [[Parisa Fitz-Henley]] as Corinne\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Dr. Samantha Yep\n* [[Myndy Crist]] as Lynne\n\n==Production==\nIn ''The Book Club Deconstructed'', a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] release of the film, screenwriter/director Robin Swicord explains how each of the six book club members is based on a character in one of Austen's novels. Bernadette represents Mrs. Gardiner in ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', Sylvia is patterned after Fanny Price in ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', Jocelyn reflects the title character in ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', Prudie is similar to Anne Elliot in ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', Allegra is most like Marianne in ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', and Grigg represents all of Austen's misunderstood male characters.\n\nAlthough the film is set in [[Sacramento]], it was shot in [[Southern California]]. Filming locations included [[Encino, California|Encino]], [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Los Angeles]], [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], [[Northridge, California|Northridge]], [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]], and [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]].\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack includes \"New Shoes\" by [[Paolo Nutini]], \"You're All I Have\" by [[Snow Patrol]], \"Save Me\" by [[Aimee Mann]], \"So Sorry\" by [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], and \"Getting Some Fun Out of Life\" by [[Madeleine Peyroux]].\n\n==Release==\n{{Anchor|Release|Box office}} \nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] before going into limited release in the US.

I settled down with this movie as with a comfortable book.

It's all a tad too neatly packaged, like a brand new set of Austen with the bindings unbroken. Still, a lively ensemble cast works hard ... Swicord's gift as a screenwriter is that her catch-up summaries avoid sounding pedantic or like [[CliffsNotes]]. She's less assured as a director. Her pacing is off, with some scenes going on longer than they need to and others whizzing by so fast you miss the nuances. Relationships aren't always as clear as they should be. Still, Austen devotees are sure to lap up the central premise that her notions of love and friendship are as relevant today as ever. And if ''The Jane Austen Book Club'' gets people thinking about forming a club of their own, it will have served a more admirable purpose than most movies.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Ruthe Stein, Chronicle Senior Movie Writer |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/21/DD9QRM3FQ.DTL |title= Review: 'Jane Austen Book Club' is many adaptations in one |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref>\n\nCarina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said it was nice to see \"a movie so alive to the pleasures of reading and writing and sharing books, especially when the love feels sincere ... in parts, the story feels awkwardly truncated or too shallow to matter. But Swicord has a playful sense of humor and a good ear for dialogue, and the movie pleasantly accomplishes what it set out to accomplish.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= September 21, 2007 |last= Ferguson |first= Dana |title= 'The Jane Austen Book Club' |url= http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-jane21sep21,0,6874362.story |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071214193509/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/chocano/cl-et-jane21sep21,0,6874362.story |archive-date= 2007-12-14 |url-status= dead |publisher=Calendarlive.com |accessdate= 2019-08-16 }}</ref>\n\nDennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"While there are occasional forced notes ...
