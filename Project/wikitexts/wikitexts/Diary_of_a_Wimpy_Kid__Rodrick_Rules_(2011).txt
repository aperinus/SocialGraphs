It stars [[Zachary Gordon]] and [[Devon Bostick]]. [[Robert Capron]], [[Rachael Harris]], [[Steve Zahn]], and [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] also have prominent roles.\n\nThe film was released on March 25, 2011, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It earned $72.4 million on a budget of $18\u201321 million. It is the second installment in the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film series]], preceded by 2010's ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2010 film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''. A sequel followed in 2012, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\n{{Long plot|date=May 2022}}\nThe Heffley family attends a back-to-school roller skating party, where Greg, now about to start seventh grade, meets a new girl named Holly Hills, whom he instantly develops a crush on.\n\nA local talent show is advertised on TV, and Rodrick sees it as his band's big break. Susan, who writes a parenting column in the local paper, wants to get Greg and Rodrick to spend more time together and incentivizes them with money. However, at church the following Sunday, Rodrick stains Greg's pants with chocolate, humiliating Greg and causing a public scuffle between the two and getting them prohibited from the family's upcoming trip to the water park. Susan and Frank leave the two home for the weekend to work on their differences, during which Rodrick, against his parents' orders, throws a wild party that Greg and his best friend Rowley end up participating in. The next morning, their parents unexpectedly announce they will be returning early from their trip due to Manny being ill, prompting the brothers to hastily clean up the house. They find that someone wrote \"Rodrick Rules\" on the bathroom door in permanent marker. Greg gets the idea to replace it with a door in the basement, though after their family gets home, they realize that the replacement door does not have a lock.\n\nRodrick tells Greg to deny everything, but Susan soon realizes the lock is gone and confronts Greg over it. Greg confesses that he and Rodrick had people over, but lies, saying it was only a band practice and begs Susan to not punish Rodrick. Susan agrees to this, and Rodrick, believing that Greg kept their secret, gains respect for his younger brother. The two start spending more time together, and Rodrick gives Greg advice on school and girls, though most of it gets Greg in trouble.\n\nOne night, Susan and Frank end up finding pictures of Rodrick's party. Greg is grounded for two weeks with no video games, while Rodrick is grounded for a month and forbidden from participating in the talent show, leaving him distraught. Having learned that Greg partially admitted the truth to Susan earlier on, Rodrick states that they may be brothers, but will never be friends. Greg and Rodrick are punished further by being forced to spend the weekend at their grandfather's retirement home, but Greg ends up running into Holly, and the two become friends.\n\nAt the talent show the next week, Rodrick finds out that he has been booted from his band by Bill Walter, a guitarist who recently joined; and Rowley is not able to perform his magic tricks due to his assistant having stage fright. Greg offers to participate in Rowley's magic act if Susan allows Rodrick to perform, which she agrees to. The magic act is praised by the crowd, including Holly, but people are unimpressed by Rodrick's band act until Susan starts dancing at the edge of the stage, which prompts the crowd to join in. Frank tapes the entire footage of Susan dancing, agreeing with Greg to keep it a secret. Rodrick removes Bill from the band in retaliation and reconciles with Greg.\n\nIn a mid-credit scene, Greg and Rowley upload the footage of Susan dancing to [[YouTube]], which goes viral. Rodrick learns about this, and shouts \u201cGreg, you are so dead!\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters}}\n* [[Zachary Gordon]] as [[Greg Heffley|Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley]], the middle son of Susan and Frank and the brother of Rodrick and Manny.\n* [[Devon Bostick]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Rodrick Heffley|Rodrick Heffley]], Greg and Manny's older brother and Susan and Frank\u2019s oldest son who is a drummer and a bully.\n** Conner Ingram as young Rodrick.\n* Connor and Owen Fielding as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Manny Heffley|Manny Heffley]], Rodrick and Greg's younger brother and Susan and Frank\u2019s youngest son who never gets into trouble.\n* [[Robert Capron]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Rowley Jefferson|Rowley Jefferson]], Greg's childish best friend.\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as  [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Susan Heffley|Susan Heffley]], Rodrick, Greg, and Manny's mother.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Frank Heffley|Frank Heffley]], Rodrick, Greg, and Manny's father.\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as  [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Holly Hills|Holly Hills]], Greg's love interest.\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Bill Walter|Bill Walter]], a brief new member of Rodrick's band whom Frank dislikes.\n* [[Grayson Russell]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Fregley|Fregley]], Greg's weird classmate.\n* [[Karan Brar]] as Chirag Gupta, a friend of Greg's.\n* [[Laine MacNeil]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Patty Farrell|Patty Farrell]], Greg's arch-enemy since kindergarten.\n* John Shaw as Mr. Draybick, Greg's history teacher who used to have Rodrick as a student.\n* Bryce Hodgson as Ben, one of Rodrick's friends.\n* [[Terence Kelly (actor)|Terence Kelly]] as  [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Grandpa Heffley|Grandpa Heffley]], Frank's father and Rodrick, Greg, and Manny's grandfather.\n* [[Belita Moreno]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Mrs. Norton|Mrs. Norton]], an acting teacher at Greg's school.\n* [[Andrew McNee]] as [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Coach Malone|Coach Malone]], Greg's gym teacher.\n* [[Alf Humphreys|Alfred E.
