The film stars [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Burt Lancaster]]. It follows a bedridden woman, who overhears the plot of murder. While on the telephone, she attempts to help her husband solve the mystery and prevent the crime. Stanwyck was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. It is one of the few pre-1950 [[Paramount Pictures]] films which remained in the studio's library (the rest are currently owned by [[NBCUniversal]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Radio play==\n[[Lucille Fletcher]]'s play originally aired on the ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' radio program on May 25, 1943, essentially a one-woman show with [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Mrs. Stevenson, an imperious invalid who accidentally intercepts a phone call between two men plotting a murder for that evening. She tries to enlist the help of the telephone operator, the police, and a hospital, becoming more frantic as the time passes. In the final moments of the play, she realizes that [[Contract killing|she herself is the intended victim]]. The play was reprised seven times (on August 21, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1948, 1952, 1957 and 1960). The final broadcast was on February 14, 1960. [[Orson Welles]] called ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' \"the greatest single radio script ever written\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings|title=The Hitch-Hiker|publisher=[[The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air]], June 21, 1946, (at 1:00), at the [[Internet Archive]]|access-date=2014-08-04|date=1988-02-24}}</ref> In 2015, the broadcast was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for inclusion in the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nLeona Stevenson is a spoiled, bedridden daughter of wealthy businessman James Cotterell. She tries to reach her husband, Henry. The servants are absent and she is alone in the apartment. She overhears two men planning a [[murder]] on a crossed telephone connection. The call cuts off without Leona learning much other than it is scheduled for the night. She fails to call the telephone company and the police for a few details.\n\nWhile finding Henry, Leona recalls her past. She learns that the [[secretary]] met Henry that day with an attractive woman named Sally Lord and did not return to the office. Leona recognizes the woman as Sally Hunt, a college friend in love with Henry, and at the time was poor and working in a drug store. Leona took Henry from Sally, and married him against her father's wish. Sally later married Fred Lord, a lawyer in the district attorney's office. From overheard conversations, she learns her husband was close to resolving an investigation about Henry somehow. Sally is concerned she follows her husband and two associates to a mysterious meeting at an abandoned house on [[Staten Island]]. The house sign is owned by Waldo Evans, a chemist working for Leona's father. Sally arranged to meet Henry after warning him. He received a phone call, left the table and did not return. Sally concludes that the house was destroyed, Morano has been arrested by the police, and Waldo escaped them.\n\nLeona receives a message from Henry, stating he left the town for work he had forgotten about and he will return on Sunday. Leona calls Dr. Phillip Alexander, the specialist she came to New York to see regarding her lifelong heart troubles. Alexander reveals that he gave Henry her prognosis ten days ago, something that Henry kept from her. In a flashback, Leona had gone some years without any cardiac episodes, before marrying Henry. Henry learns about her health issues for a few years, when she suffered a [[cardiac arrest]] during a quarrel. It becomes clear Leona tries to use Henry, insisting he worked for her father even though he is bored. As their troubles become severe, Leona's attacks become frequent, until she is bedridden. However, Alexander diagnoses the problems as purely [[psychosomatic]]; nothing is wrong with her physically, but he thinks she needs psychiatric help.\n\nLeona calls Waldo. He reluctantly discloses that Henry recruited him to steal chemicals from the Cotterell drug company and sell them for Morano. Henry tried to bypass Morano when Waldo was transferred. However, Morano and his thugs tricked Henry into signing an [[IOU]] for $200,000 for a lost profit in three months. When Henry protested he had insufficient money, Morano pointed out that Leona has a large insurance policy. With Morano in custody, Waldo stresses that Henry no longer needs to raise the sum. He gives Leona a number to reach Henry, but when she calls and discovers that it is for the [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|city morgue]]. The distraught Leona phones a nurse at the hospital. A frantic Henry calls Leona from a [[telephone booth]]. She hears an unnamed intruder sneaking inside the house, and tells Henry that she is the victim of the murder plot. Henry tells Leona to leave the house, but she is killed by the intruder and the phoneline goes off. As the police arrest Henry, he re-dials the phone, only for the killer to pick it up and send a reply to him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Leona Stevenson\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Henry J.

The film plays in [[Real time (media)|real time]] with many flashbacks, and adds more characters and backstories. The bedroom window overlooks the night skyline of [[Manhattan]]. The film is shot very dark, with looming shadows and a circling camera used to maintain a high level of suspense.<ref>[http://www.noiroftheweek.com/2008/06/sorry-wrong-number-1948.html Eifert, Steve].
