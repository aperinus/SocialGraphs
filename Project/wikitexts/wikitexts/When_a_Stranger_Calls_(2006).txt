The film stars [[Camilla Belle]], [[Brian Geraghty]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Tessa Thompson]] and [[Clark Gregg]]. Belle plays a babysitter who starts to receive threatening phone calls from an unidentified stranger, played by both [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] and [[Lance Henriksen]]. It is a remake of [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]]'s [[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|1979 horror film of the same name]], which became a [[cult classic]] for its opening 20 minutes, which this remake extends to a feature-length film.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on February 3, 2006. It was panned by critics but was a moderate box office success, grossing $67 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA local sheriff enters a home where multiple homicides have been committed; the victims are three children and their babysitter, all slaughtered brutally by an intruder using his bare hands.\n\nIn Colorado, 125 miles away from the crime scene, sixteen-year-old Jill Johnson ([[Camilla Belle]]) is on her way to babysit for the wealthy Mandrakis family, as punishment for exceeding her cell phone minutes. When she arrives, Mrs Mandrakis shows her around and tells her about their live-in housemaid, Rosa.\n\nA long time after the parents leave, Jill begins to receive obscene phone calls from someone (voiced by [[Lance Henriksen]]) who, most of the time, does not say anything and then hangs up. She initially believes it is her friends playing a prank but when she contacts them, they deny it. While the Mandrakis' two children are asleep upstairs, Jill is visited by her friend Tiffany ([[Katie Cassidy]]) but, in fear of getting into further trouble, Jill asks her to leave. While returning to her car, Tiffany is ambushed by an unseen intruder.\n\nJill receives a call from the person, indicating he can see her. Alarmed, she calls the police, who tell her they can trace the calls if she is able to keep him on the line for at least sixty seconds. While waiting for the phone to ring, Jill sees a shadow moving in the guest house. Believing it is the Mandrakis' son back from college, she goes to investigate, but finds the guest house empty. While in the guest house, the phone rings and it's the same caller. This only confirms her fear that he's watching her. She keeps him on the phone so the call can be traced, only to remember he called the wrong line. Jill looks out the window and sees Rosa's vehicles light come on.\n\nBelieving Rosa is home, Jill searches for her, but finds no one is there. The phone rings again, and the caller remains quiet on the other end, and Jill manages to keep him on the line for a minute so the call can be traced. Jill then hears the shower running in the maid's room but, upon checking, the bathroom is empty. The police then tell her the calls are coming from inside the house. Horrified, Jill finds Tiffany\u2019s body on the bathroom floor and flees.\n\nJill goes to the children who are already hiding in their playroom. She looks up and sees the intruder ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]) in the loft. They all escape into the greenhouse and hide; Jill discovers Rosa's dead body under the water. The intruder enters and searches the greenhouse. Jill manages to lock him inside but he breaks out and attacks her. During the altercation, Jill manages to stab the assailant's hand into the hardwood floor with a fireplace poker, before rushing out of the house into the arms of a police officer. The assailant is arrested.\n\nDays later while recovering in the hospital, Jill awakens to a phone ringing. She gets out of bed and, while looking at her reflection in the mirror, the assailant appears behind her and grabs her. She begins to shriek hysterically, waking from her hallucination as the doctors and her father desperately try to stop her frantic panicking.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Camilla Belle]] as Jill Johnson\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as The Stranger\n** [[Lance Henriksen]] as The Stranger (voice)\n* [[Katie Cassidy]] as Tiffany Madison\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Scarlett\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Bobby\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Ben Johnson\n* [[Derek de Lint]] as Dr. Mandrakis\n* [[Kate Jennings Grant]] as Kelly Mandrakis\n* [[David Denman]] as Officer Burroughs\n* Arthur Young as Will Mandrakis\n* [[Madeline Carroll]] as Allison Mandrakis\n* [[Steve Eastin]] as Detective Harv Hines\n* John Bobek as Officer Lewis\n* Brad Surosky as \"Boom-Boom\"\n* Karina Logue as Track Coach\n* Rosine Ace Hatem as Rosa Ramirez\n* Escher Holloway as Cody\n* Owen Smith as Police Officer\n* Jessica Faye Helmer as Additional Police Officer\n* Lillie West as Stacy (voice)\n* [[Dianna Agron]] as Cheerleader\n\n==Production==\n[[Screen Gems]] first announced production of ''When a Stranger Calls'' in August 2004, with Jake Wade Wall penning the script. Screen Gems had plans to release both a remake of the original film and a sequel titled ''When a Stranger Returns''.<ref>{{cite web|last=LaPorte|first=Nicole|title='Stranger' redials|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/stranger-redials-1117908922/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=March 18, 2017|date=August 10, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Balchack|first=Brian|title=Screen Gems plans remakes of When a Stranger Calls and it' sequel When a Stranger Returns|url=https://movieweb.com/screen-gems-plans-remakes-of-when-a-stranger-calls-and-it-sequel-when-a-stranger-returns/|website=[[MovieWeb]]|date=August 11, 2004|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Evan Rachel Wood]] was offered the role of Jill, but turned it down. [[Camilla Belle]] was then approached and almost turned the role down due to her personal dislike for horror films but West, the director, convinced her that he was going more for a [[psychological thriller]] and so she accepted. To prepare for the role, Belle had to do two months of weight-training and learning how to run. Belle was injured twice on the set; she struck a wooden bridge, cutting and scarring her hand, and also slammed her head against a glass window.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Michael J.|url=http://www.radiofree.com/profiles/camilla_belle/interview02.shtml|title=Camilla Belle on 'When a Stranger Calls'|website=RadioFree.com|date=February 2, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fienberg|first=Daniel|url=https://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/camilla-belle-answers-when-a-stranger-calls/article_38ca2ae7-e5f3-5ecc-91ae-37df784713ae.html|title=Camilla Belle answers 'When a Stranger Calls'|work=[[Daily Herald (Utah)|Daily Herald]]|date=February 5, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/what-would-you-do-when-a-stranger-calls/|title=What Would You Do When a Stranger Calls?|website=MovieWeb|date=February 3, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] occurred from January 1 to February 28, 2005, in Vancouver, Canada. [[Bellarmine-Jefferson High School]] was used to portray the high school seen in the film while [[Signal Hill, California|Signal Hill]] was used to portray the carnival shown in the film. [[Running Springs]] was used as the filming location for the road sequences.

When messaged, \"Jill\" (a [[Colloquis]]-style program) made small talk before panicking, as she received calls from a stranger asking her to check the children. She then gives the user her phone number (a toll-free 877 number) and asks them to call her. When users call, they hear an ad for the movie.\nAlso, around the time of the DVD release, a new screen name appeared, Jill051606, to tie in with the DVD release date on May 16, 2006. It does not involve calling her, but instead she directs users to a video security system on the official DVD site where the shadow of the stranger passes by frequently.\n\nAs a marketing promotion for the film, a MySpace profile was created for Jill051606 featuring photos from the film. Users could add the profile as a friend, leave comments, and read Jill's blog.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] and [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] on May 16, 2006. Special features include two audio commentaries (one with Camilla Belle and Simon West; the other with Jake Wade Wall), [[deleted scene]]s, a 20-minute making-of featurette, and trailers. A [[Blu-ray]] version of the film was released for the first time by Mill Creek Entertainment on October 4, 2016 in a triple feature with ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) and ''[[Vacancy (film)|Vacancy]]'' (2007).

This sequel never materialized.\n\nWriter Jake Wade Wall discussed the possibility of a sequel in September 2020. His treatment would have the film be a remake of the second half of the original film, where Jill Johnson is older now and has a family and the killer has escaped the asylum, citing the success of ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018) as an inspiration.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3632405/stranger-returns-writer-jake-wade-wall-dials-details-unmade-sequel-phantom-limbs/ |first=Jason|last=Jenkins|title= 'When a Stranger Returns': Writer Jake Wade Wall Dials Up Details On His Unmade Sequel [Phantom Limbs] |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |date=September 18, 2020 |access-date= June 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs]]\n* ''[[When a Killer Calls]]'' (2006), a mockbuster of this film released by [[The Asylum]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/whenastrangercalls/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0455857|When a Stranger Calls}}\n* {{mojo title|whenastrangercalls06|When a Stranger Calls}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|when_a_stranger_calls|When a Stranger Calls}}\n* {{snopes|link=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/madmen/babysit.htm|title=The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs}}\n\n{{When a Stranger Calls}}\n{{Simon West}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:When A Stranger Calls}}\n[[Category:When a Stranger Calls (film series)]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 horror films]]\n[[Category:2006 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American psychological horror films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:American teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Davis Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films about stalking]]\n[[Category:Films based on urban legends]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Simon West]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Davis]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Wyck Godfrey]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Dooley]]\n[[Category:Home invasions in film]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:Teen thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about telephony]]\n[[Category:Thriller film remakes]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
