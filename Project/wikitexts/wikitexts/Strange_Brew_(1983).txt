Co-stars include [[Max von Sydow]], [[Paul Dooley]], [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[Angus MacInnes]].\n\nLoosely based on elements of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', most of the film was shot in [[Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Parts were also filmed in [[Prince George, British Columbia]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo unemployed brothers, [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]] ([[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]), screen a poorly-made film they have produced to a theater audience. When the disappointed patrons become hostile, they release a jar of moths into the theater, which disrupts the showing and allows them to escape without issuing refunds. The next day, the two place a live mouse in an empty beer bottle in an attempt to [[blackmail]] the local [[The Beer Store|beer store]] into giving them free Elsinore beer, but they are told to take their complaint to Elsinore brewery's management; when they do so, they are given jobs on the [[Assembly line|bottling line]] inspecting for mice in bottles.\n\nMeanwhile, the evil [[Brewmaster|Brewmeister]] Smith ([[Max von Sydow]]) is perfecting a secret plan to take over the world by adulterating Elsinore beer with a mind control drug which, while rendering the consumer docile, also makes him or her attack others when certain musical tones are played. Smith tests this spiked beer on patients of the neighbouring Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane, which is connected to the brewery by tunnels.\n\nBob and Doug learn that the brewery's former owner, John Elsinore, has recently died under mysterious circumstances and his daughter Pam ([[Lynne Griffin]]) has been given full control of the Elsinore brewery. While exploring the massive complex, they find a shuttered cafeteria containing an old Galactic Border Patrol video game, which supernaturally reveals that Brewmeister Smith murdered John Elsinore and that Pam's bumbling Uncle Claude ([[Paul Dooley]]) was involved. Bob recognizes a brewery employee as former hockey great Jean \"Rosie\" LeRose ([[Angus MacInnes]]), who suffered a career-ending [[nervous breakdown]] and has fallen under Smith's control.\n\nEventually, Bob and Doug wander into the Brewmeister's operations room while he is away, and Doug takes a [[floppy disk]] containing a video of John Elsinore's murder (thinking it is a \"[[New wave music|new wave]] [[Extended play|EP]] [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]\" and not realizing the importance of its contents). Smith and Claude tranquilize the brothers and arrange to frame them for murder, concealing Pam and her father's friend, Henry Green ([[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]]), in beer kegs in the back of their sabotaged van, and instruct the brothers to deliver the kegs to a party. Unable to stop, the brothers careen into [[Lake Ontario]]. All survive (Pam with apparent memory loss), and the brothers are arrested.\n\nThe brothers' bizarre antics at their trial cause the judge to declare them insane and put them under Brewmeister Smith's care at the asylum. Rosie soon finds them and helps them escape, and they find and rescue Pam. Having figured out the Brewmeister's plan, Rosie foments an uprising among the brainwashed mental-patient test subjects. The brothers separate for the first time in their lives. Doug and a group of asylum inmates help capture Claude, while Rosie and another group overpower Brewmeister Smith. The spirit of John Elsinore, possessing the brewery's electrical system, electrocutes Smith when he is shoved against his light-up world map. Meanwhile, Smith has locked Pam and Bob in a brewery tank and begins filling it with beer; they escape when Bob consumes all the beer, expanding to a cartoonish size.\n\nJohn Elsinore's ghost warns them that Smith has already shipped tainted beer to [[Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest|Oktoberfest]] and urges them to prevent the beer from being consumed. The police accompany the brothers back to their house to retrieve their dog, Hosehead, to invade the party. Enticed by promises of free beer and sausages, Hosehead leaps into the air and flies over the city like [[Superman]]. He crashes into the tent at the celebration and, mistaken for a skunk, frightens people away from the tainted beer. In the end, the McKenzie Brothers are heroes and Pam and Rosie find true love. Bob and Doug are allowed to haul away the contaminated beer, apparently to try to drink it all. The movie ends with an over-the-credits commentary by Bob and Doug about the movie and select crew members as their names scroll by in the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] as Doug McKenzie\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as Bob McKenzie\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Brewmeister Smith\n* [[Lynne Griffin]] as Pam Elsinore\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Jean \"Rosie\" LeRose\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Uncle Claude\n* [[Brian McConnachie]] as Ted\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as voice of Father McKenzie\n* Tom Harvey as The Inspector\n* [[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]] as Henry Green\n* Len Doncheff as Jack Hawkland\n* Buddy the Dog as Hosehead\n* Chris Benson as Hospital Orderly\n\n==Production==\nIn 1981, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas recorded a Bob and Doug McKenzie comedy album, ''[[The Great White North (album)|The Great White North]]'', which sold a million copies.<ref name=\"godfrey\">{{cite news | last = Godfrey | first = Stephen | title = Hoser Brothers Hope Beer Film will Take Off, Eh? | work = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = August 26, 1983 }}</ref> Based on this success, they thought about parlaying that success into a feature film.<ref name=\"plume\">{{cite news | last = Plume | first = Kenneth | title = Interview with Dave Thomas | work = [[IGN]] | date = February 10, 2000 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035845p1.html | access-date = 2009-07-22 }}</ref> After fellow ''SCTV'' cast member [[John Candy]] got an offer from [[Universal Pictures]] to do a film called ''[[Going Berserk]]'', Moranis and Thomas started talking about writing a screenplay for a Bob and Doug film. Andrew Alexander, executive producer for ''SCTV,'' reminded them that he had exclusive contracts with the two men and that if they wrote a script, he would sue them.<ref name=\"plume\" /> Moranis and Thomas soon found themselves faced with the challenge of expanding their improvisations on ''SCTV'' from \"two guys talking about how hard it was to get parking spaces in donut shops to a full-length story\", Thomas said in an interview.<ref name=\"godfrey\" />\n\nMoranis and Thomas hired [[Steve De Jarnatt]] to write the first draft.<ref name=\"plume\" /> Initially, Thomas told De Jarnatt that he wanted to base the film's story on ''[[Hamlet]]'', but De Jarnatt's draft was too faithful to the play and he was told be more creative with the parallels. Moranis' and Thomas' agents sent the script to various Hollywood studios, and a few days later they had a deal with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] based not on the script but on record sales, \"the breakout potential, and the fact that it was being advertised on a television show\", Thomas remembers.<ref name=\"plume\" /> MGM was unhappy with the script because Bob and Doug were improvised characters done in their \"comic voices\" and they felt that nobody but themselves could write for these characters.<ref name=\"plume\" /> Thomas began rewriting the script without Moranis, who was now uncertain about doing the film. After working on the first 50 pages, Moranis took a look at what Thomas had done and they then worked together rewriting it. However, they were not sure just how much they could legally change and did most of the changes in the first third of the script, including the addition of Bob and Doug's science fiction film, ''Mutants of 2051 A.D.'', which Bob and Doug were shown watching in a movie theater, causing a riot. Thomas remembers that the script was \"far more bizarre and conceptual in the beginning ... if we had been able to rewrite the whole thing, we would have made the whole thing like that\".<ref name=\"plume\" />\n\nOriginally, Moranis and Thomas were not going to direct or write the film but ended up doing both with the guidance of executive producer Jack Grossberg, who had produced films by [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Woody Allen]]. They were given a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"godfrey\" /> Before filming, all of the major breweries wanted the McKenzie brothers to appear in beer advertisements. The filmmakers had the promise of the [[Molson]] Brewery, but once the brewery found out that there was a joke in the film about putting a mouse in a beer bottle, they distanced themselves from the film. The filmmakers were also banned from filming in a [[The Beer Store|Brewers Retail]] store, and from using the name \"Brewers Retail\". The filmmakers instead built a replica of a Brewers Retail store at a cost of more than $45,000, calling it \"The Beer Store\". Filming also took place at the Old Fort Brewing Co. in Prince George, British Columbia.<ref name=\"godfrey\" /> The emergency vehicles used during filming were all real [[Metropolitan Toronto Police]] [[squad cars]]. The ambulances used briefly were on loan from [[Toronto EMS|Metropolitan Toronto Ambulance]].\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Strange Brew'' has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 25 critics with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though lowbrow in intent and outcome, Strange Brew effectively mines laughs from its unique premise and likeable stars.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_brew/ |title=Strange Brew |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= 2022-06-21 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film received a score of 50 based on six reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Strange Brew|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/strange-brew|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=2022-06-21}}</ref>\nIn her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"Anyone who's partial to the McKenzies' humor doubtless has a fondness for beer.

(Full title: ''The Adventures of Bob and Doug McKenzie: Strange Brew - Excerpts from the Original Soundtrack''). Most of the album consisted of comedy sketches and film dialogue, while the music sampling was usually accompanied by the characters' commentary. The main title theme was performed by Thomas' brother, [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]]. The album was produced by Marc Giacomelli, Rick Shurman and Ian Thomas. \nThe soundtrack won the Canadian [[Juno Award]] for Best Comedy Album in 1984. Moranis and Thomas accepted the award in character at the awards ceremony on 5 December 1984, which was hosted by [[Joe Flaherty]] and SCTV alum [[Andrea Martin]].\nThe album was only available for a short time and currently remains out of print. This was the last album released by the duo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Brew-Bob-Doug-McKenzie/dp/B000P87G4K/ref=sr_1_46?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1343501656&sr=1-46&keywords=strange+brew |title=Strange Brew: Music |website=Amazon |date=2008-02-22 |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobanddoug.com/albums.html |title=Albums |publisher=BobAndDoug.com |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/music_strangebrew.htm |title=Strange Brew Soundtrack and Movie Music - The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Motion picture score==\nAs with the soundtrack album, the motion picture score was released for a short time and remains out of print.

The book also included a joke library card with the names of numerous Canadian celebrities who had checked it out.

Co-written by Dave Thomas and Paul Flaherty, the film was to be directed by Flaherty, and [[Dan Aykroyd]] was on board to play the part of friend Rick Ripple. Principal photography was to begin on July 19, 1999 in [[Toronto]]. At one point, [[Todd McFarlane]] was to step in as executive producer to revive financing for the film, but never followed through.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~bobnet/news/200005170427.html |title=BobNET: Dave Thomas Interview |publisher=Execulink.com |date=2000-05-17 |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\nThe plot, according to a Maple Palm (Dave Thomas's production company) release, would feature Bob and Doug, now working as garbage men, being convinced by a fast-talking insurance salesman (Aykroyd) to get into the microbrewing business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sctvguide.ca/episodes/as_gwn.htm |title=SCTV Guide - After SCTV - Bob and Doug McKenzie |publisher=Sctvguide.ca |access-date=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of films featuring fictional films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title | id=0086373 | title=Strange Brew}}\n* {{Amg movie|47177|Strange Brew}}\n*{{Mojo title|strangebrew}}\n*[http://www.bobanddoug.com Bob and Doug McKenzie website, pictures, clips, and information]\n\n{{Bob & Doug McKenzie}}\n{{Hamlet}}\n{{Dave Thomas}}\n\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bob and Doug McKenzie]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films about beer]]\n[[Category:Films based on Hamlet]]\n[[Category:Modern adaptations of works by William Shakespeare]]\n[[Category:Self-reflexive films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Fox]]\n[[Category:1983 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1983 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dave Thomas]]\n[[Category:1980s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
