In 1996, ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Catwalk'' a negative review, opining \"the film makes it clear that Ms. Turlington is used to being stared at by everyone around her. And these star-struck gazes eventually become more interesting than the model herself, since they reveal the aura of privilege that accompanies great beauty. Nothing Ms. Turlington says, no matter how vapid, is greeted with anything less than giddy admiration. So if she seems self-involved, no wonder.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/16/movies/film-review-lots-of-beautiful-models-admiring-themselves.html|title=Lots of Beautiful Models Admiring Themselves |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=29 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:Films about modeling]]\n[[Category:1995 documentary films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n\n\n{{documentary-tv-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
