It premiered at the [[59th Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]], where Moore won the [[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]], and cinematographer [[Edward Lachman]] won a prize for Outstanding Individual Contribution.\n\nThe film tells the story of Cathy Whitaker, a 1950s housewife, living in wealthy suburban [[Connecticut]] as she sees her seemingly perfect life begin to fall apart. Haynes pays homage to the films of [[Douglas Sirk]] (especially 1955's ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'', 1956's ''[[Written on the Wind]]'', and 1959's ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]''), and explores [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender roles]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[Social class|class]] in the context of [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1957 [[suburb]]an [[Connecticut]], Cathy Whitaker seems to be the perfect wife, mother, and [[homemaker]]. Her husband, Frank, is an executive at Magnatech, a television advertising company. One evening, Cathy receives a phone call from the local police, who are holding Frank. When she picks him up, he says it is all a misunderstanding, but it turns out that he has been exploring the illicit underground world of gay bars in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. In the midst of all of this, one day Cathy sees an unfamiliar black man walking in her yard. He turns out to be Raymond Deagan, the son of her late gardener, who is taking over his father's accounts.\n\nFrank often stays late at the office. One night when he says he is working, Cathy decides to bring him dinner, and she walks in on him passionately kissing a man. He confesses to having had \"problems\" as a young man and agrees to sign up for [[conversion therapy]]. However, their relationship is strained, Frank's work suffers, and he increasingly turns to [[Alcoholism|alcohol]]. Cathy runs into Raymond at a local art show and, to the consternation of onlookers, initiates a discussion with him about modern painting. After a party, Frank attempts to make love to Cathy, but he is [[Erectile dysfunction|unable to become aroused]] and accidentally strikes her when she tries to console him.\n\nThe next day, Raymond catches Cathy crying and asks her to run some errands with him. She agrees, and they wind up going to a bar in a black neighborhood, where Cathy is the only white person present. They are seen together on the street by a gossipy acquaintance of Cathy's, and the woman immediately begins to stir up scandal. When Cathy attends her daughter's ballet performance, the mothers of the other girls shun her. Frank also hears about Cathy and Raymond and, in response to his anger, Cathy denies having an other-than-professional relationship with Raymond and says she has fired him to quell the rumors. She then tells Raymond that their friendship cannot continue, as it is not \"plausible\".\n\nCathy and Frank go to Miami for New Year's to try to repair their marriage, but, at the hotel, Frank meets a young man and has another homosexual encounter. While they are gone, three white boys taunt and physically assault Raymond's daughter, Sarah, partly because of her father's rumored relationship with Cathy, and the girl is concussed by a rock thrown at her head.\n\nFrank breaks down and tearfully tells Cathy that he has fallen in love with a man and wants a divorce. When Cathy learns what happened to Sarah, she visits Raymond, who says he is moving to [[Baltimore]] in two weeks, as the rumors have destroyed his business and led his African-American neighbors to throw rocks through his windows. When Cathy tells Raymond she is going to be single and asks if she can come visit him some time, he stoically, but gently, rejects her, saying he has learned his lesson and needs to do what is right for his daughter.\n\nCathy shows up at the train station to see Raymond off, and they silently wave to each other as the train leaves the station.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- first 14 in the same order as in the opening titles of the film -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Cathleen \"Cathy\" Whitaker\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Frank Whitaker\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Raymond Deagan\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Eleanor Fine\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Sybil\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Dr. Bowman\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Mona Lauder\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Stan Fine\n* Ryan Ward as David Whitaker\n* Lindsay Andretta as Janice Whitaker\n* Jordan Puryear as Sarah Deagan\n* [[Bette Henritze]] as Mrs. Leacock\n* [[Barbara Garrick]] as Doreen\n* [[Olivia Birkelund]] as Nancy\n* [[June Squibb]] as Elderly Woman\n* [[J.B.

While her interviewer, Mrs. Leacock, suggests calling the police, Cathy walks outside to confront him and learns the circumstances of the situation and how he came to be there, after which she apologizes for her assumptions and demonstrates a capacity to see beyond his race and show sympathy for his father's recent passing. This is an action that is observed closely by Mrs. Leacock through the window, and ultimately makes its way into her article profiling Cathy and her \"kindness to negroes\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPresenting this particular issue so early on in the film, there is a clear contrast drawn between Hartford's suburban idyllic autumnal setting and the reality of the social order that dominates the everyday life of the Whitakers and the people in their lives.<ref name=\":2\" /> As Frank's difficulties continue to develop, Cathy finds great solace in befriending Raymond and ultimately comes to develop feelings for him as a result.<ref name=\":3\" /> These feelings, however, prove to be a huge social taboo in this time period, and are met with anger and prejudice in affluent [[New England]]. With the developing historical events of the [[Little Rock Nine|Little Rock Crisis]] serving as the contextual backdrop to the struggle in ''Far From Heaven'', it is in this struggle that one of the central themes of the film comes to the forefront, and is continually reintroduced through segregational policies of the era. Over the course of the film, we observe Cathy and Raymond's interactions being highly scrutinized by the different members of their own respective communities, as well as examples of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices that were commonplace during this era, such as being unable to sit next to each other at a local lunch counter.<ref name=\":3\" /> Frank and Cathy's vacation to [[Miami]] exemplifies this when a young African-American boy jumps into the hotel pool where Cathy and Frank are vacationing. Not only is the boy swiftly removed from the pool, but the white guests who were swimming at the time rapidly exit the pool area in disgust, mortified that the water and surrounding area had been shared, and therefore tainted, by a Black person.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nRebecca Sherr wrote in her essay \"(Not) queering \"white vision\" in ''Far from Heaven'' and ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''\":\n<blockquote>Implicitly, this scenario illustrates white Americans' fear of black bodies, bodies that for whites symbolize \"contamination\"; and \"contamination\" in turn signifies the underlying fear of miscegenation. The camera moves between Cathy's point-of-view looking out at the pool, and then the camera turns and focuses directly on Cathy so that she becomes the object of the gaze. Her eyes remain half-hidden behind sunglasses, which act as shield and mirror. As the unfolding action is miniaturized and reflected\u2014indeed, doubled\u2014on Cathy\u2019s lenses, the message is that this drama turns back on Cathy, illustrating in a rather didactic manner the futility of her desire for Raymond, a black man. The emphasis on parenting here, with a black father and white mother \"saving\" and disciplining their respective children, further emphasizes the undercurrent of segregation as policing the boundaries of racial reproduction.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Homosexuality and escapism===\nFrank Whitaker's burgeoning homosexuality is no doubt one of the more pivotal thematic story elements within ''Far From Heaven'', as it sets in motion a series of events in the film that ultimately culminate in, not only the estrangement of his wife, but the inevitable failure of his marriage. Characterized as the reliable husband, the successful hardworking businessman, the charming spouse, and the devoted father, he is idealized in a way that assigns him so many demanding roles, it is almost as if he is driven to pursue his homosexual tendencies as a means to escape his taxing everyday life and release his burden and frustration.<ref name=\":3\" /> We witness this early on in the film in his office at Magnatech when lunch meetings and dinner meetings pile up in his schedule, as portfolio season is well underway and his [[New York City|New York]] office continues to push up deadlines. Much like Cathy, Frank falls short of his exalted reputation, and as he is exploring Hartford one evening, avoiding returning home by taking in a movie, he soon finds himself walking the streets, delving further into the seedy underbelly of Hartford nightlife, where he hopes to find what he is looking for. It is when he notices what appear to be two gay men walking into a basement bar that he finally acts on his impulses and begins the slippery slope of self gratification that ultimately comes to dominate his lifestyle.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is through these humble beginnings that we come to explore with Frank the subversive and hushed nature of the gay community as he begins to act on his desires.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMitra Moin writes in her essay, \"''Far From Heaven'' and ''[[Carol (film)|Carol]]'': Channeling 1950s Melodrama\":\n<blockquote>The 1950s is a time of constraining expectations; everyone is expected to lead perfect suburban lives, and those that deviate are socially condemned. Haynes sets this up in ''Far From Heaven'', where Cathy appears to have a model life: two children, a successful husband, and a suburban home. She is a typical housewife, admired by others: \"Women just like yourself, with families and homes to keep up.\" This is dismantled in the premise, when Cathy receives a call from the police station regarding her husband. Beauty and perfection, here, are forms of oppression. The props are also important to observe as symbols of the 1950s: The television manifests the suburban prosperity that characterizes the time period. Cathy must adhere to the narrow and confining gender roles of the 1950s, just as Frank must suppress his homosexual desires. These characters, disillusioned in their seemingly flawless worlds, ultimately find these symbols as oppressive.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\nLikewise, Cathy, who finds an escape through her relationship with Raymond, begins to act on her impulses as well, taking us further into the bigoted, prejudiced nature of upper class Hartford society. When Cathy, in the aftermath of Eleanor observing the physical abuse Frank has inflicted upon her, is discovered crying in her yard by Raymond, their relationship becomes even closer, and he extends to her an invitation for a day in the country in an effort to take her mind off her worries, which she ultimately accepts. This invitation, however, sets in motion a series of events that culminates in a romantic evening between the two, which is inadvertently observed by Mona Lauder, a woman whose [[gossip]] is notorious for spreading like wildfire. It is through Mona's prejudiced tittle-tattle that Cathy soon finds herself with her reputation besmirched, as even her friends and loved ones are disgusted with her behavior. Frank's revelation of his affair to Cathy, which effectively ends their marriage, is mirrored when Cathy reveals her attraction for Raymond to Eleanor and is summarily rejected, exposing the subtle dichotomy between their respective vices. As Rebecca Sherr notes in her essay:\n<blockquote>The \"mirroring\" technique occurs several times and is a visual clue as to the parallels the film draws between interracial romance and homosexuality. [...] The two instances of \"coming out\" in ''Far from Heaven'' produce different narrative trajectories, and the mediating factor of racial difference accounts for these divergent outcomes. This difference in outcome is based in the notion of visibility\u2014racial difference cannot usually be hidden. The film communicates that heterosexual, interracial desire could, in a sense, be seen as even more \"queer\" than homosexuality, at least in the context of queerness as visible deviance.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Cathy finds herself isolated at the end of the film, a divorc\u00e9e fallen from grace who now devotes her life to her children and her volunteer work for organizations such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], she still possesses feelings for Raymond that, though now held back, dominate the subtext of the ending of the film, without either character having to utter a single word in their silent, tear-wrenching farewell.<ref name=\":3\" /> Todd McGowen observes of both Cathy and Frank in \"Relocating Our Enjoyment of the 1950s: The Politics of Fantasy in ''Far From Heaven''\": \"The point here is not that they enjoy in spite of the widespread disapproval; it is instead that this disapproval enables and fuels their enjoyment. Their time together has the significance it does precisely because the social prohibition does not permit it.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==={{Lang|fr|Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne}} and cinematography===\nAccording to Haynes' [[Audio commentary|director's commentary]], recorded for the DVD-release of ''Far from Heaven'', the film was made in the style of many 1950s films, notably those of [[Douglas Sirk]]. Haynes created color palettes for every scene in the film, and was careful and particular in his choices. He emphasized experience with color in such scenes as one in which Cathy, Eleanor, and their friends are all dressed in reds, oranges, yellows, browns, and greens, and also played with the color green by using it to light forbidden and mysterious scenes. This effect was employed both in the scene in which Frank visits a gay bar and when Cathy goes to the restaurant in a predominantly black neighborhood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Far from Heaven'' DVD commentary track</ref>\n\nBlue is often used in the film to represent Frank and Cathy's failing marriage, as in the scene in which Cathy receives a phone call from the Hartford police concerning Frank and his \"loitering\" and, later, when Frank and Cathy leave the psychiatrist's office after their first visit to try to curb Frank's homosexual tendencies. It is in the second of these moments that the only profanity in the entire film is used, by Frank towards Cathy, further demonstrating the coldness and bitterness he feels towards his wife, and perfectly in sync with the color palette that envelops them during this scene.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nScott Higgins writes in \"Orange and Blue, Desire and Loss: The Colour Score in ''Far From Heaven''\":\n<blockquote>Generally, we can isolate two strategies of colour design in ''Far from Heaven''. On one hand, Haynes makes straightforward and adroit use of classical convention in a fairly subtle and un-ironic way. On the other hand, moments of strong stylisation reveal a self-consciousness of form that announces its artifice. The film's articulation of an autumnal orange motif exemplifies how Haynes reawakens dormant Hollywood conventions in a rather delicate expressive manner. The more overt manipulation of coloured lighting, however, offers a test case. Red and green lighting broadcasts its artifice and its reference to Sirk, activating an awareness of form that Haynes nonetheless manages to align with our sympathy for his characters. In his extensive use of blue light, though, Haynes exploits conventional motivations and the melodrama's generic tendency towards stylisation to exact a sincere and direct affective charge from colour temperature, in much the way filmmakers had done between the late 1930s and 1960s. His project of self-conscious reference may, in fact, open room for Haynes to renew the classical convention in an emotionally direct way. It is this play between citation and invocation of colour scoring that makes ''Far From Heaven'' so compelling.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to the color scheme, Haynes used shots and angles appropriate to Sirk's films and era, and the script employs over-the-top, melodramatic dialogue. In driving scenes, the filmmakers employed the [[rear projection]] process commonly used in older films, even reusing a plate from Sirk's ''[[Written on the Wind]]'' for one shot of Cathy driving to her daughter's ballet recital.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Cinematographer [[Edward Lachman]] helped created the appropriate \"look\" by using the same types of lighting techniques, lighting equipment, and lens filters that would have been used to film a [[melodrama]] in the 1950s, and [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s score is reminiscent of those he had composed 40 and 50 years earlier. Also, supervising sound editor Kelley Baker used [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] to make the sounds of things in the film such as rustling clothes and footsteps more prominent in a way similar to films from the 1950s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the director's commentary, Haynes noted that he was influenced by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s film ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Both films portray feelings of alienation and awkwardness, which is conveyed by, for example, sometimes lingering on a character for a few seconds longer than is comfortable for the viewer before cutting to the next scene.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n''Far from Heaven'' has received high acclaim from critics since its release. It holds an 87% \"Fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10; the site's critical consensus reads: \"An exquisitely designed and performed melodrama, ''Far From Heaven'' earns its viewers' tears with sincerity and intelligence.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Far From Heaven |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/far_from_heaven |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 84 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Far From Heaven |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/far-from-heaven |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called the film a masterpiece and considered it a companion of Haynes' earlier film ''[[Safe (1995 film)|Safe]]'' (1995) in its use of \"the same talented actress to explore suburban alienation in comparably gargantuan consumerist surroundings\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/magnificent-repression/Content?oid=910451|title=Magnificent Repression [on ''Far from Heaven'']|last=Rosenbaum|first=Jonathan|date=November 22, 2002|newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]]|access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated in four categories at the [[75th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] ([[Julianne Moore]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] ([[Todd Haynes]]), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Edward Lachman]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] ([[Elmer Bernstein]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=2003 {{!}} Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003 |access-date=2022-10-22 |website=www.oscars.org |language=en}}</ref> At the [[59th Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]], it was nominated for the [[Golden Lion]], while Moore won the [[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]] and Lachman won a prize for Outstanding Individual Contribution.\n\n''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?'', a website that gathers various critics' polls, found ''Far from Heaven'' to be the 56th most acclaimed film of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/21stcentury_allfilms_table.php |title=TSPDT - 21st Century (Full List) |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |access-date=December 22, 2018}}</ref> In August 2016, [[BBC|BBC Magazine]] conducted a poll on the 21st century's 100 greatest films so far, with ''Far from Heaven'' ranking at number 86.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC - Culture - The 21st Century's 100 greatest films|work=BBC Magazine|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|date=August 23, 2016|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[The Guardian]]'' ranked the film 13th in its list of the best films of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100 best films of the 21st century |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century |website=The Guardian |date=September 13, 2019 |access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===In other media===\n{{main|Far from Heaven (musical)}}\nTheatrical songwriting team [[Scott Frankel]] and [[Michael Korie]] worked with [[Richard Greenberg]] on an Off Broadway-bound musical adaptation.
