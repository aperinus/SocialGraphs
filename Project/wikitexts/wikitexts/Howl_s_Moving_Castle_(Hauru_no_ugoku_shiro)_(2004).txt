It is loosely based on the [[Howl's Moving Castle|1986 novel of the same name]] by English author [[Diana Wynne Jones]]. The film was produced by [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] and distributed by [[Toho]]. The Japanese voice cast featured [[Chieko Baisho]] and [[Takuya Kimura]], while the English dub version starred [[Jean Simmons]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Josh Hutcherson]] and [[Billy Crystal]].\n\nThe film is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early twentieth-century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom. It tells the story of Sophie, a young [[Hatmaking|milliner]] who is turned into an elderly woman by a witch who enters her shop and curses her. She encounters a wizard named Howl and gets caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king.\n\nInfluenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States' invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, the film contains strong [[Pacifism|anti-war]] themes. Miyazaki stated that he \"had a great deal of rage\" about the Iraq war, which led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the United States.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} It also explores the theme of [[old age]], depicting age positively as something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains [[Feminism|feminist]] elements as well, and carries messages about the value of [[compassion]].\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki said ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, explaining, \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} The film is significantly thematically different from the novel; while the novel focuses on challenging class and gender norms, the film focuses on love, personal loyalty and the destructive effects of war.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' premiered at the [[61st Venice International Film Festival]] on 5 September 2004, and was theatrically released in Japan on 20 November 2004. It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $236 million worldwide, making it one of the most commercially successful Japanese films in history. The film received critical acclaim, with particular praise toward its visuals and Miyazaki's presentation of the themes. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', in 2006, and won several other awards, including four [[Tokyo Anime Award]]s and a [[Nebula Award for Best Script]].\n\n==Plot==\nSophie, a young [[Hatmaking|milliner]] and eldest of three sisters, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living [[scarecrow]], whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle where she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire [[demon]] named Calcifer, the source of the castle's magic and movement. Calcifer makes a deal with Sophie, agreeing to break her curse if she breaks his link with Howl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a [[Cleaner|cleaning lady]].\n\nMeanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, which is searching for its missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King, under the pretense of being his mother, to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's head sorceress, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power and reverting her to her true age, that of a harmless old woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight for the king. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him by turning him into a monster, but with Sophie's help he remembers himself and just barely avoids death. The duo escapes along with the former Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog Heen. In the meantime, soldiers from each kingdom break into the homes of both Jenkins and Pendragon (Howl's aliases in those kingdoms). However, the men only find an empty courtyard and warehouse, as the castle's magic nature allows travel between 4 separate residences.\n\nSophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of the Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The remainder of the castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.\n\nFollowing the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star \u2013 Calcifer \u2013 and gives him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains white. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom. He reveals that only his true love's kiss can break his curse. After seeing Sophie's affection lies with Howl, he promptly heads for home to cease the war, but promises he will see them again. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, also decides to end the war. Sometime later, bombers fly under dark skies over a recovered and green countryside headed to another war, while Sophie, Howl, and the others travel in the opposite direction in a new flying castle.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Multiple image|align=right | total_width = 400\n|image1 = Chieko Baish\u014d at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2019 (49013476248) (cropped).jpg\n|caption1 = [[Chieko Baisho]], who voiced Sophie in the Japanese version of the film\n\n|image2 = Emily Mortimer 2011 Shankbone.JPG\n|alt2 = Picture of Emily Mortimer dressed in white against a green background\n|caption2 = [[Emily Mortimer]], who voiced the young Sophie in the version of the film dubbed into English\n\n|image3 = Studio publicity Jean Simmons.jpg\n|alt3 = Publicity still of Jean Simmons\n|caption3 = [[Jean Simmons]], who voiced older Sophie in the English dub\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So [he] felt some hesitation about the award.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} Miyazaki identifies as a [[pacifist]].{{sfn|Gordon|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} On the eve of the Iraq War, Miyazaki decided to make a film that he felt would be poorly received in the [[United States]]. Despite the film's success in that country, literary scholar Dani Cavallaro stated that Miyazaki was able to \"create a film which ought, in principle, to have caused a certain unease among American audiences.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} In the movie, Madame Suliman appears to have only sadistic motivations for creating conflict,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} and despite being [[omniscient]], is unable to recognize the idiocy of the war until the very end of the story. This reflects Miyazaki's desire to show real-world conflicts as also being somewhat arbitrary and fueled by the desires of capricious people.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=8}} Cavallaro stated that the depiction of the war carried \"an unmistakable bitter taste.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=61\u201362}} She also writes that the military presence and warfare was highlighted in the film.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Cavallaro|first=Dani|title=The Late Works of Hayao Miyazaki: A Critical Study, 2004-2013|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4766-1909-5|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=26\u201330}}</ref> From the early concept sketches military elements were emphasized, and when the film shows the bustling commercial district the soldiers in uniforms stand out intentionally.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe universe of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' is depicted as not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message of the film is that \"war is bad.\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, \"a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace.\"{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like ''Princess Mononoke'', which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Andrew Osmond stated that \"Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all,\" in the form of the monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at one point that he will soon not be able to return to human form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} In contrast, Ashitaka in ''Princess Mononoke'' fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}} Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of [[masculinity]], as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n===Flight and critique of modernity===\nLike several other Miyazaki films,{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} ''Howl's Moving Castle'' reflects the director's love of [[flight|flying]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Sequences in the film include both several aircraft of inventive design, as well as Howl transforming into a bird.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki examines flight as a theme most directly in the later film ''[[The Wind Rises]]''.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Miyazaki stated that he was attracted to military aircraft as a child, but that he grew to detest them because of the destructive purpose for which they are created.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Thus ''Howl's Moving Castle'' contains images both of aircraft shown as harmless and beautiful, and large military craft depicted as ugly and destructive.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}} Cavallaro writes that Miyazaki wants to \"portray flight as an object of admiration and awe,\" but that he is not \"[blind] to its abuse by unscrupulous strategists and rulers.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe nuanced view of flight is part of Miyazaki's broader critique of modern society and technology. Margaret Talbot writes that in person, Miyazaki exhibits \"a profound dissatisfaction with modern life,\"{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} particularly with the effects of technology and a disconnection from nature.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Many of his films depict technological hubris as among the roots of evil.{{sfn|Scott|2005a}} The battleships which are seen moving over the landscape are depicted as \"gleaming with modernity and parading righteousness,\"{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} but are then shown to be highly destructive.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} In contrast, the semi-organic castle demonstrates \"Miyazaki\u2019s Taoist presentation of industrialism needing to be aligned with nature\" according to Carl and Garrath Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|Wilson|2015}} Antonio Lioi writes that Miyazaki often depicts beautiful scenes in contrast to those containing symbols of modernity, such as the scene where Sophie's reverie is interrupted by a war machine. This contrast is part of an [[Ecology|ecological]] criticism of modernity, but Miyazaki also offers an alternative, in the form of beautiful natural scenery.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}}\n\n===Old age and compassion===\nMiyazaki stated that an attractive aspect of the story of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} When Sophie becomes old as a result of the witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in ''Howl's Moving Castle'', which made it a risky concept.{{sfn|Talbot|2006}} Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of \"aged unattractiveness,\" when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who come to love her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films.{{sfn|Lioi|2010}} According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\nIn 2013, Miyazaki stated that ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was his favorite creation, and explained his choice by saying \"I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed.\"{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and Sheeta and Pazu in ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' learn to survive by learning the same lesson.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|pp=171\u2013172}} Over the course of the film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that \"In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches.\"{{sfn|Parsons|2007}} They are also given a lot of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.{{sfn|Parsons|2007}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 220\n| image1    = HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg\n|alt1            = Picture of Miyazaki holding a microphone \n| caption1  = Director and screenwriter [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 2009\n| image2    = Toshio Suzuki, Howl's Moving Castle premiere.jpg\n|alt2            = refer to caption\n| caption2  = [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]], who produced the film, at its premiere\n}}\nIn September 2001, Studio Ghibli announced the production of two films.

Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the \"feel\" of a hand-drawn image.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2015|p=137}}\n\nLike with the other Studio Ghibli movies, the film was co-produced with other companies, which were [[Tokuma Shoten]], the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]].{{sfn|Rooney|2004}}\n\n==Comparisons between film and novel==\nThe film has several differences from the novel, partly due to the different requirements of the two media. [[Diana Wynne Jones]]' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=127}} As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Jones discussed the film with [[Studio Ghibli]] representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying \"It's fantastic. No, I have no input\u2014I write books, not films. Yes, it will be ''different'' from the book\u2014in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film.\"{{sfn|nausicaa1|2016}}\n\nThe novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, dark and sinister wizard's tower, very different from the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a \"rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs\"{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} that is similar to [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the \"endearing\" persona and image that he has in the film.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=128}} Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a [[fantasy]] universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or washing up, in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|p=129}} In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world [[Wales]]. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=129\u2013130}}\n\nMiyazaki's biggest addition to the plot of the book was the use of the war as a large part of the plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In the film, however, Howl disappears in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}}\n\nThe roles of several characters also differ between novel and film due to this plot change. The Witch of the Waste is the chief antagonist of the book, whereas in the film she is reduced by Madame Suliman's magic to an ultimately harmless old woman who evokes sympathy in the audience and in Sophie.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, the film conflates the novel's two characters of Mrs. Penstemmon and the wizard Suliman into Madame Suliman. Although Suliman comes closest to being a traditional villain in the film, she is shown as having ambiguous motivations, and reviewers have stated that the real villain is war itself.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} Howl loses the \"rakish\" womanizing aspect that was a significant part of his character in the novel.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} In contrast, Sophie becomes a more conventional figure in the film; she is less grumpy and outspoken, and demonstrates her love for Howl earlier and more explicitly.{{sfn|Kimmich|2007|pp=132\u2013133}} The storyline in the novel of Sophie being a powerful sorceress in her own right is muted in the film, although she is still shown to have control over her curse.{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\nThe thematic focus of the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience of watching the film was similar to reading high quality [[fan fiction]]; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different.{{sfn|Levi|2008}} Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that \"Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war.\"{{sfn|Levi|2008}}\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Joe Hisaishi 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Hisaishi]], who composed and conducted the score, in 2011]]\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[Joe Hisaishi]], and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|title=Music in the movies: Joe Hisaishi|work=Den of Geek|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215001607/http://www.denofgeek.com/other/12911/music-in-the-movies-joe-hisaishi|archive-date=15 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack CD]] was first released on 19 November 2004 by Tokuma Japan Communications.

At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish.\"{{sfn|Burr|2005}} [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Admirers of [Hayao Miyazaki's] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller. For newcomers to his world, \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a fitting introduction to one of modern cinema's great enchanters.\"{{sfn|Scott|2005b}}\n\nConversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two and a half out of four stars, and called it a \"disappointment\" compared to Miyazaki's other recent movies.{{sfn|Ebert|2005}} Jonathan Trout of the [[BBC]] said, \"Youngsters and Miyazaki fans will coo at the world's depth and rich surreality, but opaque plotting, and a tendency to mope with Sophie whilst Howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act vanish into thin air.\"{{sfn|Trout|2005}} Writing for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[Stephanie Zacharek]] said, \"the plot of ''Howl's Moving Castle'' meanders so listlessly that its details become less and less charming.
