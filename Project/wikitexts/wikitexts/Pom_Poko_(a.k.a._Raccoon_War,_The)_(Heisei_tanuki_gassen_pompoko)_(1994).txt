In Japanese folklore, ''tanuki'' are considered to be [[Bake-danuki|magical creatures]], capable of shape-shifting into people or other objects.  They are a highly sociable, mischievous species, too fun-loving and fond of tasty treats to be a real threat \u2013 unlike ''[[kitsune]]'' (foxes) and other shape-shifters.\n\nThe phrase \"Pom Poko\" in the title refers to the sound of ''tanuki'' drumming their bellies, from a 1919 poem by [[Uj\u014d Noguchi]] which became a popular children's song when it was set to music in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|last=Munroe Hotes|first=Catherine|date=November 13, 2010|title=Belly Drum Dance at Shojoji Temple (\u8b49\u57ce\u5bfa\u306e\u72f8\u56c3\u5b50, c.1933)|url=http://nishikataeiga.blogspot.se/2013/10/belly-drum-dance-at-shojoji-temple-c1933.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819231311/http://nishikataeiga.blogspot.se/2013/10/belly-drum-dance-at-shojoji-temple-c1933.html|archive-date=August 19, 2016|access-date=July 9, 2016|website=Nishikata Film Review}}</ref>\n\nProminent [[scrotum]]s are an integral part of ''tanuki'' folklore, and they are shown and referred to throughout the film, and also used frequently in their shape-shifting. This remains unchanged in the DVD release, though the English [[Dub localization|dub]] (but not the [[subtitles]]) refers to them as \"raccoon pouches\".\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in late 1960s Japan. A group of ''tanuki'' are threatened by a gigantic suburban development project called [[Tama New Town|New Tama]], in the [[Tama Hills]] on the outskirts of [[Tokyo]]. The development is cutting into their forest habitat and dividing their land. The story resumes in early 1990s Japan, during the early years of the [[Heisei era]]. With limited living space and food decreasing every year, the ''tanuki'' begin fighting among themselves for the diminishing resources, but at the urging of the matriarch Oroku, they decide to unify to stop the development.\n\nSeveral ''tanuki'' lead the resistance, including the aggressive chief Gonta, the old guru Seizaemon, the wise-woman Oroku, and the young and resourceful Shoukichi. Using their illusion skills (which they must re-learn after having forgotten them), they stage a number of diversions including industrial sabotage. These attacks injure and even kill people, frightening construction workers into quitting, but more workers immediately replace them. In desperation, the ''tanuki'' send out messengers to seek help from various legendary elders from other regions.\n\nAfter several years, one of the messengers returns bringing a trio of elders from the distant island of [[Shikoku]], where development is not a problem and the ''tanuki'' are still worshipped. In an effort at re-establishing respect for the supernatural, the group stages a massive [[Hyakki Yagy\u014d|ghost parade]] to make the humans think the town is haunted. The strain of the massive illusion kills one of the elders and his spirit is lifted up in a ''[[raig\u014d]]'', and the effort seems wasted when the owner of a nearby [[Amusement park|theme park]] takes credit for the parade, claiming it was a [[publicity stunt]].\n\nWith this setback, the unity of the ''tanuki'' finally fails and they break up into smaller groups, each following a different strategy. One group led by Gonta takes the route of [[eco-terrorism]], holding off workers until they are wiped out in a pitched battle with the police, and finally, fused into the form of a ''[[tsurube-otoshi]]'', killed blocking the path of an oncoming [[dekotora]]. Another group desperately attempts to gain media attention through television appearances to plead their case against the habitat's destruction. One of the elders becomes [[Dementia|senile]] and starts a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] dancing [[cult]] among the ''tanuki'' who are unable to transform, eventually sailing away with them in a ship that takes them to their deaths, while the other elder investigates joining the human world as the last of the transforming ''[[kitsune]]'' (foxes) have already done.\n\nWhen all else fails, in a last act of defiance, the remaining ''tanuki'' stage a grand illusion, temporarily transforming the urbanized land back into its pristine state to remind everyone of what has been lost.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|author2=McCarthy, Helen}}</ref> Finally, with their strength exhausted, the ''tanuki'' most trained in illusion follow the example of the ''kitsune'': they blend into human society one by one, abandoning those who cannot transform. While the media appeal comes too late to stop the construction, the public responds sympathetically to the ''tanuki'', pushing the developers to set aside some areas as parks. However, the parks are too small to accommodate all the non-transforming ''tanuki''. Some try to survive there, dodging traffic to rummage through human scraps for food, while others disperse farther out to the countryside to compete with the ''tanuki'' who are already there.\n\nOne day, Shoukichi, who also joined the human world, is coming home from work when he sees a non-transformed ''tanuki'' leaping into a gap in a wall. Shoukichi crawls into the gap and follows the path, which leads to a grassy clearing where some of his former companions are gathering. He joyfully transforms back into a ''tanuki'' to join them. Shoukichi's friend, Ponkichi, [[Fourth wall|addresses the viewer]], asking humans to be more considerate of ''tanuki'' and other animals less endowed with transformation skills, and not to destroy their living space; as the view pulls out and away, their surroundings are revealed as a golf course within a suburban sprawl.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
