[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent John Fitzgerald, believing she works with Roy, puts her back on the plane. While she is in the plane restroom, Roy subdues the passengers and flight crew, agents sent by Fitzgerald, and crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. Drugging the shocked June, he warns that agents will come after her.\n\nWaking at home, June prepares for her sister April's wedding, and learns she wants to sell their father's 1966 [[Pontiac GTO|Pontiac GTO tri-power]], which June had planned to restore as a wedding gift. She is picked up by Fitzgerald and his agents. Roy appears, killing numerous agents in a highway chase and rescuing her. She flees to her ex-boyfriend Rodney, a firefighter, before Roy arrives and pretends to take June hostage, shooting Rodney in the process.\n\nRoy convinces June she is safer with him, and reveals that he has the Zephyr, a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual energy]] battery; he had been assigned to guard its inventor, Simon Feck, until Fitzgerald tried to steal the battery, framing Roy. In [[Brooklyn]], June and Roy discover Feck has gone into hiding but left Roy a clue that he is in the [[Alps]]. They are attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer Antonio Quintana. Drugged again, June drifts in and out of consciousness as they are captured and then escape to Roy's off-the-grid island. Accepting a call from her sister, June accidentally leads Quintana's men to the hideaway. Escaping Quintana's unmanned aerial assault vehicle in a helicopter, Roy knocks June out to circumvent her fear of flying.\n\nJune wakes up aboard a train in [[Austria]], where Roy has reunited with Simon, and they manage to kill Bernard, an assassin hired by Quintana. After checking into a hotel in [[Salzburg]], June follows Roy to a meeting with Naomi, Quintana's henchwoman, where he offers to sell the Zephyr.\n\nFitzgerald and [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] Isabel George find June and reveal Roy used her at the airport to smuggle the Zephyr past security. Heartbroken, June leads them to the hotel. Fleeing across the rooftops, Roy is shot and falls into the river with the Zephyr. Simon is kidnapped from CIA custody by Fitzgerald, the real traitor, to be delivered to Quintana in Spain.\n\nReturning home, June attends her sister's wedding, and visits an address Roy had been monitoring, where she meets his parents and learns his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, an [[U.S. Army|Army]] sergeant and [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], was killed in action, and have won various lotteries and sweepstakes they do not remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine declaring she has the Zephyr, June is taken by Quintana's men to [[Seville]].\n\nDrugged with a prototype [[truth serum]], June explains that Roy's deal with Quintana was meant to alert the CIA so June would be returned home safely in time for the wedding. Roy tracks Fitzgerald, rescues June, and leads Quintana and his men on a car chase. Quintana is killed by a bull stampede, and Roy trades Fitzgerald the Zephyr for Simon. Fitzgerald shoots at Simon anyway, but Roy takes the bullet. Simon reveals that the battery is unstable, and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald.\n\nRoy is hospitalized in [[Washington, D.C.]], where George tells him June has moved on, and welcomes him back to the CIA; however, George's coded language reveals that he will be killed. June, disguised as a nurse, drugs Roy and breaks him out of the hospital. Waking up in the rebuilt GTO, Roy and June drive toward [[Cape Horn]], and his parents unexpectedly receive their own tickets there.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Roy Miller/Matthew Knight  \n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as June Havens  \n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as John Fitzgerald  \n* [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] as Antonio Quintana  \n* [[Viola Davis]] as CIA Director Isabel George  \n* [[Paul Dano]] as Simon Feck  \n* [[Falk Hentschel]] as Bernhard  \n* [[Marc Blucas]] as Rodney  \n* Lennie Loftin as Braces  \n* [[Maggie Grace]] as April Havens  \n* Rich Manley as Danny  \n* [[Dale Dye]] as Frank Jenkins <!--Please see the talk page before changing this back to Frank Knight-->\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Molly Knight  \n* [[Gal Gadot]] as Naomi  \n* Jack O'Connell as Wilmer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBefore film director James Mangold signed on to ''Knight and Day'', it was previously associated with director [[Tom Dey]].<ref name=\"zeitchik\">{{cite news| last =Zeitchik | first = Steven | title =James Mangold wrestles 'Knight and Day' to the screen | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date =June 24, 2010 | url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-mangold-20100624,0,6848019.story | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}</ref> More than 12 writers contributed to the film.
