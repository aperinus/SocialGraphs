Unknown to Stig, Bobby is an [[Undercover operation|undercover]] [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[Special agent|Special Agent]] who reports to his superior, Special Agent Jessup, that he did not get the [[cocaine]] from Papi they need to convict him.\n\nAgainst orders, Bobby remains undercover to assist Stig in robbing $3 million - in a bank vault in Tres Cruces, Texas - to prosecute Papi for [[money laundering]]. Bobby then meets with fellow DEA Agent and ex, Deb Rees, while Stig, an undercover [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEAL]] and [[Petty officer first class|Petty Officer 1st Class]] with the [[United States Navy]] [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Office of NavaI Intelligence]], meets with his commanding officer, [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Harold Quince, and is told to kill Bobby so they can fund [[covert operation]]s.\n\nBobby and Stig are surprised to find $43.125 million and not $3 million. Stig follows orders to betray Bobby and escape with the money, pulling his gun as Bobby is about to pull his. Stig wounds Bobby in the upper arm rather than kill him, and then sees Bobby's DEA badge. Unsure what to think, Stig leaves him in the desert.\n\nAfter debriefing, Quince orders his death. Stig escapes after learning the money will go to the [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Naval Air Station in Corpus Christi]]. Meanwhile, a man named Earl aggressively interrogates the bank manager about the stolen money and the vet who treated Bobby's wound.\n\nBobby goes to Stig's to find the money, only to have him contact him from a sniper's post across the street. A hit squad sent by Quince attacks the apartment but Bobby and Stig escape. Bobby tries to tell Jessup what happened, but Earl and his men are already there. Earl kills Jessup, frames Bobby, and lets him go, agreeing to clear his name if he recovers the $43 million.\n\nBobby and Stig kidnap Papi, interrogating him in Deb's garage. Earl is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent Papi reports to, and the money they stole was the CIA's payments. The agency has forced Papi, and other cartels, to pay a 7% cut in exchange for using CIA planes to smuggle products across the border. The garage is attacked by Quince's hit squad. Bobby, Stig, and Deb escape, as does Papi, who calls his crew. All three are captured by Papi and taken to his farm in Mexico. After a beating and a visit from Earl, Papi gives the men 24 hours to return the money, or Deb will die.\n\nAt the base, Bobby infiltrates Quince's office, discovering he is Deb's boyfriend, and they had planned to steal the money for themselves. Meanwhile, Stig asks [[Admiral]] Tuwey for help. Tuwey orders Quince's arrest but disavows Stig to protect the Navy's reputation. Both Quince and Stig evade arrest from US [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|Navy Masters-at-Arms]] officers. Unable to find the money in time, Papi kills Deb. Bobby later realizes the money is in a motel room he and Deb had frequented and goes to help Stig, who had returned to Papi's farm for vengeance.\n\nThere, Stig is surrounded by Papi's men, then both Quince and Earl intervene. Bobby arrives in a car filled with money, and blows it up, scattering the money everywhere, leading to a massive shootout. During a standoff, Earl reveals that the CIA has 20 other secret banks, and the loss of the $43.125 million is only a minor setback. Signaling Stig with a phrase from an earlier conversation, Stig shoots Earl, and Bobby shoots Quince. Bobby and Stig kill Papi and the duo escape, but first Bobby shoots Stig in the leg as payback for shooting him in the desert. While planning to continue to take down the CIA's secret banks and sabotage their black operations, Bobby reveals to Stig that he did not blow up all the money and had some stashed away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Special Agent Robert \"Bobby\" Trench\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as U.S. Navy [[Navy SEALs|SEAL]] [[Petty officer, first class|Petty Officer 1st Class]] Michael \"Stig\" Stigman\n* [[Paula Patton]] as DEA Special Agent Deb Rees\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Earl\n* [[James Marsden]] as U.S. Navy  [[United States Navy SEAL|SEAL]] [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Harold Quince\n* [[Fred Ward]] as U.S. Navy [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Tuwey\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Manny \"Papi\" Greco\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as DEA Special Agent Jessup\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Dr. Ken\n* Edgar Arreola as Rudy\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is an adaption of the comic series of the same name by [[Steven Grant]].<ref name=\"cinemablend\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Fred-Ward-Joins-Denzel-Washington-Mark-Walhberg-2-Guns-32081.html|title=Fred Ward Joins Denzel Washington And Mark Walhberg In 2 Guns|last=Carp|first=Jesse|website=Cinema Blend|date=July 23, 2012|access-date=October 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203204840/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Fred-Ward-Joins-Denzel-Washington-Mark-Walhberg-2-Guns-32081.html|archive-date=December 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> However, it has been noted by ''the Observer'' that it can also be seen as evocative of the 1973 thriller ''[[Charley Varrick]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Philip |last=French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/18/2-guns-denzel-washington-review |title=2 Guns \u2013 review |newspaper=The Observer |date=August 18, 2013 |access-date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> The pictures have similar plots and in both cases the bank being robbed is in a town named Tres Cruces.\n\nFilming took place in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and areas throughout [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"onlocationvacations\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/tag/2-guns-filming-locations/|title='2 Guns', starring Mark Wahlberg, filming in New Mexico|website=Onlocationvacations.com|access-date=October 23, 2012|archive-date=September 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919231247/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/tag/2-guns-filming-locations/|url-status=dead}}</ref> While filming in Louisiana, the production spent $57.5 million in the state and received a $17.6 million subsidy under the state's film incentive program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmla.com/download.php?file=uploads/2013%20Feature%20Production%20Report%20w%20Release%20030614_1394127596&type=pdf|title=2013 Feature Film Production Report|date=March 6, 2013|website=FilmL.A.|access-date=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020222456/http://filmla.com/download.php?file=uploads%2F2013%20Feature%20Production%20Report%20w%20Release%20030614_1394127596&type=pdf|archive-date=October 20, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''2 Guns'' marked the second collaboration for Wahlberg and Korm\u00e1kur.
