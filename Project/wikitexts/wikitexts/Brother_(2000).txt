Surviving clan members have few options: either to join the winners, reconciling with shame and distrust, or to die by committing [[seppuku]]. Yamamoto, however, decides to escape to Los Angeles along with his associate Kato ([[Susumu Terajima]]). There he finds his estranged half-brother Ken ([[Claude Maki]]), who runs a small-time drug business together with his local African-American friends. At the first meeting, Yamamoto badly hurts one of them, Denny ([[Omar Epps]]), for an attempt to fraud him. Later, Denny becomes one of the Yamamoto's closest friends and associates.\n\nUsed to living in a clan and according to its laws, Yamamoto creates a hapless gang out of Ken's buddies. The new gang quickly and brutally attacks Mexican drug bosses and takes control of their territory in LA. They also form an alliance with Shirase ([[Masaya Kato]]), a criminal leader of Little Tokyo district, making their group even stronger. As time passes, Yamamoto and his new gang emerge as a formidable force, gradually expanding their turf to such an extent that they confront the powerful Italian Mafia. Now everybody respectfully addresses Yamamoto as Aniki (\u5144\u8cb4, elder brother). But soon Aniki suddenly loses any interest in their now successful but dangerous business, spending his time with a girlfriend or just sitting silently thinking about something. However, the Mafia ruthlessly strikes back, and soon Yamamoto and his gang are driven into a disastrous situation of no return as they are hunted down one by one.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as Yamamoto, also referred to as Aniki (meaning elder brother)\n* [[Omar Epps]] as Denny\n* [[Tetsuya Watari]] as Jinseikai Boss\n* [[Claude Maki]] as Ken\n* [[Masaya Kato]] as Shirase, the \"boss of [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]]\"\n* [[Susumu Terajima]] as Kato, Yamamoto's lieutenant\n* Royale Watkins as Jay\n* [[Lombardo Boyar]] as Mo\n* [[Ren Osugi]] as Harada\n* [[Ryo Ishibashi]] as Ishihara\n* [[James Shigeta]] as Sugimoto\n* [[Tatyana Ali]] as Latifa\n* Makoto Otake as Chief of Police\n* Kouen Okumura as Hanaoka\n* Naomasa Musaka as Hisamatsu\n* [[Rino Katase]] as Night Club Madame\n* Joy Nakagawa as Marina, Yamamoto's Girlfriend\n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Victor\n* [[Tuesday Knight]] as Prostitute\n* Tony Colitti as Roberto\n* [[Antwon Tanner]] as Colin\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Brother\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n| cover      = Brother -- joe hisaishi.jpeg\n| border     = yes\n| alt        =\n| released   = 27 January 2001\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Stage & screen\n| length     = 49:39\n| label      = [[PolyGram]], Silva America, [[Milan Records]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Hisaishi \u2013 Brother (Music From The Motion Picture)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Joe-Hisaishi-Brother-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/release/2751925|website=[[Discogs]]|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>\n| producer   = Joe Hisaishi\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/brother-original-soundtrack-mw0000005030 |title= Joe Hisaishi - Brother [Original Soundtrack] |publisher=[[allmusic.com]]|access-date=2015-11-03|first=William|last=Ruhlmann}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing =  \n| total_length = 49:39\n\n| title1 = Drifter... in LAX\t\n| length1 = 4:22\n| writer1 = [[Joe Hisaishi]]\n\n| title2 = Solitude\t\n| length2 = 3:34\n| writer2 = [[Duke Ellington]], Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title3 = Tattoo\n| length3 = 0:56\n| writer3 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title4 = Death Spiral\t\n| length4 = 1:04\n| writer4 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title5 = Party \u2013 One Year Later \t\n| length5 = 4:26\n| writer5 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title6 = On the Shore\t\n| length6 = 1:21\n| writer6 = Joe Hisaishi\n \n| title7 = Blood Brother\n| length7 = 3:37\n| writer7 =  Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title8 = Raging Men\n| length8 = 1:19\n| writer8 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title9 = Beyond the Control \t\n| length9 = 1:25\n| writer9 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title10 = Wipe Out\n| length10 =5:26 \n| writer10 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title11 = Liberation from the Death\n| length11 = 3:52 \n| writer11 = Joe Hisaishi\n\n| title12 = I Love You...

To greater contrast the character against more familiar elements, he set it in a foreign country, choosing Los Angeles as a place-holder.  When producer [[Jeremy Thomas]] asked Kitano if he was interested in foreign productions, Kitano told him about the script.  Thomas promised him complete creative control, which Kitano said he got.  Commenting on the differing styles of filmmaking, Kitano said that American productions are more focused on the business side and are less sentimental.  Kitano cited their strong pride in their professionalism as positive aspect.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/mar/16/culture.features3|title=Blood Brother|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2001-03-15|access-date=2015-09-11}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nSeveral scenes were censored for the U.S. release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/9752|title=Beat Takeshi's BROTHER chop chopped for U.S. Distribution|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2001-08-02|access-date=2015-09-11}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nAt the time of its release, ''Brother'' was hyped as Kitano's vehicle for breaking into the United States film market.

But while many of the action set pieces are enlivened by the director\u2019s customary verve and humor, the plot advances clumsily with the narrative engine continually sputtering and stopping. Characters are so unsatisfyingly developed that the film delivers only on a basic level as a tale of gangster rivalry, greed, elimination and expansion, with its larger themes struggling to register... \u201cBrother\u201d is full of elegant compositions and poised, deliberate camera movement but rarely matches the visual impact of earlier Kitano features.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rooney |first1=David |title=Brother |url=https://variety.com/2000/film/markets-festivals/brother-4-1200464376/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=18 February 2020 |language=en |date=8 September 2000}}</ref> Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' gave the film two and half stars out of five, stating, \"Kitano's beat is an altogether grimmer affair, laden with dark irony and unexpurgated scenes of violence.
