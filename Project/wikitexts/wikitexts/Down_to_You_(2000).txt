[[Selma Blair]], [[Shawn Hatosy]], [[Zak Orth]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Lucie Arnaz]], and [[Henry Winkler]] play supporting roles. Isacsson's first and only feature film, ''Down to You'' paired Prinze and Stiles a year after their respective starring roles in the successful high school-set romantic comedies ''[[She's All That]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. Despite being the second-highest grossing film at the domestic box office its opening weekend, the film received poor response from critics and failed to recoup its $35 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile attending college in New York City, sophomore Al and freshman Imogen begin dating. After three months they have fallen in love. Imogen, an aspiring artist, arranges a private showing at an art gallery for Al's birthday, after which the two have sex for the first time.\n\nAl's roommate Monk, who has become a pornographic film actor and director, tells him that love is illusory and fleeting, and Monk's co-star Cyrus flirts with Al. Al loses a bet and must perform as an extra in one of Monk's films. This causes an argument between him and Imogen, who wants to spend time with him before she goes to France for the summer. He abandons the film in favor of spending the night with her.\n\nWhile in France, Imogen is asked by her cousin if she and Al will marry. This unnerves her as she is only nineteen, and she acts differently toward Al on her return. His father, who hosts a [[cooking show]], wants to do a father-and-son show after Al graduates, but Al would rather pursue his dream of becoming a chef of [[French cuisine]].\n\nConcerned that he and Imogen are drifting apart, Al arranges a picnic in the countryside; on the way back, she drives drunk and crashes into a tree. Seeing the accident as a sign, they try to improve their relationship. Though they seem happy, Monk predicts it is a precursor to a breakup.\n\nWhen Imogen declines to have sex one night, Al feels emasculated and has a sexual fantasy about Cyrus. Imogen fears that she may be pregnant, and though she turns out not to be, this further strains their relationship. At one of Monk's parties, Cyrus tries to seduce Al, but he declines.\n\nMeanwhile, Imogen spends time with musician acquaintance Jim; when Al learns she has agreed to design Jim's album cover, they argue and she leaves upset. The next day, she confesses she had sex with Jim afterward. After a tearful breakup, she moves to San Francisco to finish school.\n\nAl graduates but becomes depressed. Monk is too preoccupied with his new work as an author and lecturer to comfort him, and their friendship dissolves. After a period of isolation, Al starts dating again and has a [[casual relationship]] with Cyrus, but she eventually moves away. He enrolls in the [[International Culinary Center|French Culinary Institute]] but feels unmotivated and drops out, and is reduced to bar-hopping with his single friend Eddie. Drunk and missing Imogen, he tries to purge himself of his feelings for her by drinking a bottle of her shampoo, resulting in his hospitalization.\n\nAl's parents throw a party with his friends to lift his spirits. Monk apologizes to Al, and they mend their friendship. Imogen appears, and they spend time catching up; she has become a [[cover art]]ist for a San Francisco-based book publisher. She confesses that she misses him, and gives him a book titled ''Down to You'' with her cover artwork depicting the two of them in love. They rekindle their romance, deciding that they met too young but can start over. Al takes a job at a four-star restaurant in San Francisco and surprises Imogen with a romantic evening.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Alfred \"Al\" Connelly\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Imogen\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Cyrus, an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] dropout turned pornographic film actress\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Eddie Hicks, one of Al's roommates\n* [[Zak Orth]] as Monk Jablonski, Al's other roommate\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Jim Morrison, a musician who dresses and acts like his namesake, [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]]\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Lana, Imogen's friend and later roommate\n* [[Lucie Arnaz]] as Judy Connelly, Al's mother\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as \"Chef Ray\" Connelly, Al's father\n[[Adam Carolla]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]] appear as themselves in a sequence in which Al imagines himself being made fun of on ''[[The Man Show]]''. Additional minor roles are played by [[Zay Harding]] and [[Lauren German]] as a lovestruck couple, [[Chloe Hunter]] as one of Al's high school girlfriends, [[Bradley Pierce]] as one of Imogen's high school boyfriends, [[Lola Glaudini]] as a woman Al goes on a date with, [[Alexia Landeau]] as Imogen's cousin, [[Susan Blommaert]] as a psychiatrist, [[Frank Wood (actor)|Frank Wood]] as a doctor, [[Joanna P.

It went on to gross $24.4 million worldwide, below its $35 million budget.<ref name=mojo/> The film received negative reviews from critics. [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it an \"F\" grade, calling the dialogue \"embarrassing in its coy and wistful hungry-heart neuroticism\" while criticizing the lead actors' performances and Isacsson's writing: \"Making his first feature, writer-director Kris Isacsson treats the most squishy-sincere rituals of first love with a quivering sense of discovery. Obviously, it's a discovery to him. For the audience, it's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as ''[[Annie Hall]]''.\"<ref name=\"Gleiberman\">{{cite web |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |date=2000-01-28 |title=''Down to You'' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/review/movie/0,1683,1089,downtoyou.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010507200312/http://www.ew.com/ew/review/movie/0,1683,1089,downtoyou.html |archive-date=2001-05-07 |access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref> In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[A. O. Scott]] described it as \"scrubbed, wholesome and bland\", opining that Isacsson \"seems aware that a feature film requires narrative complication: not even really good-looking people can be happy all the time. But he flees from anything that might involve real human emotion, or for that matter any credible human activity other than looking good.\"<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite web |last=Scott |first=A.
