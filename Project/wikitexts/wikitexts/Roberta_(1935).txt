It was an adaptation of the 1933 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Roberta]]'', which in turn was based on the novel ''Gowns by Roberta'' by [[Alice Duer Miller]].  It was a solid hit, showing a net profit of more than three-quarters of a million dollars.\n\nThe film kept the famous songs \"[[Yesterdays (1933 song)|Yesterdays]]\", \"[[Let's Begin]]\" (with altered lyrics), and \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" from the play, along with a fourth song, \"[[I'll Be Hard to Handle]]\". Three songs from the play were dropped\u2014\"The Touch of Your Hand\", \"Something Had to Happen\" and \"You're Devastating\". Two songs were added to this film, \"[[I Won't Dance]]\" (resurrected from the flop Kern show ''[[Three Sisters (musical)|Three Sisters]]'')<ref name=\"HollywoodMusical\">{{cite book \n|title= The Hollywood Musical\n|url= https://archive.org/details/hollywoodmusical0000tayl\n|url-access= registration\n|last1= Taylor\n|first1= John Russell\n|last2=Jackson\n|first2=Arthur\n|year=1971\n|publisher= McGraw-Hill\n|location= New York\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/hollywoodmusical0000tayl/page/28 28\u201329]}}</ref> and \"Lovely to Look At\", which both became #1 hits in 1935. The latter addition was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song Oscar]]. The songs \"I Won't Dance\" and \"Lovely to Look At\" have remained so popular that they are now almost always included in revivals and recordings of ''Roberta''.\n\nThis was the first of three pairings for [[Irene Dunne]] and [[Randolph Scott]]; ''[[High, Wide and Handsome]]'' (1937) and ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940) were the other two.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,tv_miniseries,documentary,video_game,short&roles=nm0002050,nm0000068&sort=year,asc {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\n''Roberta'' is the third Astaire-Rogers film, and the only one to be remade with other actors. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] did so in 1952, entitling the new [[Technicolor]] version ''[[Lovely to Look At]]''. Indeed, with an eye to a remake, MGM bought ''Roberta'' in 1945, keeping it out of general circulation until the 1970s.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Kent, a former star football player at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], goes to Paris with his friend Huck Haines and Huck's dance band, the Wabash Indianians. Alexander Voyda has booked the band, but refuses to let them play when he finds the musicians are not the [[Native Americans of the United States|Indians]] he expected, but merely from Indiana.\n\nJohn turns to the only person he knows in Paris for help, his Aunt Minnie, who owns the fashionable \"Roberta\" gown shop. While there, he meets her chief assistant (and secretly the head designer), Stephanie. John is quickly smitten with her.\n\nMeanwhile, Huck unexpectedly stumbles upon someone he knows very well. \"Countess Scharwenka\", a temperamental customer at Roberta's, turns out to be his hometown sweetheart Lizzie Gatz. She gets Huck's band an engagement at the nightclub where she is a featured entertainer, and Huck agrees to keep her true identity a secret.\n\nTwo things trouble John: One is Ladislaw, a handsome, deposed Russian prince and doorman, who seems too interested in Stephanie. The other is the memory of Sophie, the snobbish, conceited girlfriend he left behind after they quarreled about his lack of sophistication and polish.\n\nWhen Aunt Minnie dies unexpectedly without leaving a will, John inherits the shop. Knowing nothing about women's fashion and aware that his aunt intended for Stephanie to inherit the business, he persuades Stephanie to remain on as his partner. Correspondents flock to hear what a football player has to say about feminine fashions. Huck gives the answers, making a lot of weird statements about the innovations John is planning to introduce.\n\nSophie arrives in Paris, attracted by John's good fortune. She enters the shop, looking for a dress, but is dissatisfied with everything Stephanie shows her. Huck persuades her to choose a gown that John had ordered to be discarded as too vulgar. When John sees her in it, they quarrel for the final time.\n\nJohn reproaches Stephanie for selling Sophie the gown. Terribly hurt, Stephanie quits the shop. With Roberta putting on a fashion show in a week, Huck takes over the design work, with predictably bad results. When Stephanie sees his awful creations, she is persuaded to return to save Roberta's reputation.\n\nThe show is a triumph, helped by the entertainment provided by Huck, Countess Scharwenka, and the band. The climax is a gown modeled by Stephanie herself. At the show, John overhears that she and Ladislaw are leaving Paris and mistakenly assumes that they have married. Later, he congratulates her for becoming a princess. When she informs him that Ladislaw is merely her cousin and that the title has been hers since birth, the lovers are reunited. Huck and Lizzie, who decide to get married, do a final tap dance sequel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Stephanie\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Huck\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Scharwenka\n* [[Randolph Scott]] as John\n* [[Helen Westley]] as Roberta\n* [[Claire Dodd]] as Sophie\n* [[Victor Varconi]] as Ladislaw\n* [[Luis Alberni]] as Voyda\n* Ferdinand Munier as Lord Delves \n* [[Torben Meyer]] as Albert\n* [[Lucille Ball]], with platinum blond hair, appears (uncredited) in her first RKO film<ref name=\"Pictures-35\">{{cite book \n|title= Lucy: A Life in Pictures\n|last= Frew\n|first= Tim\n|year= 2001\n|type= Trade paperback\n|orig-year=1996\n|edition= First paperback\n|publisher= [[Barnes & Noble|Barnes & Noble Books]]\n|location= [[New York City|New York]]\n|isbn= 0-7607-2866-6\n|page=35}}</ref> as a model wearing an elaborate feather cape, after the vocal by Dunne, in the fashion show.<ref name=\"IMDB\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026942/fullcredits#cast ''Roberta''] cast at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> \n}}\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"The Pipe Organ Number\": Astaire performing on the hands of his band arranged as a keyboard\n* \"Let's Begin\": Comedy song and dance number by Astaire, [[Candy Candido]] and [[Gene Sheldon]], with band\n* \"Yesterdays\": Sung by Dunne, with guitar and string bass accompaniment\n* \"[[I'll Be Hard to Handle]]\": Double dance by Astaire and Rogers, a tap number in which they \"talk with their feet\" (repartee expressed in dance steps).\n* \"[[I Won't Dance]]\": Song by Rogers and Astaire, Astaire introduces at piano; followed by a solo dance to the melody by Astaire\n* \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\": Sung by Dunne (reprise danced by Rogers and Astaire)\n* \"Russian Lullaby\": Sung by Dunne with balalaika orchestra\n* \"Fashion Pageant\": Parade of models in an array of costumes to a medley of songs, with Astaire as master of ceremonies\n* \"Lovely to Look At\": Dunne solo and Rogers and Astaire dance\n* \"Finale Dance\": Astaire and Rogers<ref>[http://www.reelclassics.com/Teams/Fred&Ginger/fred&ginger3.htm \"Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire: ''Roberta'': (1935)\"].
