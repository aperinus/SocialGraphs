The film stars [[Emily Blunt]], [[Rebecca Ferguson]], [[Haley Bennett]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]], [[Allison Janney]], [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], and [[Lisa Kudrow]]. The film follows an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] divorc\u00e9e who becomes involved in a [[missing person]] investigation.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on November 4, 2015, in [[New York City]]. Produced by [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]], ''The Girl on the Train'' was the first film to be distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] as part of DreamWorks' new distribution deal via the company [[Amblin Partners]].<ref>{{cite news |author1=Pamela McClintock |author2=Gregg Kilday |title=Steven Spielberg, Jeff Skoll Team to Form Ambling Partners, Strike Distribution Deal With Universal |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steven-spielberg-jeff-skoll-team-849249/ |access-date=January 25, 2022|work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered in [[London]] on September 20, 2016, before it was theatrically released in the United States on October 7, 2016.<ref name=VarUni/> The film was a box office success, grossing {{US$|173 million|long=no}} worldwide. Although it received mixed reviews, Blunt's performance received widespread acclaim, as well as nominations for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]] at the [[23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] at the [[70th British Academy Film Awards]]. A Hindi-language [[The Girl on the Train (2021 film)|remake of the same name]] was released in 2021, with [[Bollywood]] actress [[Parineeti Chopra]] in the starring role.\n\n==Plot==\nRachel Watson is a recovering alcoholic who aimlessly rides a train into [[New York City]] every day after losing her job and her marriage. From the train, she fixates on the lives of her former husband, Tom, his new wife, Anna, and their neighbors, Scott and Megan Hipwell; Megan worked for Tom and Anna as a nanny for their baby, Evie, but had recently quit.\n\nDuring her marriage to Tom, Rachel became depressed about her infertility and developed a drinking problem which led to continual blackouts and destructive behavior. At a barbecue held by Tom's boss, she drunkenly made a scene and Tom was later fired because of it. Now, while drunk, Rachel often harasses Tom and Anna, calling them repeatedly throughout the day, though she has little memory of this once she sobers up.\n\nOn the way home one afternoon, Rachel becomes infuriated when she spots Megan kissing a stranger. She goes to confront Megan but wakes up in her own bed hours later, covered in blood. Megan is reported missing and Rachel is questioned by Detective Riley because she was seen in the vicinity that day. Rachel contacts Scott, posing as Megan's friend, to tell him about the affair. Scott shows her a picture of Megan's psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic, whom Rachel identifies as the man she saw kissing Megan. As a result, Abdic is questioned as a suspect but tells the police that Scott was emotionally abusive towards his wife, and suspicion shifts to him.\n\nBelieving Abdic is involved in Megan's disappearance, Rachel schedules an appointment with him, but she ends up discussing her own emotional issues. Abdic recalls a session with Megan in which she revealed she had a baby when she was very young. The baby accidentally drowned in the bathtub and Megan never forgave herself for it. Megan is found murdered and tests reveal she was pregnant, but neither Scott nor Abdic was the father. Scott enters Rachel's house and aggressively confronts her for lying to him about knowing Megan, directing the police towards Abdic, and leaving him as the new suspect. Rachel tries to report the assault to the police, believing Scott's violence suggests he may have murdered Megan, but Riley says that he has been ruled out as a suspect as there is CCTV footage of him at a bar at the time.\n\nOn the train, Rachel sees Martha, the wife of Tom's former boss, and apologises for her behaviour at the barbecue where she believes she broke a platter, threw food, and insulted Martha. Martha says she did nothing wrong, and it is revealed Tom had been fired for having sex with co-workers. Rachel realises that Tom [[Gaslighting|planted false memories in her head]] during her drinking binges, and was also violent toward her during her blackouts, which accounts for the injuries she had when she awoke. Meanwhile, Anna suspects Tom of cheating and secretly finds a cell phone hidden in their house; a voicemail reveals that the phone belonged to Megan.\n\nA now sober Rachel remembers that on the day of Megan's disappearance, she caught Megan meeting Tom, and he hit her when she tried to confront them. Realizing that Tom killed Megan when she refused to abort his baby, Rachel warns Anna, who is already aware. When both women confront Tom, he becomes angry, tries to force Rachel to drink alcohol again, throws the drink at her face, and then knocks her unconscious. When Rachel awakens, she flees for the front door but it is locked. Tom tries to strangle her as Anna watches from the top of the stairs, guarding Evie. Rachel doubles back through the kitchen and picks up a corkscrew. Outside, Tom grabs her and\u2014as she turns\u2014she stabs him in the neck with the corkscrew. Anna then appears and twists it deeper into Tom's neck, killing him and avenging Megan's death. Interviewed by Riley, Rachel and Anna tell identical stories about killing Tom in self-defense after he admitted that he was Megan's killer. Anna admits that Rachel had been right about everything.\n\nLater, Rachel visits Megan's tombstone at a cemetery and states: \"We are tied forever now, the three of us, bound forever by the story we shared.\" Later, she sits on the opposite side of the train, hopeful for a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Rachel Watson, a lonely alcoholic, and Tom's ex-wife\n* [[Rebecca Ferguson]] as Anna Watson, a real-estate agent, and Tom's current wife\n* [[Haley Bennett]] as Megan Hipwell, Anna and Tom's nanny, and Scott's wife\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Tom Watson, Rachel's ex-husband, and Anna's current husband\n* [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] as Scott Hipwell, Megan's husband\n* [[Allison Janney]] as DS.
