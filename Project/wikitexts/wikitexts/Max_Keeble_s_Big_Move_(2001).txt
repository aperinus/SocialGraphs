Watts, [[James Greer (writer)|James Greer]], Jonathan Bernstein and Mark Blackwell and starring [[Alex D. Linz]], [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], [[Nora Dunn]], and [[Robert Carradine]]. The plot follows the eponymous Max and his friends, who begin going to junior high school only to learn Max and his family will soon move elsewhere; Max resolves to get even with those who [[bully]] him and his friends before he leaves since he will not remain long enough to face discipline for anything he does.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 5, 2001 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $18 million against its $25 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMax Keeble is a paperboy who starts his first day of middle school. Max is antagonized by the corrupt megalomaniacal school principal, Elliot T. Jindrake, resident school bullies Troy McGinty and Dobbs, and the Evil Ice Cream Man. Max also learns that an animal shelter he visits next door to the school is being closed down to build Jindrake's opulent football stadium.\n\nWhen Max's father, Donald, reveals that he is moving to [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]] for his boss, because he is unable to stand up for himself, Max realizes that he can do whatever he wants to his tormentors, facing no consequences because he will be gone by then. Enlisting his equally socially outcast friends, Robe and Megan, Max sets up a variety of pranks, which include traumatizing Troy by playing the main theme song of the children's television show ''MacGoogles the Highlander Frog'' (which frightened him as a child), then trapping him in the gym with a MacGoogles costume wearer; instigating a fight between Dobbs and the Evil Ice Cream Man by stealing the coolant coil for the [[ice cream van|ice cream truck]] and Dobbs's [[Personal digital assistant|handheld device]]; and ruining Jindrake's chances of becoming successor to the current superintendent, Bobby \"Crazy Legs\" Knebworth (an alumnus who was a star football player for the school) by planting animal pheromones within his breath spray, instigating a food fight in the cafeteria in view of Superintendent Knebworth, and later by sabotaging his TV announcements by placing a cardboard cutout of Max mocking him.\n\nAfter his missions are completed, Max ends up ditching Robe and Megan's going-away party by accepting an invitation to a milkshake party hosted by his crush Jenna, causing a falling-out. Robe tells Max how Megan [[limerence|really feels about him]], and then walks away telling Max that he hopes he enjoys his new life in Chicago. Max then calls Megan's house, telling her mom to relay to her that he is sorry for what happened. Taking Max's earlier advice to heart, Donald announces that he quit his job and started his own business, meaning that Max is not moving after all. Max freaks out at this news, and learns that other students at his school are suffering because of his actions.\n\nMax confronts Jindrake, Troy, and Dobbs one final time, and with the help of other students at his school, Max eventually defeats Troy and Dobbs for good by throwing them into the dumpster with his schoolmates' help and stops Jindrake from demolishing the animal shelter. Jindrake is dismissed and facing criminal charges for [[Embezzlement|manipulating with the school budget]] to build his stadium due to Max tricking Jindrake into publicly admitting to his crimes earlier.\n\nThe film ends when Max rides on his bicycle delivering newspapers around his neighborhood, and the Evil Ice Cream Man starts pursuing him once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alex D.
