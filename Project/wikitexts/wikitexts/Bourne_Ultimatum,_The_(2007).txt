''The Bourne Ultimatum'' is the third installment in the [[Bourne (film series)|''Jason Bourne'' film series]], after ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004). The fourth film, ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'', was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to ''Ultimatum''), ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'', was released in July 2016.\n\n[[Matt Damon]] reprises his role as Ludlum's signature character, former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin and [[psychogenic amnesia]]c [[Jason Bourne]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/jason-bourne-takes-his-case-to-moma/78614 |title=Jason Bourne Takes His Case to MoMA |first=Bruce |last=Bennett |date=May 28, 2008 |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |access-date=September 10, 2009}}</ref> In the film, Bourne continues his search for information about his past before he was part of [[Jason Bourne#Operation Treadstone|Operation Treadstone]] and becomes a target of a similar assassin program.\n\n''The Bourne Ultimatum'' was produced by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and was released on August 3, 2007, and grossed a total of $444.1 million worldwide becoming, at the time, Damon's highest-grossing film with him as the lead. The film received universal acclaim from critics, who considered it to be the best film in the series. It was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2007#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2007]] and went on to win all three of its nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|Following his pursuit by Kirill]] , [[Jason Bourne]] evades [[Moscow]] police through a train station while wounded and deals with more flashbacks of when he first joined [[Jason Bourne#Operation Treadstone|Operation Treadstone]].\n\nSix weeks later, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy reveals the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director]] Ezra Kramer. Meanwhile, in [[Turin]], journalist Simon Ross of ''[[The Guardian]]'' meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to [[London]], after his mention of \"Blackbriar\" during a cell phone call to his editor is detected by the [[ECHELON]] system. Bourne reappears in [[Paris]] to inform Martin Kreutz, the brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz, of her assassination in [[India]].\n\nBourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at [[London Waterloo station]]. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when he panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Ross is shot and killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen. Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels, a CIA [[station chief]] involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels' office in [[Madrid]] but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons, a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to [[Tangier]] and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit.\n\nNicky learns that Blackbriar \"asset\" Desh Bouksani has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Nicky accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Nicky and Bourne as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Bourne follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels's death by a planted bomb. However, Bourne manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Nicky. Bourne opens up to Nicky and then sends Nicky into hiding. Bourne examines the contents of Daniels' briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in [[New York City]], where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Bourne travels to New York.\n\nLandy receives a phone call from Bourne, which is intercepted by Vosen. When Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and gives him the birth date \"4-15-71\", Bourne tells Landy that she looked tired, indicating  that he is in New York and watching her from an overlooking building. Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne of a location to meet up, and leaves his office with a tactical team. Bourne, however, waits for them all to leave, enters Vosen's office, and takes classified Blackbriar documents. When he realizes that he has been tricked, Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, but the resulting car chase ends with Bourne and Paz's vehicles crashing into a concrete barrier. Bourne holds the injured Paz at gunpoint, but spares his life.\n\nBourne arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch, who ran Treadstone's [[behavior modification]] program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, on an upper floor, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne, who now remembers that he was forced to volunteer for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, \"Why didn't you take the shot?\"  Bourne asks Paz if he knows why he's supposed to kill him, and repeats the dying words of The Professor in ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': \"Look at us. Look at what they make you give.\" Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the [[East River]].\n\nThree days later, Nicky watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the status of David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Nicky smiles. Bourne is shown swimming away in the East River.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Starring roles are listed with bullet points here-->\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]], a former operative for the black ops Operation Treadstone.\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Nicolette \"Nicky\" Parsons, Bourne's former Treadstone contact in Paris. \n* [[David Strathairn]] as Noah Vosen, CIA deputy director in charge of the new Treadstone black ops upgrade called Operation Blackbriar.\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Ezra Kramer, director of the CIA.\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Simon Ross, a reporter for ''The Guardian'' who has been investigating Treadstone.\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Paz, a Blackbriar assassin.\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Dr. Albert Hirsch, the psychologist who oversaw Treadstone's behavioral modification program.\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Pamela Landy, CIA deputy director and task force chief, sent in to aid Vosen in tracking down Bourne.\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Martin Kreutz, Marie's brother\n[[Tom Gallop]] reprises his role as special agent Tom Cronin, Pamela Landy's assistant.

What's wonderful is that it's an oppositional story. Is he a killer, or was he made to be a killer? There is an underlying feeling that Bourne is one of us, and he's running away from \"them.\" He's trying to get answers, and he doesn't trust them. They're all bad, and the system's corrupted. To convey that with a sense of excitement in a very contemporary land-scape is great fun. [...] If you opened your door in New York or Paris or London or whatever, you've got to believe that whatever the story it is that Bourne's engaged in [, something] could be happening there.
