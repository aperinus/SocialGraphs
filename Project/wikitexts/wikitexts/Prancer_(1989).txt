Their apple farm has fallen on hard times. John is temporarily being helped by his sister-in-law, Sarah.\n\nWhile walking home after a school Christmas pageant, Jessica and her best friend, Carol, witness a plastic reindeer fall from a Christmas decoration being hung above the main street in town. She concludes that it was [[Prancer (Santa Claus's reindeer)|Prancer]] from the order given in the poem \"[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]\" (a.k.a. \"The Night Before Christmas\").\n\nAfraid he will be unable to provide for Jessica, John discusses a plan for Sarah to take her in to raise temporarily. She overhears this, but initially does not know the full details. She and Carol go sledding and knock down some flowers at a house owned by a reclusive widow named Mrs. McFarland. While walking home, Jessica encounters a live reindeer in the woods. It runs away, disappearing into the darkness. Later, while walking home from school, she finds its tracks and follows them into the woods once more. She hears a gunshot, and continues to walk. John eventually finds her, but almost hits the reindeer who is now standing in the road. Noticing it is wounded, he grabs his rifle, intending to shoot it. As Jessica pleads for him not to do so, it disappears.\n\nLater while dreaming of Prancer, Jessica is startled awake by the scene of the plastic reindeer falling from earlier. She hears a noise and sees that the window to the barn is open. Investigating, she finds the reindeer is now inside among the other animals. Afraid John will find him, she moves him to a shed. Certain that he is the \"real\" Prancer, she takes it upon herself to nurse him back to health. She calls veterinarian Dr. Orel Benton who initially refuses, but comes over to find him.\n\nJessica later tells a [[Shopping mall|mall]] [[Santa Claus|Santa]] that she has Prancer, and gives him a [[Polaroid camera|Polaroid]] picture and a letter to give to the real Santa before Christmas Eve. He takes them to the editor of the local newspaper. Eventually, Jessica apologizes to Mrs. McFarland for knocking down her flowers, and asks her if she can have a job to help pay for oats for the reindeer. Mrs. McFarland agrees to pay her if she cleans a room in her house, and they become friends. The newspaper editor, inspired by Jessica's faith, writes an article which is then read by the local pastor in the middle of his sermon, which makes Jessica find out that she has been outed to the entire town. She becomes mad at Carol, who she thinks squealed. She then terminates her friendship with Carol, and later finds the article in the paper.\n\nJohn, meanwhile, is reading the paper. Before he finds the article, he discovers Prancer has escaped from the barn and let all the other animals out too. While he tries to round them up, Prancer goes inside the house and wrecks it. Townspeople begin to converge on the farm, wanting to see him. John grabs his rifle, threatening to shoot him when a local butcher stops him, offering to buy Prancer. Jessica, afraid the butcher will kill him, runs away in the night determined to rescue him. The butcher keeps him as a sales tool for his Christmas tree lot. Steve runs after her, telling her that he loves her even though they fight. She attempts to open Prancer's cage but falls, injuring her head in the process.\n\nJessica stays in her bedroom, becoming despondent. John goes to her and she asks him to read a passage from \"[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]\". He tells her that times may continue to be hard for a long time but while he could bear losing the farm, he will not lose her. He changes his mind about sending her away to Sarah. He suggests they take Prancer to Antler Ridge, which would be the perfect place for Santa to pick him up. The townspeople gather outside her bedroom window and begin singing to cheer her up. Prancer is taken to Antler Ridge where he runs out of sight. Following his tracks, John and Jessica notice that they vanish at the edge of a cliff. The faint sound of sleigh bells can be heard, and a streak of light is seen rising to meet Santa's sleigh. Jessica bids Prancer farewell, and to always remember her. The sleigh flies across the full moon and over the town toward the Riggs farm\u2014its very first stop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Rebecca Harrell Tickell|Rebecca Harrell]] as Jessica Riggs\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as John Riggs\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Mrs. McFarland\n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Dr. Orel Benton\n* [[Michael Constantine]] as Mr. Stewart/Mall Santa\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Sarah\n* [[Ariana Richards]] as Carol Wetherby\n* John Joseph Duda as Steve Riggs\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Billy Quinn\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Herb Drier\n* [[Walter Charles]] as Minister\n* [[Michael Luciano (actor)|Michael Luciano]] as Bert\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Boy #1\n* Sandra Olson as Town woman\n* Dan Atherton as Town man\n* Boo as [[Prancer (Santa Claus's reindeer)|Prancer]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as it holds a 67% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \"''Prancer's'' good-natured holiday cheer -- and a terrific performance from its young star -- are enough to make this yuletide adventure a moderately rewarding watch\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Prancer|url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prancer/|website = www.rottentomatoes.com|date = 1989-11-17|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref>\n\nThe film's young lead actress, [[Rebecca Harrell Tickell|Rebecca Harrell]], garnered a nomination for a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture for her performance, but lost to [[Winona Ryder]] for her role in ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]''. Movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] highlighted Harrell's performance, saying:\n\n<blockquote>\nAnd what really redeems the movie, taking it out of the category of kiddie picture and giving it a heart and gumption, is the performance by a young actress named Rebecca Harrell, as Jessica. She's something. She has a troublemaker's look in her eye, and a round, pixie face that's filled with mischief. And she's smart -- a plucky schemer who figures out things for herself and isn't afraid to act on her convictions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Prancer|url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/prancer-1989|date = 1989-11-17|\naccess-date = 2017-12-24}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM Home Video]] with several re-packagings in 2003 and 2004, and a newer release on October 7, 2014.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0098115}}\n* {{tcmdb title|87036|Prancer}}\n* {{Mojo title|prancer|Prancer}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|prancer|Prancer}}\n*{{AFI film|id=58238|title=Prancer}}\n\n{{John D.
