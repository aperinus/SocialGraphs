The film is loosely based on the story of [[Anneliese Michel]] and follows a self-proclaimed [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] (Linney) who acts as defense counsel representing a [[parish priest]] (Wilkinson), accused by the state of [[negligent homicide]] after he performed an [[exorcism]].\n\n==Plot==\nErin Bruner, an ambitious lawyer seeking to become a senior partner in her law firm, takes the case of Father Richard Moore, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] diocesan priest charged with [[negligent homicide]] following an attempted [[exorcism]] of 19-year-old student Emily Rose. While the archdiocese wants Moore to plead guilty to minimize the crime's public attention, Moore instead pleads not guilty. During the trial, the statements of the witnesses are visualized via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. Prosecutor Ethan Thomas interrogates several doctors and neurologists to establish a medical cause for Emily's death, particularly [[epilepsy]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Emily had dropped out of her college studies after being consistently struck by delusions and muscle spasms at 3 a.m. She returned to her parents' home and was treated with epilepsy and psychosis medications. Moore was consulted when her condition failed to improve, and his assessment and observations led him to the conclusion that Emily was being [[Demonic possession|possessed by a demon]]. With the consent of Emily's parents, Moore subjected Emily to an exorcism that ultimately failed. Moore surmised that Emily's medications were to blame for the unsuccessful expulsion, as they paralyzed Emily's brain activity and kept the demon out of reach.\n\nMoore, wanting to tell Emily's story, gives his testimony when he is called to the witness stand. Bruner begins experiencing supernatural phenomena at home, waking up at 3 a.m. to the smell of burning material. Moore warns her she may be a target for the demons, revealing he too has experienced similar phenomena on the night he was preparing the exorcism. Bruner supports Moore by summoning anthropologist Sadira Adani to testify about the beliefs surrounding spiritual possession from various cultures, but Thomas dismisses her claims as nonsense. Graham Cartwright, a medical doctor who attended the exorcism, gives Bruner a cassette tape on which the exorcism was recorded, and Moore presents the recording as evidence. Cartwright's testimony to authenticate the exorcism and refute the prosecution's medical case is prevented when he is suddenly struck and killed by a car. A distraught Bruner retreats to her office, where her boss threatens her with termination if she allows Moore to testify again. Bruner visits Moore in his jail cell, where he convinces her to allow him to tell the rest of Emily's story despite her boss's threat.\n\nThe next day, Moore takes the witness stand again and reads a letter that Emily wrote before she died. On the morning after the exorcism, Emily was [[Marian apparition|visited by the Virgin Mary]] in a field near her house and was permitted the choice of ascending to [[Heaven]]. However, Emily chose to endure her suffering and later received [[stigmata]] on her hands. Thomas does not interpret the markings as a divine sign, but rather as traces of self-inflicted injuries. The jury ultimately reaches a verdict of guilty but surprises the court by asking Judge Brewster to give a sentence of time served. Although momentarily shocked by the suggestion, Brewster ultimately accepts it, and Moore is free to go. Bruner is offered a partnership in her firm, but declines. Later, Moore and Bruner pay a visit to Emily's grave, and Moore states that the time will come wherein Emily will be declared a saint. The epilogue reveals that Moore never appealed his conviction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Erin Christine Bruner\n* [[Jennifer Carpenter]] as Emily Rose\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Father Richard Moore\n* [[Campbell Scott]] as Ethan Thomas\n* [[Colm Feore]] as Karl Gunderson\n* [[Joshua Close]] as Jason\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Dr. Mueller \n* Duncan Fraser as Dr. Graham Cartwright\n* [[J.

According to Derrickson's [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he chose Boardman as his co-writer because Derrickson sees himself as a believer and Boardman as a [[Religious skepticism|skeptic]], and believed the pairing would provide the screenplay with two different perspectives, thus providing the film some ambiguity as to whether it supports a religious/supernatural interpretation of the events depicted, or a more secular/medical interpretation.\n\nThe character of Emily Rose was inspired by the story of [[Anneliese Michel]].<ref name=washingtonpost>{{cite news|last=Hansen|first=Eric T.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200559.html|title=What in God's Name?!|date=September 4, 2005|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref> German director [[Hans-Christian Schmid]] made his own film of Michel's story, ''[[Requiem (2006 film)|Requiem]]'', around the same time in late 2006.
