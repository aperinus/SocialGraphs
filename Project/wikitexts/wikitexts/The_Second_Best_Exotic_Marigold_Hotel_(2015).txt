It is the [[sequel]] to the 2011 [[sleeper hit]] film ''[[The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]'' and features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of stars [[Judi Dench]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Dev Patel]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Penelope Wilton]], [[Ronald Pickup]], [[David Strathairn]], and [[Richard Gere]].\n\n==Plot==\nMuriel Donnelly and Sonny Kapoor travel to [[San Diego, California]] to propose a plan to hotel magnate Ty Burley for buying and opening a second hotel in India as a companion to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. They are told that a company inspector will anonymously visit India to evaluate the project.\n\nBack in [[Jaipur, India|Jaipur]], Evelyn Greenslade is offered a job as a fabric buyer. She is concerned that at age 79, the job will require many responsibilities and considerable travel. Douglas Ainslie, who is in love with Evelyn, is worried about losing time with her as well, and also eager to introduce her to his daughter.\n\nSonny's life becomes complicated by plans for his upcoming wedding to Sunaina, plus a possible rival for her affections and his business interests. He is also desperate to impress American visitor Guy Chambers, whom he immediately identifies as the American hotel chain's anonymous inspector. Noting the interest Guy has taken in Sonny's mother, he encourages a romantic relationship between them at first, then angrily resents it when he concludes Guy is not the inspector after all.\n\nMadge Hardcastle's dilemma is deciding between two suitors from India and which to wed. Norman Cousins becomes frantic when he believes a local taxi driver mistakenly assumed Norman wanted a fatal accident to befall his current sweetheart, Carol, but then discovers that she has been sleeping with other men. And Douglas' daughter arrives for a visit with his estranged wife Jean (who returned to the UK at the end of the previous film) seeking a divorce so that she can remarry.\n\nMuriel, while having received bad news from a medical appointment, struggles to keep Sonny from ruining his wedding, his business and his future, having become quite fond of him. Decisions come to a head for all during the colourful wedding of Sonny and Sunaina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dev Patel]] as Sonny Kapoor\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Evelyn Greenslade<ref name=\"cast\" />\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Muriel Donnelly<ref name=\"cast\" />\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Douglas Ainslie\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Madge Hardcastle\n* [[Tina Desai]] as Sunaina\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Jean Ainslie\n* [[Ronald Pickup]] as Norman Cousins\n* [[Diana Hardcastle]] as Carol Parr \n* [[Claire Price]] as Laura Ainslie\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Mrs. Kapoor\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Guy Chambers\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Ty Burley\n* [[Tamsin Greig]] as Lavinia Beech/Theresa\n* [[Shazad Latif]] as Kushal\n* [[Rajesh Tailang]] as Babul\n* [[Denzil Smith]] as Mr Dhurana, the Viceroy Club Secretary\n* [[Sid Makkar]] as Jay\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOn 29 October 2012, [[Vulture.com|Vulture]] reported that screenwriter [[Ol Parker]] was consulted to deliver a treatment to [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] executives for a sequel titled ''The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2''.
