The film follows two young [[Afghan refugees]], Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah, as they leave a [[refugee camp]] in [[Pakistan]] for a better life in [[London]]. Since their journey is illegal, it is fraught with danger, and they must use back-channels, bribes, and smugglers to achieve their goal.\n\nThe film won the [[Golden Bear]] prize at the 2003 [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the [[57th British Academy Film Awards]] the film was nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film]] but lost to [[Touching the Void (film)|Touching the Void]] (directed by [[The Last King of Scotland (film)|The Last King of Scotland]] director [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3491989.stm|title=No Disaster for 'Touching the Void '|website=BBC News|date=16 February 2004|access-date=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJamal and Enayatullah are [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] refugees in a camp in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]]. They travel to [[Quetta]], and thence to [[Taftan (Balochistan)|Taftan]] on the [[Iran]]ian border. They pay [[people smuggler]]s to assist them over the border; on their first attempt they are stopped by Iranian police and returned to Pakistan, but their second attempt is successful. They travel to [[Tehran]] and then to [[Maku, Iran|Maku]], in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish part of Iran]], from where they cross a mountain range on foot to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]] they meet a group of other migrants, and they are taken to [[Italy]] inside a shipping container. The container is not ventilated, and most of the refugees, including Enayatullah, are suffocated to death. Jamal survives and lives in Italy for a time. He then steals a woman's purse and buys a rail ticket to [[Paris]]. From there, he goes to the [[Sangatte]] [[asylum seekers]] camp and with a new friend, Yusef, he crosses the [[English Channel]] by stowing away on a lorry. Finally, he arrives in London, where he calls his uncle to say he has arrived but that Enyatullah is \"not in this world\". The film ends with images of the Peshawar refugees.\n\n==Production and style==\nThe film is shot in a [[documentary film|documentary]] style but it is in fact a drama performed by non-professional actors and with improvised dialogue. The actors are mostly playing fictionalised versions of themselves; for example, Jamal is a real Afghan refugee and the Iranian policeman who deports the two refugees back to Pakistan is played by a real policeman who is re-enacting his normal work for the camera. Enayatullah was a market trader whom the filmmakers cast because they thought him \"a nice guy\". The production team lied to authorities in several countries in order to secure filming rights, having met government resistance in [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]]. Most of the film was shot on location, but the scenes inside the Sangatte camp were actually filmed in England, as the film crew received hostility from the French inhabitants of the nearby village.<ref name=\"R1DVD\">Michael Winterbottom, \"Behind the Scenes Footage with Commentary\", on the Region 1 DVD.</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe film was released in the UK in March 2003 by the [[BBC]] after festival screenings in 2002. It was released in the [[United States]] in a limited number of cities in September 2003 by [[Lions Gate]] as part of the short-lived [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Film Series]] partnership experiment with [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment]]. The film did not make much money, but was highly regarded by the critics that were able to see it. The film holds an 89% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=In this World|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_this_world/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn a case of life imitating art, after returning to Pakistan, Jamal Udin Torabi made the journey to London in reality and applied for [[Political asylum|asylum]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/06/immigration.afghanistan|title=Afghan boy turns movie role into real life|first=Fiachra|last=Gibbons|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 November 2002}}</ref> He lived with a family in [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]], although he was only granted leave to remain in the UK until his eighteenth birthday.
