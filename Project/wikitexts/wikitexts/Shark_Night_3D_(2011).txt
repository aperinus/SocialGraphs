Her boyfriend scares her and takes her bra off. He leaves and she goes to retrieve it. She is then attacked and devoured by a shark.\n\nAt Tulane University, Gordon and Nick are in their dorm when Malik bursts in. Malik tells them that he got a B+ on a exam and that they are going to Sara Palski\u2019s house for the weekend to celebrate. As the three walk out, Malik says he is going to marry his girlfriend Maya. Maya pulls up in a car with Beth. Blake and Sara arrive. The kids drive toward the lake and stop at a bait shop. They meet Dennis Crim and Red. The seven college kids drive toward the lake until Sheriff Sabin appears. Malik, Maya, Nick, and Blake take the boat out to go water skiing. Malik is attacked by a shark and loses his arm. Maya, Nick, and Sara take him in the boat to the hospital. Malik is still bleeding from his arm. It bleeds into a hole in the boat, leaking blood into the water. A shark bumps the boat and devours Maya. The other three are forced to jump off the boat as the steering and brakes stop working.\n\nBy night, Red and Dennis appear and offer to take two people to the hospital. Beth and Gordon decide to go. While on the way Dennis explains that he and Red put the sharks in the lake. He then shoots Gordon in the arm. Gordon swims towards a tree and climbs it but is caught by a shark. Beth gets thrown into a net and gets attacked and killed by a pack of cookie cutters.\n\nBlake tells Malik that Maya is dead and in a burst of rage, Malik tries to kill the shark responsible. Nick notices a camera attached to the shark. Blake tells the others he is taking Malik to a hospital on Sarah\u2019s [[WaveRunner]]. As they drive toward the hospital, Malik sees a great white shark following them. He sacrifices himself and is killed. As Blake tries to escape, the shark jumps out of the water and decapitates him.\n\nSheriff Sabin arrives at the house, where he notices the dead shark on the shore. He radios for backup. Nick passes out, knocking over a container of chicken noodle soup that the sheriff had. Sherman the dog eats it. Sara overhears on the radio about Beth\u2019s death. She and Nick are kidnapped by Dennis and the sheriff.\n\nNick wakes up tied to a chair. He panics as the sheriff explains that Sabin, Red, Dennis, and a bait store clerk were heavily influenced by ''[[Shark Week]]''. They decided to record people getting brutally devoured by sharks. Sabin cuts Nick\u2019s leg and spills gasoline. Nick uses his lighter to burn the rope to free himself. He then throws it at the sheriff who catches on fire. The sheriff falls in the lake and is devoured by a shark.\n\nOn the boat, Dennis chops up fish and dumps the blood and guts all over Sara who is in a shark cage. Nick jumps aboard with a dart gun aimed at Red\u2019s head as he demands that Dennis bring Sarah back up. Dennis agrees, but then pulls out a knife and throws it, hitting Red in the heart. Nick throws the body overboard. Dennis and Nick fight. Nick knocks Dennis into the water and brings Sarah up out of the water. Dennis grabs a lever and pulls it re-submerging the cage.\n\nThe two start to fight again and a shark appears. Dennis gets his leg tangled up in the rope attached to the cage and is eaten. Nick dives down to retrieve a weapon from the ship and kills the sharks. Nick and Sara make it back to the boat along with the dog.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sara Paxton]] as Sara Palski\n* [[Dustin Milligan]] as Nick LaDuca\n* [[Chris Carmack]] as Dennis Crim\n* [[Katharine McPhee]] as Beth Mazza\n* [[Joel David Moore]] as Gordon Guthrie\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Sheriff Greg Sabin\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Red \n* [[Sinqua Walls]] as Malik Henry\n* [[Alyssa Diaz]] as Maya Valdez\n* [[Chris Zylka]] as Blake Hammond\n* Jimmy Lee Jr. as Carl\n* Damon Lipari as Keith\n* Christine Quinn as Jess\n* Kelly Sry as Wonsuk\n* Tyler Bryan as Kyle\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place in the fall of 2010 in [[Louisiana]] around the [[Ark-La-Tex]] and at [[Caddo Lake]] in [[Uncertain, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksla.com/story/14972373/filmed-in-hollywood-south-shark-night-3d-trailer-released|title=Filmed in Hollywood South: Shark Night 3D trailer released|last=Roy|first=Carolyn|work=[[KSLA]]|publisher=[[Raycom Media]] | date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe sharks featured in the film were animatronic sharks built by Edge Innovations, who previously built sharks for movies such as ''[[Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)|Deep Blue Sea]]'', ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', and even the Orca in ''[[Free Willy]]''. According to [[Walt Conti]], the head of Edge Innovations, two models for each shark were built, one \"attacker\" and one \"swimmer\", each of which required very different internal mechanisms. \"Sharks are this total contrast of stealthy, cruising lurking and these intense bursts of power,\" Conti says. \"We split those two behaviors into two different types of models, and optimized each to do one of those things best.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/3d/shark-night-3ds-predators-blow-jaws-out-of-the-water|title = Shark Night's FX Blows Jaws Out of the Water|date = 2 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the movie was always going to be titled ''Shark Night 3D'' overseas, Ellis fought for a name change for the North American release, at one point wanting to release the film under the title ''Untitled Shark Thriller 3D''.<ref name=\"vultureuntitled\">{{cite web|last1=Broddeser-Akner|first1=Claude|title=Snakes on a Plane Director Fighting to Call His Next Film Untitled 3D Shark Thriller|url=https://vulture.com/2011/02/snakes_on_a_plane_director_fig.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Bloody Disgusting would later compare the proposed title of the film to Ellis's previous film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/23364|title='Shark Night 3D' Could Be Titled 'Untitled 3D Shark Thriller'?!|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=June 2015}}\n''Shark Night'' received negative reviews from critics.
