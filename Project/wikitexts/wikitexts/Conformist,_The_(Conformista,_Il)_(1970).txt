The film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], [[Stefania Sandrelli]], [[Gastone Moschin]], Enzo Tarascio, [[Fosco Giachetti]], [[Jos\u00e9 Quaglio]], [[Dominique Sanda]] and [[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]]. The film was a co-production of [[Italy|Italian]], [[France|French]], and [[West Germany|West German]] film companies.\n\nBertolucci made use of the 1930s art and decor associated with the [[Fascist]] era: the [[middle-class]] drawing rooms and the huge halls of the ruling elite.<ref>Buss, Robin.

After receiving a telephone call, Marcello is picked up in a car driven by his superior, Special Agent Manganiello. The film often returns to the interior of this car, as the two of them pursue the professor and his wife.\n\nA series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] depict Marcello discussing with his blind friend Italo his plans to marry, his somewhat awkward attempts to join the Fascist secret police, and his visits to his parents: a [[morphine]]-addicted mother at the family's decaying villa, and his unhinged father at an insane asylum.\n\nIn another flashback, Marcello is seen as a boy who is humiliated by his schoolmates until he is rescued by Lino, a [[chauffeur]]. Lino offers to show him a pistol and then makes sexual advances towards Marcello, which he partially responds to before grabbing the pistol and shooting wildly into the walls and into Lino, then flees from the scene of what he assumes is a murder.\n\nIn another flashback, Marcello and Giulia discuss the necessity of his going to [[Confession (religion)|confession]], even though he is an atheist, in order for her Roman Catholic parents to allow them to marry. Marcello agrees and, in confession, admits to the priest to have committed many [[Mortal sin|grave sin]]s, including his homosexual intercourse with and subsequent murder of Lino, premarital sex, and his absence of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for these sins. Marcello admits he thinks little of his new wife but craves the normality that a traditional marriage with children will bring. The priest is shocked but quickly absolves Marcello once he hears that he is working for the Fascist secret police, called [[Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism]].\n\nMarcello finds himself ordered to assassinate his old acquaintance and teacher, Professor Quadri, an outspoken [[anti-Fascist]] intellectual now living in [[exile]] in [[France]]. Using his honeymoon as a convenient cover, he takes Giulia to Paris where he can carry out the mission.\n\nWhile visiting Quadri he falls in love with Anna, the professor's young wife, and pursues her. Although it becomes clear that she and her husband are aware of Marcello's Fascist sympathies and the danger he presents to them, she responds to his advances and forms a close attachment to Giulia, towards whom she also makes sexual advances. Giulia and Anna dress extravagantly and go to a dance hall with their husbands where Marcello's commitment to the fascists is tested by Quadri. Manganiello is also at the dance hall, having been following Marcello for some time and doubtful of his intentions. Marcello secretly returns the gun that he has been given and gives Manganiello the location of Quadri's country house where the couple plan to go the following day.\n\nEven though Marcello has warned Anna not to go to the country with her husband and has apparently persuaded her to stay in Paris with him, she does make the car journey. On a deserted alpine road, Fascist agents attack and stab Quadri as Anna watches in horror. When the men turn their attention to her, she runs to the car behind for help. When Anna sees that the passenger in the rear of the car is Marcello and realizes his betrayal, she begins to scream uncontrollably, before running into the woods to escape the men trying to kill her. Marcello watches without emotion as she is pursued through the woods and finally shot to death. Manganiello walks away from the car for a cigarette, disgusted with what he sees as Marcello's cowardice in not shooting Anna when she ran to their car.\n\nIn 1943, Marcello now has a small child with Giulia and is apparently settled in a conventional life when the resignation of [[Benito Mussolini]] and the fascist dictatorship is announced. He is called by Italo for a meeting. While walking, they overhear a conversation between two men; Marcello recognizes one of them as Lino whom he thought he had murdered. Marcello publicly denounces Lino as a Fascist, homosexual and the murderer of the Quadris. In his frenzy, he also denounces Italo as a Fascist. As a monarchist political crowd sweeps past, taking Italo with them, Marcello sits near a small fire and stares intently behind him at the young man Lino had been talking to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Marcello Clerici\n** Pasquale Fortunato as 13-year-old Marcello\n* [[Stefania Sandrelli]] as Giulia\n* [[Gastone Moschin]] as Special Agent Manganiello\n* [[Dominique Sanda]] as Anna Quadri, the Minister's Lover, and the Ventimiglia Prostitute\n* Enzo Tarascio as Professor Luca Quadri\n* [[Fosco Giachetti]] as The Colonel\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Quaglio]] as Italo Montanari\n* [[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]] as Pasqualino \"Lino\" Semirama\n* [[Yvonne Sanson]] as Giulia's Mother\n* [[Milly (actress)|Milly]] as Marcello's Mother\n* [[Giuseppe Addobbati]] as Antonio Clerici (Marcello's Father)\n* Antonio Maestri as Don Lattanzi (The Confessor)\n* Christian Aligny as Raoul\n{{div col end}}\n'''Dubbing voices (Italian version)'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sergio Graziani]] as Marcello Clerici\n* [[Rita Savagnone]] as Anna Quadri\n* [[Arturo Dominici]] as The Colonel\n* [[Giuseppe Rinaldi]] as Italo Montanari\n* [[Lydia Simoneschi]] as Giulia's Mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n<small>Source:</small> <small>RaroVideo Blu-ray booklet.<ref name=\"Cast Credits\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       =Credits\n| year        = 2014\n| page        = 3\n| type        =booklet\n| publisher   = RaroVideo\n| id          = BRRVD 088\n}}</ref></small>\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Conf0001.jpg|thumb|Marcello seduces Giulia during their train ride to Paris.]]\n\nThe film is a case study in the psychology of conformism and fascism: Marcello Clerici is a [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]], cultivated and intellectual but largely dehumanized by an intense need to be 'normal' and to belong to whatever is the current dominant socio-political group. He grew up in an [[upper class]], perhaps [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional]] family, and he suffered a major [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual trauma]] and gun violence episode in which he long believed (erroneously) that he had committed a murder. He accepts an assignment from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[secret police]] to assassinate his former mentor, living in exile in [[Paris]]. In Trintignant's characterization, Clerici is willing to sacrifice his values in the interests of building a supposedly \"normal life.\"<ref>Scott. A.O.

It was photographed by [[Vittorio Storaro]], who used rich colors, authentic wardrobe of the 1930s, and a series of unusual camera angles and fluid camera movement. Film critic and author Robin Buss writes that the [[cinematography]] suggests Clerici's inability to conform with \"normal\" reality: the reality of the time is \"abnormal.\"<ref>Buss, Robin. Ibid.</ref> Also, Bertolucci's cinematic style synthesizes [[expressionism]] and \"fascist\" film aesthetics. Its style has been compared with classic [[German cinema|German films]] of the 1920s and 1930s, such as in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.<ref>[http://italian.vassar.edu/bertolucci/conformist.html Klein, Jessi].

In this dazzling film, Bertolucci, 30, manages to combine the bravura style of a [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], the acute sense of period of a [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti]] and the fervent political commitment of an [[Elio Petri]] ('Investigation of a Private Citizen') with complete individuality and, better still, a total lack of self-indulgence.\"<ref name=\"Thomas, Kevin 1971 p. 11\"/>\n\nGary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that the film was \"an extraordinarily beautiful and spellbinding picture,\" but \"what's below the surface doesn't stand up to much analysis. I think this is true and that it amounts to a terrible flaw.

He wrote, \"Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in ''The Conformist'', with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture. This isn't just photography, it's art &mdash; powerful, beautiful, and effective.
