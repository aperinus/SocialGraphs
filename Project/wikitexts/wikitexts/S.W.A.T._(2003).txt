Produced by [[Neal H. Moritz]], it is based on the [[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|1975 television series of the same name]] and stars [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Brian Van Holt]] and [[Olivier Martinez]].\n\nIn the film, Hondo (Jackson) and his SWAT team are tasked to escort an imprisoned drug kingpin/international fugitive to prison after he offers a $100 million reward to anyone who can break him out of police custody.\n\n''S.W.A.T.'' was released in the United States on August 8, 2003. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $207 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[SWAT]] officer Jim Street, his partner Brian Gamble, and their team infiltrate a bank taken hostage by robbers, where Gamble disobeys orders and engages the robbers, causing a hostage to sustain injuries. He and Street manage to subdue the criminals, but are taken off the SWAT team by Captain Fuller, the commanding officer of the [[LAPD Metropolitan Division]]. Fuller offers Street a chance to rejoin the team by implicating Gamble, but he refuses and is demoted to working police inventory while Gamble quits the force and ends their friendship.\n\nSix months later, the chief of police calls on Sergeant Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson, a [[Force Recon|Marine Force Recon]] veteran, to reorganize the SWAT team. Hondo takes an interest in Street, a former [[U.S. Navy SEAL]], and recruits him along with fellow officers TJ McCabe, Michael Boxer, Deacon Kaye, and Chris Sanchez, despite Fuller's protests. They bond as they train together and manage to pass their numerous tests; as they celebrate afterward, Street has a hostile run-in with Gamble. The team then succeeds in their first real mission: subduing an unstable gunman by using a wall-breaching battering ram designed by Street.\n\nFrench [[drug lord]] Alexander Montel arrives in Los Angeles and kills his uncle for embezzlement, after assuming control of his family's criminal empire by killing his father. As he drives to the airport in his uncle's car, he is pulled over by police for a broken tail light, and detained due to discrepancies with his false I.D.; authorities determine that he is an international fugitive and is wanted in several countries. Montel's associates, disguised as LAPD officers, attempt to break him out as he is being transferred to prison, killing two [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff's deputies]]. Hondo's team manages to arrive in time to kill the gunmen and recapture Montel. As reporters swarm the team, Montel announces to the cameras that he is willing to offer 100 million dollars to whoever is able to break him out, which draws the attention of criminals across the city.\n\nThe LAPD prepare to transfer Montel into federal custody by air, but are unable to escape before Gamble shoots down the helicopter. The police send out a large convoy, which is ambushed by gang members but discovered to be a decoy for Hondo's team, who transport Montel in two SUVs. McCabe reveals himself to be in league with Gamble, who critically wounds Boxer and escapes with Montel and McCabe to the subway, where they hijack a subway car and flee through the sewers as the SWAT team gives chase. Fuller then sends all available units to [[Hawthorne Municipal Airport (California)|Hawthorne Airport]] to prevent Montel from escaping by plane.\n\nHondo's team commandeers a limousine to reach the airport, but realize that Gamble has a private plane which will land on the [[Sixth Street Viaduct|Sixth Street Bridge]] to fly the criminals out of the country. Preparing to take off, the plane is intercepted by the SWAT team; Gamble's men are killed, Sanchez is wounded while Kaye arrests Montel, and Hondo confronts McCabe, who commits suicide. Street pursues Gamble to the railyard under the bridge, where they fight hand-to-hand until Gamble is knocked under a passing train and killed. Fuller and the rest of the LAPD arrive, and Hondo's team deliver Montel to federal prison. As the team drive back to Los Angeles, they receive a report of an armed robbery in progress to which Hondo readies his team with prompting from Street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Officer III James \"Jim\" Street\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Officer III Brian Gamble, quits police department after bank robbery case.
