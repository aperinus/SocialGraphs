Dickerson|Ernest Dickerson]] and starring rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] as the eponymous Jimmy Bones, a murdered [[numbers runner]] that rises from the grave to avenge his death. The film is presented as a homage to [[blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s and incorporates numerous elements from the genre.\n\nIt initially met with negative reviews and a dismal box-office performance, but has since been reappraised as a cult classic, especially for Snoop Dogg and Pam Grier's performances, the practical effects, and Dickerson's direction.<ref name=\"BD\">{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3610032/scream-factorys-bones-blu-ray-perfect-way-discover-ernest-dickersons-2001-gem-review/|title=Scream Factory's 'Bones' Blu-ray Is the Perfect Way to Discover Ernest Dickerson's 2001 Gem [Review]|last=Jenkins|first=Jason|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=March 24, 2020|accessdate=April 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/streaming-guides/422981/5-black-horror-movies-that-people-keep-sleeping-on/|title=5 Black Horror Movies That People Keep Sleeping on|date=10 February 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1979, Jimmy Bones ([[Snoop Dogg]]) is a numbers runner who is loved in his neighborhood as its member and protector. He is betrayed and brutally murdered by corrupt cop Lupovich ([[Michael T. Weiss]]) and drug pusher Eddie Mack ([[Ricky Harris (actor)|Ricky Harris]]) who then force Jimmy's associates Jeremiah ([[Clifton Powell]]) and Shotgun (Ronald Selmour) to take turns stabbing him to death. His lover Pearl ([[Pam Grier]]), had been the only one to refuse, trying to kill herself instead but was stopped. Afterward, Bones' elegant brownstone building becomes his own tomb and is closed.\n\nTwenty-two years later, the neighborhood has become rundown because Bones' absence cleared the way for drugs to enter the neighborhood. Four teens, Patrick ([[Khalil Kain]]), his brother Bill ([[Merwin Mondesir]]), their step-sister Tia ([[Katharine Isabelle]]) and their best friend Maurice (Sean Amsing), buy the Bones house to turn it into a nightclub. In the process, Tia finds a black dog who is actually the spiritual manifestation of Jimmy's spirit. As the dog eats, Jimmy is slowly resurrected.\n\nPatrick meets Pearl, who remains in the neighborhood, and her daughter Cynthia ([[Bianca Lawson]]), whom he begins courting. Exploring the basement, Patrick, Cynthia, Bill, Tia, and Maurice find Jimmy Bones' remains and realize he was actually murdered. The five decide to keep quiet about the murder and bury the remains. Jeremiah, father to Patrick and Bill and Tia's stepfather, finds out about their plan to open the club at Bones' old building. He freaks out and demands that Patrick and the others leave the building. Patrick, Bill, and Tia refuse his request and open the nightclub, in spite of their father's objections. On opening night, Maurice is lured into an upstairs room and mauled to death by the black dog.\n\nOnce he is fully resurrected, Jimmy sets the club on fire, scaring off the club goers, and begins his revenge. Shotgun, who is Pearl's neighbor, tells her how they should have burned the building down a long time ago. After the incident, Pearl admits to Cynthia that Jimmy Bones is her father, as she had a relationship with him. Jimmy first confronts Shotgun and mercy kills him (Shotgun has always felt guilty of Bones' death and became an alcoholic). Patrick confronts his father and demands to know if he helped murder Jimmy Bones twenty-two years earlier. Jeremiah admits to betraying Bones to make money and leave the neighborhood. Also, he got fed up living in Bones' shadow. Jeremiah allowed drugs into the neighborhood as long as he got paid for it.\n\nLater, Jimmy confronts Eddie Mack in his home and decapitates him, keeping the head alive and containing his soul. He does the same to Lupovich. Pearl, knowing that Jeremiah is next, goes with Cynthia to his house to rescue him. They end up being too late. Pearl, Cynthia, Patrick, Bill, Tia and Jeremiah's wife Nancy ([[Lynda Boyd]]) watch him get dragged off by Jimmy, leaving nothing but a melted hole in the window. Jimmy brings Jeremiah back to his old house, along with the heads of Lupovich and Mack. Jimmy sends Lupovich and Mack to hell for all eternity while Jeremiah begs for his life.\n\nPatrick, Cynthia, Bill, and Pearl go underground to find that Jimmy Bones' body has disappeared. Pearl tells them that in order to put Jimmy to rest, they have to destroy the dress she wore the night Jimmy was murdered which was buried alongside him, as his blood which splattered onto it still contains his spirit and is the only thing keeping him anchored to the world of the living. As they look for Jimmy, Pearl steps in the elevator which closes and goes up. Meanwhile, Jeremiah asks Jimmy what he wants. He asks Jeremiah if he could give him his life back. When Jeremiah says he can't do that, Jimmy sends him to hell.\n\nPearl gets off the elevator and walks into a room that is filled with ignited candles. She has a flashback and Jimmy appears and puts the bloody dress on her. Patrick, Cynthia, and Bill head to the second floor where they see a ghostly Maurice, who leads Bill in the wrong direction where he is captured and killed. Patrick tries to reach him but is too late. Patrick and Cynthia make their way to the room where Pearl and Jimmy are at; Patrick knows it's a trap. As Cynthia is lured to Pearl and Jimmy, Patrick hears his father's voice in a mirror begging for help. When Patrick hesitates, Jeremiah chokes him. Patrick uses his knife to chop Jeremiah's arm off and he disappears into hell. Patrick goes after Jimmy, who grabs Patrick by the throat as Cynthia begs him to let go. Pearl, realizing what is happening, tells Jimmy she loves him before grabbing a candle and setting herself and the dress on fire.\n\nAs Jimmy and Pearl both die together, Patrick and Cynthia escape, barely making it out before the entire building collapses. Before jumping to safety, Cynthia is briefly pulled back into the building by an unseen force. Outside, Patrick finds an old picture of Jimmy and Pearl as Jimmy's face turns to him and says, \"Dog eat dog, boy.\"  Too late, Patrick realizes that Cynthia has Jimmy's blood within her, and turns around as Cynthia, now possessed by Jimmy, smiles at him and vomits a mouthful of maggots into his face.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as Jimmy Bones\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Pearl\n* [[Michael T.
