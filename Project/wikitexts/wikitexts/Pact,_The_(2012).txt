The film was made following the success of McCarthy's short film of the same name which showed at the [[2011 Sundance Film Festival]]. The film follows Annie, whose mother has recently died, as she tries to discover what caused her sister Nicole and her cousin Liz to disappear.\n\n== Plot ==\nNicole Barlow is finalizing preparations for her mother's funeral at her childhood home in [[San Pedro, California]]. Her sister, Annie does not want to attend, reminding Nicole of the way their mother used to treat them. Nicole tries to contact her cousin, Liz, and her daughter Eva via [[video call]]. After losing the connection, Nicole sees an open door, leading into a dark room and walks inside.\n\nAnnie arrives, having been informed that Nicole is missing, and finds Nicole's phone along with a photo. That night, she awakens from a bad dream and finds a photo of two pregnant women\u2014her mother and a woman in a floral dress. The next day, Annie attends her mother's funeral, and it is shown that Annie has [[Heterochromia iridum|one blue eye and one green eye]], but her mother did not.<ref>{{cite web|title=Director Nicholas McCarthy Ties Up Loose Ends On 'The Pact'|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3202946/director-nicholas-mccarthy-ties-up-loose-ends-on-the-pact/|quote=The eyes thing was actually explained a little more in a cut piece of dialogue from the cousin character, where she remarks on Annie\u2019s eyes being different colors \u2013 she said in the script, \u201cYour mother didn\u2019t have them, so your father must\u2019ve.\u201d I hope that explains it a little more\u2026|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the funeral, Annie meets Liz and Eva, and the three return to Annie's mother's house. Later, Annie dreams of a shirtless man crying, and, while she sleeps, her phone shows a map, pinpointing an address. When Annie awakens and sees a figure in the hall, she enters Liz's room and finds her bed empty. An unseen force tries to attack Annie, but she is able to escape the house with Eva.\n\nThe police don't believe Annie's story, with one officer, Bill Creek, implying her guilt in the disappearances. In a motel, Annie notices the address on her phone, finding a blurred picture of a figure in a floral dress. That night, she dreams of the crying man again, as well as a decapitated woman in a floral dress; still in the dream, Annie tries to flee from the room but the door slams shut.\n\nIn the morning she wakes up, extremely agitated. Annie, accompanied by Bill Creek, returns to her mother's house where they discover a [[secret passage|hidden room]], one which Annie has absolutely no recollection of. When nobody else will take her seriously, she recruits her [[psychic]] friend, Stevie. Stevie, Annie, and Stevie's protective brother Giles go to the house. In the hidden room, Stevie has a hysterical fit, repeating the name \"Judas.\u201d They then see the corpse of a woman in a floral dress floating above them, and Annie realizes that it is not her mother haunting the house.\n\nOutside, Giles blasts Annie for putting his sister in harm's way. They have a brief altercation, and Giles angrily drives away with Stevie, leaving Annie all by herself. Researching Judas online, Annie finds a serial killer, dubbed the \"Judas Killer,\u201d who decapitated a woman in a floral dress, Jennifer Glick. Annie also discovers that her mother has a brother, and that both had connections with Glick.\n\nCreek investigates the house after finding a mysterious photo pointing to a cupboard, where there is a secret door leading into the hidden room. Creek is then murdered by an unknown assailant. Desperate for answers, Annie uses a makeshift [[Ouija]] board to contact Glick, who confirms her suspicions that Glick was murdered by her uncle, the \"Judas Killer.\u201d\n\nAnnie sees Judas come up from a secret hatch, and hides, discovering the bodies of Creek and Nicole. While Judas cries, Annie takes Creek's gun but is overpowered by Judas and knocked unconscious. She awakens to find herself tied up and imprisoned in the closet, but manages to escape, stabbing Judas with a coat hanger.\n\nBefore Judas can kill her, Glick's spirit pulls her away, to Creek's gun. Annie shoots Judas, killing him, noting that he has [[heterochromia]] as well. In the aftermath, Annie is awarded custody of Eva. With Liz and Nicole dead, the house has been sold and is under renovations. In the final scene, Annie sleeps and we see in her dream that Judas' eye opens, and he looks around.<ref>{{cite web|title=Director Nicholas McCarthy Ties Up Loose Ends On 'The Pact'|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3202946/director-nicholas-mccarthy-ties-up-loose-ends-on-the-pact/|quote=The sequence is a dream \u2013 she falls asleep in the hotel, then we cut to her dream.
