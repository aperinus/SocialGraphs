It is the sequel to ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' (2013), and serves as the seventh installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise. The film stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]] (in his final film role), [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Kurt Russell]], and [[Jason Statham]]<!-- PER BILLING BLOCK-->. Having secured amnesty for their past crimes, [[Dominic Toretto|Dom]], [[Brian O'Conner|Brian]], and the rest of their team return to the [[United States|US]] to live normal lives, until Deckard Shaw, a rogue [[United Kingdom Special Forces|UKSF]] and [[MI6]] assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film. Casting showed the returns of Diesel and Walker that same month. [[Principal photography]] began that September in Atlanta, but was indefinitely suspended in November after [[Paul Walker#Death|Walker's death]]; filming resumed in April 2014 and ended in July, with Walkers's brothers Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]] standing-in to complete his remaining scenes, causing delay to its 2015 release date; with other filming locations including Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo. With an estimated production budget of up to $250 million, it is [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films ever made]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, exactly six years after the [[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|fourth film]] was released. Upon release, the film became a commercial success and received positive reviews, with praise being aimed at the cast's performances, action sequences, depth and its emotional tribute to Walker, with many considering the film to be one of the best in the franchise. It grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which was the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->second highest<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!--> of all-time]] at the time. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the <!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

Additionally, ''Furious 7'' became the highest-grossing film of the franchise in the first twelve days of its theatrical release and ranks as the highest-grossing film in the franchise to date. A sequel, ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', was released in April 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter defeating [[Owen Shaw]] and securing amnesty for their past crimes,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' (2013)}} [[Dominic Toretto]], [[Brian O'Conner]] and the team have returned to the [[United States|US]] to live normal lives. Brian accustoms himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, [[Deckard Shaw]], breaks into the hospital where the comatose Owen is held in London, before breaking into the [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] office in [[Los Angeles]] to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Deckard fights Luke Hobbs and escapes, detonating a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister, Mia, that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]], sent from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house shortly after [[Han Lue]], a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Deckard in [[Tokyo]].{{refn|name=Han|group=N|As depicted in ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006) and ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' (2013)}} Dom travels to Tokyo to retrieve Han's body and acquires the objects found at the crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell. As Dom, Brian, Tej Parker, and Roman Pearce mourn Han and [[Gisele Yashar]] at Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom confronts Deckard in an underground tunnel, but Deckard flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by a man only known as Mr. Nobody. \n\nAt his [[air base]] of operations in [[El Segundo, California]], Mr. Nobody tells that he will help Dom in stopping Deckard if he helps him get ''God's Eye'', a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a Nigerian terrorist named Mose Jakande. The team soon [[airdrops]] their off-road modified cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in [[Azerbaijan]], ambush Jakande's convoy and rescue Ramsey. They leave for the [[Etihad Towers]] in [[Abu Dhabi]] and steal the flash drive containing the God's Eye chip from a billionaire hidden in a [[W Motors Lykan HyperSport|Lykan HyperSport]]. With God's Eye secure, Dom, Brian, Nobody, and his team use it to hunt Deckard down to an abandoned factory, but are ambushed by Jakande and his henchmen and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. As Mr. Nobody is medevaced, the team returns to Los Angeles where Dom plans to fight Deckard alone, while Letty, Brian, Tej, and Roman resolve to protect Ramsey from Jakande. Later, Brian promises Mia that he will fully dedicate himself to their family after he defeats Deckard and Jakande. As Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Discovering the situation, Hobbs leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an [[ambulance]]. \n\nBrian battles and kills Jakande's henchman Kiet before hijacking a [[Cellular repeater|signal repeater tower]], allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Meanwhile, Dom and Deckard engage in a brawl on top of a public parking garage. Jakande intervenes and attacks them both; Dom uses the distraction to defeat Deckard by causing part of the parking garage to collapse beneath him. Dom attempts to crash his [[Dodge Charger (1966)#Second generation|Dodge Charger]] onto Jakande's helicopter; he leaves a bag of grenades on the helicopter and crashes on the rubble of the garage. Hobbs shoots the grenades, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. After Brian and Hobbs help Letty bring out Dom's unconscious body, she cradles him and fully regains her memories by remembering their wedding. Dom regains consciousness after Letty tells him this. Deckard is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] prison. The rest of the team relax on a tropical beach. Brian and Mia play with their son Jack while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey look on, acknowledging that Brian is happily retired with his family. Dom drives away and Brian catches up with him. As Dom recalls his memories with Brian, the two bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car crash in 2013.

Both would be written by [[Chris Morgan (filmmaker)|Chris Morgan]] and directed by [[Justin Lin]], who had been the franchise's writer and director, respectively, since ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"SequelLaTimes\"/> On December 20, 2011, following the release of ''[[Fast Five]]'' (2011), [[Vin Diesel]] stated that ''Fast Six'' would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said:<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/>\n\n<blockquote>We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages&nbsp; ... &nbsp;The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'<ref name=\"SequelDec20\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, in an interview on February 15, 2012, [[Dwayne Johnson]] stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on ''Fast Seven'' would only begin after the completion of ''Fast Six''.<ref name=\"SequelFeb1512\"/>\n\nIn April 2013, during the post-production of the retitled ''Fast & Furious 6'', Lin announced that he would not return to direct the seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an accelerated scheduled for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|access-date=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013|archive-date=December 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204003235/https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/104306-interview-fast-furious-6-director-justin-lin|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

On April 16, 2013, Diesel announced that the sequel would be released on July 11, 2014.<ref name=\"Sequel4\"/> In May 2013, Diesel said that the sequel would feature Los Angeles, Tokyo, and the Middle East as locations.<ref name=\"Sequel5\"/><ref name=\"Sequel6\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in early September 2013 in Atlanta, with a casting call issued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/weblogs/buzz/2013/aug/21/fast-and-furious-7-about-start-filming/ |title=\"Fast and Furious 7\" about to start filming in Atlanta; casting call |author=Brett, Jennifer |publisher=Access Atlanta |date=August 21, 2013 |access-date=August 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825063720/http://www.accessatlanta.com/weblogs/buzz/2013/aug/21/fast-and-furious-7-about-start-filming/ |archive-date=August 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Seven ...
