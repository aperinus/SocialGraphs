The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death.\n\nSimon Moore's script was purchased by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] in May 1993, and actress Sharon Stone signed on as both star and co-producer. Development was fast tracked after director Sam Raimi's hiring, and [[principal photography]] began in [[Old Tucson Studios]] in [[Arizona]] on November 21, 1993. The film was distributed by [[TriStar Pictures]] and was released in the United States on February 10, 1995, to a dismal [[box office]] performance, receiving mixed reviews from critics. In later years, however, the film has earned critical praise especially for the performances, direction, cinematography and musical score, with some critics noting it as underrated in Raimi's catalog.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/08/the-quick-and-the-dead-blu-ray-review |title=The Quick and the Dead Blu-ray Review - IGN |date=September 8, 2009 |access-date=2019-05-03 |archive-date=2019-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503075847/https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/08/the-quick-and-the-dead-blu-ray-review |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.slashfilm.com/853138/sam-raimis-western-f-rules/ | title=Sam Raimi's Western F****** Rules | date=May 5, 2022 }}</ref><ref>https://ew.com/movies/sam-raimi-films-ranked/</ref>\n\nThis was Russell Crowe's American [[Western (genre)|Western]] film debut and was [[Woody Strode]]'s final performance (the film is dedicated to him), as well as the last theatrical release of [[Roberts Blossom]] who died in 2011. The phrase \"[[The quick and the dead (idiom)|the quick and the dead]]\" is from the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]] (2 Timothy 4:1) in various Bible versions, including the [[King James Bible]], describing the final judgment. The plot of this film bears no resemblance to that of the [[The Quick and the Dead (1987 film)|1987 film of the same name]], which was based on a western novel by [[Louis L'Amour]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1881, a wanderer known only as \"The Lady\" arrives in the [[American frontier|Old West]] town of Redemption, which is ruled by a ruthless outlaw named John Herod. Herod announces a fast draw [[bracket (tournament)|single elimination]] shooting tournament with the following rules: any contestant may challenge any other, no challenge can be refused, every contestant must fight once per day, and a fight continues until one contestant either yields or dies. The Lady announces her participation, insisting that she is only interested in the large cash prize.\n\nDuring the sign-up, Herod's henchmen arrive with Cort, a former member of their gang with exceptional gunfighting skill. Cort has given up violence to become a preacher and refuses to participate in the tournament. Herod and his men [[lynching|attempt to lynch him]], but The Lady shoots through the rope, saving his life.\n\nThe Lady meets \"The Kid\", a brash young gun dealer who believes Herod is his father and hopes to earn his respect by winning the tournament. She sleeps on his bed (but not with him), and notices barrels of dynamite under it. In the first round, Herod, The Kid, and The Lady easily defeat their opponents. Herod gives Cort a cheap gun and declares that he can only have one bullet at a time, to prevent him from shooting his way out of town. Despite previously swearing not to draw, Cort reflexively does so when threatened and wins his first-round duel.\n\nBefore the second round, Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional [[gunfighter]] hired by the townspeople to kill him. Herod declares that all duels are now to the death and proceeds to kill Cantrell with three precise shots. The Kid goes next, and also wins. That evening, The Lady faces off with Herod's associate Eugene Dred after he rapes the saloon owner's young daughter but refuses to kill him until forced to defend herself. Horrified by having taken a life, she rides out of town.\n\nThe next day, Cort duels a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] gunfighter named Spotted Horse. Cort shoots his opponent, but Herod refuses him a second bullet to finish the wounded Horse as the native stumbles around firing wildly. However, Cort is tossed a cartridge by a blind sundries boy and succeeds in finishing Spotted Horse, much to Herod's amusement and satisfaction at turning the preacher back into a killer. Doc Wallace finds The Lady at a nearby cemetery and tells her that he recognizes her and knows why she is there. Flashbacks reveal that the Lady's real name is Ellen. Her father was the [[marshal]] in Redemption until a young Herod and his gang left him to hang. Herod gives Ellen his own custom pistol (similar to the one she carries as an adult) to shoot the rope and save him, but Ellen accidentally shot her father instead. Doc hands Ellen her father's old badge and begs her to help rid the town of Herod.\n\nEllen rides back to town and convinces Cort to help her defeat Herod. Ellen challenges Herod, but he has already accepted a challenge from The Kid. As Ellen and Cort are the only fighters left, Herod orders them to fight, threatening to kill them himself if they refuse. Herod urges The Kid to withdraw, but he refuses. He wounds Herod but ultimately loses the duel. Herod coldly refuses to take his hand while he dies, only saying that it was never proven that he was the Kid's real father.\n\nWhen Cort and Ellen face off, Cort shoots her in the chest and Doc declares Ellen dead. Cort angrily demands to fight Herod immediately but settles for dawn of the next day. That night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, breaks Cort's right hand. Before the duel, Herod personally kills Ratsy for dishonoring the tournament. Herod confesses that he fears Cort, which is why he forced him to enter the tournament. As a matter of honor, he offers to fight Cort left-handed, but still instructs his henchmen to kill Cort if he wins.\n\nAt the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode, including Herod's house and the clock tower. Ellen emerges from the smoke and flames, having faked her death and planted The Kid's dynamite with help from Cort, Doc, and the blind sundries boy. Cort kills Herod's remaining henchmen while Ellen faces off against Herod, revealing her identity by throwing her father's badge at his feet. Herod wounds Ellen but she shoots him through the chest and finishes him off with a bullet to the eye. Tossing the badge to Cort, she says, \"The law's come back to town\", then saddles up and rides away.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:GeneHackmanJun08.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Gene Hackman portrayed John Herod, the film's main antagonist]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Ellen \"The Lady\"\n** Stacy Linn Ramsower as Young Ellen\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as John Herod\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Cort\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Fee \"The Kid\" Herod\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Horace, The Bartender\n* [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Eugene Dred\n* [[Keith David]] as Sergeant Clay Cantrell\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as \"Ace\" Hanlon\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as \"Scars\"\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as \"Dog\" Kelly\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Ratsy\n* Lennie Loftin as Foy\n* [[Fay Masterson]] as Mattie Silk\n* [[Olivia Burnette]] as Katie\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as \"Doc\" Wallace\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as The Marshal\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as \"Swede\" Gutzon\n* David Cornell as \"Simp\" Dixon\n* Josef Rainer as Virgil Sparks\n* Arturo Gastelum as Carlos Montoya\n* [[Scott Spiegel]] as Gold Teeth Man\n* [[Woody Strode]] as Charlie Moonlight\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as Wedding Shemp\n* Jonothon Gill as Spotted Horse\n* Jerry Swindall as The Blind Boy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nWriter [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] finished his [[spec script]] for ''The Quick and the Dead'' in late 1992, writing it as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[Spaghetti Western]]s of [[Sergio Leone]], particularly the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' starring [[Clint Eastwood]]. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. \"When you introduce women into that kind of world, something very interesting happens and you have an interesting dynamic straight away,\" Moore commented.<ref name=first/> The names of the lead villain ([[Herod the Great|Herod]]) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible.<ref name=first/> Moore considered directing his own script as an [[independent film]] and shooting ''The Quick and the Dead'' on a $3\u20134 million budget in either Spain or Italy.<ref name=first/>\n\n[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased Moore's script in May 1993 and approached [[Sharon Stone]] to star in the lead role in July 1993.<ref name=first>Muir, pp. 171-179</ref> Because Stone also signed on as co-producer, she had approval over the choice of director. [[Sam Raimi]] was hired to direct because Stone was impressed with his work on ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992). The actress told the producers that if Raimi did not direct the film, she would not star in it. Although she had mixed emotions on Raimi's previous work, she believed that the director still had yet to showcase his talents, feeling that ''The Quick and the Dead'' would be a perfect opportunity to \"stretch the limits of his technical and creative ability.\"<ref name=Comp>{{cite book | author = [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]] | title = The Evil Dead Companion | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | location = London | chapter = Blood Still in the Veins | pages = 162\u2013179 | isbn = 0-312-27501-3}}</ref> Moore was also enthusiastic over Raimi's hiring, based on his previous work with the [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''Evil Dead'' film series]].<ref name=first/>\n\nWhen Sony began [[wikt:Fast track|fast tracking]] development of ''The Quick and the Dead,'' the studio commissioned a series of rewrites from Moore.
