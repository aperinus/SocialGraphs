As of the early 2008 release of the film they had created a national debt of over $9.6 trillion, $30,000 for each American.<ref>Paul B.

China has the greatest trade surplus in the world while the USA has the largest trade deficit in the world.\n* The leadership deficit is the lack of civic or political leaders willing to make it clear Americans must cut government spending, pay more taxes, save more of their personal income and use less imported materials.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes\n[[Robert Bixby]], [[David M.

Meant to raise awareness of the skyrocketing national debt and the disaster it spells for future generations, this highly informative docu reps a heady mix of charts, graphs and talking heads, but its superb packaging and timely subject matter should give it a shot at theatrical exposure before it cashes in on homevid and broadcast slots.</blockquote>\n\nIn an August 2008 review focused mostly on the film's subject matter, [[Roger Ebert]] began with the following:<ref name=\"ebertreview\">{{cite news| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/REVIEWS/329/1023 |date= August 21, 2008| title= I.O.U.S.A. | access-date=2011-11-02| author=Roger Ebert| author-link=Roger Ebert| publisher= Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A letter to our grandchildren, Raven, Emil and Taylor: I see you growing up into such beautiful people, and I wish all good things to you as you make the leap into adulthood.

But if they do, they'll find it accomplishes an amazing thing. It explains the national debt, the foreign trade deficit, the decrease in personal savings, how the prime interest rate works, and the weakness of our leaders. No, not only [[George W. Bush]], but politicians of both parties, who know if they vote against tax cuts, they will be lambasted by their opponents and could lose their jobs.</blockquote>\n\nLater that year, ''I.O.U.S.A.'' made Ebert's list of Top Five Documentary Films of 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081205/COMMENTARY/812059997/1023 | title=The best films of 2008... and there were a lot of them | date=December 5, 2008 | access-date=2008-12-07 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | archive-date=2013-02-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220013938/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081205%2FCOMMENTARY%2F812059997%2F1023 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Companion book==\n''I.O.U.S.A. - The Book'' ({{ISBN|0470222778}}), published by [[John Wiley & Sons]], was released in September 2008.
