Seaman]] from [[Gary K. Wolf]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Who Censored Roger Rabbit?]]''. The film stars [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Stubby Kaye]], and [[Joanna Cassidy]], with the voices of [[Charles Fleischer]] and an uncredited [[Kathleen Turner]]. Set in a 1947 version of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] where [[cartoon character]]s (commonly referred to as \"toons\") and people co-exist, the film follows [[Eddie Valiant]], a private investigator who must help exonerate [[Roger Rabbit]], a toon who has been framed for the murder of the [[Acme Corporation]]'s owner.\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] purchased the [[film rights]] for the film's story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] and his production company, [[Amblin Entertainment]]. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film while Canadian animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.\n\nThe film was released through Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner on June 22, 1988. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its visuals, humor, writing, and performances, with critics and audiences considering it to be \"groundbreaking\". It grossed over $351 million worldwide, becoming the [[1988 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 1988]]. It brought a renewed interest in the [[Golden age of American animation]], spearheading [[Modern animation in the United States|modern American animation]] and the [[Disney Renaissance]].<ref>{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Classic Hollywood: On the case of 'Roger Rabbit'|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-rabbit-classic-hollywood-20130401,0,7123062,full.story|access-date=April 16, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 21, 2013|archive-date=April 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404115801/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-roger-rabbit-classic-hollywood-20130401,0,7123062,full.story|url-status=live}}</ref> It won three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and received a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its animation direction by Williams.\n\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 14, 2020|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world co-populated by humans and cartoon characters, \"[[Animated cartoon|toons]]\" regularly interact with real people, act in animated shorts and films, and reside in an area of [[Los Angeles]] known as Toontown. Private detective Eddie Valiant once worked closely with toons alongside his brother Teddy, but sank into depression and alcoholism after Teddy was murdered by a toon during a case.\n\nIn 1947, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor performances of one of his stars, [[Roger Rabbit]]. Maroon hires Eddie to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife [[Jessica Rabbit|Jessica]] being romantically involved with Marvin Acme, owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at an underground nightclub, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing [[patty-cake]] in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger, who becomes distraught about his wife cheating on him.\n\nThe next morning, Acme is discovered dead in his factory, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Eddie meets [[Judge Doom]], Toontown's sinister superior court judge, who uses a chemical substance known as \"The Dip\", capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons. Eddie later runs into Roger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, who tells him that Roger is innocent and that Acme's missing will, which will give Toontown's ownership to the toons, may be the key to his murder. In his office, Eddie finds Roger, who begs him to help exonerate him. Eddie reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar, where his girlfriend Dolores works. Jessica approaches Eddie and says that Maroon forced her to pose for the photographs so he could blackmail Acme.\n\nDoom and his toon weasel henchmen discover Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon [[taxi]]cab. They flee to a theater, where Eddie tells Roger about the tragic loss of Teddy. As they leave with Dolores, Eddie sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf Industries, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's [[Pacific Electric]] transit system shortly before Acme's murder. Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon. Roger is sent to guard outside but he is kidnapped by Jessica. Maroon tells Eddie that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so he could sell the studio, then admits he only did so out of fear for the safety of the toons. Maroon is then murdered by an unseen assailant before he can explain the consequences of the missing will. Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene, and assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Once he finds her, Jessica reveals that it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon and that the former gave her his will for safekeeping, but she soon discovered it was blank. She and Eddie are then captured by Doom and the weasels.\n\nAt the Acme factory, Doom reveals himself as the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf Industries and explains his plot to destroy Toontown with a machine fueled with dip to build a freeway full of attractions in its place and force people to drive it once he has the transit system decommissioned to control all the profits. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's [[water cannon]]. Eddie performs a comedic [[vaudeville]] act full of pratfalls, causing the weasels to [[Death from laughter|die of laughter]] before he kicks their leader into the machine's dip vat, killing him. Eddie then fights Doom, who is flattened by a [[steamroller]] but survives, revealing himself as a disguised toon \u2013 and the one who killed Teddy. Eddie empties the machine's supply onto the factory floor, spraying it all over Doom and melting him to death.\n\nThe emptied machine then crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a train. As the police and many dozens of toons gather at the scene, Eddie reveals Doom as Acme's murderer to everyone, clearing Roger's name. Eddie also discovers that Roger inadvertently wrote a love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in [[invisible ink|disappearing/reappearing ink]], and Toontown's ownership is handed over to the toons. Having regained his sense of humor now that he has avenged Teddy, Eddie happily enters Toontown with Dolores alongside Roger, Jessica, and the other toons.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Do not include Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit as she was uncredited and does not have top billing.

Spielberg's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the [[box-office]] profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Spielberg convinced [[Warner Bros.]], [[Fleischer Studios]], [[Famous Studios]], [[King Features Syndicate]], [[Felix the Cat|Felix the Cat Productions]], [[Turner Entertainment]], and [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Walter Lantz Productions]] to \"lend\" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from this agreement, and some of the original Looney Tunes voice artists being hired to reprise their roles, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of ''Roger Rabbit''. However, executives at Warner Bros. expressed displeasure at the animators using the Daffy design by [[Bob Clampett]] and demanded they use the design by [[Chuck Jones]]; in response to this, Zemeckis had separate artists animate Daffy using Jones' design to satisfy Warner Bros. to use Clampett's design in the final film. The producers were unable to acquire the rights to use [[Popeye]], [[Tom and Jerry]], [[Little Lulu]], [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]], or the [[Terrytoons]] characters for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, [[Western Publishing]], [[Harvey Comics]], and [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]]).<ref name=\"Norman\" /><ref name=\"comment\" />\n\n[[Terry Gilliam]] was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging.

Williams came up with the idea of making the cartoon characters \u201c2.5-dimensional\u201d, and the animated footage was sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately, to give the characters a sense of depth and create the illusion of them being affected by the lighting on set.<ref>[https://www.thewrap.com/why-who-framed-roger-rabbit-broke-all-rules-30th-anniversary/ \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019 Creators on How They Broke All the Rules]</ref><ref name=\"ears\" /> Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage.

Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called ''The Stooge'', based on [[The Stooge|the 1952 film of the same name]]. The proposed film is set in a prequel, taking place five years before ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica. Wolf has stated the film is currently wending its way through Disney.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdizzy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=30567 |title=\u2022 View topic - Mickey Mouse & Roger Rabbit in The Stooge |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |access-date=August 24, 2014 |archive-date=July 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728130030/http://www.dvdizzy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=30567 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2016, while promoting his film ''[[Allied (film)|Allied]]'' in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel \"moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s\". He also stated that the sequel would feature a \"digital Bob Hoskins\", as Eddie Valiant would return in \"ghost form\". While the director went on to state that the script is \"terrific\" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are \"slim\". As he explained more in detail, \"The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Brew|first=Simon|title=Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2 would include \"digital Bob Hoskins\"|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2/45599/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2-would-include-digital-bob-hoskins|publisher=Den of Geek|access-date=November 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130054422/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2/45599/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2-would-include-digital-bob-hoskins|archive-date=November 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In December 2018, while promoting ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'', his latest film, and given the 30th anniversary of ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'', Zemeckis reiterated in an interview with [[Yahoo! Movies]] that though the sequel's script is \"wonderful\", Disney is still unlikely to ever produce it, and he does not see the possibility of producing it as an original film for the streaming service [[Disney+]], as he feels that it does not make any sense as there is no \"[[Disney Princess|Princess]]\" in it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Tom|title=Robert Zemeckis on 'Welcome To Marwen', 'Back To The Future, and 'Roger Rabbit 2'|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/robert-zemeckis-welcome-marwen-back-future-roger-rabbit-2-110025983.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!
