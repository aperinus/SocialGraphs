Fikret U\u00e7ak]] and written by [[Do\u011fan Tamer]] based on the characters created by [[Steve Ditko]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Simon]] and [[Rodolfo Guzm\u00e1n Huerta]], featuring [[Aytekin Akkaya]] as [[Captain America]] and [[Yavuz Selekman]] as [[El Santo|Santo]] called to Istanbul on a special mission to stop the villainous [[Spider-Man]] and his criminal gang. The film, which went on nationwide general release across the country on {{start date|1973|11|1}}, was completely unauthorized by the copyright owners of the characters depicted. The film was popular and thus spawned other rip-offs of other major Hollywood productions<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sinematikyesilcam.com/2013/05/fantastik-turk-sinemasi-3-dev-adam-1973-2/|title=Fantastik T\u00fcrk Sinemas\u0131 - 3 Dev Adam (1973 Three Giant Men)|date=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201173105/http://sinematikyesilcam.com/2013/05/fantastik-turk-sinemasi-3-dev-adam-1973-2/|archive-date=2020-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onedio.com/haber/hollywood-dan-uyarlanmis-olsa-da-ozgun-kopya-niteliginde-olan-11-yesilcam-filmi-734617|title=Hollywood'dan Uyarlanm\u0131\u015f Olsa da \"\u00d6zg\u00fcn Kopya\" Niteli\u011finde Olan 11 Ye\u015fil\u00e7am Filmi|website=Onedio}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story takes place in [[Istanbul]], where a violent criminal organization led by [[Spider-Man]] surfaces in the city with counterfeit [[United States dollar]]s. They also mutilate a woman's face via a [[boat]] propeller. A small task-force consisting of [[Captain America]], [[El Santo|Santo]] and Captain America's girlfriend, Julia arrives to help local police stop Spider-Man and his gang.\n\nJulia, who has infiltrated Spider-Man's hideout, is captured and taken to a house in a remote location. She manages to send an [[SOS]] signal to the Captain. Captain America saves Julia and chases after Spider-Man, who manages to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Mexico]]'s national superhero/wrestler, Santo, infiltrates the [[dojo]] that is used as a front for [[counterfeiting]]. After being captured, he manages to escape along with incriminating evidence.\n\nCaptain America and Santo raid a very important hideout where most of the counterfeiting operation is taking place. They manage to shut down the hideout while Spider-Man kills a couple, steals a statue and runs away.\n\nSoon afterwards, another fight between heroes and Spider-Man begins. It is revealed that Spider-Man is able to spawn duplicates of himself when killed, as one Spider-Man is beaten to a pulp by Santo and another is strangled to death by Captain America.\n\nCaptain America and Santo then go undercover in a nightclub. Spider-Man's gang notice them and a fight occurs. The heroes are seemingly overpowered this time and are taken to Spider-Man's hideout. Once there Captain America and Santo act like they are fighting themselves to confuse their captors but manage to break out and eliminate most of the gang members. Spider-Man arrives at the end of the fight with his girlfriend, only to have her struck by a wild shot from the gun of one of his henchmen. He flees, with Captain America in hot pursuit.\n\nCaptain America catches Spider-Man and defeats him, only to hear the taunting laugh of yet another Spider-Man. The fight continues until each Spider-Man is dead.\n\nAs the heroes are about to leave Istanbul, Captain America sees what appears to be Spider-Man sitting in the back of a taxi and furiously runs to the taxi, grabs the person and immediately removes his mask only to realize that it was just a young boy wearing a red wrestling mask.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yavuz Selekman]] as [[El Santo|Santo]]. The primary difference between this version of El Santo and the original is that the character in the film wears a wrestling mask only briefly, whereas the real-life Santo was never seen in public without one. Santo was famous during the '60s, and he was very well known in [[Turkey]].\n* Aytekin Akkaya as [[Captain America]]. He doesn't have his shield and his mask lacks the wings on the side of his head.\n* Tevfik \u015een as [[Spider-Man]]. He is depicted as a villain, with none of his abilities from the comics. His only superpower here is the ability to come back unharmed from death multiple times, sometimes interpreted as making clones of himself. \n* Do\u011fan Tamer as Inspector Orhan\n* Deniz Erkanat as Julia. Captain America's girlfriend and superhero partner.\n* Mine Sun as Nadya. Spider-Man's girlfriend and partner in crime.\n* Altan G\u00fcnbay as Nightclub Owner\n* Ersun Kazan\u00e7el as Bartender\n* Osman Han as Bouncer\n* Ali Ekdal as Commissioner\n* Nilg\u00fcn Ceylan\tas Janet\n* \u0130hsan Baysal as Bouncer\n* Mehmet Ya\u011fmur as Spider-Man's henchman\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was premiered in Mexico in 1975.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam]]'' \u2013 a Turkish film known to use ripoff footage, most notably from ''Star Wars''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0181947}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|3_mighty_men}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312215429/http://www.antimattermultiverse.com/products/3-dev-adam-dvd Review of film with screenshots and clips]\n*[http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/3devadam/default.php Review of movie at ''I-Mockery'' (contains significant plot detail)]\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s Turkish-language films]]\n[[Category:Turkish superhero films]]\n[[Category:1970s rediscovered films]]\n[[Category:1970s superhero films]]\n[[Category:1970s vigilante films]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man fan films]]\n[[Category:Captain America films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Turkish action films]]\n[[Category:Films about cloning]]\n[[Category:Turkish vigilante films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of El Santo]]\n[[Category:Turkish films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Unofficial film adaptations]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
