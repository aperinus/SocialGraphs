It stars an [[ensemble cast]] that consists of [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Maika Monroe]], [[Travis Tope]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], and [[Judd Hirsch]]. The film takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, during which the [[United Nations]] has collaborated to form the Earth Space Defense, an international military defense and research organization. Through [[reverse engineering]], the world has fused the power of alien technology with humanity's and laid the groundwork to resist a second invasion.\n\nPlans for a sequel to ''Independence Day'' began as early as 2001, with [[20th Century Fox]] eventually [[green-light]]ing the project in 2014. Principal photography began in April 2015 at locations primarily in [[New Mexico]] but also in the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] of [[Utah]], which were featured in the original. This was one of [[Robert Loggia]]'s final projects before he died and the film is dedicated in memory of him.\n\n''Independence Day: Resurgence'' was released by [[20th Century Fox]] in the United States on June 24, 2016, twenty years after the release of ''Independence Day'', in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX 3D]], receiving negative reviews and becoming a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $389 million worldwide at the box office against its $165 million budget.<ref name=\"bombs2\"/><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=Independence Day: Resurgence review|url=https://blewe.com/movies/Independence_Day_Resurgence|website=Blewe|access-date=June 27, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819223657/https://blewe.com/movies/Independence_Day_Resurgence|archive-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"IDR Bombs \u2013 The Wrap\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/5-reasons-why-independence-day-resurgence-bombed/|title=5 Reasons Why 'Independence Day: Resurgence' Bombed|last=Doty|first=Meriah|date=June 26, 2016|website=The Wrap|access-date=June 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/06/26/box-office-independence-day-earns-extinction-level-41m-weekend/#1051ae38e7eb|title=Box Office: 'Independence Day: Resurgence' Bombs With Extinction-Level $41M Weekend|first=Scott|last=Mendelson|work=Forbes}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS.

After establishing [[Area 51]] as its headquarters, the ESD set up bases on the [[Moon]], [[Mars]], and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], and orbital defense satellites above Earth, as [[fortification]]s against future invasions.\n\nESD Director David Levinson meets with [[warlord]] Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the [[Africa]]n [[State (polity)|state]] Republique Nationale d'Umbutu.<ref name=\"Space\">{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/33364-spaceships-independence-day-resurgence.html|title=The Epic Spaceships of 'Independence Day: Resurgence'|date=July 7, 2016|author=Elizabeth Howell|work=[[Space.com]]|access-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> They travel to a landed alien saucer and discover that the aliens were drilling before then sending a distress signal to their homeworld prior to their defeat. It is revealed that people such as former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are [[Telepathy|telepathically]] linked to the aliens' collective consciousness, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.\n\nAn unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's [[Moon]]. Despite objections from Levinson, it is destroyed on the orders of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then collect Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a [[space tug]]. They head for the wreckage in the [[Van de Graaff (crater)|Van de Graaff]] crater, where they recover a large container. An alien [[mothership]], 3000 miles in diameter suddenly appears,<ref name=\"Space\" /> responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of Earth's planetary defense systems before landing over the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], where it starts to drill down toward [[Structure of the Earth#Core|Earth's molten core]] for fuel that will destroy the planet in the process. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug avoided capture and return to Area 51.\n\nWhitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in [[eusociality|a hivemind]] and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Realizing that they had killed a supervising Queen above Earth during the first invasion, Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill this one, her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are ambushed within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.\n\nIn Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of [[virtual intelligence]]. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refugees from other worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls \"Harvesters\", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.\n\nKnowing that the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hides her in an [[isolation chamber]] and uses a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission, leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus destroying the enemy ship by sacrificing himself. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an [[Force field (fiction)|energy shield]] and a battle breaks out. During the engagement, when the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a critical hit by Whitmore's daughter Patricia deactivates her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to kill her before she can take the sphere.\n\nWith the Queen gone, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential [[counterattack]] on the Harvesters' homeworld.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 150\n| image1    = Jeff Goldblum June 2016.jpg\n| width1    = 1239\n| height1   = 1692\n| image2    = Liam Hemsworth June 2016.jpg\n| width2    = 1005\n| height2   = 1536\n| image3    = Maika Monroe June 2016.jpg\n| width3    = 712\n| height3   = 944\n| footer    = [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Liam Hemsworth]] and [[Maika Monroe]] at the film's premiere in Japan in June 2016.\n}}\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as Jake Morrison, a pilot of the Earth Space Defense and Patricia Whitmore's fianc\u00e9, who lost his parents when the aliens first attacked.\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as David Levinson, the director of the Earth Space Defense and the United States government's leading researcher on extraterrestrial technology.\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as [[List of fictional presidents of the United States (U\u2013Z)#President Thomas J.

''Crucible'' serves as a prequel to the film and was published on May 24, 2016. A novelization of ''Independence Day: Resurgence'' by Alex Irvine followed on June 21 before the film's release and it differs from the film in that the character of the President survives most of the alien conflict as a prisoner of the Harvester Queen and is killed when the ship is destroyed, instead of being killed when the aliens attack the fortified bunker in Colorado and it also reveals - in POV exposition, during the scene where the Queen captures the sphere - that the sphere aliens are responsible for the creation of the Harvester aliens, who turned on them and wiped them out, though this plot device is not further explored in the book and may not be considered canon in any further films since it was not used in the final film. Titan Comics started a six issue comic book miniseries, ''Independence Day: Dark Fathom'', written by [[Victor Gischler]], with art by Tazio Bettin, which serves as a prequel set between the first and second films, and which began its run on March 23 and ended on June 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/independence-day-resurgence-get-comic-826664|title='Independence Day: Resurgence' To Get Comic Book Prequel (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 2015, the first trailer was released by 20th Century Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/13/10034926/independence-day-resurgence-trailer-jeff-goldblum|title=The first trailer for Independence Day: Resurgence has arrived|website=The Verge|date=December 13, 2015}}</ref> A TV spot was shown during [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016.
