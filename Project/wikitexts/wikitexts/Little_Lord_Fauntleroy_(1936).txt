Cedric's prejudiced English grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt (C.&nbsp;Aubrey Smith), had long ago disowned his son for marrying an American.\n\n[[File:Little-Lord-Fauntleroy-1936.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Dolores Costello]] and [[Freddie Bartholomew]]]]\n\nThe earl sends his lawyer Havisham ([[Henry Stephenson]]) to bring Ceddie to England. As the earl's sons are all dead, Ceddie is the only remaining heir to the title. Mrs.&nbsp;Errol accompanies her son to England, but is not allowed to live at Dorincourt castle. For Cedric's happiness, she does not tell him it is because of his grandfather's bigotry. The earl's lawyer is impressed with the young widow's wisdom. However, the earl expresses skepticism when Mr.&nbsp;Havisham informs him that Cedric's mother will not accept an allowance from him.\n \nCedric soon wins the hearts of his stern grandfather and everyone else. The earl hosts a grand party to proudly introduce his grandson to British society, notably his sister Lady Constantia Lorridaile ([[Constance Collier]]).\n\nAfter the party, Havisham informs the earl that Cedric is not the heir apparent after all. American Minna Tipton ([[Helen Flint]]) insists her son Tom ([[Jackie Searl]]) is the offspring of her late husband, the earl's eldest son. Heartbroken, the earl accepts her apparently valid claim, though Tom proves to be a rather obnoxious lad.\n\nCeddie's friend Dick Tipton ([[Mickey Rooney]]) recognises Minna from her newspaper picture. He takes his brother Ben, Tom's real father, to England and disproves Minna's claim. The earl apologises to Ceddie's mother and invites her to live with the delighted Ceddie on his estate.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n {{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 240\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) 2.jpg\n| width1    = 240\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Freddie Bartholomew]], [[Guy Kibbee]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) 3.jpg\n| width2    = 240\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Freddie Bartholomew, [[Mickey Rooney]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) 4.jpg\n| width3    = 240\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = [[Henry Stephenson]], Freddie Bartholomew, [[Dolores Costello]], [[Una O'Connor (actress)|Una O'Connor]]\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    = Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936) 1.jpg\n| width4    = 240\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = [[C.
