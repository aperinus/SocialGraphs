It was Farley's last leading film role and was released following his death in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1804, Leslie Edwards, a foppish aristocrat, and the loud, low-brow Bartholomew Hunt are competing against the renowned [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis & Clark]] to be the first to chart and make it across the [[United States]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In the beginning of the film, Edwards has high hopes to head the first expedition to make it across the U.S., but while he has ambition and funding, he has grown up sheltered and knows little of the wilderness he seeks to cross. To aid in his journey, he hires the services of a supposedly knowledgeable wilderness-man and tracker, Hunt, who, once they get underway, turns out to be less than advertised.\n\nThey are aided by a crew of varied, rugged and grizzled frontiersmen, including the group's version of [[Sacagawea]], a young Indian woman by the name Shaquinna, who is integral in helping them find their way across the dangerous and unknown terrain ahead, as well as eventually becoming Edwards' love interest. Along the way, the group goes through various mishaps and ordeals from having to deal with quirky, indigenous Indian tribes and vicious eagles, to running out of food and romantic snafus, as Hunt's ineptness often causes more problems than it solves. Along the way, Edwards and Hunt's shared journey helps Edwards shed his aristocratic, snooty ways and he learns camaraderie and honor, as well as a more humble view of a world he thought he understood. Hunt finds true friendship in Edwards and a sense of self-confidence he had not known before.\n\nAfter many hardships and setbacks, they eventually make it to the Pacific coast just minutes before Lewis and Clark's expedition; however, once the celebration is over, they find that they do not necessarily want to go back to their old lives and collectively decide to continue their adventure, leading Edwards and Hunt's expedition to further explore the great uncharted world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Bartholomew Hunt\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Leslie Edwards\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Guy Fontenot\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Hidalgo\n* [[Lisa Barbuscia]] as Shaquinna\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Jonah\n* [[David Packer (actor)|David Packer]] as Bidwell\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Pratt\n* [[Patrick Cranshaw]] as Jackson\n* Steven M.

Because the screenwriters shared the same agent, Rob Carlson, as [[Steve Oedekerk]], known at the time for his success writing for [[Jim Carrey]], Oedekerk was able to help the script circulate.  It became a hot script and was ultimately purchased by Turner Pictures.<ref name=\"bestinshowbook\">{{cite book |last=Muir |first=John |title=Best in Show: The Films of Christopher Guest and Company |publisher=[[Applause Theatre & Cinema Books]] |year=2004 |isbn=1557836094}}</ref>\n\nChris Farley was the first actor to be cast.  The writers originally wanted to offer the role of Leslie Edwards to [[Hugh Laurie]]; at that point, he was a star only in the United Kingdom, so Turner executives wished for a more recognizable actor. The role was turned down by [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Bill Murray]] before Matthew Perry accepted the part.<ref name=\"bestinshowbook\" /><ref name=\"farleybiography\">{{cite book |last1=Farley |first1=Tom |last2=Tanner |first2=Colby |title=The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0143115564}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film had a budget of {{US$|30 million}} (equivalent to about ${{inflation|US|30|1998}} million in {{inflation/year|US}}).  Feeling that the humor of the story was in putting the goofball protagonists against a historical backdrop, the filmmakers opted for realism in the art design. Principal photography began in the summer of 1996. Four weeks were spent shooting in the Big Bear region of Northern California.  A town representing St. Louis circa 1804 was constructed at Reading Island park (not really an island) on the Sacramento River, east of [[Cottonwood, California]], and a Native American village set was built upriver. Heat posed a major challenge for the summer shoot, with actors wearing furs in temperatures of over one hundred degrees.<ref name=\"bestinshowbook\" /> For the sequences of the boat on the River, the 2nd unit crew traveled to West Central [[Montana]] to film scenic areas on the Missouri River, right along the [[Helena National Forest]] and [[Lewis and Clark National Forest]]. Additional scenes were shot on locations in [[Humboldt County, California]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hesseltine|first1=Cassandra|title=Complete Filmography of Humboldt County|url=http://humboldt.filmhumboldtdelnorte.org/filmography|website=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission|publisher=Humboldt Del Norte Film Commission|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFilming was completed in the fall of 1996, with a 1997 release target.  However, the film was delayed a full year due to the pending merger between [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] and [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]. Then Chris Farley passed away on December 18 1997 of a drug overdose. By the time the film was released in May 1998, Chris Farley had been dead nearly six months.<ref name=\"bestinshowbook\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nWriter Tom Wolfe (not the [[Tom Wolfe|author of the same name]]) stated that the script was intended to be more of an ensemble piece than the [[buddy comedy]] the studio saw it as. Farley's assistant, Ted Dondanville, stated that in post-production, cuts were made around the star and targeted peripheral characters.  He felt that the lost material would have helped Farley's performance. \"They cut the ensemble scenes first, Matthew Perry's second, and Chris's never.\"<ref name=\"farleybiography\" />\n\nA scene featuring Edwards' sweetheart, played by [[Parker Posey]], was cut, as was the film's original ending.  The re-shot ending did not include Bokeem Woodbine, resulting in his character Jonah disappearing after the fight against the conquistadors.<ref name=\"bestinshowbook\" />\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception of ''Almost Heroes'' has been generally negative. The film has a 5% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 39 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"A sorry swan song for the talented Chris Farley, ''Almost Heroes'' is a directionless comedy that doesn't even come close to triumph.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Almost Heroes |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/almost_heroes/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-02-18 }}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' gave the film one out of four stars and wrote: \"This is a dreadful motion picture - a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio. There's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/almost.html |title=Almost Heroes - A Film Review by James Berardinelli |publisher=reelviews.net |access-date=2011-11-29}}</ref>  Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: \"''Almost Heroes'' [...] gives off the discomfiting reek of desperation. ... How could director Christopher Guest [...] have reduced himself to staging gags such as Farley's slap-fest with hostile Injuns, Eugene Levy (as a nasty pirate) speaking in a zany French accent, or Farley stealing an egg from an eagle's nest, punching out the bird, and then falling to the ground with an epic thud? ''Almost Heroes'' goes thud too. Despite his compulsion to trash everything in his midst, including himself, Chris Farley deserved better.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283612,00.html |title=Almost Heroes - Reviewed by Owen Gleiberman |publisher=ew.com |date= 1998-06-12|access-date=2011-11-29}}</ref>  John R. McEwen of ''Film Quips Online'' wrote: \"It's clear, his death notwithstanding, that Farley is the funniest thing about this... As expected, there is little here but sight gags and low humor, but if you're in the mood (and I must have been), it has its laugh-out-loud moments. ... Perry also has a few good bits, but he is obviously a distant second banana. Additional appearances by people like Eugene Levy and Kevin Dunn, and others, add to the hilarity, although many of the jokes fall flat...I doubt if anyone ever expected Chris Farley to win an Academy Award. But it is a fitting tribute to him that his last outing, while not a great work of American cinema, can provide a good dose of chuckles, and more than a few belly laughs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmquipsonline.com/almostheroes.html |title=Almost Heroes - Review by John R. McEwen |publisher=filmquipsonline.com |access-date=2011-11-29}}</ref>\n\nOne of the film's producers, [[Denise Di Novi]], reflected on the failure of the end product:\n\n{{Blockquote|text=The script was brilliant.  We even hired Christopher Guest to direct it.  I've thought so many times about what went wrong.  I always like to say I have the distinction of making the only unsuccessful Christopher Guest movie.\n\nYou never know with movies.  It's kind of like alchemy; the chemistry just didn't work.  It had all the right actors.  It had a great director, a great script.  But I think the tone of the comedy was very odd.  It almost read better than it played.  It wanted to be a quirky, British, ''[[Blackadder|Black Adder]]'' type of comedy, and here we had Chris Farley and Matthew Perry.  It was just a weird combination. |author=Denise Di Novi<ref name=\"farleybiography\" />}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Wagons East|''Wagons East''}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119053|title=Almost Heroes}}\n* {{Amg movie|162432|Almost Heroes}}\n\n{{Christopher Guest}}\n\n[[Category:1990s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Christopher Guest]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Denise Di Novi]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1804]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
