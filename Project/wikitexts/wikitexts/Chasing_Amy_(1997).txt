The film is about a male comic artist (Affleck) who falls in love with a [[lesbian]] woman (Adams), to the displeasure of his best friend (Lee). It is the third film in Smith's [[View Askewniverse]] series.\n\nThe film was originally inspired by a brief scene from an early film by a friend of Smith's. In [[Guinevere Turner]]'s ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'', one of the lesbian characters imagines her friends passing judgment on her for \"selling out\" by sleeping with a man. Smith was dating Adams at the time he was writing the script, which was also partly inspired by her.<ref>{{cite web | author = Kevin Smith | date = June 26, 2000 | url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/79 | title = Kevin Smith's comments on his own film | work = The Criterion Collection | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081209052031/http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/79 | archive-date = December 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews, praising the humor, performances and Kevin Smith's direction. The film won two awards at the 1998 [[Independent Spirit Awards]] (Best Screenplay for Smith and Best Supporting Actor for Lee). Characters from the film would go on to appear in later Askewniverse films ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001) and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'' (2019), direct spin-offs of ''Chasing Amy'', with Affleck, Lee, Adams and Ewell reprising their roles in cameo appearances; Smith described the characters' roles in ''Jay and Silent Bob Reboot'' as being an \"eight-page sequel\" to ''Chasing Amy''.\n\n==Plot==\nComic book artists and lifelong best friends Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones at a [[comic book convention]], where they are promoting their comic ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]''. Immediately attracted to Alyssa, Holden soon learns she is a lesbian. The two begin spending time together, and a deep friendship develops. Holden eventually confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, they sleep together and begin a romantic relationship.\n\nThis new development worsens matters between Holden and Banky, as Banky resents Alyssa for coming between him and his best friend. Banky uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, telling Holden that Alyssa once participated in a [[threesome]] with two men. This upsets Holden, who has believed that he was the only man Alyssa had ever slept with, and he clumsily attempts to make her confess, leading to an argument. She angrily confirms the threesome but refuses to apologize for her past sexual experiences, wanting to continue their relationship. Holden leaves feeling unsure.\n\nLater, while Holden has lunch with [[Jay and Silent Bob]], Silent Bob reveals that he once had a relationship similar to Holden's. Though he loved his girlfriend Amy, her promiscuity made him end the relationship. Later regretting it, he says he has \"spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.\"\n\nMoved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend, while telling Banky that he realizes that Banky is gay and in love with Holden, proposing a [[threesome]]. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, but Alyssa refuses, reasoning that it will not save their relationship, and that the proposal is offensive. Alyssa and Banky both leave.\n\nOne year later, both Banky and Alyssa are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention. It is revealed that Holden and Banky dissolved their partnership of ''Bluntman and Chronic'', the rights to which Banky now exclusively owns. Banky smiles sadly at seeing Holden, who silently congratulates him for his own solo comic being successful. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, encouraging Holden to speak to her. During their brief emotional conversation, Holden gives her a copy of ''Chasing Amy'', his new comic based on their relationship. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who she was talking to. Smiling and teary-eyed, Alyssa replies, \"Oh, just some guy I knew.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Holden McNeil\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Alyssa Jones\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[Banky Edwards]]\n* [[Dwight Ewell]] as Hooper\n* [[Jason Mewes]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Jay]]\n* [[Kevin Smith]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]]\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Fan\n* [[Scott Mosier]] as Collector\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Little Kid\n* [[Brian O'Halloran]] as Exec. #1\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Exec. #2\n* [[Carmen Llywelyn]] (credited as Carmen Lee) as Kim\n* [[Guinevere Turner]] as Singer\n* [[Joe Quesada]] (uncredited) as Himself\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nOn a budget of $250,000, the film grossed a total of $12,021,272 in theaters.<ref name=\"productions1\"/><ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>Sciretta, Peter (January 21, 2015).

The unique concept of the book is that it is roughly half-novel, half-[[manga]], with [[Moyoko Anno]] providing the art for the comic book pages.<ref>[http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?series_id=&series_id=62&section=profiles Vizmedia.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904234656/http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?series_id=&series_id=62&section=profiles |date=September 4, 2009 }}</ref>  In an episode of ''[[SModcast]]'', Smith revealed that while he was thrilled to have a manga based on his film, he was shocked when he read the novelization, as the characters' sexual histories, which are just mentioned in conversation in the film, are depicted in the novel's manga illustrations as sexually graphic flashbacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nSmith had the original screenplay published along with his ''Clerks'' script from [[Miramax Books]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film had no [[soundtrack album]] released, however, many songs make an appearance in the movie, including a cover of [[The Cars]]' \"[[Let's Go (The Cars song)|Let's Go]]\" performed by [[Ernie Isley]], \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], \"[[Run's House (song)|Run's House]]\" by [[Run-DMC]] and other songs by artists such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[The Hang Ups]], [[Gwen Guthrie]] and [[Liz Phair]].\n\nThere are two songs by the band [[Soul Asylum]] featured in the film: \"Lucky One\" and \"We 3\". The band had previously contributed the song ''Can't Even Tell'' to the soundtrack of Smith's 1994 debut film ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]''. [[Soul Asylum]] frontman [[Dave Pirner]] composed the incidental music for the film, and the film's theme song, \"Tube of Wonderful\", which plays over the opening credits. The song makes a re-appearance in Smith's 2001 film ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', as well as its 2019 reboot ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]'', both times introducing the character Holden McNeil.\n\nThe [[music video]] for the song \"Have You Seen Mary\" performed by the band [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]] features several scenes of the film. In ''Chasing Amy'', the song is played in the scene while Holden and Hooper are at Jack's Music Shoppe.\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn a scene originally written for ''[[Mallrats]]'', several principal characters share memories of sexual escapades gone awry. This scene reveals the character's own emotional \"sex scars\" and was purposefully created\u2014down to the style of dialogue and set dressing\u2014to mirror a scene from [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' in which Quint and Hooper share the physical scars they've both earned from encounters with sharks. However, in this film it's used with Alyssa and Banky.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/79 |title=The Hows and Whys of 'Chasing Amy' |publisher=Criterion.com |access-date=May 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209052031/http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/79 |archive-date=December 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0118842}}\n* {{tcmdb title|324214}}\n* {{Allmovie title|154583}}\n* {{mojo title|chasingamy}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|chasing_amy}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/79-the-hows-and-whys-of-chasing-amy ''The Hows and Whys of Chasing Amy''] an essay by Kevin Smith at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/chasing_amy.html DailyScript.com] \u2013 The ''Chasing Amy'' screenplay\n\n{{Kevin Smith}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1997 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1997 independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about anti-LGBT sentiment]]\n[[Category:Films about comics]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional painters]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Smith]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Scott Mosier]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Kevin Smith]]\n[[Category:Homophobia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Male bisexuality in film]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:View Askew Productions films]]\n[[Category:View Askewniverse films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
