It was directed by [[Michael Apted]], from an original story and screenplay by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]] and [[Bruce Feirstein]].<ref>Simpson, p 26</ref> It was produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]]. The title is the translation of the motto on the Bond family [[coat of arms]], seen first in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter [[Elektra King|Elektra]], who was previously held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a [[nuclear meltdown]] in the waters of [[Istanbul]].\n\nFilming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film received mixed reviews, with the plot and [[Denise Richards]]' casting frequently targeted for criticism; it also received praise for the performances of Brosnan and [[Sophie Marceau]], and for its emotional weight and focus on characters in comparison to previous entries. ''The World Is Not Enough'' earned $361.8&nbsp;million worldwide. It was also the first [[Eon Productions|Eon]]-produced ''Bond'' film officially released under the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] label instead of [[United Artists]], the franchise's original owner and distributor.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Bilbao]], MI6 agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] meets a [[Swiss bank]]er named Lachaise to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of [[M (James Bond)|M]]. Bond interrogates the banker to identify the assassin of an MI6 agent, but Lachaise is killed before revealing this information, and Bond is forced to escape with the money. At MI6 headquarters in London, the money is revealed to be laced with explosives that kill King. Bond chases the assassin by boat on the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the [[Millennium Dome]], where she attempts to escape via [[hot air balloon]]. Bond offers her protection; she refuses and blows up the balloon at the cost of her life.\n\nBond traces the recovered money to Renard, a [[KGB]] agent turned [[terrorist]]. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet embedded in his brain, which makes him immune to pain but will eventually kill him. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter Elektra, whom Renard had previously abducted and held for ransom. Bond flies to [[Azerbaijan]], where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, [[paragliding|paraglider]]-equipped [[snowmobile]]s.\n\nBond visits [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]] at a casino to acquire information about Elektra's attackers. There, Bond grows suspicious as Elektra immediately loses $1 million on a game of high card draw, and discovers that Elektra's head of security, Sasha Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] base in [[Kazakhstan]]. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] Dr. Christmas Jones. Renard removes the [[GPS]] locator card and weapons-grade [[plutonium]] from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard steals the bomb and flees, leaving everyone to die. Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Bond warns M that Elektra may not be as innocent as she appears, and hands her the locator card as proof of the theft. An alarm sounds, revealing that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to a [[Pigging|pipeline inspection pig]] heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They jump clear of the rig and a large section of the pipe is destroyed. Bond and Jones are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for having advised her father not to pay the ransom money.\n\nBond accosts Zukovsky at his [[caviar]] factory in the [[Caspian Sea]] and they are attacked by Elektra's helicopters. Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was to accept a payoff via bets in his casino in exchange for the use of a [[submarine]] captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to [[Istanbul]], where Jones realizes that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting [[nuclear meltdown]] would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the [[Bosphorus]]. Elektra's pipeline, planned to go around Istanbul, would dramatically increase in value. Bond gets a signal from the locator card at the [[Maiden's Tower]] before Zukovsky's henchman Bull blows up the command centre. Zukovsky is knocked unconscious, and Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a [[garrote]] and reveals that she cut off a portion of her ear to make her kidnapping look more believable. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra. Before dying, Zukovsky uses his [[cane gun]] to free Bond, who frees M and kills Elektra.\n\nBond dives after the submarine, boards it and frees Jones. The submarine's hull ruptures as it sinks into the Bosphorus. Bond fights Renard and impales him by firing the plutonium rod into his stomach. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate underwater. Later, they share a romantic evening in Istanbul and end up in bed together while being monitored by MI6 satellites.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as [[Elektra King]], an oil heiress who is seemingly being targeted by Renard, the world's most wanted terrorist. M gives Bond the task of protecting her at all costs, although he suspects that there is more to her than meets the eye. [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Vera Farmiga]] were also considered for the role before Broccoli saw Marceau's performance in ''[[Firelight]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Field|first=Matthew|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930556527|title=Some kind of hero : 007 : the remarkable story of the James Bond films|date=2015|others=Ajay Chowdhury|isbn=978-0-7509-6421-0|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|oclc=930556527|access-date=9 September 2021|archive-date=28 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211128234516/https://www.worldcat.org/title/some-kind-of-hero-007-the-remarkable-story-of-the-james-bond-films/oclc/930556527|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Victor \"Renard\" Zokas, a former [[KGB]] agent turned high-tech terrorist who previously kidnapped Elektra.

The Nintendo 64 version was developed by [[Eurocom]] and the PlayStation version was developed by [[Black Ops (developer)|Black Ops]].<ref>Black Ops had previously adapted ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' for the PlayStation and would go on to develop ''[[007: Nightfire|Nightfire]]'' in 2002.</ref> Versions of ''The World Is Not Enough'' for the [[Personal Computer|PC]] and the [[PlayStation 2]] were planned for release in 2000, but both were cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134285p1.html|title=The World Is Not Enough preview (PS2)|website=IGN|date=27 April 2001 |access-date=17 December 2007|archive-date=1 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101084107/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/134/134285p1.html|url-status=live}}</ref> These versions would have used the [[id Tech 3]] [[game engine]] from ''[[Quake III Arena]]''.
