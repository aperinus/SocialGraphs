It is about two gentlemen pretending to be people other than themselves. Interwoven in their storylines are two romance-stricken ladies, each possessing an unusual allegiance to the manliness of the name Ernest. London man-about-town Jack Worthing, who hides behind the name Ernest, is an aristocrat from the country with uncertain lineage. His friend, Algernon Moncrieff, is of moderate means and has also created an imaginary character, Bunbury. Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax, has caught the eye of Jack. Jack's ward in the country, Cecily Cardew, has caught the eye of Algernon. Lady Bracknell rules the roost with her heavy-handed social mores.\n\nThe story begins in London. Jack and Algy are discussing life and love. Both reveal to each other their imaginary characters, Ernest and Bunbury. Jack reveals that he is in love with Algy's cousin, Gwendolen, and Algy reveals that he is in love with Jack's ward, Cecily. Both gentlemen begin to scheme the pursuit of their love. At tea that afternoon, Jack and Gwendolen secretly reveal their love for one another. Gwendolen makes it known that her \u201cideal has always been to love someone by the name of Ernest.\u201d Jack fears she will find out his true identity. Lady Bracknell inquires as to Jack's pedigree. Jack confesses that he does not know who his parents are because, as a baby, he was found in a handbag in a cloakroom at Victoria Station. Lady Bracknell will not allow her daughter \u201c\u2014a girl brought up with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel.\u201d\n\nAt the manor house in the country, Cecily is daydreaming as her governess, Miss Prism, tries to teach her German. Uninvited, Algy arrives from London and assumes the role of Ernest. While Algy and Cecily are getting acquainted with the parlor, Jack arrives in black mourning clothes and informs Miss Prism that his brother, Ernest, is dead. When Algy and Cecily come out to see him, the sad news loses its believability as everyone now thinks Algy is Ernest. In pursuit of Jack, Gwendolen arrives from London and meets Cecily. They both discover that they are engaged to Ernest, not realising one is Jack and one is Algy. When the men arrive in the garden, the confusion is cleared up. The ladies are put off that neither one is engaged to someone named Ernest.\n\nLady Bracknell arrives, by train. As everyone gathers in the drawing room, Lady Bracknell recognises Miss Prism as her late sister's baby's governess from twenty-eight years before. Miss Prism confesses that she inadvertently left the baby in her handbag at Victoria Station. Jack realised they are talking about him. He retrieves the handbag from his private room and shows Miss Prism. She acknowledges that the bag is hers. Lady Bracknell then tells Jack that he is her late sister's son and the older brother to Algy. Unable to ascertain who his father was, Jack looks in an Army journal, as his father was a general, and realises that his father's name was Ernest.  Thus it becomes apparent that his real name is also Ernest &ndash; as Lady Bracknell says, being the eldest son, he must have been named after his father.\n\nThe film ends with Jack saying, \u201cI\u2019ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Michael Redgrave]] as John (Jack) Worthing\n*[[Michael Denison]] as Algernon Moncrieff\n*[[Edith Evans]] as Lady Bracknell\n*[[Joan Greenwood]] as Gwendolen Fairfax\n*[[Margaret Rutherford]] as Miss Prism\n*[[Miles Malleson]] as Canon Chasuble\n*[[Dorothy Tutin]] as Cecily Cardew\n*[[Aubrey Mather]] as Merriman\n*[[Walter Hudd]] as Lane\n*[[Richard Wattis]] as Seton\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe film is largely faithful to Wilde's text, although it divides some of the acts into shorter scenes in different locations. Edith Evans's outraged delivery of the line \"A ''hand''bag?\" has become legendary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/209-the-importance-of-being-earnest|title=The Importance of Being Earnest|first=Charles|last=Dennis|website=The Criterion Collection|date=24 June 2002}}</ref> As actor [[Ian McKellen]] wrote, it is a performance \"so acclaimed and strongly remembered that it inhibits audiences and actors years later\", providing a challenge for anyone else taking on the role of Lady Bracknell.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Ian |last=McKellen |url=http://www.mckellen.com/writings/750413observer.htm |title=On The Test of Time |magazine=[[The Observer Magazine]]|location=London |date=13 April 1975}}</ref>\n\nThe film is noted for its acting, although the parts played by Redgrave and Denison called for actors ten years younger.
