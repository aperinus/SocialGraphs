It was Hitchcock's first American project, and his first film under contract with producer [[David O. Selznick]]. The screenplay by [[Robert E. Sherwood]] and [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], and adaptation by [[Philip MacDonald]] and [[Michael Hogan (screenwriter)|Michael Hogan]], were based on the 1938 novel [[Rebecca (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Daphne du Maurier]].\n\nThe film stars [[Laurence Olivier]] as the brooding, aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter and [[Joan Fontaine]] as the young woman who becomes his second wife, with [[Judith Anderson]], [[George Sanders]] and [[Gladys Cooper]] in supporting roles. The film is a [[Gothic fiction|gothic tale]] shot in [[Black and white|black-and-white]]. Maxim de Winter's first wife Rebecca, who died before the events of the film, is never seen. Her reputation and recollections of her, however, are a constant presence in the lives of Maxim, his new wife and the housekeeper [[Mrs. Danvers]].\n\n''Rebecca'' was theatrically released on April 12, 1940 to critical and commercial success. It received eleven nominations at the [[13th Academy Awards]], more than any other film that year. It won two awards; [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], becoming the only film directed by Hitchcock to win the former award. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Rebecca-Olivier-Bates-Fontaine.jpg|thumb|In Monte Carlo, Max de Winter ([[Laurence Olivier]]) stops to speak to Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper ([[Florence Bates]]) only after recognizing her companion ([[Joan Fontaine]]), the girl he had encountered earlier.]]\n[[File:Rebecca (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for Rebecca]]\n\nMaxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge and contemplates jumping. A young woman shouts at him and stops him in his tracks, but he rudely asks her to walk on.\n\nLater, at [[Monte Carlo]] on the [[French Riviera]], the same young woman is staying with her pompous old travelling companion, Mrs. Van Hopper, and she again encounters the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, looking much more debonair. They are attracted to each other, and although Van Hopper tells her he is still obsessed with his dead wife, who we are told drowned in the sea near Manderley, she soon becomes the second Mrs. de Winter.\n\nMaxim takes his new bride back to [[Manderley]], his grand mansion by the sea in southwestern England, dominated by its housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a chilly individual who had been a confidante of the first Mrs. De Winter, whose death she has not forgotten. She has even preserved Rebecca's grand bedroom suite unchanged, and displays various items that carry her monogram.\n\nEventually, his constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his first wife, which could explain his irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to please her husband by holding a costume party as he and Rebecca used to. Danvers advises her to copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. Nevertheless, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled since Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death.\n\nMrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, but Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window in Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog, and in the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat has been discovered with Rebecca's body in it.\n\nMaxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start when Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When she claimed she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, she fell, struck her head, and died. To conceal the truth, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled, and identified another body as Rebecca's.\n\nThe crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her na\u00efve ways as they both plan to prove Maxim's innocence. When the police claim the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim by threatening to reveal that she had never been suicidal. When Maxim goes to the police, they suspect him of murder. However, further investigation reveals that she was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to [[Suicide methods#Indirect|goad him into killing her]] so Maxim would be ruined.\n\nA free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Joan Fontaine]] as the second Mrs. de Winter\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter, owner of Manderley\n* [[Judith Anderson]] as [[Mrs. Danvers]], housekeeper of Manderley\n* [[George Sanders]] as Jack Favell, Rebecca's first cousin and lover\n* [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]] as Frank Crawley, Maxim's estate manager of Manderley and friend\n* [[Gladys Cooper]] as Beatrice Lacy, Maxim's sister\n* [[C.

However, Rebecca was not pregnant but had incurable cancer and had a motive to commit suicide, that of punishing Maxim from beyond the grave. Therefore, her death is declared a suicide, not murder.\n\nHitchcock later said that Selznick wanted the smoke from the burning Manderley to spell out a huge \"R\", which Hitchcock thought lacked subtlety. While Selznick was preoccupied by ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), Hitchcock was able to replace the smoky \"R\" with the burning of a monogrammed n\u00e9glig\u00e9e case lying atop a bed pillow. Hitchcock edited the film \"[[In-camera editing|in camera]]\" (shooting only what he wanted to see in the final film) to restrict the producer's power to re-edit the picture.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=Charlotte |date=2005 |title=It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock, A Personal Biography |location=New York |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |page=129 |author-link=Charlotte Chandler }}</ref> But Selznick relished the post-production process; he personally edited the footage, laid in [[Franz Waxman]]'s score, and supervised retakes and extensive re-recording of the dialogue of Sanders, Bates and Fontaine. Rewrites and reshooting were called for after a rough cut was previewed on December 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Leff\">{{cite book |last=Leff |first=Leonard J. |date=1987 |title=Hitchcock and Selznick: The Rich and Strange Collaboration of Alfred Hitchcock and David O.

In the novel, Mrs. Danvers is something of a jealous mother figure, and her past is mentioned in the book. In the film, Mrs. Danvers is a much younger character (Judith Anderson would have been about 42 at the time of shooting), and her past is not revealed at all. The only thing known about her in the film is that she came to Manderley when Rebecca was a bride.\n\nThe [[Breen Office]], Hollywood's censorship board, specifically prohibited any outright hint of a lesbian infatuation or relationship between Mrs. Danvers and Rebecca,<ref name=Leff/>{{Rp|70}} though the film clearly does dwell on Danvers' obsessive memories of her late mistress.\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported in 1944 that Edwina Levin MacDonald sued Selznick, Daphne du Maurier, United Artists and Doubleday for plagiarism. MacDonald claimed that the film ''Rebecca'' was stolen from her novel ''Blind Windows'', and sought an undisclosed amount of accounting and damages.<ref>''The Hollywood Reporter'', January 13, 1944</ref> The complaint was dismissed on January 14, 1948<ref>''The Fresno Bee Republican'', January 17, 1948 \u2013 see ''e.g.'' [https://www.dumaurier.org/guestbook.html here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807025002/http://www.dumaurier.org/guestbook.html|date=August 7, 2012 }}</ref> and the judgment can be read online.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/194873075fsupp6551561|title=MacDONALD v.
