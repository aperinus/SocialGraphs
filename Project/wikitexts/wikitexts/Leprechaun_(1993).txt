Davis plays a vengeful [[leprechaun]] who believes a family has stolen his pot of gold. As he hunts them, they attempt to locate his gold to mollify him.\n\nOriginally intended as [[horror film|straight horror]], Davis injected humor into his role, and reshoots added increased gore to appeal to older audiences. ''Leprechaun'' was the first in-house production at [[Trimark Pictures]] for theatrical exhibition; it earned a domestic gross of $8.6 million against a budget of roughly $1 million and became a [[cult film]]. While initial reviews were negative, the commercial success prompted a [[Leprechaun (film series)|series of films]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1983, Dan O'Grady returns to his home in [[North Dakota]] from a trip to his native [[Ireland]], where he stole the pot of gold from a leprechaun he interrogated. After burying the gold, O'Grady discovers that the evil leprechaun has followed him home and murdered his wife. O'Grady uses a [[four-leaf clover]] to suppress the leprechaun's powers and trap him inside a crate. Before he can burn him, he suffers a stroke.\n\nTen years later, J. D. Redding and his teenage daughter Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 10-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While looking around the basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's cry for help and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. The leprechaun tells Ozzie that he works as a shoemaker in Ireland, but came to America looking for his gold. After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing that he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear that Ozzie might hurt himself. A bag of one hundred gold coins magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a coin, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves, hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.\n\nAt the farm, the leprechaun lures J. D. into a trap by imitating a cat, biting and injuring his hand. Tory and the others rush him to the hospital, and the leprechaun follows on a tricycle. Alex and Ozzie visit a pawn shop to see if the gold is pure, and the leprechaun kills Joe the shop owner for stealing his gold and shines the dead shop owner's shoes before leaving. The leprechaun fixes himself a small go-kart and goes back to the farmhouse, getting pulled over by a police officer on the way back for speeding. The police officer gets chased by the leprechaun into the woods, eventually getting killed by the leprechaun in the process. The leprechaun returns to the farmhouse, where he searches for his gold and shines every shoe that he finds. After leaving J. D. at the hospital, the group drives back to the farmhouse. Finding it ransacked, Nathan checks outside, where he is injured by a bear trap set by the leprechaun. The group fights the leprechaun outside, ganging up and beating him up with sticks and stone.\n\nAfter finding a shotgun in the farmhouse, they shoot the leprechaun several times. When this has no effect, they attempt to flee the farm, but their truck's engine has been sabotaged by the leprechaun. After ramming the truck with the go-kart, the leprechaun terrorizes the group until Ozzie reveals that he and Alex found the pot of gold. Tory recovers the bag from the well and gives it to the leprechaun. Believing the worst to be over, they leave for the hospital. While counting his gold, the leprechaun discovers that he is missing the last coin that Ozzie swallowed. Thinking that they have tricked him, he menaces them until Ozzie tells them about O'Grady, who was taken to a nursing home after his stroke. The group distracts the leprechaun by throwing dirty shoes around, which the leprechaun can't resist but to go and shine them, while Tory gets into her jeep and drives off. Tory visits the home to learn how to kill the leprechaun.\n\nAt the nursing home, the leprechaun pretends to be O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her that the only way to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover, which happens to grow in a big batch outside the farm. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she searches for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Ozzie reveals that he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him trying to get it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, causing him to melt away. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out to continue menacing the group. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and the leprechaun with gasoline. As the cops arrive in the morning and investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as Lubdan The Leprechaun\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Tory Redding\n* [[Ken Olandt]] as Nathan Murphy\n* [[Mark Holton]] as Ozzie Jones\n* [[Robert Hy Gorman]] as Alex Murphy\n* David Permenter as Deputy Tripet\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Sheriff Roy Cronin\n* [[Shay Duffin]] as Dan O'Grady\n* Pamela Mant as Mrs. O'Grady\n* John Sanderford as J.D.

Desiring to make a film, he decided that a low budget horror film was his best opportunity. Jones was inspired by the [[Lucky Charms]] commercials to create a leprechaun character, only his twist was to turn the character into an antagonist. Jones was further influenced by the film ''[[Critters (film)|Critters]]'', which featured a small antagonist. Jones brought the concept to [[Trimark Pictures|Trimark]], who were looking to get into film production and distribution. ''Leprechaun'' became the first film produced in-house by Trimark to be theatrically released. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' quoted the budget at \"just under $1 million\".<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/08/25/leprechaun-warwick-davis-jennifer-aniston|title=Shlocky charms: The crazy rise and 'terrifying' return of 'Leprechaun'|last=Collis|first=Clark|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2014-08-25|access-date=2015-02-11}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Fangoria]]'', Jones stated that he began writing the script in 1985 and spent a long time developing the Leprechaun character, which he initially envisioned as a \"horrible, murderous creature\", but which became a more comedic and developed character before filming began.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_111_1992_Sleepwalkers_QualityControl-BONES_c2c|title=Leprechaun Lucky Harms|last=Shapiro|first=Marc|publisher=Fangoria (111)|year=1992|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_111_1992_Sleepwalkers_QualityControl-BONES_c2c/page/n66 26]\u201329}}</ref> Warwick Davis, who had experienced a dry spell after playing the protagonist in ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'', liked the script and was excited to play against type. Jennifer Aniston, who was an unknown at the time, impressed Jones, and he fought to have her cast.<ref name=\"ew\" />\n\nShooting occurred from October 28-December 3, 1991, and beginning at Valencia Studios, where ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' had recently finished production. Several violent scenes were filmed at [[Big Sky Ranch]], where ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' and ''[[The Waltons]]'' were shot. Davis later said it felt \"a little blasphemous\".<ref name=davis>{{cite book|title=Size Matters Not|last=Davis|first=Warwick|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=9781118119396|pages=190\u2013194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wi2PvSo3AkEC&pg=PA190}}</ref> Davis performed most of his own stunts. For the scene where Davis chases Aniston in a wheelchair, Aniston had to run in slow motion so that Davis could keep up with her, as he had trouble manipulating the wheels.<ref name=davis/> The film was initially more of a straightforward horror film, but Davis sought to add more comedic elements. Jones agreed with this tonal shift, and they shot it as a horror comedy.<ref name=ew/> Several scenes had to be re-shot after the producers insisted that the film be made gorier to appeal to older audiences.<ref name=davis/>\n\nGabe Bartalos performed the make-up effects. Trimark contacted Bartalos to produce a sample. Bartalos's early efforts were not to his liking, and he pushed the design in a more grotesque direction, as that was what he wanted to see on the screen as a horror fan. Bartalos's design impressed Trimark, and he got the account. Applying the make-up took three hours, and taking it off took another 40 minutes.<ref name=ew/> Davis described the experience as \"not a pleasant sensation\".<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/warwick-davis-13743|title=Interview: Warwick Davis|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|work=[[The A.V.

Davis was conscious of the need to stay relaxed and not move, and he channelled his confidence that the make-up effects were properly applied into his acting.<ref name=avclub/>\n\n== Release ==\nLeading up to the film's release, Trimark engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign, partnering with the [[National Basketball Association]], [[American Stock Exchange]], and, after failing to secure deals with either corporate headquarters, individual franchisees of [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1993/01/29/marketing-leprechaun|title=Marketing 'Leprechaun'|last=Broeske|first=Pat H.|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1993-01-29|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref> ''Leprechaun'' opened on January 8, 1993, in 620 theatres and took in $2,493,020 its opening week, ultimately earning $8,556,940 in the United States.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=leprechaun.htm|title=Leprechaun|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2015-02-11}}</ref> [[Vidmark]] released it on VHS in April,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-04-09/entertainment/9304070735_1_leprechaun-reservoir-dogs-consenting-adults|title=Movies|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=1993-04-09|access-date=2015-02-11}}</ref> and it sold over 100,000 copies.{{sfn|Muir|2011|p=293}} The film score was released on March 9 by [[Intrada Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/leprechaun-mr0000133036|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2016-07-04|title=Leprechaun - Kevin Kiner}}</ref> The film was released on DVD in August 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63|title=DVD ETA: A Flood of Second-Half Releases Signals Format's Arrival|last=Traiman|first=Steve|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=110|issue=28|date=1998-07-11|pages=63\u201368}}</ref> Lionsgate released a triple feature collection on March 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/new-lionsgate-dvd-cover-art-and-info-march/|title=New Lionsgate DVD Cover Art and Info \u2013 March|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|work=Collider.com|date=2008-02-10|access-date=2015-02-11}}</ref> All seven films in the series were released on Blu-ray in a collection in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/exclusive-detailscover-art-leprechaun-the-complete-movie-collection-blu-ray-set/|title=Exclusive details/cover art: \"Leprechaun: The Complete Movie Collection\" Blu-ray set|last=Gingold|first=Michael|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2014-06-24|access-date=2015-02-11}}</ref> The film is often broadcast on cable channels such as [[Syfy]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/st-patricks-day-good-for-a-google-doodle-and-a-leprechaun/|title=St. Patrick's Day good for a Google Doodle and a 'Leprechaun'|last=Hubbard|first=Amy|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2013-03-17|access-date=2015-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.13newsnow.com/entertainment/how-jennifer-aniston-made-st-patricks-day-scary/86974540|title=How Jennifer Aniston made St. Patrick's Day scary forever|access-date=2016-07-04|date=2016-03-17|last=Haidet|first=Ryan|publisher=[[WVEC]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Sequels and reboot ===\n{{Main|Leprechaun (film series)}}\n''Leprechaun'' was followed by five sequels: ''[[Leprechaun 2]]'' (1994), ''[[Leprechaun 3]]'' (1995), ''[[Leprechaun 4: In Space]]'' (1997), ''[[Leprechaun in the Hood]]'' (2000), and ''[[Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood]]'' (2003).
