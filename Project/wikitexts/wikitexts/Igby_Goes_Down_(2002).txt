The film was written and directed by [[Burr Steers]], and stars [[Kieran Culkin]], [[Claire Danes]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Jared Harris]]. It was given a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] through [[United Artists]] on September 13, 2002, in the United States, and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nCulkin and Sarandon received [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations for their performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/2003?page=1|title=Winners & Nominees 2003|work=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|date=January 19, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJason \"Igby\" Slocumb Jr. is a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] 17-year-old boy, rebelling against the oppressive world of his strict East Coast \"[[old money]]\" family. His [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] father, Jason has been committed to an institution. Igby fears that he will eventually suffer a [[mental breakdown]] like his father. His mother, Mimi, is self-absorbed and distant and tends to [[alcoholism|drink]] heavily. Igby mockingly describes his ambitious older brother Ollie as a [[Fascism|fascist]] or a [[Young Republican]], and that he studies \"[[neo-fascism]]\" (economics) at [[Columbia University]].\n\nIgby figures that there must be a better life out there, and he sets out to find it, rebelling against his family at every opportunity. After happily flunking out of several [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], he ends up in a brutal military academy where he gets beaten by his classmates. After escaping and spending time in a Chicago hotel courtesy of his mother's credit card, Igby is sent to New York for the summer to stay with his godfather, successful real estate magnate D. H. Banes.\n\nWhile working construction for D. H., Igby first encounters Rachel, his godfather's [[Edie Sedgwick]]-influenced, [[heroin]]-addicted trophy mistress. Rather than return to school, he escapes into the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] underworld of Manhattan, hiding out with Rachel and her [[performance art]]ist friend Russel at her studio owned by D. H. Eventually, he and Rachel have sex. After being found at the studio by D. H. and getting beaten up by Rachel for jeopardizing her living arrangements, he hooks up with terminally bored, part-time lover, Sookie, only for her to later leave him for Ollie.\n\nDespite seeming cold and distant, Mimi is not unaffected by her rebellious son. She describes Igby's conception as an act of animosity and therefore believes that it shouldn't be a surprise that his life follows the same course. His name is explained as a family in-joke. As a child, he would blame his toy bear, Digby, for things he had done only he was mispronouncing it as \"Igby\". To get him to take responsibility for his actions, his family would call him Igby whenever he lied.\n\nIgby is informed by D. H. that his mother Mimi is dying from [[breast cancer]] and so he returns to see her. She asks Igby to be present for her death. She has arranged to commit [[suicide]] with help from Ollie, who feeds her drug-laden strawberry yogurt before ultimately placing a plastic bag over her head.<!-- The film opens at this point but a more linear description of the plot is simpler for this article. -->\n\nBefore she dies, Mimi makes a final revelation, casually inquiring of Igby, \"I take it you know that D. H. is your father?\" Igby visits his father Jason in the hospital before leaving for [[Los Angeles]] to finally make a clean break by getting 3,000 miles away from his family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Jason \"Igby\" Slocumb Jr.\n** [[Rory Culkin]] as 10-year-old Igby\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Sookie Sapperstein\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as D.
