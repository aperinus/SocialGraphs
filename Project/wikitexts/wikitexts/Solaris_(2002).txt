It is based on the 1961 [[Solaris (novel)|science fiction novel of the same name]] by Polish writer [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]].\n\nReflecting on [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s critically acclaimed 1972 film ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (which was itself preceded by a [[Solaris (1968 film)|1968 Soviet TV film]]), Soderbergh promised to be closer in spirit to Lem's novel.<ref>{{cite web | last=Levy | first=Glen | title=Top 10 Hollywood Remakes: Solaris (2002) / Solyaris (1972) | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2010/10/01/top-10-hollywood-remakes/slide/solaris-2002-solyaris-1972/ | work=Time | date=September 29, 2010 | access-date=November 2, 2013 | quote=Indeed, he\u2019s said that he didn\u2019t intend ''Solaris'' to be a remake of Tarkovsky\u2019s film but rather a new version of Stanislaw Lem\u2019s novel.}}</ref> Still, Lem disliked both renderings.<ref name=\"LEM-20021208\" />\n\nThe film is set almost entirely on a [[space station]] orbiting the planet Solaris, adding flashbacks to the previous experiences of its main characters on Earth. The protagonist, Dr. Chris Kelvin, struggles with the questions of Solaris's motivation, his beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance.\n\nDespite positive reviews from critics, the film grossed only $30 million worldwide on the budget of $47 million.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Clinical psychologist]] Dr. Chris Kelvin is approached by emissaries for DBA, a corporation operating a [[space station]] orbiting the planet Solaris, who relay a message sent from his scientist friend Dr. Gibarian. Gibarian requests that Kelvin come to the station to help understand an unusual phenomenon but is unwilling to explain more. DBA is unsure how to proceed, as the mission to study Solaris has been sidetracked and none of the astronauts want to return home. In addition, DBA has lost contact with the security patrol recently dispatched to the station. Kelvin agrees to a solo mission to Solaris as a last attempt to bring the crew home safely.\n\nUpon arriving at Solaris Station, Kelvin learns that Gibarian has committed suicide and most of the crew have either died or disappeared under bizarre circumstances. Both surviving crew members, Snow and Dr. Gordon, are reluctant to explain the situation at hand. The situation is further complicated when Kelvin sees a young boy running through the station. Once alone in his quarters, Kelvin dreams about his long dead wife Rheya, reliving when they first met and some of their most romantic and intimate moments. He awakens shocked and terrified to encounter Rheya, apparently alive again beside him in bed. Kelvin leads this \"Rheya\" into an escape pod and jettisons the pod into space. Afterward, he confides his actions to Snow and comes to understand that replicas of the crew's loved ones have been mysteriously appearing (the little boy he saw earlier is apparently a replica of Gibarian's son). Rheya manifests a second time, but this time Kelvin lets her stay. Gradually, this version of Rheya comes to realize that she does not feel human; her memories feel artificial, in that she lacks the emotional attachment that comes with actually having lived them.\n\nThrough numerous flashbacks, Kelvin and Rheya's meeting and courtship are explored, with hints as to her disturbed upbringing and emotional difficulties. It is also gradually revealed through these flashbacks that Rheya once terminated a pregnancy but did not tell Kelvin about it. When he discovered her choice, Kelvin was so distraught that he walked out on her. Rheya then committed suicide and was later found by Kelvin when he returned to her.\n\nKelvin, the replica of Rheya, Snow and Gordon meet to discuss the situation. In frustration at Kelvin's apparent attachment to the virtual Rheya, Gordon blurts out what Kelvin did to the previous Rheya replica. An appalled Rheya abandons the meeting. Kelvin confronts Gordon, who in turn chastises him for getting emotionally involved with something that is not really human and may eventually pose a threat to human beings on the station as well as on Earth. Later, apparently during a dream, Kelvin has a vision of Gibarian, and asks him what Solaris wants. Gibarian balks at the idea of knowing an alien entity's motivations, or even that it might have motivations, and tells Kelvin simply that \"there are no answers, only choices\". Kelvin wakes to find that Rheya has killed herself. Soon afterward, she self-resurrects, and it is revealed that other manifestations who have \"died\" had done the same.\n\nGordon develops an apparatus which can permanently destroy a replica but Kelvin objects to using it on Rheya. Driven by his own grief and guilt over the \"real\" Rheya's death on Earth, he begins ingesting a chemical stimulant to stay awake in order to monitor Rheya, trying to avoid repeating the past and essentially abandoning her to suicide. Kelvin eventually falls asleep and Rheya successfully petitions Gordon to destroy her with the apparatus as she has done for her own replica(s). Traumatized, Kelvin confronts Dr. Gordon who maintains she merely facilitated an [[assisted suicide]] and only strives for the preservation of the humans on the station.\n\nKelvin and Gordon then discover a dead body stashed away in a ceiling vent in the station's cold room \u2013 Snow. The Snow they have been interacting with is a replica. Confronted by Gordon and Kelvin, the Snow replica explains that upon being dreamed into existence, he was attacked by the real Snow and thus killed him in self-defense. He goes on to tell them that repeat usage of the apparatus has drained the ship's fuel cell reactor, making a return trip to Earth impossible. Furthermore, Solaris has begun to exponentially increase its mass, thereby gravitationally pulling the space station inexorably toward the planet. Gordon and Kelvin begin prepping a smaller space vehicle called ''Athena'' to escape.\n\nBack on Earth, Kelvin struggles to return to normal life, haunted by the idea that he \"remembered her wrong\"\u2014that is, Rheya as being invariably suicidal. When he accidentally cuts his finger in his kitchen, the wound immediately heals, and it is then that Kelvin realizes that he never returned to Earth. In a flashback, Kelvin gives up the idea of boarding the lifeboat, and Doctor Gordon leaves him behind. As the plummeting space station rattles itself to pieces around him, the replica of Gibarian's young son appears and offers his hand in assistance. In the kitchen, Rheya appears to Kelvin yet again. This time, however, she is tranquil, and assures Kelvin that they no longer have to think in terms like \"life\" and \"death,\" and that all they have ever done is forgiven.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Dr. Chris Kelvin\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Rheya\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Dr. Gordon\n* [[Jeremy Davies]] as Snow\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as Gibarian\n* [[John Cho]] as DBA Emissary #1\n\n==Production==\nFor a while, [[James Cameron]] was looking to remake ''Solaris''. His production company [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] spent close to five years securing the rights with both author [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]] and the Russian film studio [[Mosfilm]], which owns the [[Solaris (1972 film)|1972 Russian film]] by [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] based on the novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=7116&s=features|title=''Solaris'': Sci-fi with a Soderbergh Difference|date=February 27, 2003|publisher=Urban Cinefile|access-date=June 4, 2012}}</ref> However, because of his many commitments in the 90s, Cameron was unable to take on directing duties.\n\n{{blockquote|What I would've done would\u2019ve been more like ''[[The Abyss]]'', where visual set pieces might have gotten in the way of what is a clean line as a relationship film.
