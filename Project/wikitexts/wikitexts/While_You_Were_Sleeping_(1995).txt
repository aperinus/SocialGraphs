Sullivan and [[Fredric Lebow]]. It stars [[Sandra Bullock]] as Lucy, a [[Chicago Transit Authority]] [[token coin|token]] collector, and [[Bill Pullman]] as Jack, the brother of a man whose life she saves, along with [[Peter Gallagher]] as Peter, the man who is saved, [[Peter Boyle]] and [[Glynis Johns]] as members of Peter's family, and [[Jack Warden]] as a longtime family friend and neighbor.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $182 million at the box office. Bullock and Pullman received praise for their performances. Bullock also garnered a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\nLucy Eleanor Moderatz is a lonely [[token coin|fare token]] collector for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]], stationed at the [[Randolph/Wabash station]]. She secretly loves Peter Callaghan, a handsome commuter, though they are strangers. On [[Christmas]] Day, she rescues Peter from the oncoming [[Chicago \"L\"]] train after muggers push him onto the tracks. She accompanies the comatose Peter to the hospital, where a nurse overhears her musing aloud, \"I was going to marry him.\" Misinterpreting, the nurse tells his family that she is his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nLucy becomes too caught up in the crisis to explain the truth. She remains silent for several reasons: she is embarrassed, Peter's grandmother, Elsie, has a heart condition, and Lucy falls in love with Peter's big, loving family. While visiting Peter, she confesses her predicament to him, unaware Peter's godfather Saul overhears the truth and later confronts her. He says he will keep her secret because the accident has brought the family closer.\n\nWith no family and few friends, Lucy becomes so captivated with the quirky Callaghans and their unconditional love for her that she is unable to hurt them by revealing that Peter does not know her. She spends a belated Christmas with them, then meets Peter's \nyounger brother Jack, who is supposed to take over his father's furniture business, though he wants his own business. Jack is initially suspicious, but he falls in love with Lucy as they spend time together. She soon falls in love with him.\n\nAfter [[New Year's Eve]], Peter wakes up. He does not know Lucy, so it is assumed he has [[lacunar amnesia|amnesia]]. She and Peter spend more time together, and Saul persuades Peter to propose to her \"again\"; she accepts, though she is now in love with Jack. When Jack visits her the day before the wedding, she gives him a chance to change her mind, asking if he can give her a reason not to marry Peter. He replies that he cannot, leaving her disappointed.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, just as a priest begins the ceremony, Lucy finally confesses everything and tells the family she loves Jack rather than Peter. At this point, Peter's real fianc\u00e9e, Ashley Bartlett Bacon, arrives and demands the wedding be stopped. As the family argues, Lucy slips out unnoticed, unsure of her future.\n\nSome time later, while Lucy is at work, Jack places an engagement ring in the token tray of her booth. He enters her booth and with most of the Callaghan family watching, proposes to her. Jack and Lucy are married and then leave on a CTA train for their honeymoon. Lucy narrates that he fulfilled her dream of going to [[Florence|Florence, Italy]], and explains that, when Peter asked when she fell in love with Jack, she replied, \"It was while you were sleeping.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Lucy Eleanor Moderatz\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Jack Callaghan\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Peter Callaghan\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Ox Callaghan\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Saul Tuttle\n* [[Glynis Johns]] as Elsie\n* [[Micole Mercurio]] as Midge Callaghan\n* [[Jason Bernard]] as Jerry Wallace\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Joe Fusco, Jr.\n* [[Ally Walker]] as Ashley Bartlett Bacon\n* [[Monica Keena]] as Mary Callaghan\n\n== Production ==\nBoth [[Demi Moore]] and [[Julia Roberts]] were offered the role of Lucy Moderatz but turned it down.<ref>{{cite news |last=Howden |first=Martin |date=January 7, 2011 |title=Great roles actors have turned down |work=Yahoo Movies |url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blog/article/113577/great-roles-actors-have-turned-down.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718133746/http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blog/article/113577/great-roles-actors-have-turned-down.html |archive-date=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\nThough the original screenplay was entitled \u201cComa Guy\u201d, the title was changed shortly after the script was acquired by [[Caravan Pictures]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Spencer |first=Ashley |date=April 21, 2020 |title=While You Were Sleeping' turns 25: An oral history of the Sandra Bullock rom-com favorite |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/while-you-were-sleeping-sandra-bullock-oral-history/2020/04/20/13f37222-7e8b-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126050401/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/while-you-were-sleeping-sandra-bullock-oral-history/2020/04/20/13f37222-7e8b-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html |archive-date=2020-11-26}}</ref> The original script was also set in [[New York City]], but to accommodate for the film's budget, the filmmakers changed the setting to [[Chicago]] where they shot on location.<ref name=\":0\" /> Filming took place from October 8 to December 14, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |title=While You Were Sleeping - Miscellaneous Notes |url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18838/while-you-were-sleeping/#notes |access-date=2022-08-13 |website=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Database]]}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was a tremendous success, grossing a total of $182,057,016 worldwide against an estimated $17,000,000 budget.
