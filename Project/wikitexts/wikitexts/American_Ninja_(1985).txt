Directed by [[Sam Firstenberg]], who specialized in this genre in the 1980s, the film stars [[Michael Dudikoff]] in the title role and is the first installment in the ''American Ninja'' franchise, followed by ''[[American Ninja 2: The Confrontation]]'' (1987). It had a mixed reception, but it was a financial success, and since then, it has been considered a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs an alternative to prison, young American Joe Armstrong is conscripted into the [[U.S. Army]] by a judge. Joe ends up fighting off the Black Star Order of [[ninja]]s while stationed in the [[Philippines]]. He saves Patricia Hickock, daughter of Colonel William Hickock, Joe's commanding officer, from a kidnapping attempt. But because the rest of Joe's platoon is wiped out by the ninjas, Joe's popularity with his fellow GIs takes a nosedive, even as he is targeted for revenge by the Black Star Master Ninja.\n\nWhile performing chores on the base, Corporal Curtis Jackson goads Joe into a fight. Jackson proves no match for Joe's [[ninjitsu]] expertise, which greatly impresses him and their fellow soldiers. Shortly after that, Jackson discovers that Joe is an [[amnesiac]]; he remembers very little of his past, other than running with various street gangs and mastering several exotic martial arts. The grateful Patricia organizes a date for herself with Joe. Jackson and another soldier, Charley Madison, sneak Joe off the base. Still, he and Patricia are caught during dinner by Sergeant Rinaldo, who is in the middle of a meeting with [[black market]]er Victor Ortega, whose payroll the sergeant is on. To get Joe out of the way, Rinaldo leads him to an abandoned warehouse, ostensibly for dropping off supplies. There, Joe is ambushed by ninjas but defeats all of them. Then Joe's truck is stolen, and he gives chase using a motorcycle. The truck driver runs Joe off the road; thinking Joe dead, he brings the truck to Ortega.\n\nJoe, however, hides under the truck and is brought to the heart of Ortega's operation, which encompasses the Black Star Ninja training camp. Ortega is paying the Black Star Order for weapons stolen from the Army, which he then resells to the highest bidder. Joe is discovered but escapes with the aid of Ortega's servant Shinyuki. He returns to the base, where he is promptly arrested by [[military police]] under Rinaldo's false accusation that ''he'' is fencing the arms. Jackson realizes that Joe has been set up, but his protests are wasted on Rinaldo. Black Star Master infiltrates the fence that night, slaughters the on-duty MPs, and then tries to kill Joe, but is thwarted by the sudden arrival of MP reinforcements, none of whom see the Black Star Master fleeing the scene. One of the dead MPs is found with a throwing star lodged in his head, further implicating Joe.\n\nOnly Jackson, Charlie, and Patricia believe that Joe is innocent of the charges he now faces. They tell Hickock everything they know about the hijacking and murders, but he scoffs at their story. After briskly dismissing them, Colonel Hickock meets Rinaldo privately, revealing that he is also Ortega's accomplice. Hickock orders Rinaldo to finish off Joe, but then the Black Star Master kidnaps Patricia since her father is becoming a less-than-reliable partner. Rinaldo attempts to run Joe off the road, only to be killed himself.\n\nJoe returns to Ortega's mansion, where he is reunited with Shinyuki. It is revealed that Shinyuki, a former [[Japanese holdout|Japanese holdout soldier]], adopted Joe at birth after the boy's parents died. He trained Joe in the ways of ninjitsu until a bomb blast separated the two; each has believed the other to be dead for years. Now Shinyuki completes Joe's training, and they launch a surprise attack on the Black Star camp. Shinyuki sacrifices his life to help Joe defeat the Black Star Master; meanwhile, Hickock leads his assault on Ortega to rescue his daughter and wipe out any evidence that connects him to Ortega's weapon-jacking. Ortega flees by helicopter with Patricia as his hostage after gunning down her father. Joe, however, boards Ortega's chopper; he and Patricia jump to safety just before Jackson shoots down the helicopter, killing Ortega.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Dudikoff]] as Private Joe Armstrong\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Corporal Curtis Jackson\n* [[Judie Aronson]] as Patricia Hickock\n* Guich Koock as Colonel William T.
