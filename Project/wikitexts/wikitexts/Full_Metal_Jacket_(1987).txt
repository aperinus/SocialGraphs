[[Drill instructor]] Gunnery Sergeant Hartman uses harsh methods to turn the recruits into combat-ready Marines. Among the recruits is the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, whom Hartman nicknames \"[[Gomer Pyle]]\", and the wisecracking J.T. Davis, who receives the name \"Joker\" after interrupting Hartman's introductory speech with an impression of [[John Wayne]].\n\nDuring basic training, Hartman names Joker as squad leader and puts him in charge of helping Pyle improve. One day, Hartman discovers a [[jelly doughnut]] in Pyle's [[Footlocker (luggage)|footlocker]], blames the platoon for Pyle's infractions, and adopts a [[collective punishment]] policy in which any infraction committed by Pyle will earn a punishment for everyone else in the platoon. One night, the recruits [[Hazing|haze]] Pyle with a [[blanket party]], in which Joker reluctantly participates. Following this, Pyle appears to reinvent himself as a model recruit, showing particular expertise in marksmanship. This pleases Hartman but worries Joker, who believes Pyle may be suffering a [[mental breakdown]] after seeing Pyle talking to his rifle. After the recruits graduate and the night before they leave Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom, loading [[M14 Rifle|his service rifle]] with live ammunition, executing drill commands, and loudly reciting the [[Rifleman's Creed]]. Hartman attempts to intervene, but Pyle shoots and kills him and then commits suicide.\n\nBy January 1968, Joker is a [[sergeant]] and is based in [[Da Nang]] for the newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' alongside his colleague [[Private First Class]] Rafterman, a combat photographer. The [[Tet Offensive]] begins and Joker's base is attacked, but holds. The following morning, Joker and Rafterman are sent to [[Phu Bai International Airport|Phu Bai]] where Joker searches for and reunites with Sergeant \"Cowboy\", a friend he met at Parris Island. During the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]], a [[booby trap]] kills the squad leader, leaving Cowboy in command. Becoming lost in the city, the squad is ambushed by a [[Viet Cong]] sniper who kills two members. As the squad moves in on the sniper's location, Cowboy is killed.\n\nAssuming command, squad machine gunner \"Animal Mother\" leads an attack on the sniper. Joker locates her first, but his [[M16 rifle|M-16]] rifle jams, alerting the sniper to his presence. As the sniper opens fire, she is revealed to be a teenage girl. Rafterman shoots her, wounding her mortally. The squad discusses what to do while standing over her as she lies in pain, begging them to finish her off, and Joker [[coup de gr\u00e2ce|does so]] after Animal Mother states that they will leave her if he does not. Later, as night falls, the Marines return to camp singing the \"[[Mickey Mouse March]]\". A narration of Joker's thoughts conveys that, despite being \"in a world of shit\", he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Private/Sergeant J.&nbsp;T. \"Joker\" Davis, a wise-cracking young Marine.

Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"it's as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale\".<ref name=\"Kempley\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] saw in the film an attempt to tell a story of individual characters and the war's effects on them.

Corliss appreciated \"the Olympian elegance and precision of Kubrick's filmmaking\".<ref name=\"RevTime\" /> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Ian Nathan awarded the film three stars out of five, saying it is \"inconsistent\" and describing it as \"both powerful and frustratingly unengaged\". Nathan said after the opening act, which focuses on the recruit training, the film becomes \"bereft of purpose\"; nevertheless, he summarized his review by calling it a \"hardy Kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings\" and praised Ermey's \"staggering performance\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric\". Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him \"the film's stunning surprise&nbsp;... he's so good\u2014so obsessed\u2014that you might think he wrote his own lines\".{{efn|As noted above, much of Ermey's dialogue in the film was indeed based on his own improvisations.}} Canby said D'Onofrio's performance should be admired and described Modine as \"one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation\", and concluded ''Full Metal Jacket'' is \"a film of immense and very rare imagination\".<ref name=\"RevNewYorkTimes\" />\n\nJim Hall, writing for [[Film4]] in 2010, awarded the film five stars out of five and added to the praise for Ermey, saying his \"performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him\". The review preferred the opening training segment to the later Vietnam sequence, calling it \"far more striking than the second and longer section\". Hall commented the film ends abruptly but felt \"it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director's vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence\". Hall concluded; \"''Full Metal Jacket'' ranks with ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' as one of Kubrick's very best\".<ref name=\"RevFilm4\" /> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it \"Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes&nbsp;... and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since ''Dr. Strangelove'', as well as the most horrific\".<ref name=\"RevChicagoReader\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film an \"intense, schematic, superbly made\" drama that is \"loaded with vivid, outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the film's power\" but said it never develops \"a particularly strong narrative\". The cast performances were all labeled \"exceptional\"; Modine was singled out as \"embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience\".<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> [[Gilbert Adair]], writing for ''Full Metal Jacket'', commented; \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature.

Ebert called it \"one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage\" but said this was not enough to compete with the \"awesome reality of ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''\". Ebert criticized the film's Vietnam-set second act, saying the \"movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying\" and concluded the film's message is \"too little and too late\", having been done by other Vietnam War films. Ebert praised Ermey and D'Onofrio, saying \"these are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Ebert's review angered [[Gene Siskel]] on their television show ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At The Movies]]''; he criticized Ebert for liking ''[[Benji the Hunted]]''  more than ''Full Metal Jacket''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.

This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories that are connected by the same characters. Jenkins said this structure is a development of concepts Kubrick originally discussed in the 1960s, when he talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=128}}\n\nSergeant Hartman, who is renamed from the book's Gerheim, has an expanded role in the film. Private Pyle's incompetence is presented as weighing negatively on the rest of the platoon; unlike those in the novel, he is the only under-performing recruit.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=123}} The film omits Hartman's disclosure he thinks Pyle might be mentally unstable\u2014a \"[[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]]\"\u2014to the other troops; instead, Joker questions Pyle's mental state. In contrast, Hartman praises Pyle, saying he is \"born again hard\". Jenkins says that portraying Hartman as having a warmer social relationship with the troops would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as a force of nature who embodies a killer culture.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=124}}\n\nSome scenes in the book were removed from the screenplay or conflated with others. For example, Cowboy's introduction of the \"Lusthog Squad\" was markedly shortened and supplemented with material from other sections of the book. Although the book's third section was largely omitted, elements from it were inserted into other parts of the film.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=146}} For instance, the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two sections of Parts II and III of the book. According to Jenkins, the film presents this passage more dramatically but in less gruesome detail than the novel.\n\nThe film often has a more tragic tone than the book, which relies on callous humor. In the film, Joker remains a model of humane thinking, as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper scene and elsewhere. Joker works to overcome his own meekness rather than compete with other Marines. The film omits Joker's eventual domination over Animal Mother shown in the book.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=147}}\n\nThe film also omits Rafterman's death; according to Jenkins, this allows viewers to reflect on Rafterman's personal growth and speculate on his future growth after the war.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=146}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe line \"Me so horny. Me love you long time\", which is uttered by the Da Nang street prostitute to Joker, became a catchphrase in popular culture<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vineyard |first1=Jennifer |title=Mariah Carey, Fergie Promise To 'Love You Long Time' \u2013 But Is The Phrase Empowering Or Insensitive?
