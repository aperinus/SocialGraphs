Noting his unpreparedness, his driver gives him [[gumboots]].\n\nMcCandless sets up camp in an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned city bus]] that he calls \"The Magic Bus\". He is content with the isolation, the beauty of nature, and the thrill of living off the land. He hunts with a .22 caliber rifle, reads books, and keeps a journal as he prepares his new life in the wild.\n\n===Flashback===\nIn May 1990, McCandless graduates with high honors from [[Emory University]]. He is disenchanted with modern society after discovering that his parents lied to him, and he and his sister Carine were born out of wedlock.\n\nMcCandless destroys his credit cards and identification, donates his savings to [[Oxfam]] and sets out on a cross-country drive in his [[Nissan Sunny#B210 (1973\u20131977)|Datsun 210]] to experience life in the wilderness. He does not tell his parents nor Carine what he is doing or where he is going and does not contact them after his departure. This causes his parents to become increasingly anxious.\n\nAt [[Lake Mead]], McCandless's car is caught in a flash flood; he abandons it and begins [[hitchhiking]]. Burning what remains of his cash, he assumes the name Alexander Supertramp. In [[Northern California]], McCandless encounters [[hippie]] couple Jan and Rainey. Rainey tells him his relationship with Jan is failing, which McCandless helps rekindle.\n\nIn September, McCandless arrives in [[Carthage, South Dakota]], and works for a contract harvesting company owned by Wayne Westerberg. He leaves after Westerberg is arrested for [[satellite piracy]].\n\nMcCandless kayaks down the [[Colorado River]] and, though told by park rangers he may not do so without a license, ignores their warnings and goes downriver to Mexico. His kayak is lost in a dust storm, and he crosses back into the United States on foot. Unable to hitch a ride, he jumps on freight trains to [[Los Angeles]]. Not long after arriving, however, he starts feeling \"corrupted\" by modern civilization and leaves. He is forced to resume hitchhiking when [[Railroad police#United States|railroad police]] catch and beat him.\n\nIn December 1991, McCandless arrives at [[Slab City, California|Slab City]], in the [[Imperial Valley]], and encounters Jan and Rainey again. He also meets Tracy Tatro, a teenage girl who shows interest in him, but he turns her down because she is a minor. After the holidays, McCandless continues heading for Alaska.\n\nOne month later, camping near [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], McCandless meets Ron Franz, a retired widower who lost his family in a car accident while he was serving in the [[United States Army]]. He leads a lonely life in a workshop as a leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt detailing his travels.\n\nAfter two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska. Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with an offer to adopt him as his grandchild. McCandless tells him they should discuss it after he returns from Alaska.\n\n===Flashforward===\nFour months later, at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he makes several poor decisions. Trying to live off the land, he hunts down a large [[moose]] with his rifle, but cannot [[Meat preservation|preserve the meat]] and it spoils within days. As his supplies dwindle, he realizes that nature can be harsh.\n\nMcCandless concludes that true happiness can be found only when shared with others, and he seeks to return from the wild to his friends and family. However, he finds that the [[Teklanika River|stream]] he crossed during the winter has become wide, deep, and violent due to the thaw, and he is unable to cross. Defeated, he returns to the bus.\n\nIn a desperate act, McCandless gathers and eats roots and plants. He confuses similar plants and eats a [[Poisonous plant|poisonous one]]. Slowly dying, he continues to document his process of self-realization, and imagines what it might have been like if he had returned to his family. He writes a farewell note to the world and crawls into his sleeping bag to die.\n\nA post-script states that two weeks later, moose [[hunters]] found his body, and that shortly afterwards, Carine brought her brother's ashes back to Virginia in her backpack.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 0632.JPG|thumb|320px|[[Salvation Mountain]] where Chris and Tracy took a walk.]] -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Chris McCandless]] a.k.a.
