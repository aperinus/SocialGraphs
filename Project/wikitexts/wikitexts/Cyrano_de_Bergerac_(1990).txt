It stars [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Anne Brochet]] and [[Vincent Perez]]. The film was a [[co-production (media)|co-production]] between companies in France and Hungary.\n\nThe film is the first [[feature film]] version of Rostand's original play in colour, and the second theatrical film version of the play in the original French. It is also considerably more lavish and more faithful to the original than [[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|previous film versions]] of the play. The film had 4,732,136 admissions in France.<ref>{{cite web|author=JP |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=5268&affich=france |title=Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) |publisher=JPBox-Office |date=28 March 1990}}</ref>\n\nThe film and the performance of G\u00e9rard Depardieu won numerous awards, notably 10 of the [[C\u00e9sar Awards]] of 1991.\n\nSubtitles are used for the non-French market; the English-language version uses [[Anthony Burgess]]'s translation of the text, which uses five-beat lines with a varying number of syllables and a regular [[couplet]] rhyming scheme, in other words, a [[sprung rhythm]]. Although he sustains the five-beat rhythm through most of the play, Burgess sometimes allows this structure to break deliberately: in Act V, he allows it to collapse completely, creating [[free verse]].\n\nIn 2010, ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' was ranked number 43 in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\".<ref>{{cite web | title = The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema \u2013 43. Cyrano de Bergerac | url = http://www.empireonline.com/features/100-greatest-world-cinema-films/default.asp?film=43 | work = Empire }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gascony|Gascon]] poet and swashbuckler [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] is self-conscious about his enormous nose, but pretends to be proud of it. He is admired and respected by many people for his bravery and good swordsmanship. He madly loves his cousin, the beautiful Roxane; however, he is sure that she will reject him because of his appearance. To elevate himself in her eyes, he interferes with a play being staged at the H\u00f4tel du Bourgogne, in Paris, and wins a duel with a marquis.\n\nIn the second act of the play and film, Cyrano meets with Roxane at her request. He is crushed when Roxane tells him she is infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a handsome and dashing new recruit to the [[Cadets de Gascogne]] (the military unit in which Cyrano is serving). However, Cyrano learns that Christian is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love to Roxane, Cyrano approaches Christian with a proposal: Cyrano will write the love letters, and Christian will woo Roxane with them. Christian agrees.\n\nCyrano aids Christian, writing heartfelt love letters and poems. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him. But the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant and exceptionally powerful older nobleman, also has designs on Roxane. Roxane and Cyrano thwart De Guiche's attempt to visit Roxane by arranging a quick [[secret marriage]] between Roxane and Christian. In revenge, De Guiche orders his company of cadets\u2014including Cyrano and Christian\u2014to report immediately for military duty in the [[Siege of Arras (1640)|Siege of Arras]] against the [[Spain|Spanish]].\n\nThe siege is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Christian does not know that Cyrano escapes over enemy lines twice each day to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane. These letters draw Roxane out from the city of Paris to the war front. Although she has come to visit Christian, she admits to him that she has fallen in love with the author's soul, and would love the author even if he were ugly. Christian tries to find out whether Roxane loves him or Cyrano, and asks Cyrano to find out. However, during the subsequent battle, Christian is mortally wounded. The scene ends with the French returning to the battle.\n\nIn the final scene of the play and film, fourteen years later, Roxane has entered a convent and retired from the world. Cyrano has made many enemies with his writings; he is still free, but now poor. During this time, Cyrano has faithfully visited Roxane every week, never declaring his love. On this day, his enemies attack and mortally injure him. Cyrano nevertheless visits Roxane at the convent. When she mentions Christian's last letter, sensing his own mortality, Cyrano asks if he can read it. Roxane gives him the letter, which he reads movingly. Just before Cyrano dies, Roxane realizes that she has loved him all along.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Cyrano de Bergerac]]\n* [[Anne Brochet]] as Roxane\n* [[Vincent Perez]] as Christian de Neuvillette\n* [[Jacques Weber]] as Comte Antoine de Guiche\n* [[Roland Bertin]] as Ragueneau\n* [[Philippe Morier-Genoud]] as Le Bret\n* [[Pierre Maguelon]] as Carbon de Castle-Jaloux\n* [[Sandrine Kiberlain]] as Sister Colette\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Josiane Stol\u00e9ru]] as the Duenna\n* [[Philippe Volter]] as Vicomte de Valvert\n* [[Jean-Marie Winling]] as Ligni\u00e8re\n* Louis Navarre as The Bore\n* Gabriel Monnet as Montfleury\n* Fran\u00e7ois Mari\u00e9 as Bellerose\n* Anatole Delalande as The child\n* Alain Rimoux as The father\n* [[Michel Fau]] as Ragueneau's Poet\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on {{nowrap|30 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 7.9/10.

In his review on the film, Ebert wrote, \"''Cyrano de Bergerac'' is a splendid movie not just because it tells its romantic story, and makes it visually delightful, and centers it on Depardieu, but for a better reason: The movie acts as if it believes this story. Depardieu is not a satirist - not here, anyway.
