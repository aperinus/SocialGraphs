It received mixed reviews; critics praised the performances of Duvall and Downey as well as Thomas Newman's score while criticizing the formulaic nature of its script and the lack of development for its supporting characters.\n\nDuvall received multiple award nominations for his performance as Judge Joseph Palmer, including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]] and [[Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Satellite Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. [[Thomas Newman]] also received a [[Satellite Award]] nomination for [[Satellite Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nHank Palmer is a successful [[Lawyer|attorney]] in Chicago. When Hank receives news his mother has just died, the judge grants his case a [[continuance]]. Before returning to his hometown of Carlinville, Indiana to attend the funeral, Hank argues with his neglected, unfaithful wife, Lisa, whom he is divorcing.\n\nIn Carlinville, Hank reunites with his older brother, Glen, a tire shop owner, and his mentally disabled younger brother Dale. Hank's estranged father is [[Judge]] Joseph Palmer of Carlinville's [[Criminal law|criminal court]], who he merely calls \"Judge.\" The two have been estranged due to the Judge's harsh treatment of his son in light of his youthful indiscretions, including a car accident when Hank was seventeen that had ruined Glen's future MLB career and resulted in his father sending Hank to juvenile detention rather than the recommended community service or otherwise helping his son.\n\nFrom the courtroom gallery, Hank discreetly watches his father presiding a case. During the proceedings, the Judge seems momentarily confused when he is unable to recall his long-time [[bailiff]]'s name. The morning after the funeral, Hank notices the Judge's [[Cadillac]] has the right-front headlight and fender damaged and accuses his father, a recovered alcoholic, of driving intoxicated. The Judge reacts defensively, having no memory of an accident. Hank's strained family relationship is further complicated by his former girlfriend, Sam Powell. He comes to believe her college-student daughter Carla, that he had earlier flirted with, may be his daughter. Sam reveals Glen is Carla's father, having briefly slept with him after breaking up with Hank.\n\nThe next day, after arguing with his father, Hank vows never to return to Carlinville and leaves for the airport. Just before Hank's [[airliner|flight]] takes off, Glen calls to say their father is a suspect in a fatal [[hit and run accident]]. The victim, Mark Blackwell, is a recently released [[ex-convict]] whom Judge had [[sentencing|sentenced]] to twenty years in prison for a murder that he had committed after the Judge had earlier given Blackwell a light sentence for shooting up the victim's house.\n\nJudge is [[indicted]] after police [[forensic]]s confirm Blackwell's blood is on the Judge's Cadillac. He is charged with [[second-degree murder]]. C.P. Kennedy is hired as the Judge's defense attorney. When his defense proves ineffective, Hank takes over as lead counsel. While preparing for trial, Hank learns his father is undergoing [[chemotherapy]] for terminal cancer. The Judge's inability to remember the accident or previously recall his bailiff's name may be a side effect of chemotherapy. During this time, Hank's daughter, Lauren, arrives for a short visit, meeting her grandfather for the first time and bonding with him.\n\nAt the trial, Judge, honor-bound to his [[ethical responsibility]], insists on testifying. He [[scuttling|scuttles]] his own defense by testifying he is unable to remember the accident, but believes he may have intentionally killed Blackwell. Hank pushes the Judge until he reveals that he had previously given Blackwell a lighter sentence, the biggest mistake of his career, because Blackwell's circumstances had reminded the Judge of Hank and he'd seen the troubled son that the Judge had refused to help in the young man. Judge is convicted on a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in the [[Indiana State Prison]].\n\nSeven months later, Hank returns to Carlinville. Judge has been granted a [[compassionate release]], allowing him to die at home. Fishing on a lake, Hank and Judge appear to have buried their mutual animosity. After praising Hank as a lawyer, the Judge suddenly and peacefully dies on the boat. The courthouse flag flies at [[half-mast|half-staff]] to honor Judge. Hank visits the courthouse and spins his father's chair; it stops, facing him, indicating he is the next Judge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Henry \"Hank\" Palmer, the Chicago lawyer/New Judge\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Judge Joseph Palmer, the judge, Hank's father\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Powell, Hank's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Glen Palmer, Hank's older brother\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Dale Palmer, Hank's mentally challenged younger brother\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Dwight Dickham, the Prosecutor\n* [[Sarah Lancaster]] as Lisa Palmer, Hank's wife\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Mike Kattan\n* [[Emma Tremblay]] as Lauren Palmer, Hank's daughter\n* [[Ken Howard]] as Judge Sanford Warren\n* [[Leighton Meester]] as Carla Powell, Samantha's daughter\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Attorney C.P.
