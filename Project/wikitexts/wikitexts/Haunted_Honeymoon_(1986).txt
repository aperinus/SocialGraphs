Wilder also served as writer and director. The title ''Haunted Honeymoon'' was previously used for the 1940 U.S. release of ''[[Busman's Honeymoon (film)|Busman's Honeymoon]]'' based on the stage play by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]].\n\nWilder and Radner play Larry Abbot and Vickie Pearle, two radio murder mystery actors who decide to get married. Larry, plagued with on-air panic attacks, is treated with a form of shock therapy and subsequently chooses to marry Vickie in a castle-like mansion which had been his childhood home. Once there, they meet the eccentric members of Larry's family, including his great-aunt Kate (DeLuise) and his cousin Charles (Pryce).\n\n''Honeymoon'' was distributed by [[Orion Pictures]] through a deal with [[HBO]]. The movie flopped  by grossing just short of its $9 million budget whilst it was panned by the critics. The movie earned DeLuise the [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress|Worst Supporting Actress]]. The movie represents the last feature film appearance for Radner (prior to her diagnosis and death from [[ovarian cancer]]) and the last directorial role for Wilder.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=October 2015}}\nLarry Abbot (Wilder) and Vickie Pearle (Radner) are performers on radio's \"Manhattan Mystery Theater\" who decide to get married. Larry has been plagued with on-air panic attacks and speech impediments since proposing marriage. Vickie thinks it is just pre-wedding jitters, but his affliction could get them both fired.\n\nLarry's uncle, Dr. Paul Abbot, decides that Larry needs to be cured. Paul decides to treat him with a form of shock therapy to \"scare him to death\" in much the same way someone might try to startle someone out of hiccups.\n\nLarry chooses a castle-like mansion in which he grew up as the site for their wedding. Vickie gets to meet Larry's eccentric family: great-aunt Kate (DeLuise in drag), who plans to leave all her money to Larry; his uncle, Francis; and Larry's cousins, Charles, Nora, Susan, and the cross-dressing Francis Jr. Also present are the butler Pfister and wife Rachel, the maid; Larry's old girlfriend Sylvia, who is now dating Charles; and Susan's magician husband, Montego the Magnificent.\n\nPaul begins his \"treatment\" of Larry and lets others in on the plan. Unfortunately for all, something more sinister and unexpected is lurking at the Abbot Estates mansion. The pre-wedding party becomes a real-life version of Larry and Vickie's radio murder mysteries, werewolves and all.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gene Wilder]] as Larry Abbot\n*[[Gilda Radner]] as Vickie Pearle<ref>{{cite news|title= Yearns For Motherhood : Gilda Radner In Life-career Squeeze|work=Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-23/entertainment/ca-21800_1_gilda-radner|access-date=2012-07-09}}</ref>\n*[[Dom DeLuise]] as Aunt Katherine \"Kate\" Abbot\n*[[Jonathan Pryce]] as Charles \"Charlie\" Abbot\n*[[Eve Ferret]] as Sylvia\n*[[Bryan Pringle]] as Pfister, the Butler\n*[[Peter Vaughan]] as Uncle Francis Abbot Sr.\n*[[Paul L.

He wanted to make a \"comedy chiller\" inspired by such films as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1939), ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Black Cat (1941 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1941), and radio shows like ''[[Inner Sanctum Mystery|The Inner Sanctum]]''. \"Since I was 6 years old I have been scared of horror movies\", said Wilder \"And the movies that I liked the best \u2013 even though I was scared by them \u2013 were what was called then 'comedy-chillers.' They were horror movies yet they had comedy, or they were comedies and yet they had horror. They were not comedy-mysteries, they were not comedy-thrillers, they were comedy-chillers.\" Wilder says when he started writing the film \"I knew I wanted it to be a comedy-chiller\", but he struggled and the film wound up as an \"autobiographical psycho/sexual comedy with music.\"<ref name=\"gene\"/>\n\nWilder and Radner fell in love while making ''[[Hanky Panky (1982 film)|Hanky Panky]]'' (1982) and he decided to revisit the project as a vehicle for them both. \"I always thought that Gilda has been one of our most brilliant television comediennes, but now I think she's becoming more than very good as a comic movie actress, which is a very, very different thing\", said Wilder.<ref name=\"gene\"/>\n\nWilder rewrote the script with writing partner, Terry Marsh. \"I knew that I wanted it to be not a parody and not a satire, but to re-create a comedy-chiller\", said Wilder.<ref name=\"gene\"/> \"I don't like naturalism. I like things that are fantastical \u2013 I'm not saying necessarily fantasies, but more than reality.\"<ref name=\"wilder\"/>\n\nWilder says the film was partly inspired by a song [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and [[Jack Buchanan]] sang in the film ''[[Monte Carlo (1930 film)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1930). Wilder says he heard it while watching the film in bed with Radner. \"I'm always looking for some emotional spine to what I'm doing. I look over at her [Radner] and tears are coming down from her eyes. It was so sweet and innocent. Like little children. And I thought that's what this ('Haunted Honeymoon') is about.\"<ref name=\"wilder\">{{cite news|title=FOR GILDA RADNER AND GENE WILDER, ANOTHER HONEYMOON|edition=FIFTH|author=WILLISTEIN, PAUL|work=Morning Call|date=25 July 1986|page=D01}}</ref>\n\n\"I couldn't imagine him singing it with any other girl\", said Radner. \"So, I just had a tantrum and said I had to be the fiancee \u2013 not a big tantrum, just a tiny tantrum.\"<ref name=\"wilder\"/>\n\nHe says he was also inspired by seeing [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in the early 1980s. \"The world opened up for me\", he said. \"I'm more comfortable when I don't have to be held down by authenticity. In this film, which is set in the \u201930s, I feel that I'm presenting authenticity of the heart. I'm not interested in everyday reality, but in the reality of the heart. I like fantasy, like a fairy tale. I'm interested in shadows and contrasts. It's like the opening scene in the movie, when a character says, `It's not what you think.' Well, it's probably what you think. But it's too complicated.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=GILDA RADNER SHE'S WILDER, \u2013 BUT TAMER THE ZANY COMEDIAN SEEMS TO HAVE MELLOWED SINCE HER MARRIAGE TO ACTOR GENE WILDER|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=Aug 23, 1986|page=1D}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was one of 14 films financed by Orion Pictures through a deal with HBO.<ref>{{cite news|title=Time Unit Extends Pact With Orion For Movie Rights|author=LAURA LANDRO|work=Wall Street Journal|date=Feb 26, 1985|page=45}}</ref>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe film was shot in London at Elstree Studios in 1985 over 11 weeks.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sneed, Lavin & O'Malley INC.|title=Not exactly like a virgin...|work=Chicago Tribune|date=9 July 1985|page=16}}</ref> \"Gene calls it a 'comedy chiller'\", said Gilda Radner. \"For me, this is a part very similar to my own life.

Producer Susan Ruskin said:  \n{{Blockquote|I know people have the tendency to think, 'Well, the studio must not be comfortable about the film.' They're very comfortable about the film, they've been behind it 100 percent. A lot of the studios, with a lot of their films, are considering not doing advance critics' screenings.
