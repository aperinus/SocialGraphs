Pakula]], adapted from [[William Styron]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]''. The film stars [[Meryl Streep]] as Zofia \"Sophie\" Zawistowski, a [[Polish Americans|Polish immigrant]] to America with a dark secret from her past who shares a boarding house in Brooklyn with her tempestuous lover Nathan ([[Kevin Kline]] in his first feature film), and young writer Stingo ([[Peter MacNicol]]). It also features [[Rita Karin]], [[Stephen D. Newman]] and [[Josh Mostel]].\n\n''Sophie's Choice'' premiered in Los Angeles on December 8, 1982, and was theatrically released on December 10 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $30 million.\n\nStreep's titular performance was almost unanimously praised. The film received five nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], with Streep winning the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1947, Stingo moves to [[Brooklyn]] to write a novel and is befriended by Sophie Zawistowska, a Polish immigrant, and her emotionally unstable lover, Nathan Landau. Nathan is constantly jealous and, when he is in one of his violent mood swings, he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him, and he abuses and harasses her. A flashback shows how Nathan first met Sophie after her immigration to the U.S. when she nearly died due to [[anemia]].\n\nSophie tells Stingo before she came to the U.S., her husband and father were killed in a [[Arbeitslager|German work camp]], and she was interned in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Stingo later learns from a college professor Sophie's father was a Nazi sympathizer. When Stingo confronts Sophie with this, she admits the truth. She explains that she left her husband who was an assistant to her father, for her war-time lover, J\u00f3zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, and was a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen [[Gestapo]] documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her two children Jan and Eva. Two weeks later, J\u00f3zef was murdered by the Gestapo and Sophie was arrested and sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] with the children. After arrival, Sophie was assigned as [[Rudolph H\u00f6ss]]' secretary due to her language and office skills.\n\nNathan tells Sophie and Stingo he is doing groundbreaking research at a pharmaceutical company, but Nathan's physician brother tells Stingo that Nathan has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and all of the schools Nathan claimed to attend were actually expensive \"[[Psychiatric hospital|funny farms]]\". Nathan is not a biologist as he claims. He does have a job at a pharmaceutical firm, which his brother obtained for him, but it is in the library, and he only occasionally assists with research.\n\nAfter Nathan believes Sophie has betrayed him again, he calls Sophie and Stingo on the telephone and fires a gun in a violent rage. Sophie and Stingo flee to a hotel, and Stingo plans for a future for the two of them. She agrees to be with him but not to marry because she considers herself an unfit mother. Upon arrival at Auschwitz, she had been forced to choose which one of her children would be murdered in the [[gas chamber]]. To avoid having both children killed, she chose Eva.\n\nSophie and Stingo make love. Then while Stingo is sleeping, Sophie leaves a note and returns to Nathan. Sophie and Nathan commit suicide by taking [[cyanide]]. Stingo recites the poem \"Ample Make This Bed\" from a book by [[Emily Dickinson]], the American poet Sophie was fond of reading, that she left on her bed.\n\nStingo moves to a small farm his father recently inherited in southern Virginia to finish writing his novel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Zofia \"Sophie\" Zawistowski\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Nathan Landau\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Stingo\n* [[Rita Karin]] as Yetta Zimmerman\n* [[Stephen D.
