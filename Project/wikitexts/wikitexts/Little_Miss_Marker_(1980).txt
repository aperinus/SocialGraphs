Carter gives his six-year-old daughter to Sorrowful's gangster-run gambling operation as a \"marker\" (collateral) for a bet. When Carter loses his bet and commits suicide, the gangsters are left with the girl on their hands. Sorrowful's nervous assistant Regret is concerned about the legality of the arrangement, which might violate kidnapping statutes.\n\nIn the interim, a crime boss named Blackie coerces his longtime rival Sorrowful into financing a new gambling joint. It is opened in the stately home of Blackie's girlfriend, the widowed Amanda Worthington, who needs money to repurchase her family property. Amanda is also counting on her racehorse Sir Galahad to ride to her rescue. While the girl's personal needs inconvenience Sorrowful, a father-daughter relationship develops and they become inseparable.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Sorrowful Jones\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Amanda Worthington\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Blackie\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as Regret\n* Sara Stimson as the Kid\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Herbie\n* [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]] as Brannigan\n* [[Nedra Volz]] as Mrs. Clancy\n* [[Lee Grant]] as the Judge\n* [[Andrew Rubin]] as Carter, the Kid's father\n* [[Ralph Manza]] as the Casino Worker\n* [[Jack DeLeon]] as the Building Superintendent\n\n==Award nominations==\nIn 1981, Sara Stimson was nominated for the female [[Young Artist Award]] in the category of Best Major Motion Picture - Family Entertainment.
