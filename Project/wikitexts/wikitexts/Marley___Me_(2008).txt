The film stars [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] as the owners of Marley, a Labrador retriever. ''Marley & Me'' was released in the United States and Canada on December 25, 2008, and set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office ever with $14.75 million in ticket sales.<ref name=\"MSNBC\">{{cite news | url = http://www.today.com/id/28394518 | title = 'Marley & Me' sets Christmas Day record | publisher = [[Today.com]] | access-date = 7 January 2014 | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = 25 December 2008 }}</ref> The film was followed by a 2011 [[direct-to-video]] prequel, ''[[Marley & Me: The Puppy Years]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nNewlyweds John and Jenny Grogan  escape the brutal Michigan winters and relocate to South Florida, each landing reporter jobs at competing newspapers. At ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', Jenny immediately receives prominent front-page assignments, while at the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'', John finds himself writing obituaries and mundane two-paragraph news articles.\n\nWhen John senses Jenny is contemplating motherhood, his friend and co-worker, Sebastian Tunney, suggests adopting a dog to test their readiness to raise a family. They choose a yellow [[Labrador retriever]] puppy that John names Marley (after [[Bob Marley]]). After a year, he grows into a big dog and soon proves to be incorrigible, forcing John and Jenny to enroll him in a dog obedience program run by a woman named Ms. Kornblut. Unfortunately, Marley refuses to obey commands and when she blows her whistle, he tackles her and [[Non-penetrative sex|humps]] her leg, prompting her to kick him out of her class. When they tried to take Marley to get neutered, he tried to escape the car onto a busy road, almost getting him roadkilled.\n\nEditor Arnie Klein offers John a twice-weekly column writing anything he likes. Initially stumped for ideas, John realizes that Marley's misadventures might be the perfect topic for his first column. Arnie loves it, and Marley's continual wreaking havoc on the household provides John a wealth of material. The column proves popular with readers and eventually helps double the paper's circulation. Meanwhile, Jenny miscarries early in her first trimester, leaving them devastated.\n\nJenny and John have a belated honeymoon in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], leaving Marley at home, under a young woman's care. She cannot control him well, and John and Jenny return to a damaged house. Soon after, Jenny discovers she's pregnant and nine months later, she delivers a healthy boy, Patrick. When a second son, Conor, arrives, Jenny opts to be a stay-at-home mom, so John takes on a daily column for a doubled salary. With their family growing and concern over the neighborhood's crime rate, they move to a larger house in [[Boca Raton]], where Marley delights in swimming in the backyard pool.\n\nJenny exhibits [[postpartum depression]] symptoms, stressed with raising two small children, and becoming increasingly impatient and irritable with Marley and also John. Sebastian agrees to take Marley for a few days after Jenny, upset and angry, demands John find him a new home. Jenny quickly realizes Marley is an indispensable part of the family. A few years and nine months later, they have a daughter, Colleen.\n\nAfter turning 40, and envious when Sebastian is hired by ''[[The New York Times]]'', John grows dissatisfied with being a columnist. With Jenny's blessing, he accepts a reporter job with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', and the family moves to a farm in rural Pennsylvania. John soon realizes he is a better columnist than reporter and pitches a column idea to his editor. Life is idyllic until the aging Marley suffers a near-fatal [[gastric dilatation volvulus|intestinal]] disorder. He recovers, but, too old for corrective surgery, suffers a second attack later. Marley is [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] with John at his side. The family pay their last respects to their beloved pet as they bury him beneath a tree in their front yard.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[John Grogan (journalist)|John Grogan]]\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Jennifer \"Jenny\" Grogan\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Sebastian Tunney\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Arnie Klein\n* [[Haley Hudson]] as Debbie\n* [[Haley Bennett]] as Lisa\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Ms. Kornblut\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Dr. Platt\n* [[Nathan Gamble]] as Patrick Grogan (Age 10)\n**Bryce Robinson as Patrick Grogan (Age 7)\n**Dylan Henry as Patrick Grogan (Age 3)\n*Finley Jacobsen as Conor Grogan (Age 8)\n**Ben Hyland as Conor Grogan (Age 5)\n*Lucy Merriam as Colleen Grogan (Age 5)\n\n==Production==\nBecause the film covers 14 years in the life of the dog, 22 different yellow labradors played the part of Marley (as revealed in the special feature Finding Marley on the DVD).\n\nThe film was shot on location in Florida's [[West Palm Beach]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], [[Miami]], and [[Dolphin Stadium]], in addition to Philadelphia and [[West Chester, Pennsylvania|West Chester]] in Pennsylvania.
