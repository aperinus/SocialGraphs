Jeffrey's father is confined in a bed and with some manner of constricting device, suggesting a seizure disorder.   Walking home from the hospital, Jeffrey cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed human ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with Williams' daughter, Sandy. Sandy tells Jeffrey that the ear somehow relates to a lounge singer named Dorothy Vallens. Intrigued, Jeffrey, posing as a pest exterminator, gains access to her apartment. While there, he steals a spare key while she is distracted by a man in a distinctive yellow [[sport coat]], whom Jeffrey nicknames the \"Yellow Man\".\n\nJeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings \"[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]\", and leave early so Jeffrey can infiltrate her apartment. Dorothy returns home, stripping down to nothing, but when she hears Jeffrey, she finds him hiding in a closet and forces him to undress at knifepoint.  She nearly [[fellatio|fellates]] Jeffrey, but he retreats to the closet when [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], an aggressively [[psychopath]]ic gangster and drug lord, arrives and interrupts their encounter. Frank then proceeds to beat and rape Dorothy while inhaling narcotic gas from a canister and alternating between fits of sobbing and violent rage. After Frank leaves, Jeffrey sneaks away and seeks comfort from Sandy.\n\nAfter surmising that Frank has abducted Dorothy's husband Don and son Donnie to force her into [[sex slavery]], Jeffrey suspects Frank cut off Don's ear to intimidate her into submission. While continuing to see Sandy, Jeffrey enters into a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] sexual relationship in which Dorothy encourages him to hit her. Jeffrey sees Frank attending Dorothy's show and later observes him [[drug dealing|selling drugs]] and meeting with the Yellow Man.  Jeffrey then sees the Yellow Man meeting with a 'well dressed man.'\n\nWhen Frank catches Jeffrey leaving Dorothy's apartment, he abducts them and brings them to the lair of Ben, a criminal associate who is holding both Don and Donnie hostage. Frank permits Dorothy to see her family and forces Jeffrey to watch Ben perform an impromptu [[lip-sync]] of [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\", which moves Frank to tears. Afterwards, he and his gang take Jeffrey and Dorothy on a high-speed joyride to a sawmill yard, where he again attempts to sexually abuse Dorothy. When Jeffrey intervenes and punches him in the face, an enraged Frank and his gang pull him out of the car.  Replaying the tape of [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" Frank smears lipstick on his face and violently kisses Jeffrey, likewise smearing him with red lipstick. Frank savagely beats Jeffrey unconscious, while a woman dances on the roof of the car and Dorothy pleads for Frank to stop. Jeffrey awakes the next morning, bruised and bloodied.\n\nVisiting the police station, Jeffrey realizes that Detective Williams' partner, Tom Gordon, is the Yellow Man, who has been murdering Frank's rival drug dealers and stealing confiscated narcotics from the [[evidence room]] for Frank to sell. After he and Sandy attend a party during which they profess their love for one another, they are pursued by a car which they assume belongs to Frank. As they arrive at Jeffrey's home, Sandy realizes the car belongs to her ex-boyfriend Mike Shaw. After Mike threatens to beat Jeffrey for stealing his girlfriend, Dorothy appears on Jeffrey's porch naked, beaten and confused. Mike backs down as Jeffrey and Sandy whisk Dorothy to Sandy's house to summon medical attention.\n\nWhen Dorothy calls Jeffrey \"my secret lover\", a distraught Sandy slaps him for cheating on her. Jeffrey asks Sandy to tell her father everything, and Detective Williams then leads a police raid on Frank's headquarters, killing his men and crippling his criminal empire. Jeffrey returns alone to Dorothy's apartment, where he discovers her husband dead and the Yellow Man mortally wounded. As Jeffrey leaves the apartment, the 'Well Dressed Man' arrives, sees Jeffrey in the stairs and chases him back inside. Jeffrey, realizing that the 'Well Dressed Man' is actually Frank Booth, uses the Yellow Man's [[walkie-talkie]] to say he is in the bedroom while he, in fact, hides in a closet. When Frank arrives, Jeffrey ambushes and kills him with the Yellow Man's gun, moments before Sandy and Detective Williams arrive for help.\n\nJeffrey and Sandy continue their relationship and Dorothy is reunited with her son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Dorothy Vallens\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Jeffrey Beaumont\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]]\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Sandy Williams\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Mrs. Pam Williams\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Ben\n* [[George Dickerson]] as Detective John Williams\n* [[Priscilla Pointer]] as Mrs. Frances Beaumont\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Aunt Barbara\n* Jack Harvey as Mr. Tom Beaumont\n* Ken Stovitz as Mike Shaw\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Raymond\n* [[Jack Nance]] as Paul\n* J.

The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.<ref>{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Biting into ''Blue Velvet'' | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=October 2, 1986 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861002/PEOPLE/41216001/1023 | access-date=February 16, 2007 | archive-date=May 23, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523163316/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19861002%2FPEOPLE%2F41216001%2F1023 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. \"I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery.

And so it went away for a while.\"<ref name=\"rodley\"/>{{rp|136}} Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with [[Dino De Laurentiis]] that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Blue Velvet\"/> This deal meant that ''Blue Velvet'' was the smallest film on De Laurentiis's slate.<ref name=\"Blue Velvet\"/> Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production.<ref name=\"Blue Velvet\"/> \"After ''Dune'' I was down so far that anything was up!

Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her [[Lanc\u00f4me]] ads in the early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Italian film director [[Roberto Rossellini]]. After completion of the film, during test screenings, [[ICM Partners]]\u2014the agency representing Rossellini\u2014immediately dropped her as a client.

The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.<ref>{{cite book | title=Some of Me | first=Isabella | last=Rossellini | year=1997 | publisher=Random House | location=New York | isbn=978-0-679-45252-2 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/someofme00ross }}</ref>\n\nThe Carolina Apartments on 5th and Market St in downtown Wilmington served as the location central to the story, with the adjacent Kenan fountain featured prominently in many shots.

For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the [[deleted scene]]s, long thought lost, had been discovered.
