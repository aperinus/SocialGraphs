''Fast & Furious'' is the first film to feature [[D-BOX]] motion.\n\n''Fast & Furious'' was scheduled to be released in June 2009, but premiered at the [[Universal Amphitheatre|Gibson Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles on March 12, 2009 and was theatrically released worldwide by [[Universal Pictures]] on April 3. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with praise for reuniting the original cast and the action sequences, but criticism for its screenplay. It grossed over $360 million worldwide, subverting expectations to become the then-highest-grossing film in the franchise, and the [[List of 2009 box office number-one films in the United States|17th highest-grossing film of 2009]]. It also grossed $72.5 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which made it the highest grossing worldwide spring weekend opening of all time, until the release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010). A sequel, ''[[Fast Five]]'', was released in April 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n[[Dominic Toretto]] and his crew, consisting of girlfriend Letty, Tego Leo, Rico Santos, Cara and [[Han Lue]], are hijacking fuel tankers in the [[Dominican Republic]]. Dom suspects the police are on their trail, and leaves Letty behind to protect her from being caught. Months later, in [[Panama City]], Dom gets a call from his sister Mia, who tells him Letty has been killed in a car crash. Dom heads to Los Angeles to attend her funeral and finds traces of [[nitromethane]] at the crash site. He coerces the local mechanic into giving the name of the buyer, David Park, and is informed that the only car that uses nitromethane in the area is a green 1972 [[Ford Torino#1972|Ford Torino Sport]]. Meanwhile, [[FBI]] agent [[Brian O'Conner]] is trying to track down a Mexican [[drug lord]], Arturo Braga, whose identity to the public is unknown; his search also leads him to Park.\n\nDom arrives at Park's apartment and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park, who in turn becomes the FBI's new informant and gets Brian into a [[Street racing|street race]]. Brian selects a [[Custom car|modified]] 2002 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] R34 from the impound lot; Dom also shows up, in his 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle#1970 Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]. Ramon Campos, Braga's second-in-command, and [[Gisele Yashar]], Braga's liaison, reveal that the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics [[heroin]] between the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Dom wins by bumping Brian's car while in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team. The team meets up with Braga's henchman, Fenix, and Dom notices that Fenix drives the same Torino the mechanic described.\n\nThey drive across the border using tunnels to avoid detection. Dom confronts Fenix and learns that he kills the drivers after their work is done, and that he killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A stand-off ensues; Dominic detonates his car with nitrous to distract Braga's men, and Brian hijacks a 1999 [[Hummer H1]] with $60 million worth of heroin in it. Brian and Dom drive back to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot, where they pick up a modified 2008 [[Subaru Impreza|Subaru Impreza WRX STI]] hatchback; they drive to Dom's house and reunite with Mia. Dom attacks Brian when he learns he was the last person in contact with Letty; Brian explains Letty was working undercover, tracking Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record. Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to show up to exchange money for the heroin. At the drop site, the man who claims to be Braga is revealed as a decoy, and Campos\u2014the real Braga\u2014escapes with Fenix to [[Mexico]]. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix nearly runs over Gisele before Dom saves her. The failed trap results in Brian being taken off active duty.\n\nWith Gisele's help, Brian and Dom travel to Mexico to catch Braga in the Subaru and Dom's rebuilt 1970 [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1970|Dodge Charger R/T]], and apprehend him at a church. As Braga's henchmen try to rescue him, Brian and Dom drive through the tunnels back to the United States. Brian is chased by Fenix ahead of the others until he is [[side collision|T-boned]] and pushed out of the tunnels. Before Fenix can kill him, Dom drives out of the tunnels and into Fenix, killing him. As police and helicopters approach the crash site on the American side of the border, Brian tells Dom to leave, but Dom says he is tired of running. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dom to 25 years to life. Brian resigns from the FBI and Dom boards a prison bus that will transport him to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|Lompoc penitentiary]]. As the bus drives down the road, Brian, Mia, Leo, and Santos arrive in their cars to intercept it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the characters|List of Fast & Furious characters}}\n\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]], a professional street racer, criminal, and fugitive.\n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]], an FBI agent and former LAPD officer who previously aided Dom in avoiding law enforcement, and was in a relationship with Mia Toretto, which later got patched up again.\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as [[List of Fast & Furious characters#Letty Ortiz|Letty Ortiz]], Dominic's wife, who dies in an automobile explosion caused by Fenix Calderon.\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] as [[List of Fast & Furious characters#Mia Toretto|Mia Toretto]], Dominic's sister and Brian's ex-girlfriend, but the relationship was later patched up again.\n* [[John Ortiz]] as Arturo Braga / Ramon Campos, a Mexican drug lord who recruits street racers to smuggle heroin across the Mexico\u2013U.S. border.\n* [[Gal Gadot]] as [[Gisele Yashar]], a liaison for Braga who shows a romantic interest in Dom.\n* [[Laz Alonso]] as Fenix Calderon, Braga's right-hand man.\n\nThe central cast is rounded out by [[Sung Kang]] as [[Han Lue]],  [[Ron Yuan]] as David Park, Braga's right-hand man, while Puerto Rican singers [[Tego Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Don Omar]] feature as [[List of Fast & Furious characters#Tego Leo|Leo]] and [[List of Fast & Furious characters#Rico Santos|Santos]] respectively, members of the oil heist team.

The movie cars were built in Southern California's San Fernando Valley. Around 240 cars were built for the film.<ref name=\"pedaltothefloor.com\"/> However, the replica vehicles do not match the specifications they were supposed to represent. For example, the replica version of ''F-Bomb'', a 1973 [[Chevrolet Camaro]] built by Tom Nelson of NRE and David Freiburger of ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' magazine, included a 300&nbsp;hp crate V8 engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission, whereas the actual car included a [[twin-turbo]] 1,500&nbsp;hp engine and a 5-speed transmission.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/fast-furious-cars-1973-f-bomb-camaro.html The F-Bomb Drops on Fast & Furious] Edmunds Insideline March 13, 2009</ref>\n\nThe original Dodge Charger 426 Hemi R/T that was used in the original movie was a 1970, but the car in this movie was a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi with a slightly modified front grill and rear tail lights to appear as a 1970 car; the original 1970 Dodge Charger was in pieces, being totally disassembled for restoration.\n\nThe original red 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS seen in the end credits of the first ''Fast & Furious'' movie, also makes an appearance but is later highly modified for a street race.\n\nThe most radical vehicles built for the film were the Chevy trucks constructed for the fuel heist. Powered by 502ci GM big block motors, the '67 had a giant ladder-bar suspension with airbags using a massive 10-ton semi rear axle with the biggest and widest truck tires they could find. The '88 Chevy Crew Cab was built with twin full-floating GM 1-ton axles equipped with Detroit Lockers and a transfer case directing power to both axles and capable of four-wheel burnouts.<ref>[http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0905_fast_furious_movie_cars/musclecars_destruction.html Fast & Furious Movie Cars \u2013 Faster And More Furious] Hod Rod Magazine, May 2009</ref>\n\nAnother vehicle built for the film was the blue Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 owned by an uncredited owner which brought a 241-mile per hour top speed at the [[Bayshore Route|Bayshore Route Highway]] in Japan. It was a hard car to build by the production so they made clones by acquiring Nissan Skyline 25GT's and made them look like the original car. The Skyline \nthat was also used at the desert was actually a dune buggy using a Skyline R34's shell.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Fast & Furious (soundtrack)|Fast & Furious (score)}}\nThe score to ''Fast & Furious'' was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], who recorded his score with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Newman Scoring Stage at [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"scoring\">{{cite news | author=Dan Goldwasser | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/178/ | title=Brian Tyler scores fast and furious with ''Fast & Furious''| publisher=ScoringSessions.com | date=February 24, 2009 | access-date=February 24, 2009 }}</ref> The score album was released on CD by Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records with over 78 minutes' worth of music.\n\nThe trailers for the film feature the track \"[[We Are Rockstars]]\" by [[Does It Offend You, Yeah?]] and a [[Travis Barker]]-remixed version of \"[[Crank That (Soulja Boy)|Crank That]]\" by [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]].\n\nThe official soundtrack was released on March 31, 2009, on [[Star Trak]], with production handled primarily by [[The Neptunes]].
