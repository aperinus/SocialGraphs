He joins Finnegan, Roper, Dale, and Plummer cruising campus by car, looking for women. Upperclassmen Roper and Finnegan both \"strike out\" with two women, but one of them, Beverly, says she likes Jake; he makes a note of her room number.\n\nAt a team meeting in the house, the coach introduces the new players, including freshmen Jake, Plummer, Beuter, Brumley, and transfer students Jay and Willoughby. The coach cites two rules: no alcohol in the house, and no women upstairs. The team quickly disregards the rules and hosts a drunken party during which several players take women up to their bedrooms. The next morning, Beuter leaves temporarily for home, concerned his girlfriend is pregnant.\n\nThe team goes out drinking and \"cruising chicks\", beginning the night at a local disco. Jay makes arrogant remarks to a bartender, provoking a brawl, and the team is ejected. Jay goes home, and the rest of the team changes clothes and visits a western-themed bar. The next day Willoughby shares his marijuana, music, and philosophy with the freshmen. Jake happens upon Justin, a high school teammate who has embraced [[punk subculture]]. He invites the team to a punk concert, and with Jake's encouragement, they go. Jake leaves flowers and a note on Beverly's apartment door that night, then attends a massive party at the team's house.\n\nBeverly calls him in the morning and they agree to meet. She says she is a performing arts major; Jake answers only that he is a baseball player, based on Finnegan's advice. At the team's first unofficial practice, Jay upsets his teammates by pitching aggressively. McReynolds, the team's captain and best player, puts Jay in his place by hitting a home run. The coach arrives unexpectedly and calls Willoughby off the pitcher's mound. It is later revealed that Willoughby is 30 and has been fraudulently transferring to new colleges to continue playing ball and enjoying the student lifestyle.\n\nBeverly invites Jake to \"Oz\", a costume party thrown by performing arts students. Jake mentions the party to his teammates and tries to tell them they would not enjoy it, but they cajole him into taking them. Although they initially feel out of place, they enjoy themselves all the same. Finnegan is ridiculed by his friends for pretending to be into astrology, and Jake takes part in an improvised ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''\u2013themed take on ''[[The Dating Game]]''. Jake and Beverly spend the rest of the night together.\n\nThe next morning, the semester begins and Jake and Beverly walk to class together. Two teammates razz Jake for not returning home that night. He runs into Plummer in his classroom, and they settle in for their first lecture. Their history professor enters and writes \"Frontiers are where you find them\" on the chalkboard. As their first college class officially begins, Jake and Plummer fall asleep.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Blake Jenner]] as Jake Bradford\n* [[Zoey Deutch]] as Beverly\n* [[Glen Powell]] as Walt \"Finn\" Finnegan\n* [[Tyler Hoechlin]] as Glen McReynolds\n* [[Ryan Guzman]] as Kenny Roper\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Charlie Willoughby\n* [[Will Brittain]] as Billy \"Beuter\" Autrey\n* [[Austin Amelio]] as Nesbit\n* Temple Baker as Tyrone Plummer\n* Juston Street as Jay Niles\n* J.
