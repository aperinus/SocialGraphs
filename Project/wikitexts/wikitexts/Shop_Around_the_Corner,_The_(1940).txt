Kralik's coworkers at Matuschek and Company include his friend, Pirovitch ([[Felix Bressart]]), a kindly family man; Ferencz Vadas ([[Joseph Schildkraut]]), a two-faced womanizer; saleswoman Ilona Novotny ([[Inez Courtney]]); clerk Flora Kaczek ([[Sara Haden]]); and Pepi Katona ([[William Tracy]]), an ambitious, precocious delivery boy. One morning, Kralik reveals to Pirovitch that he's been corresponding anonymously with an intelligent and cultured woman whose ad he came across in the newspaper.\n\nKralik is Mr. Matuschek's oldest and most trusted employee, but lately there has been tension between the two. They get into an argument over Mr. Matuschek's idea to sell a cigarette box that plays \"[[Dark Eyes (Russian song)|Ochi Ch\u00ebrnye]]\" when opened. After their exchange, Klara Novak ([[Margaret Sullavan]]) enters the gift shop looking for a job. Kralik tells her there are no openings, but when she is able to sell one of the cigarette boxes (as a candy box), Mr. Matuschek hires her. However, she and Kralik do not get along.\n\nMr. Matuschek begins to suspect his wife is having an affair as she stays out late and requests money from him.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, Kralik is preparing to meet his mystery correspondent for a dinner date. The meeting is stalled when Mr. Matuschek demands that everyone stay after work to decorate the shop. Later Kralik is called into Mr. Matuschek's office and is fired. No one in the shop understands Mr. Matuschek's actions are related to his suspicions that Kralik is having an affair with his wife. Later, Mr. Matuschek meets with a private investigator who informs him that his wife is having an affair with one of his employees\u2014Ferencz Vadas. Pepi returns to the shop just in time to prevent Mr. Matuschek from committing suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Kralik arrives at the Cafe Nizza, where he discovers that his mystery woman is Novak. Despite his disappointment, Kralik goes in and talks with her, pretending he is there to meet Pirovitch. In his mind, Kralik tries to reconcile the cultured woman of his letters with his annoying coworker\u2014secretly hoping that things might work out with her. Concerned that Kralik's presence will spoil her first meeting with her \"far superior\" mystery correspondent, she calls Kralik a \"little insignificant clerk\" and asks him to leave.\n\nLater that night, Kralik goes to the hospital to visit Mr. Matuschek, who offers him a job as manager of Matuschek and Company. Grateful to Pepi for saving his life, Mr. Matuschek promotes him to clerk. The next day, Novak calls in sick after her mystery man failed to show. That night, Kralik visits her at her apartment. During his visit, she receives a letter from her correspondent and reads it in front of Kralik (who wrote the letter).\n\nTwo weeks later, on Christmas Eve, Matuschek and Company achieves record sales. Kralik and Miss Novak, alone in the shop, talk about their planned dates for the evening and Miss Novak reveals that she had a crush on Kralik when they first met. After pretending to have met Novak's mystery man, Kralik puts a red carnation in his lapel and reveals to her that he is her mystery correspondent and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Shop Around the Corner trailer.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Margaret Sullavan]] as Klara Novak\n* [[James Stewart]] as Alfred Kralik\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as Hugo Matuschek\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as Ferencz Vadas\n* [[Sara Haden]] as Flora Kaczek\n* [[Felix Bressart]] as Pirovitch\n* [[William Tracy]] as Pepi Katona\n* [[Inez Courtney]] as Ilona Novotny\n* [[Charles Halton]] as Detective\n* [[Charles Smith (actor)|Charles Smith]] as Rudy{{#tag:ref|In the musical remake ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'', an uncredited Charles Smith is one of the quartet singing with Judy Garland at the engagement party.|group=N}}\n* [[Sarah Edwards (actress)|Sarah Edwards]] as Customer\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Doctor\n* [[Charles Arnt]] as Policeman (uncredited)\n* [[Mabel Colcord]] as Klara's Aunt Anna (uncredited)\n* [[Mary Carr]] as Klara's Grandmother (uncredited)\n* [[Grace Hayle]] as Plump Customer (uncredited)<ref name=\"imdbcast\"/>\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:The Shop Around the Corner (1940 poster - Style D).jpg|thumb|Alternate theatrical release poster]]\n''The Shop Around the Corner'' has a 99% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 93 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 8.8/10.

It is a comedy so good it frightens us for them. The caf\u00e9 conversation may be the best meeting in American film. The shot of Sullavan's gloved hand, and then her ruined face, searching an empty mail box for a letter is one of the most fragile moments in film.

The film uses plot elements and dialogue lines similar to the 1940 film, especially during the first date. Screen credit of ''You've Got Mail'' is given to [[Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3]] for ''Parfumerie'' (the play on which the 1940 film is based), but in a nod to the earlier film, one of the protagonists of ''You've Got Mail'' owns a bookstore named \"The Shop Around the Corner\".\n\nThe 1996 Indian Tamil-language romance film ''[[Kadhal Kottai]]'' directed by [[Agathiyan]] is an unofficial remake of ''The Shop Around the Corner''.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/shop_corner.pdf ''The Shop Around the Corner''] essay by Kevin Bahr at [[National Film Registry]]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0033045}}\n* {{amg movie|id=44464}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|shop_around_the_corner}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=413}}\n* {{AFI film|id=4630|title=The Shop Around the Corner}}\n* {{Mojo title|shoparoundthecorner|The Shop Around the Corner}}\n* [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/the_shop_around_the_corner.pdf \"Acting Ordinary in The Shop Around the Corner\"] Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism, Issue 1, 2010\n* [https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_s_Film_Legacy/deq3xI8OmCkC?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizyMChr__qAhVroXIEHQcNAtgQiKUDMBZ6BAgTEAQ ''The Shop Around the Corner''] essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pages 307-308\n'''Streaming audio'''\n* [https://archive.org/download/ScreenGuildTheater/Sgt_40-09-29_ep054_Shop_Around_the_Corner.mp3 ''The Shop Around the Corner''] on [[Screen Guild Theater]]: September 29, 1940\n* [https://archive.org/download/Lux06/Lux_41-06-23_The_Shop_Around_the_Corner.mp3 ''The Shop Around the Corner''] on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: June 23, 1941\n\n{{Ernst Lubitsch}}\n{{Samson Raphaelson}}\n{{Parfumerie}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shop Around The Corner, The}}\n[[Category:1940 films]]\n[[Category:1940 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Fictional shops]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ernst Lubitsch]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Films set in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Samson Raphaelson]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:1940s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Workplace comedy films]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s American films]]"}]}}}}
