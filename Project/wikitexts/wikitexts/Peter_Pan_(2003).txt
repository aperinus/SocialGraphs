Hogan]] and written by Hogan and [[Michael Goldenberg]]. The screenplay is based on the 1904 play and 1911 novel ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' by [[J.M. Barrie]]. [[Jason Isaacs]] plays the [[dual role]]s of [[Captain Hook]] and [[George Darling (Peter Pan character)|George Darling]], [[Olivia Williams]] plays Mary Darling, while [[Jeremy Sumpter]] plays [[Peter Pan]], [[Rachel Hurd-Wood]] plays [[Wendy Darling]], and [[Ludivine Sagnier]] plays [[Tinker Bell]]. [[Lynn Redgrave]] plays a supporting role as Aunt Millicent, a new character created for the film.\n\nAfter completing the script, Hogan and Goldenberg were given approval by [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], which held the rights to Barrie's story. [[Principal photography]] took place in Australia at [[Village Roadshow Studios]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] from September 2002 to May 2003.\n\n''Peter Pan'' premiered at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire]] in [[Leicester Square]], London on 9 December 2003 and was theatrically released by [[Universal Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[Revolution Studios]] in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2003 and in the United States on 25 December 2003. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast performances (particularly that of Sumpter, Hurd-Wood, & Isaacs), creative visual fantasy, romantic feel, and Howard\u2019s musical score, but only grossed $122 million worldwide. With an estimated budget of $130.6 million (not including marketing costs), the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]] resulting in a $70\u201395 million loss.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1904 London, [[Wendy Darling]] tells her younger brothers John and Michael stories of [[Captain Hook]] and his pirates. [[Peter Pan]] overhears her from outside their nursery window. Dissatisfied with Wendy's stories, Aunt Millicent advises the Darlings to focus on her future prospects. One night, Wendy sees Peter return to the nursery to watch her sleep, but his shadow is bitten off by the family's nurse dog, Nana. At school, Wendy's teacher discovers her drawing a picture of Peter. Wendy tries stopping a disciplinary letter from reaching her father, only to publicly embarrass him when Nana chases her into the bank.\n\nSearching for his shadow, Peter befriends Wendy, who sews it back onto him. He invites Wendy and her brothers to [[Neverland]] so she can tell her stories to his gang of Lost Boys. Using [[Tinker Bell]]'s fairy dust, the four fly to Neverland, while Nana alerts Mr. and Mrs. Darling of what has happened. In Neverland, Captain Hook and his pirate crew soon attack the children. Jealous of Peter\u2019s affection for Wendy, Tinker Bell tricks the Lost Boys into shooting the girl out of the sky, who mistake her for a bird. Fortunately, Wendy survives, saved by an acorn Peter had given her earlier. Peter banishes Tinker Bell and ends their friendship.\n\nWendy agrees to the Lost Boys' request to be their \"mother\", while Peter takes the role of their father. Meanwhile, John and Michael encounter Tiger Lily, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] princess, and Hook and his crew take the three to the Black Castle. Peter, Wendy, and the Lost Boys rescue them, as Hook is chased by the crocodile who has followed him for years. After a celebration at the Native American camp, Peter shows Wendy the fairies' home and the two share a romantic dance. Hook spies on the pair and convinces Tinker Bell that Peter will eventually choose to leave Neverland for Wendy. When Wendy asks Peter to express his feelings, he angrily demands she return home, refusing to believe that he can ever feel love without having to grow up. Peter then flies off, returns to the Darling nursery and unsuccessfully tries shutting the open window, determined to keep Wendy in Neverland.\n\nWendy urges her brothers to return home with her, as they are starting to forget their parents. The Lost Boys eventually decide to join them, to Peter's dismay. Wendy says goodbye to Peter, leaving him a cup of medicine to drink. When Wendy leaves the hideout, she and the rest of the boys are captured by Hook's crew, who also poison Peter's medicine. However, Tinker Bell drinks it to save his life. Devastated and begging for forgiveness, Peter repeatedly proclaims his belief in fairies and telepathically reaches out to everyone at Neverland and London to do the same. This revives Tinker Bell, who helps Peter rescue Wendy and free the Lost Boys. During the ensuing fight with the pirates, Hook forcefully uses Tinker Bell's dust to grant him flying abilities. During their duel, Hook taunts Peter about Wendy wanting to abandon him, and how she will eventually grow up and marry another man. Weakened, Peter falls and is incapacitated. Hook allows Wendy to say goodbye to Peter before killing him. Finally professing her love for Peter, Wendy kisses him, which brings back his happiness.\n\nFull of life again, Peter defeats Hook, who is swallowed up by the crocodile. Covering the Jolly Roger in fairy dust, Peter flies Wendy and the boys back to London where they are reunited with Mr. and Mrs. Darling, who adopts the rest of the Lost Boys. Slightly, who got lost on the way to London and arrives at the house late, is adopted by Millicent while Mr. Darling reconciles with his children. Peter promises Wendy he will never forget her and one day he will return to visit her, before returning to Neverland with Tinker Bell. Despite never seeing Peter again, she continues to tell his story to her own children, and in turn to their grandchildren and so on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeremy Sumpter]] as [[Peter Pan]]: A young boy who can fly and refuses to grow up.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Captain Hook]]: The captain of the ''Jolly Roger'', and [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|Mr. Darling]], the Darling children's father.\n* [[Rachel Hurd-Wood]] as [[Wendy Darling]]: the eldest child of the Darling family and Peter\u2019s love interest. \n** [[Saffron Burrows]] plays the adult Wendy, who narrates the film and appears in the unused epilogue.\n* [[Ludivine Sagnier]] as [[Tinker Bell]]: Peter's emotional fairy companion.\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as [[Mary Darling (fictional character)|Mrs. Darling]]: the Darling children's mother.\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as Aunt Millicent: the aunt of the three Darling children, a character created for the film.\n* [[Richard Briers]] as [[Mr. Smee]]: Hook's dimwitted first-mate.\n* Harry Newell as [[John Darling (Peter Pan)|John Darling]]: the middle child of the Darling family. \n* Freddie Popplewell as [[Michael Darling (Peter Pan)|Michael Darling]]: the youngest child of the Darling family.\n* Rebel as Nana: the dog nurse of the Darling family.\n* Carsen Gray as [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]]: the daughter of a Native American chief.\n* [[Kerry Walker]] as Miss Fulsom: a strict schoolteacher.\n* [[Mathew Waters]] as the messenger boy\n\n===The Lost Boys===\n* Theodore Chester as Slightly\n* [[Rupert Simonian]] as Tootles\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Curly\n* [[Harry Eden]] as Nibs\n* Patrick Gooch and Lachlan Gooch as the Twins\n\n===The Pirate Crew===\n* [[Alan Cinis]] as Skylights\n* [[Frank Whitten]] as Starkey\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Cookson\n* [[Daniel Wyllie]] as Alf Mason\n* Brian Carbee as Albino\n* Don Battee as Giant Pirate\n* [[Frank Gallacher]] as Alsatian Fogarty\n* Septimus Caton as Noodler\n* [[Jacob Tomuri]] as Bill Jukes\n* Venant Wong as Quang Lee\n* Phil Meacham as Bollard\n* Darren Mitchell as Mullins\n* Michael Roughan as Cecco\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film is dedicated to [[Dodi Al-Fayed]], who was executive producer of the 1991 film ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''. Al-Fayed planned to produce a live action version of Peter Pan, and shared his ideas with [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] (who was President of Great Ormond St Hospital), who said she \"could not wait to see the production once it was underway.\" Al-Fayed's father, Mohammed Al-Fayed, co-produced the 2003 adaptation of the tale after his son [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in the car crash]] which also killed Diana, Princess of Wales.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dodi Al-Fayed \u2013 Peter Pan |url=http://www.alfayed.com/dodi-and-diana/dodi.aspx |quote=The first step was for Dodi to negotiate an extension of the rights granted by the hospital to his father.

M.

In July 2002, at age 13, Jeremy Sumpter was selected for the role of Peter Pan. Since the first stage production of the story, the title role has usually been played by a woman, a tradition followed in the [[Peter Pan (1924 film)|first film adaptation]]. Two subsequent animated adaptations have featured a male voice actor as Peter Pan, and a Soviet live-action film adaptation for television cast a boy to play the role. This film was the first live-action theatrical release with a boy playing the part. The casting of a single actor to play both George Darling and Captain Hook follows a tradition also begun in the first staging of the play. Jason Isaacs was selected for the part.\n\n[[Brie Larson]] auditioned for [[Wendy Darling]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9CcjI0SOcU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/t9CcjI0SOcU |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Brie Larson: AUDITION STORYTIME!

To prepare, he says he practiced sword fighting as much as five hours a day, as well as training in gymnastics and lifting weights. Isaacs also trained for sword fighting as well.

The fairies that appear in the film are actors composited into the film with some digital enhancements. According to actor Jason Isaacs, the filmmakers were impressed with actress Ludivine Sagnier's performance and decided to abandon their plans to make Tinker Bell entirely computer animated.<ref name=Wloszczyna>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-08-06-peter-pan_x.htm |title=A Mature Peter Pan |access-date=10 September 2008 |last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |date=7 August 2003 |work=USA Today }}</ref> The film also features a large, computer-generated crocodile. Another character, an animatronic parrot, appears in some scenes on the pirate ship. A complex harness was built to send the live-action actors rotating and gliding through the air for the flight sequences. They were then composited into the shots of London and Neverland, although they are sometimes replaced with computer-generated figures. One other aspect of bringing the story to life was the complex sword-fighting sequences, for which the actors were trained. Sumpter said that, \"I had to train for five months before the shoot. I had to do harness training to learn how to fly and learn how to swordfight,\" and that, \"I got stabbed a couple of times with a sword.\"<ref name=\"sumpter\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/cs/peterpan/a/ppjeremysumpter.htm |title=Interview with 'Peter Pan' Star, Jeremy Sumpter |access-date=16 September 2008 |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |publisher=about.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929061638/http://movies.about.com/cs/peterpan/a/ppjeremysumpter.htm |archive-date=29 September 2008  }}</ref> Hogan says that the flying scenes were very difficult to accomplish, but that, \"it was tougher on the kids than it was for me.

Hollywood-based producer Lucy Fisher also said that, \"The window he flies out of had to be enlarged twice.\"<ref name=\"Wloszczyna\" />\n\n==Release==\nThis film was released in theatres on 18 December 2003 in Australia, on 24 December 2003 in the United Kingdom and on 25 December 2003 in the United States. The film was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, and South Africa, and by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the rest of the world. While Universal distributed the film theatrically in France, the home video rights are handled by Sony there.\n\n===Marketing===\nFor the promotion of the film, the original novel of ''Peter Pan'' by J.M.
