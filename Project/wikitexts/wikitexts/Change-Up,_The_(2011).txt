The film stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Jason Bateman]] as Mitch Planko and Dave Lockwood, two best friends living in [[Atlanta]] who switch bodies after urinating into the fountain to wish they had each other's lives. The film was released on August 5, 2011, in North America, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Atlanta, Dave Lockwood is married with three children, while his best friend Mitch Planko is single and at his sexual prime. After getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate into a fountain, simultaneously wishing they had each other's lives.\n\nThe next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Returning to the park to wish for their lives back, the fountain has been removed for restoration. Forced to wait until the parks department locates the fountain, Mitch and Dave have to pose as each other.\n\nAt Dave's law office, Mitch befriends Dave's assistant Sabrina, but his lack of professionalism and legal knowledge sabotage an important merger with a Japanese firm. Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot, discovering it is a \"lorno\" \u2013 [[softcore pornography|\"light\" pornography]].\n\nDave takes Mitch to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but she does not believe him. Dave advises him on how to behave professionally, and Mitch sets up Dave on a date with Sabrina, as Mitch has a crush.\n\nAfter speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to Dave's life. At her ballet recital, Dave's eldest child Cara takes Mitch's advice and throws her bully to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells him she loves him and he says the same, but feels guilty.\n\nDave takes the day off to take full advantage of being Mitch, who coaches him how to act like Mitch on the date, and shaves off Dave's pubic hair. Sabrina meets Dave at a classy restaurant and, despite only going because Mitch told her to, genuinely likes him, and they get tattoos. Dave walks her home, and she tells him to call her.\n\nMitch learns Dave told Jamie not to invite Mitch to their anniversary party, afraid he would ruin it. Dave informs Mitch the fountain has been found, but they both want to stay each other a bit longer. Mitch, forgets about the \"Dialogue Night\" he planned with Jamie, accidentally standing her up.\n\nAt the new merger meeting, the Japanese representatives offer only $625 million, $75 million short. As Dave's firm is about to agree, Mitch observes that the other representatives have not yet left, and compares the negotiations to sex and porn. He demands $725 million and has the representatives of Dave's firm begin to leave, scaring the other firm into agreement. Mitch and Dave's family go to a gala held by the firm in honor of Dave being made partner, but Jamie is upset by the speech that praises his family values.\n\nDave and Sabrina are at a baseball game when a thunderstorm hits, and wait it out at Mitch's house. She tells him she is going to have sex with him, but when he sees her tattoo of a many-spotted skipperling \u2013 his daughter's favorite butterfly \u2013 he regretfully leaves.\n\nAt the gala, Dave's boss delivers a speech about his accomplishments and love for his family, filling Mitch with guilt. Dave rushes in and kisses Jamie, finally convincing her that he is her husband. He and Mitch find the fountain surrounded by people. Proceeding with their plan to urinate in the fountain, Mitch is too embarrassed, especially after the crowd notices Dave doing so. Mitch asks why Dave did not invite him to his anniversary party, and Dave admits he was embarrassed by Mitch, but has grown to respect him while in his body. This relaxes Mitch enough to urinate, but their wish does not work. Security approaches, but on Mitch and Dave's third try the Galleria's lights go out, and they run.\n\nIn an epilogue, Dave and Mitch are thrilled to have returned to their original bodies. Mitch gets breakfast with Sabrina, not realizing the tattoo Dave got is of his face on Mitch's back, captioned \"I \u2665 Dave\". Mitch speaks at his father's wedding, and attends Dave's anniversary party. In a post-credits scene, Dave and Jamie get high and visit the aquarium, while Mitch and Sabrina have sex for the first time, and Mitch sends Dave the porno he starred in.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Planko Jr.\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as David \"Dave\" Lockwood\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Jamie Lockwood, Dave's wife\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Sabrina McKay, Dave's attractive assistant\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Planko Sr., Mitch's father and namesake\n* [[Mircea Monroe]] as Tatiana, Mitch's nymphomaniac ex-girlfriend\n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as Flemming Steel, Dave's boss\n* [[Ned Schmidtke]] as Theodore \"Teddy\" \"Ted\" Norton\n* [[Dax Griffin]] as Blow-Dried Goon\n* [[Craig Bierko]] as Valtan\n* [[Taaffe O'Connell]] as Mona\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Movie Set PA\n* [[TJ Hassan]] as Kato\n}}\n\nIn addition, Sydney Rouviere and Lauren and Luke Bain portray Dave's three children, Cara, Sarah, and Peter, respectively.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] from October 2010 to January 2011, which is also its setting. There were open castings at [[Turner Field]] and other venues in Atlanta. Several of the bar scenes were shot on location at a bar called Joe's on Juniper, in [[midtown Atlanta]]. The exterior and interior scenes of the Lockwood home were shot on location at a Buckhead residence designed by Atlanta residential designer Steve McClanahan. The movie was also shot in Los Angeles. The house used for the Lockwood home is on the 2400 block of Gramercy Park in historic West Adams. Despite being set in the summertime, production continued during a major [[winter storm]] that briefly crippled the city in January, leaving [[Peachtree Street|Peachtree]] and other streets covered in snow and ice and nearly preventing the [[Governor of Georgia|governor]]'s inauguration. Reynolds complimented the city in his interview on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', but joked that he thought the city \"was trying to kill\" him because of several unrelated incidents on the set and in his personal life that happened to occur during production.<ref>http://blogs.ajc.com/the-buzz/2011/08/02/ryan-reynolds-atlanta-was-trying-to-kill-me/ {{Dead link|date=March 2022}}</ref> During her interview on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}<!-- when? which episode ? --> [[Olivia Wilde]] stated that she refused to appear naked or take most of her clothes off and used a [[body double]] for some shots and wore [[pasties]] for close-up and upper shots.
