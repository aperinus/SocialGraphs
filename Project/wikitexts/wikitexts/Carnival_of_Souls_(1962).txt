Its plot follows Mary Henry, a young woman whose life is disturbed after a car accident. She relocates to a new city, where she finds herself unable to assimilate with the locals, and becomes drawn to the pavilion of an abandoned carnival. Director Harvey also appears in the film as a ghoulish stranger who stalks her throughout.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Brody|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-front-row-carnival-of-souls|title=The Front Row: \"Carnival of Souls\"|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=New York City|date=September 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFilmed in Lawrence, Kansas, and Salt Lake City, ''Carnival of Souls'' was shot on a budget of $33,000, and Harvey employed various [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques to finish the production. It was Harvey's only feature film, and did not gain widespread attention when originally released as a [[double feature]] with the now mostly forgotten ''[[The Devil's Messenger]]'' in 1962.\n\nSet to an organ score by Gene Moore, the film has been contemporarily noted by critics and film scholars for its cinematography and foreboding atmosphere.<ref>[https://siskelebert.org/?p=4950 Immediate Family, The Bear, Dad, Next of Kin, Carnival of Souls, 1989 \u2013 Siskel and Ebert Movie Reviews]</ref> The film has a large [[cult following]] and is occasionally screened at film and Halloween festivals. The film's plot resembles that of [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 story ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Kansas]], Mary Henry is riding in a car with two other young women when two men challenge them to a road race. During the race, the women's car is nudged by the boys\u2019 and plunges off a bridge into a muddy river. Three hours after the police start dredging the water to look for them, Mary miraculously surfaces on the river bank, but cannot remember how she survived.\n\nMary moves to [[Salt Lake City]], where she has been hired as a church organist. While driving through the desert, Mary's radio starts playing nothing but strange organ music, and she has visions of a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (simply called \"The Man\" in dialogue). She also sees a large, [[Saltair (Utah)#Saltair II|abandoned pavilion]] on the shores of the [[Great Salt Lake]]. A gas station attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before it closed.\n\nIn town, Mary rents a room. She meets the proprietor, who informs her that there is another lodger staying there. Mary unpacks her suitcase and goes to the church where she will be playing the organ. At the church she meets the minister and is invited to play the organ for the first time. At the minister's offer, Mary takes a ride out to the pavilion at the lake. She is stopped from entering by the minister who warns her that it is prohibited to enter.\n\nWhen she returns to her lodgings Mary meets a creepy man, John, the only other lodger, who wants to become better acquainted.  Mary however, retreats as she is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs and retreats to her room. John brings her coffee and a bottle of whiskey at breakfast time before she goes shopping. Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she simply were not there. When The Man appears briefly in front of her in a park, she flees, into the nearby arms of a Dr. Samuels. He tries to help her in his nearby office, acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist.\n\nMary's new employer, the minister, is put off when she declines a reception to meet the congregation. When she practices for the first time, she finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists upon her resignation.\n\nMary had agreed to meet John after church and they go to a bar. Terrified of being alone with her nightmares, Mary says she wants John's company. When they return home, he is invited to her bedroom door. John tries to convince Mary to let him stay the night, but she walks away, apparently uninterested. Nevertheless, he follows her to her bedroom, where she sees The Man in the mirror. Frightened, she tells John what has been happening to her. He leaves, believing she is losing her mind.\n\nAfter going back to Samuels' office, Mary believes she has to go to the pavilion. However, Mary is confronted by The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, boarding a bus to leave town, only to find that all the passengers are ghouls.\n\nIt is just a nightmare; she awakens in her car. In the end, she is drawn back to the pavilion, where she finds her tormentors dancing, a pale version of herself paired with The Man. When she runs away, the ghouls chase her onto the beach. She collapses as they close in.\n\nThe following day, Samuels, the minister, and police go to the pavilion to look for Mary. They find her footprints in the sand and they end abruptly in a complex group of prints. Back in Kansas, the girls' car is pulled from the river. Mary's body is in the front seat alongside the other two women. She was apparently dead all along.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Candace Hilligoss]] as Mary Henry\n* Frances Feist as Mrs. Thomas\n* Sidney Berger as John Linden\n* [[Art Ellison]] as Minister\n* Stan Levitt as Dr. Samuels\n* Tom McGinnis as Organ factory boss\n* Forbes Caldwell as Organ factory worker\n* Dan Palmquist as Gas station attendant\n* Bill De Jarnette as Mechanic\n* Steve Boozer as Chip\n* Pamela Ballard as Dress saleslady\n* [[Herk Harvey]] as \"The Man\" (the main ghoul)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nHarvey was a director and producer of [[Industrial film|industrial]] and [[educational film]]s based in Lawrence, Kansas, where he worked for the [[Centron Corporation]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/JohnCliffordInterviewCarnivalOfSouls Clifford, John - Interview, Carnival of Souls, 1999 posted by Demolition Kitchen Media on Internet Archive]</ref> While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for ''Carnival of Souls'' after driving past the abandoned [[Saltair, Utah|Saltair Pavilion]] in Salt Lake City.{{sfn|Crouse|2003|pages=35\u201338}} \"When I got back to Lawrence, I asked my friend and co-worker at Centron Films, John Clifford, who was a writer there, how he'd like to write a feature,\" Harvey recalled. \"The last scene, I told him, had to be a whole bunch of ghouls dancing in that ballroom; the rest was up to him.

The Arriflex, which was at that time more often used by cameramen filming newsreel footage, also allowed them to use a moving camera in other scenes without the need for gear like dollies or cranes.{{sfn|Crouse|2003|pages=35\u201338}} Harvey's assistant director was [[Reza Badiyi]], a young Iranian immigrant who was just beginning his film work in the States. At this time, Badiyi had been second-unit director on one other film, [[Robert Altman]]'s directing debut, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'',{{sfn|Weaver|2011|p=88}} but would go on to make (amongst other notable work) some of the best-known, iconic [[television series]] openings and montages, including ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046172/ Reza Badiyi-IMDB]</ref> The shot in which the face of The Man appears in the car window was accomplished through the use of an angled mirror placed on the far side of the window. The scene at the start of the film in which the car goes off the bridge and into the river was filmed in Lecompton, Kansas. The town did not charge a fee for the use of the bridge, only requiring the film crew to replace the bridge's damaged rails once they were done filming. This was done, at a cost of $12 for the repair.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Interview with Carnival of Souls' director Herk Harvey - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1GKYKJtmMo&ab_channel=CandaceHilligoss |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/Y1GKYKJtmMo |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-09|website=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===Musical score===\n''Carnival of Souls'' features an original organ score by local Kansas City organist and composer [https://www.discogs.com/artist/228013-Gene-Moore Gene Moore].

The scenes cut by the theatrical distributor include a scene where Mary stops at a gas station and discusses the carnival building with the attendant, a longer dialogue sequence between the minister and carpenter and an extra scene where the doctor talks to the landlady. In 1989, the film was screened at festivals across Europe and the United States, affording it renewed public interest,{{sfn|Weaver|2003|pages=154\u2013155}} and it has subsequently appeared at numerous Halloween film festivals.<ref name=\"niccum\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2004/oct/29/carnival_writer_relishes/|work=Lawrence Journal-World|date=October 29, 2004|last=Niccum|first=Jon|archive-date=December 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221095650/http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2004/oct/29/carnival_writer_relishes/|title='Carnival' writer relishes film's rise from the dead}}</ref>\n\nPrints of ''Carnival of Souls'' vary in length from 78 minutes in theatrical release to 84 minutes in the original cut.

The remake has little in common with the 1962 film, borrowing little more than the revelation at the end. Sidney Berger, who had appeared in the original film as John Linden, appeared in a cameo in the remake. The remake followed the story of a young woman (Phillips) and her confrontation with her mother's murderer. The filmmakers had asked for Candace Hilligoss, the star of the first film, to also appear, but she declined, feeling that Clifford and the filmmakers of the remake had shown disrespect to her in initiating the film without consulting her or considering her treatment for a sequel to the 1962 version.{{sfn|Weaver|2011|pages=89\u201391}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Weaver|first=Tom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223083543/http://www.bmonster.com/profile18.html| title=Stolen Souls: Candace Hilligoss left out in the cold|work=The Astounding B Monster | archive-date=February 23, 2008|accessdate= December 10, 2011|url=http://www.bmonster.com/profile18.html}}</ref> The remake was marketed as ''[[Wes Craven]] Presents 'Carnival of Souls{{'}}''.
