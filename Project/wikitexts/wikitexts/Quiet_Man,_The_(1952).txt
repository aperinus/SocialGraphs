It stars [[John Wayne]], [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[Ward Bond]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. The screenplay by [[Frank S.

The film features [[Winton Hoch]]'s lush photography of the [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside and a long, climactic, semi-comic fist fight. It was an official selection of the 1952 [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\nJohn Ford won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], his fourth, and Winton Hoch won for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].

Current wordcount 639.--->\n[[File:Maureen O'Hara John Wayne from lobby card 4.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Kate ([[Maureen O'Hara]]) and Sean (John Wayne)]]\nIn the 1920s, Sean \"Trooper Thorn\" Thornton, an Irish-born retired [[Boxer (boxing)|boxer]], travels from [[Pittsburgh]] to his birthplace of Inisfree to purchase the old family farm.{{efn|The spelling of the fictional village \"Inisfree\" can vary in spelling in some film reviews and articles, often being cited \"Innisfree\". In the film, however, the public notices announcing the upcoming horse race are boldly printed \"INISFREE RACE MEET\".}} Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property's current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean's bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.\n\nSome village residents, including Father Peter Lonergan and local [[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]-cum-[[bookmaker]] Michaeleen \u00d3ge Flynn, {{efn|Michaeleen\u2019s full name includes \"\u00d3ge\", which in [[Comparison of Scottish Gaelic and Irish|Irish]] translates to \"young\" in English. \u00d3ge is used to distinguish between a father and his son with the same name, much in the manner that the suffixes \"Sr.\" and \"Jr.\" do in English.}} trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her [[dowry]] when he finds he was deceived. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture, but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry.\n\nMary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to local [[Protestant]] Minister and fellow former boxer, Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses (in [[Irish Gaelic]]) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage.\n\nHowever, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for [[Dublin]], hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the train station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|sigfig=1}} back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dower-money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom \"no fortune, no marriage\". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the \u00a3350 (over \u00a317,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by his defensive counter-punch.\n\nA donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]. This much-anticipated brawl attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate's home for supper, much to Mary Kate's amusement and delight.\n\nThe next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a [[jaunting car]] driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|\n* [[John Wayne]] as Sean Thornton\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Mary Kate Danaher\n* [[Barry Fitzgerald]] as Michaeleen \"\u00d3ge\" Flynn \n* [[Victor McLaglen]] as Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher\n* [[Ward Bond]] as Father Peter Lonergan\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as the Widow Sarah Tillane\n* [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]] as Dan Tobin\n* [[Arthur Shields]] as Rev.

It was also a departure for [[Republic Pictures]], which backed Ford in what was considered a risky venture at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} It was the only time the studio, known for low budget [[B-movie]]s, released a film that would receive an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for Best Picture.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFord read the story in 1933 and soon purchased the rights to it for $10.

They did, and after completing ''[[Rio Grande (1950 film)|Rio Grande]]'', they headed for Ireland to start shooting.\n\nOne of the conditions that Republic placed on Ford was that the film run under two hours. However, the finished picture was two hours and nine minutes. When screening the film for Republic executives, Ford stopped the film at approximately two hours in, on the verge of the climactic fistfight. Republic executives relented and allowed the film to run its full length.<ref>Maureen O'Hara with John Nicoletti.

Filming commenced on June 7, 1951.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} All of the outdoor scenes were shot on location in Ireland in [[County Mayo]] and [[County Galway]].

Many scenes for the film were actually shot in and around the village of [[Cong, County Mayo]], on the grounds of Cong's [[Ashford Castle]]. Cong is now a wealthy small town and the castle a 5-star luxury hotel. The connections with the film have led to the area becoming a tourist attraction. In 2008, a pub opened in the building used as the pub in the film (it had actually been a shop at the time when the movie was shot); the pub hosts daily re-runs of the film on DVD.<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/quiet-man-fans-can-sup-a-stout-in-the-filmrsquos-pub-13948528.html \"Quiet Man fans can sup a stout in the film's pub,\"] Belfast Telegraph, August 25, 2008.</ref> The Quiet Man Fan Club holds its annual general meeting in Ashford Castle.

The Catholic priest, Father Lonergan, and the Protestant minister, Reverend Playfair, maintain a strong friendly relationship throughout the film, which represented the norm in what was then the [[Irish Free State]], where religious tensions occurred in the 1930s but were the norm only in Northern Ireland.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} One of the allusions to Anglo-Irish animosity occurs after the happy couple is married and a congratulatory toast offered by Hugh Forbes expresses the wish that they live in \"national freedom\" (the term ''national'' has been censored from most editions)<ref name=\"Beach\"/> and before the final donnybrook when Thornton demands his wife's dowry from Danaher.

The melody of the \"Isle of Innisfree\", which is first heard over the opening credit sequence with [[Ashford Castle]] in the background, becomes the principal musical theme of ''The Quiet Man''. The melody is reprised at least eleven times throughout the film.\n\nThe upbeat melody comically hummed by Michaeleen Oge Flynn and later played on the accordion is the \"[[Rakes of Mallow]]\".\n\nA portion of the Irish version of \"[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]\" is played throughout the film.\n\nWhen Maureen O'Hara died in October 2015, her family stated she listened to music from ''The Quiet Man'' during her final hours.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/10/24/actress-maureen-ohara-dies-at-age-95/74536318/ \"Actress Maureen O'Hara dies at 95\"].
