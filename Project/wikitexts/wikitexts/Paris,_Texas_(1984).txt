The screenplay was written by [[L. M. Kit Carson]] and playwright [[Sam Shepard]], while the musical score was composed by [[Ry Cooder]]. The film is a [[Co-production (media)|co-production]] between companies in France and West Germany, and was shot in the United States by [[Robby M\u00fcller]].\n\nThe plot focuses on a vagabond named Travis (Stanton) who, after mysteriously wandering out of the desert in a [[dissociative fugue]], attempts to reunite with his brother (Stockwell) and seven-year-old son (Carson). After reconnecting with his son, Travis and the boy end up embarking on a voyage through the [[American Southwest]] to track down Travis' long-missing wife (Kinski).\n\nAt the [[1984 Cannes Film Festival]], it won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' from the official jury, as well as the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]. It went on to other honors and critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\nTravis Henderson walks alone through the [[West Texas]] desert in a [[fugue state]], before stumbling into a bar and losing consciousness. A German doctor examines him and determines he is [[muteness|mute]], but discovers he possesses a telephone number and calls it. The call is answered by Walt Henderson, Travis' brother from Los Angeles. Walt has not seen or had contact with Travis for four years, and agrees to travel to [[Terlingua, Texas]], to retrieve him. His French wife, Anne, is concerned about the matter, as they have informally adopted Travis' son Hunter, with Hunter's biological mother Jane also missing. Walt reaches Terlingua, and finds Travis wandering from the clinic where he was found. The two brothers begin driving back to Los Angeles. With Walt becoming increasingly frustrated with Travis' muteness, Travis finally utters the name \"Paris\", asking to go there. Walt mistakenly assumes he means [[Paris]], France. Farther down the road, Travis shows Walt a photograph of empty property in [[Paris, Texas]], which he had purchased, believing he was conceived in that town.\n\nThe brothers reach Los Angeles where Travis is reunited with Anne and Hunter. Hunter, aged seven, has very little memory of his father, and is wary of Travis until the family watches [[home movies]] from days when they were all together. Hunter realizes that Travis still loves Jane. As Hunter and Travis become reacquainted, Anne reveals to Travis that Jane has had contact with her, and makes monthly deposits into a bank account for Hunter. Anne has traced the deposits to a bank in [[Houston]]. Travis realizes he can possibly see Jane if he is at the Houston bank on the day of the next deposit, only a few days away. He acquires a cheap vehicle and borrows money from Walt. When he tells Hunter he is leaving, Hunter wishes to go with him, though he does not have Walt or Anne's permission.\n\nTravis and Hunter drive to Houston, while Hunter recounts the [[Big Bang]] and the [[History of Earth|origins of Earth]]. A couple of hours after arriving at the Houston bank, Hunter identifies his mother in a car, making a drive-in deposit. He calls for Travis via [[walkie-talkie]], and they follow her car to a [[peep-show]] club where she works. While Hunter waits outside, Travis goes in, finding the business has rooms with one-way mirrors, where clients converse with strippers via telephone. He eventually sees Jane, though she cannot see him, and leaves.\n\nThe next day, Travis leaves Hunter at the [[Le M\u00e9ridien|M\u00e9ridien Hotel]] in downtown Houston, with a message that he feels obliged to reunite mother and son, as he feels responsible for separating them in the first place. Travis returns to the peep show. Seeing Jane again, and with her seemingly unaware of who he is, he tells her a story, ostensibly about other people.\n\nHe describes a [[age disparity in sexual relationships|man and younger girl]] who meet, marry and have a child. When the child is born, the wife suffers from [[Maternity blues|postpartum blues]] and dreams of escaping from the family. The husband descends into [[alcoholism]] and becomes abusive, imprisoning her in the trailer they live in. After a failed attempt to escape, the man ties the woman to the trailer stove and goes to bed, dreaming of withdrawing to an unknown place \"without language or streets\" while his wife and child scream from the kitchen. He wakes up to find the trailer on fire and his family gone, and in despair runs for five days until leaving civilization entirely.\n\nJane realizes she is speaking with Travis, and that he is recounting the story of their relationship. He tells her that Hunter is in Houston and needs his mother. Jane has longed to be reunited with her boy, and that night, enters the hotel room where Hunter is waiting, while Travis watches from the parking lot. As Jane embraces Hunter, Travis climbs into his vehicle and drives away.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of their appearance\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Travis Henderson\n* Sam Berry as Gas Station Attendant\n* [[Bernhard Wicki]] as Doctor Ulmer\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Walt Henderson\n* [[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] as Anne Henderson\n* Claresie Mobley as Car Rental Clerk\n* [[Hunter Carson]] as Hunter Henderson<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/86267/Paris-Texas/ |title=Paris, Texas (1984) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=8 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906152343/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/86267/Paris-Texas/ |archive-date=6 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Viva (actress)|Viva]] as Woman on TV\n* Socorro Valdez as Carmelita\n* Edward Fayton as Hunter's Friend\n* Justin Hogg as Hunter (age 3)\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Jane Henderson\n* Tom Farrell as Screaming Man\n* [[John Lurie]] as Slater\n* Jeni Vici as Stretch\n* Sally Norvell as \"Nurse\" Bibs\n* [[Mydolls]] as Rehearsing Band<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/event/paris-texas-with-a-performance-by-mydolls-9638127 |title=Paris, Texas with a performance by Mydolls |last=de la Garza |first=Natalie |date=31 July 2017 |access-date=29 August 2017 |work=[[Houston Press]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830145542/http://www.houstonpress.com/event/paris-texas-with-a-performance-by-mydolls-9638127 |archive-date=30 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Schatzell Street - August 1978 (6457073233).jpg|thumb|Wenders went [[location scouting]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]].]]\nWest German director [[Wim Wenders]] had travelled to the United States and stated he wished \"to tell a story about America\".<ref name=\"Willemsen\">{{cite AV media |last1=Willemsen |first1=Roger |last2=Wenders |first2=Wim |date=2009 |title=Wim Wenders Questioned by Roger Willemsen |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref> The film is named for the Texas city of [[Paris, Texas|Paris]], but not set there in any scene.

Kolker|Robert Phillip Kolker]] and Peter Beickene wrote the film presents the U.S. as \"a fantasyland, a place of striking images, a [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] of desert and city\".{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=137}} Aside from the landscape, there are references to U.S. culture and film,{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=52}} and similarities to [[John Ford]]'s 1956 film ''[[The Searchers]]''.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=52}}{{sfn|Adam|2005|p=1133}}{{sfn|Edkins|Shapiro|Pin-Fat|2012|p=114}} Academic Roger Cook argued there is a connection between the character of Travis and his surroundings observable on the ride to California. The character gradually moves from the \"desolate\" to civilization, and Travis continually tries to break away from this difficult transition.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=124}} His vehicles of choice possibly also reflect his characterization, as his preferred rental car has a bump, and he switches to a clearly used 1958 [[Ford Ranchero]] for his return to Texas.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=124}}\n\n[[Thomas Elsaesser]] discussed how ''Paris, Texas'' fit in with Wenders' depiction of women, saying many of the travels in his filmography are to find a particular woman. In the case of ''Paris, Texas'', this is with the aim of \"escaping her 'now' in order to find her as she was 'then'\".{{sfn|Elsaesser|1997|p=246}} Kolker and Beickene commented on the lack of touch, or even \"emotional fulfillment\" between Travis and Jane at the end, aside from their faces merging in the glass and their discussions of their emotions.{{sfn|Kolker|Beicken|1993|p=134}}\n\nMarc Silberman examined how [[identity (social science)|personal identity]] is also a theme in the film, as the name \"Paris\" is deceptive, conjuring images of France but referring to Texas. This is evident in what Travis refers to as \"Daddy's joke\" about Travis' mother being from Paris, and his belief that he was conceived there causes him to believe going there will achieve [[self-realization]].{{sfn|Silberman|1995|pp=218\u2013219}} Elsaesser believed the ending signified Travis sending Hunter in his stead to reunite with Jane.{{sfn|Elsaesser|1997|p=248}} Elsaesser found this to be an example of a complicated system in which various characters see each other through fantasy, and remake each other as they desire.{{sfn|Elsaesser|1997|pp=252\u2013253}} Travis' father had seen his mother as a Parisian, and this became \"a sickness\".{{sfn|Silberman|1995|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\nCook opined that returning to the sanctuary of the road is Travis' response to having suffered the worst modern American experience, turning his son over to the boy's mother.{{sfn|Cook|1997|pp=125\u2013126}} Stan Jones suggested the story involves a European theory on perception, as Travis evolves as a character from the one who perceives, to a driving force, returning to perceiving, and then withdrawing. Jones quoted French critic [[Jean-Louis Comolli]]: \"Never passive, a spectator works\".{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=53}} The ending can also suggest hope for a fresh start for Jane and Hunter.{{sfn|Cook|1997|p=127}}  Wenders himself said it marked a beginning for the next chapter in his own filmography, explaining Travis' exit: \"This scene for me had a liberating effect ... I let him disappear in my own way, and all my previous male characters went with him.
