The relatively inexpensive process was used for all scenes depicting the surface of [[Mars]]. While CineMagic proved unsatisfactory for creating visually believable special effects for ''The Angry Red Planet'', producer [[Norman Maurer]] did reuse the process in 1962, although to a lesser extent, in the comedy film ''[[The Three Stooges in Orbit]]''.<ref>Wingrove, David. ''[[Science Fiction Film Source Book]]'' (Longman Group Limited, 1985).</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs the film opens, mission control personnel on Earth are monitoring the rocketship MR-1 (\"Mars Rocket 1\") as it approaches Earth orbit following the first crewed expedition to Mars. Personnel are surprised to see the ship on their monitors, for they believed that the vehicle had become lost or destroyed in space. Ground technicians are unable, though, to make contact with anyone on MR-1, so they guide the rocket by [[remote control]] to a safe Earth landing. Only two survivors of the original four-person crew are found in the ship: Dr. Iris Ryan ([[Naura Hayden]]) and Col. Tom O'Bannion ([[Gerald Mohr]]), whose entire right arm is covered with a strange green alien growth. The MR-1's mission to Mars is then recounted by Dr. Ryan as she also helps to find a cure for Col. O'Bannion's badly infected arm. In her debriefing, she reports in detail the crew's experiences while traveling to the Red Planet and exploring its surface. She describes their expedition in retrospect, as if it were currently happening.\n\nAfter MR-1 reaches Mars and its crew explores the planet's surface, Dr. Ryan is attacked by a [[carnivorous plant]], which Chief Warrant Officer Jacobs kills with his freeze-ray, which he calls \"Cleo\". The crew then encounters an immense bat-rat-spider-crab creature, at first mistaking its legs for trees. That creature is also blinded and repelled by Jacobs who, again, uses his ray gun. When the crew returns to their ship, they realize that their radio signals are being blocked and the MR-1 is unable to leave Mars due to a mysterious [[Force field (fiction)|force field]].\n\nO'Bannion next leads the crew to a Martian lake, where a city with high, impressive structures is visible on the other side, far in the distance. Crossing the water in an inflatable raft, they are stopped by a giant [[amoeba]]-like creature with a single spinning eye. They hurriedly retreat, the creature pursuing them. As they are entering their ship, the creature catches Jacobs and draws him inside the gelatinous body, soon absorbing him; it has also infected O'Bannion's arm. The creature envelops the ship and is expected to eventually develop acids to eat through it.\n\nO'Bannion leads them in rewiring the ship to electrify the outer hull, which drives the creature away after destroying parts of it, then they rewire the ship for lift-off. The three survivors manage to lift MR-1 off from the planet since the force field has somehow been deactivated. Unfortunately, Professor Gettell, the MR-1's designer, dies of an apparent heart attack caused by the extreme stresses of the ascent.\n\nOnce the MR-1 returns to Earth, O'Bannion's infected arm is cured by medical staff using electric shocks. Mission control technicians also examine the MR-1's data recorders from the expedition and find a recording of an alien voice, which announces that the ship's crew were allowed to leave Mars so that they could deliver a message to their home planet. The voice then states that \"we of Mars\" have been observing human development on Earth for many thousands of years and have determined that humanity's technology has far outpaced progress in cultural advancement. The alien then accuses humankind of invading Mars, warning that if future expeditions ever return to the Red Planet, then the Earth would be destroyed in retaliation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerald Mohr]] as Colonel Thomas O\u2019Bannion\n* [[Naura Hayden]] as Dr. Iris \"Irish\" Ryan\n* [[Les Tremayne]] as Professor Theodore Gettell\n* [[Jack Kruschen]] as Chief Warrant Officer Sam Jacobs\n* Paul Hahn as Major General George Treegar\n* [[J.

Retrieved September 16, 2018.</ref> Pink gave his treatment to Melchior after meeting him at a party. Melchior believed the project had potential, so he offered to help write the [[screenplay]] if Pink allowed him to direct the film. While Melchior worked on establishing a working script, Pink met Maurer, who was developing CineMagic, a \"revolutionary\" filming process for creating special effects by combining hand-drawn images with live action. However, it soon became apparent the process would not be able to deliver what had been promised with respect to the quality of its effects.<ref name=\"mark\">McGee, Mark (2016). ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures''. McFarland, pp. 161-168.</ref> \"The damn Cinemagic didn't work like it should\", Pink recalled. \"It was supposed to be sort of a 3-D effect. What we came up with was great anyway\".<ref name=\"pink\"/>\n\nThe production budget for ''The Angry Red Planet'' may have actually been significantly higher than the $200,000 cited by most film and press references. In its online catalog, the [[American Film Institute]] refers to a contemporary report in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that announced an increase in allotted funding for the project more than double the frequently given figure. AFI states, \"As noted in a ''HR'' news item, just prior to the start of production, the film's budget was raised from $250,000 to $500,000\".<ref name=\"AFI1\">[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/52814 \"The Angry Red Planet (1960)\"], details, catalog of the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI), Los Angeles, California. Retrieved December 18, 2018.</ref>\n\nComments made by Pink on the eve of filming provide some evidence regarding how little money was spent to design and build sets for the production. In an interview for a September 7, 1959 news item by ''[[Associated Press]]'' reporter and writer [[James Bacon (author)|James Bacon]], Pink is quoted about the extreme cost-cutting effectiveness of using the new CineMagic process: \"Our set for the planet Mars cost us a couple of hundred dollars instead of the thousands we had estimated\".<ref name=\"Bacon\">Bacon, James (1959). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19590907&id=iBosAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4MYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4491,763658 \"New Picture Process Made: The Latest Is Called The Cinemagic\"], ''The Florence Times'' (Florence, Alabama), September 7, 1959, section 2, page 3, column 2. Archives of [[Google News]] (news.google.com). Retrieved September 18, 2018.</ref> Pink also estimates in that interview that the movie \"will be made at half the original cost\",<ref name=\"Bacon\"/> confirming that ''Invasion of Mars'' (the film's working title before its release) was a low-budget project. The \"meager\" $200,000 production budget cited for ''The Angry Red Planet'' may therefore be a credible [[Ballpark estimate|ballpark]] figure.\n\nFilming for ''The Angry Red Planet'' began on September 9, 1959 at [[Hal Roach Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]], only a month after Melchior and Pink completed their final draft of the screenplay.<ref name=\"AFI1\"/><ref name=\"mark\"/>\n\n===CineMagic===\nThe CineMagic process was used to cast a red glow over scenes depicting the surface of Mars. The low-cost process made the actors look similar to cartoon drawings so they would fit in with low-budget, less realistic [[Theatrical scenery|sets]] and [[Theatrical property|props]].\n\nTo achieve this effect, a [[Black and white|black-and-white]] [[film negative]] was first processed with [[solarisation]] (a process which partially reverses the negative making some areas of the image appear positive). The resulting film was then [[Film tinting|tinted]] red. Making a film positive was not necessary. At the time ''The Angry Red Planet'' was produced, black and white film cost less than color film and processing. The combination of using black-and-white film for all scenes depicting Mars and not needing to produce a film positive lowered production costs for the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Bacon|title=New Picture Process Made|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19590907&id=iBosAAAAIBAJ&pg=4491,763658|work=Times Daily - Sep 7, 1959|publisher=Times Daily}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=David |first=Hayes |title=The Last Interview with Sid Pink |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-last-interview-sid-pink-467.html |publisher=Yahoo! |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728220449/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-last-interview-sid-pink-467.html |archivedate=2014-07-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[American International Pictures]] released the film in September 1960 with its original running time varying between 83 and 87 minutes.<ref name=\"AFI1\"/><ref name=\"MPD1\">Berns, Samuel D.

Berns was enthusiastic at the time about the production, calling it \"a stimulating experience in suspense and intrigue\".<ref name=\"MPD1\"/> He describes CineMagic in his review as \"a well-conceived optical effect for dramatic impact\", an element of the film that he predicts will draw \"big gross business\" to the box office.<ref name=\"MPD1\"/> Berns also compliments both forms of filming presented in ''The Angry Red Planet'', as well as its music:{{blockquote|Everything seen or experienced outside the space ship on Mars is depicted in the Cinemagic process to symbolize a concept of nature on another planet. The rest of the film's action and background is printed in the normal fashion.\n...Stanley Cortez delivered an expert job of camerawork, in marking the debut of the new Eastman 5250 Color, bringing into sharp focus the soft, effective color tones of the film.
