Screenwriter [[Nora Ephron]] co-scripted the story with [[Sam Simon]].<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite web |last=Borrelli |first=Christopher |title='Teen Wolf' director's brutally honest commentary |date=27 September 2011 |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-27/entertainment/ct-ent-0929-teen-wolf-director-20110927_1_tv-movies-teen-wolf-rod-daniel/2 |access-date=13 April 2015 }}</ref> ''The Super'' is the last film in which [[Vincent Gardenia]] appeared.\n\n==Plot==\nLouie Kritski is a heartless [[slumlord]] who was born into money, thanks to his ruthless father, \"Big Lou\" ([[Vincent Gardenia]]), also a slumlord. However, the tables turn on Louie when he's threatened with prison for his failure to keep his [[New York City]] [[slum]] up to code. The judge gives him another option, which he accepts: he must live in a vacant apartment of one of his own shoddy run-down apartment blocks until he brings it up to livable standards.\n\nThe sentence is an effective [[house arrest]]; Louie is not allowed to leave the apartment except for routine exercise, grocery shopping, medical emergencies and business relating to building repairs. In addition, Louie is not authorized to make any changes to the apartment he has been assigned unless all other apartments had the same upgrade beforehand. At first Louie is adamant that not one repair will be carried out, and will wait until his father bails him out. However, Louie has a change of heart after meeting and getting to know the building's residents, including a small-time hustler named Marlon ([[Ruben Blades]]), and a struggling street boy named Tito ([[Kenny Blank]]).\n\nOver time, Louie grows more sympathetic with their problems and makes amends for his greediness through actions such as donating [[space heater]]s to the tenants to help them cope with the [[winter]]. Unfortunately, Big Lou Kritski is the owner of the property in title, and he resists his son's entreaties to spend money to improve the tenements. When Louie confronts Big Lou who is about to [[arson|set fire to his own tenement]], all the residents appear on the roof to back up Louie. The film ends with Louie's building completely refurbished, Marlon becoming the new [[building superintendent|super]], and all the tenants gathered outside to see Louie off with a gift: his [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]\u2014which had been completely stripped of its parts shortly after he first arrived\u2014fully restored. A grateful Louie drives away as a large man appears and angrily demands to know who stole his car; all the tenants point in the direction in which Louie drove off in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Louie Kritski Jr.\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Lou \"Big Lou\" Kritski Sr.\n* [[Ruben Blades]] as Marlon\n* [[Madolyn Smith]] as Naomi Bensinger \n* [[Stacey Travis]] as Heather\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Irene Kritski\n* [[Kenny Blank]] as Tito\n* [[Steven Rodriguez]] as Pedro\n* [[Beatrice Winde]] as Leotha\n* Eileen Galindo as Linda Diaz\n* Pete Cody as Pete \"Fantastic Pete\", In 2A\n\nAccording to Rod Daniel, [[Chevy Chase]] was originally considered for the lead role.<ref name=\"chicago\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Super'' had a $22 million production budget.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} The film was a box-office failure, only grossing $11,000,863 domestically in its release.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title = The Super (1991) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=super.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date = September 10, 2020 }}</ref> It was also widely panned by critics in its theatrical release.
