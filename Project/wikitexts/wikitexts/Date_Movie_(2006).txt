It was released on February 17, 2006 by [[20th Century Fox]] and stars [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Adam Campbell (actor)|Adam Campbell]], [[Sophie Monk]], [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Eddie Griffin]], and [[Fred Willard]]. It is a parody of the romantic comedy film genre, and mostly references ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]],'' ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'', ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', ''[[Legally Blonde]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. ''Date Movie'' was panned by critics and has a 7% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], but was a box office success, grossing almost $85 million on a $20 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\nJulia Jones is an obese woman who dreams of marrying [[Napoleon Dynamite]], but even in her dreams, she is rejected. Writing in her diary, she thinks she will never find her true love. Julia goes outside and dances to impress men on the streets, but is unsuccessful. Julia goes to work at her father Frank's [[My Big Fat Greek Wedding|Greek diner]], where she meets and is instantly attracted to Grant Fockyerdoder. When Frank yells at Julia to get an order, she turns to respond and accidentally hits Grant over the head with the coffee pot she is holding, knocking him to the floor. She turns around only to find his table is suddenly empty and figures he ran away. Wanting help, Julia visits a love therapist, Hitch, who initially rejects her but reluctantly agrees to help her, taking her to a garage where she gets \"[[Pimp My Ride|pimped out]]\" and made slimmer.\n\nShe earns a spot on a reality television dating show called ''[[The Bachelor (U.S. TV series)|The Extreme Bachelor: Desperate Edition]]'', the bachelor turning out to be Grant, the man she met in the diner. Host Ty Andrews introduces Grant, who greets all the women and is asked to eliminate the losers, which he does by shooting them one by one. As the last woman standing, Julia is rewarded with dinner for two at a restaurant called \"A Restaurant\". After their meal, Julia and Grant venture to her apartment, where they have sex. Julia takes Grant to meet her parents.\n\nLater, Grant takes Julia to [[Tiffany & Co.]], where they turn on the lights to reveal the salespeople ready to let her pick whatever she wants. Grant then confesses he loves her and [[Proposal of marriage|proposes to her]]. Julia happily accepts. The couple then meets with Grant's parents, Bernie and Roz, who recommend they go see a wedding planner, after which Roz reveals that Grant lost his virginity to the housekeeper, Eduardo. Julia and Grant go to the wedding planner named Jell-O, who has massive buttocks. Julia stresses that she wants a traditional wedding, but Jell-O suggests that they go to a restaurant called Taco Butt, which they decline. However, she gets upset and tells them that's the best she can do on short notice. Grant tries to ease the awkward situation by saying he has a best man they will meet up with later, which relaxes Jell-O as she shows them what she has booked for the entertainment. Jell-O uses her butt to knock over her desk, then aggressively rips off her clothes to reveal a gold spandex bra and tights, shocking the couple and revealing that she is the wedding entertainment. She shows off her dance moves until she backs up to them as they scream in fear, while she joyfully crushes & smothers them with her butt, getting even on declining her earlier offer. Grant introduces Julia to his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Andy, who seemingly harbors no resentment towards Julia for marrying Grant, going so far as to help Julia shop for her wedding dress. At the dress store, Julia hits her head on a power box and finds that she can read people's thoughts. Julia finds from reading Andy's mind that she wants to get back together with Grant and plans to split the two of them up. Julia and Andy fight each other, ''[[Kill Bill]]''-style.\n\nOn the day of their wedding Julia arrives at the church late, she then witnesses Grant and Andy sharing a kiss (but Julia is unaware that Grant tried to reject Andy's desires to get back together with her) leaving Julia heartbroken. Since she cannot forgive Grant, Julia agrees to marry Nicky. Once at the altar with Nicky, Julia is regretting it and has flashbacks about her and Grant. Frank objects to the union and realizes he was wrong about Grant who liked her even when Julia was ugly, and he persuades her to go after Grant who is revealed to have waited for months. Julia journeys to meet him as he is leaving while tossing aside Andy who was pursuing him too. Julia arrives too late and sees Grant on the streets before she falls off the roof, though Grant conveniently catches her. They get back together and get married, with Hitch officiating and now dating Jell-O. Andy and Nicky meet at the wedding and fall in love. Meanwhile, Grant and Julia leave in a horse and carriage. Roz also gifts her with a vaginal thermometer which apparently has been in their family for generations and is regarded as good luck when kept unwashed.\n\nOn their honeymoon, Grant and Julia go to Skull Island and film a woman, Anne, tied to two pieces of wood. After [[King Kong]] rips off Anne's dress and gropes her, she says \"I like hairy boys\", and King Kong roars and flattens her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Julia Jones\n* [[Adam Campbell (actor)|Adam Campbell]] as Grant Fockyerdoder\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Frank Jones\n* [[Sophie Monk]] as Andy\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] as Hitch\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Bernie Fockyerdoder\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Roz Fockyerdoder\n* [[Meera Simhan]] as Linda Jones\n* [[Judah Friedlander]] as Nicky\n* [[Marie Matiko]] as Betty Jones\n* [[Valery Ortiz]] as [[Jennifer Lopez|Jell-O]]\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Anne\n* [[Mauricio Sanchez]] as Eduardo\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Farting Cat (Uncredited)\n* [[Beverly Polcyn]] as Old Cat Woman\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Ty Andrews\n* Jack Cortes as Danny Ricks\n* Tom Fitzpatrick as [[Gandalf]]\n* [[Tom Lenk]] as [[Frodo]] \n* [[Lil Jon]] as Himself\n* [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]] as [[Napoleon Dynamite]] / [[Owen Wilson]] from ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''\n* [[Edward Moss (impersonator)|Edward Moss]] as [[Michael Jackson]] (Moss reprises the role from ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'')\n* Nadia Dina Ariqat as [[Britney Spears]]\n* Nick Steele as [[Kevin Federline]]\n* Jasen Salvatore as [[Ben Stiller]]\n* Bridget Ann Brno as [[Bridget Jones]]\n}}\n\n==Parodies==\n{{Div col}}<!-- DO NOT ADD AN ITEM WITHOUT A CITATION TO A RELIABLE SOURCE.
