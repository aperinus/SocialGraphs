The screenplay by [[Andrea Gibb]] focuses on a young single mother whose love for her son prompts her to perpetuate a deception designed to protect him from the truth about his father.\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed and won numerous awards, including two [[BAFTA Scotland]] Awards.\n\n==Plot==\nLizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) and nine-year-old [[deafness|deaf]] son Frankie (Jack McElhone) frequently relocate to keep one step ahead of her abusive ex-husband and his family. They are accompanied by her opinionated, chain-smoking mother Nell. Newly relocated in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Greenock]], Lizzie accepts a job at the local [[fish and chips]] shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school.\n\nThrough a [[Glasgow]] post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] working on HMS ''Accra''. In reality, the letters he receives are written by his mother, who prefers to maintain the lie instead of telling him why she fled her marriage.\n\nWhen she learns that ''Accra'' will soon be arriving at the docks at Greenock, Lizzie in a panic concocts a scheme to hire a man to impersonate Davey. When her effort to find someone at the local pub fails, she enlists Marie's assistance. She arranges for her to meet an acquaintance who coincidentally is passing through town at the same time ''Accra'' will be in port. When Lizzie and the stranger (Gerard Butler) meet, he doesn't tell her his name. She explains the situation and gives him the letters for background. He agrees to spend a day with Frankie in exchange for the small amount Lizzie can offer him.\n\nWhen the stranger arrives at their home to pick up the boy, he brings with him a book about marine life (to Lizzie's surprise), one of Frankie's passions, and a bond is forged immediately. They spend a day together (with Lizzie secretly following them), collecting on Frankie's bet at a soccer match from a school mate, ordering chips, and later in the evening setting up another half-day visit.\n\nThe second day is magical, ending with a nice evening at a dance, as Frankie wins another bet by getting Lizzie and the stranger to dance together. Afterwards, they walk together to get around the \"discuss no past\" ground rules, and she tells the stranger Frankie's deafness\u2014a \"present from his daddy\"\u2014and her reason for leaving her husband. She explains the letters from Frankie are so important to her because it is how she \"hears\" her son. The stranger tells her she is a great mother for protecting Frankie. Returning home, Frankie gives the stranger a hand-carved wooden seahorse as a parting gift. At the door, after a long pause together, Lizzie and the stranger kiss goodbye. After he leaves, she discovers he has returned her payment, stuffed into her coat pocket.\n\nSometime later, Lizzie learns that her husband is terminally ill, and reluctantly visits the hospital without Frankie. She experiences her husband's angry fury again, when he demands to see Frankie. Later when she tells Frankie that his dad is really sick, he writes him a note and draws him a picture. On a second visit, she delivers them to her husband, along with a snapshot of Frankie. Davey's death brings peace to them all.\n\nLizzie asks Marie about the stranger and she learns he is Marie's brother. Frankie's last letter shows that he has known the truth for a while\u2014that the stranger was not his real dad. He knows too that Lizzie is sad, but she has him for support. The letter also indicates that Frankie intends to carry on with his life, telling about his real dad passing, his friends and their gold stars in school, and getting onto the reserve [[association football|football]] team. He closes the letter by saying he hopes the stranger will visit again.\n\nLizzie finds Frankie sitting at end of a pier, and they enjoy a quiet moment together, looking out to sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Lizzie\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as The Stranger\n* [[Jack McElhone]] as Frankie\n* Sean Brown as Ricky\n* [[Mary Riggans]] as Nell\n* [[Sharon Small]] as Marie\n* [[Cal Macaninch]] as Davey\n* Sophie Main as Serious Girl\n* Katy Murphy as Miss MacKenzie\n* [[Jayd Johnson]] as Catriona\n* Anna Hepburn as Headmistress\n{{col-2}}\n* Rony Bridges as Post Office Clerk\n* Douglas Stewart Wallace as Stamp Shop Keeper\n* Elaine M.

The screenplay originated as a script for a 15-minute [[Short subject|short]] submitted to producer [[Caroline Wood]], who had requested writing samples from potential screenwriters for what would be Auerbach's film debut after several years of directing [[Television advertisement|commercials]]. Auerbach was so enamored with Andrea Gibb's work she convinced her to expand it to [[feature film|feature]] length.\n\n===Casting===\nThe production design by Jennifer Kernke and palette of colors used throughout the film were inspired by paintings created by the Glasgow Boys and Glasgow Girls, [[Glasgow School]] collectives whose artwork featured prosaic scenes of the Scottish countryside.<ref name=\"tribeca\">{{cite web|title=Dear Frankie |publisher=Tribeca Film Festival |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Dear_Frankie.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204172143/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Dear_Frankie.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[Jack McElhone]] was among the first group of boys Auerbach auditioned for the role of Frankie. She continued to see about one hundred more but was unable to find any who captured the essence of the character, as she perceived it, more impressively than he did. The role of the character listed as The Stranger in the credits, although he is addressed as Louis in one scene, still had not been cast just prior to the scheduled start of filming. When Auerbach met [[Gerard Butler]], she instinctively knew he was perfect for the role and immediately offered it to him without having him read for her.\n\n===Filming locations===\n''Dear Frankie'' was filmed on location in Scotland.\n* Buchanan Street Stamps, Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland\n* Film City Glasgow, Govan, Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland\n* Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland\n* Greenock, Inverclyde, Scotland<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Filming locations for Dear Frankie |publisher=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377752/locations |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in May 2004.

What eventually happens, while not entirely unpredictable, benefits from close observation, understated emotions, unspoken feelings, and the movie's tact ...

Director Shona Auerbach doesn't rush anything in her remarkably accomplished first feature film. [She] has resurrected Butler's career ... and gotten an unforgettable performance from Mortimer ...

[She has] a firm command of the visual medium and an equally strong rapport with actors ... Auerbach and screenwriter Andrea Gibb spin a touching story that never descends into schmaltz despite ample potential. The film is anchored in part by its setting in the kind of milieu more common to classic British [[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen-sink dramas]] or the films of [[Ken Loach]] than to anything this emotionally tender. Enriched by subtle notes of humor, the intimate story is powered by well-drawn relationships and finely shaded characters. Not only the family bonds but also those of friendship and tentative romance are traced with delicate economy and nuance.\"<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite magazine|last=Rooney |first=David |title=Dear Frankie |magazine=Variety |date=3 May 2004 |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117923739?refcatid=31&printerfriendly=true |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nCarina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated the film \"nestles comfortably in that Scottish-[[Celt]]ic niche of cozy, overcast, [[Working class|working-class]] [[fairy tale]]s that seem to smell faintly of fried fish and beer ... Not that ''Dear Frankie'' aspires to any kind of hardened realism. On the contrary, it caters to a particular type of Anglophile fantasy, the kind where the china doesn't match and the chintz is dingy, but people look out for one another and love sprouts easily in the humidity ... [Its] surprises are few and low-key, but the story wraps up nicely. In that way, the movie is not unlike the fish dinners Frankie ... procures from Marie - slightly soggy and bland, but as warm, starchy and satisfying as a box of fries.\"<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news|last=Chocano |first=Carina |title=A working-class heartwarmer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 March 2005 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/04/entertainment/et-frankie4 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'', Steve Persall graded the film B and added, \"Auerbach and screenwriter Andrea Gibb handle these circumstances with such understated grace that sap becomes special. Not perfect, but deeper, more affecting than U.S. moviegoers are accustomed to seeing. It's easy to guess what happens, but we're hooked anyway. A last-reel twist almost spoils the effect; we're waiting for something to go wrong with such a delicate story.
