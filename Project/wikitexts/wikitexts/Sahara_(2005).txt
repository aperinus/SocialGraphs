It stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Steve Zahn]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], and follows a treasure hunter who partners with a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] doctor to find a lost [[American Civil War]] [[Ironclad warship]] in the [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nThe film was shot in 2003 on-location in Morocco as well as in the United Kingdom. It became notable for its many production issues, including doubling its production budget from $80 million to $160 million, lawsuits among the crew, and being accused of several violations of international law. ''Sahara'' grossed $119&nbsp;million worldwide at the box-office, ultimately failing to recoup all of its costs and is often listed among the [[List of biggest box-office bombs|biggest box-office failures]] of all-time.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1865, at the [[conclusion of the American Civil War]], [[Richmond, Virginia]] is in ruins. The [[CSS Texas (1865)|CSS ''Texas'']], captained by Mason Tombs, is loaded with the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]'s [[Confederate gold|gold]] to keep it from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces. It then disappears into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nIn present day [[Mali]], there is a civil war between dictator General Kazim and the [[Tuareg people]]. In Nigeria, [[World Health Organization|WHO]] doctors Eva Rojas and Frank Hopper investigate a disease affecting people who have been in Mali. Zakara, a corrupt Tuareg, tries to murder Eva, but she is rescued by [[Dirk Pitt]], from the [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]], who was diving nearby.\n\nDirk gets a gold Confederate coin found in the [[Niger River|Niger]]. A clue to the long-lost ''Texas'', Dirk borrows his boss Sandecker's yacht to search for it. His partner Al Giordino and Rudi Gunn from NUMA accompany him. They first transport Eva and Hopper to Mali so they can continue investigating the disease, then continue up the Niger.\n\nBusinessman Yves Massarde and dictator General Kazim try to stop the doctors from discovering the source of the disease. Kazim sends men to attack the yacht. Dirk, Al, and Rudi survive, but the yacht is destroyed. Rudi leaves to get help while Dirk and Al go to rescue the doctors.\n\nKazim's men track down the doctors and kill Hopper. Dirk and Al rescue Eva. As they are leaving Mali, they are captured by the Tuareg insurgents. Convincing the group that they are hunted by Kazim, their leader, Modibo, shows Eva his people dying from the disease she is following. She finds out water contains toxins, and there is no treatment available. Al stumbles into a cave with a painting showing the ironclad ''Texas''. Dirk believes that the ''Texas'' became stranded when the river dried up and the same river that carried the ship now runs underground.\n\nFollowing the river bed to the border, they stumble upon Massarde's [[Concentrated solar power|solar]] plant, the source of the contamination. The chemicals are seeping slowly towards the ocean, where they will expand rapidly upon entering [[salt water]] and kill [[ocean life]] worldwide. The US government won't intervene during a civil war in a sovereign country. Massarde and Zakara capture them, keep Eva, and send Dirk and Al in a truck to Kazim. They escape in the middle of the desert. Rebuilding a plane wreck into a [[land sailing|land yacht]], they leave the desert.\n\nDirk and Al return to the plant, with Modibo's help. To cover up the existence of the waste, Massarde plans to destroy it with explosives. Fearing the plant's destruction would guarantee worldwide water contamination, Al goes to remove the explosives while Dirk tries to rescue Eva. Dirk kills Zakara after a vicious fight, but Massarde escapes via helicopter. Al successfully neutralizes the explosive, angering Massarde.\n\nThe three leave the plant in an [[Avions Voisin]] C-28, and Kazim pursues them in an attack helicopter, with his army following. A series of explosions along the dry river bed reveals the wreckage of the ''Texas''. The trio hides in the ship, using its cannon to destroy Kazim and his helicopter, killing him. Modibo arrives with Tuareg reinforcements, forcing Kazim's army to surrender and end the civil war.\n\nThe plant is shut down, stopping the source of toxic waste, and the rest is dealt with. Sandecker agrees to work covertly for the US government in exchange for NUMA funding. The ''Texas'' gold, technically belonging to the Confederate States of America, is left with Modibo's people. It is implied that Massarde is poisoned by Carl, an undercover US agent, while Dirk and Eva start a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Dirk Pitt]]\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Al Giordino\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Eva Rojas\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as Yves Massarde\n* [[Lennie James]] as [[Brigadier General]] Zateb Kazim\n* [[William H.

One 46-second action sequence cost $2 million to film but ended up not making the final cut. McConaughey was paid $8 million, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz was paid $1.6 million, and Rainn Wilson was paid $45,000. A total of 10 screenwriters were used to polish the script, with four eventually receiving credit, which added $3.8 million to the film's budget; [[David S. Ward]] made $500,000 for his uncredited work.\n\n==Costs and bribery allegations==\nInitially green-lit with a production budget of $80 million, costs rose to $100 million by the time shooting started and had ballooned to $160 million by the time production wrapped,<ref name=\"LATBunting041507\"/> with a further $61&nbsp;million in distribution expenses.  In 2014, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' listed the film as one of the [[box office bomb|most expensive flops of all time]].<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-box-office-flops-pictures,0,7165703.photogallery#axzz2tJcnZf9r Eller, Claudia,\"The costliest box office flops of all time], ''Los Angeles Times'' (January 15, 2014)</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' presented an extensive special report on April 15, 2007, dissecting the budget of ''Sahara'' as an example of how Hollywood movies can cost so much to produce and fail. Many of the often closely held documents had been leaked after a lawsuit involving the film. Among some of the items in the budget were bribes to the Moroccan government, some of which may have been legally questionable under American law.<ref name=\"LATBunting041507\"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sahara.sp,0,456381.special | title =  Sahara: Budget melts in the desert | work = Los Angeles Times | date = April 15, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070421195817/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sahara.sp,0,456381.special |archive-date=April 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Marketing ==\nTo promote the film, actor [[Matthew McConaughey]] drove his own Airstream trailer (painted with a large ''Sahara'' movie poster on each side) across America, stopping at military bases and many events such as the [[2005 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] (to Grand Marshal the race), premiering the movie to fans, signing autographs, and doing interviews at each stop.<ref name=CNN>{{cite web|title=McConaughey's elusive quest: Actor attempts to grab box-office glory with 'Sahara'|author=Snipes, Stephanie|date=April 14, 2005|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/11/mcconaughey.sahara/|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The trip's highlights were shown on an [[E!]] channel special to coincide with the film's release.
