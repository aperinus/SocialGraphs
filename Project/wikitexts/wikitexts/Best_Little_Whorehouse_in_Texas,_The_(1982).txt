Illegal or not, Ed Earl does not interfere with her business, which has been a fixture of the town going back to before World War I.\n\nOccasionally interrupted by Deputy Fred Wilkins, the narrator, Ed Earl and Miss Mona have a pleasant arrangement as secret lovers. Almost everyone in town approves of Miss Mona, a public-minded citizen who regularly donates to charity and is decent and law-abiding except in her line of work.\n\nMayor Rufus P. Poindexter and insurance salesman/local townsman C.J. Vernon inform Ed Earl that altruistic consumer advocate and television personality Melvin P. Thorpe, originally from New Jersey, announces his intention to do an expos\u00e9 about the Chicken Ranch. Visiting Thorpe in his Houston studio, Ed Earl is shocked by Thorpe's live telecast, in which Thorpe sensationalizingly reveals to a huge audience, \"Texas has a whorehouse in it.\" He later compounds the problem by insulting and threatening Thorpe in the town square after Thorpe comes to town and accuses him of taking payoffs and bribes for not cracking down on Miss Mona's business, all caught on TV.\n\nThe Chicken Ranch is an institution, one where the winning team of the football game between state rivals the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M Aggies]] traditionally comes to \"celebrate\" its victory. Thorpe's negative publicity puts a spotlight on the place, so Ed Earl asks Miss Mona to shutter the property until the TV attention subsides in two months. She closes the bordello to her regular customers, but elects to allow the football players have their victory party. Thorpe and his TV cameras infiltrate the property, break into the house, and catch the Aggies and a State Senator on tape in mid-debauch. Ed Earl and Miss Mona quarrel, punctuated by him calling her \"a whore\", and then bitterly break up.\n\nThe Governor of Texas, who cannot decide on any issue until he first sees what voters say in opinion polls, listens to Ed Earl's eloquent appeal to keep the Chicken Ranch open. However, when the polls say a bare majority of Texans disapprove of the place, he orders Ed Earl to close it down. The working girls sadly leave the Chicken Ranch immediately and permanently. Miss Mona is disconsolate, at least until learning what Ed Earl did for her to attempt to keep it open.\n\nAs Miss Mona is departing the whorehouse for the last time, Ed Earl stops her and proposes. She turns him down, knowing that having a wife who had once run a whorehouse would hurt his chances of running for the state legislature. He insists that he wants to marry her, regardless of what people will think or say. To drive his point home, he picks up Miss Mona like a bridegroom, installs her in the passenger seat of the pickup, and drives away.\n\nIn an epilogue, Deputy Fred, who succeeded Ed Earl as the Sheriff, states that Ed Earl and Miss Mona married and that Ed Earl successfully ran for the legislature, becoming a State Senator.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd\n* [[Dolly Parton]] as Mona Stangley\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Melvin P.

King and Peter Masterson were going to write the screenplay and Masterson and [[Tommy Tune]], who had directed the stage production, were to direct the film together. King recommended [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Dyan Cannon]], Cari Glynn and [[Jill Clayburgh]] as the possibles to star but was told they were not a sufficient box office draw.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\nWhen [[Dolly Parton]] was cast King suggested [[Willie Nelson]] as a co-star and Universal executives met with him but at the end [[Burt Reynolds]] was cast. Reynolds was paid $3.5 million and Parton $1.5 million.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\nReynolds wanted script changes and wanted to sing. Universal became nervous about giving the film to first-time directors and ended up replacing Masterson and Tune with Colin Higgins.<ref name=\"king\">{{cite news|title=What a round-up! Roping Dolly and Burt, bringing 'Whorehouse' to the screen|last=King|first= Larry L. |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=8 July 1982|page=d20}}</ref>\n\nReynolds later said Parton \"had two directors fired before we started \u2013 they were gone. Because I'd made so many movies and she hadn't, everyone thought it was me. Whether she was right or wrong in those decisions, it was amazing to me that she could do it.\"<ref name=\"rap\">{{cite news|title=REYNOLDS RAP|author=Scott, Jay|work=The Globe and Mail|date=27 June 1987|page=E.1}}</ref>\n\nHiggins prepared for directing it by watching old [[George Cukor]] films and [[Dr. Pepper]] commercials (\"They have a lot of wonderful movement\", said Higgins.<ref>{{cite news|title=HIGGINS: WRITER-DIRECTOR ON HOT STREAK|author=Goldstein, Patrick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Jan 24, 1981|page=b15}}</ref>)\n\nReynolds said he suggested to Higgins that Charles Durning be cast. \"Colin is very smart, very commercial. They wanted [[Mickey Rooney]], so I manipulated him a little. I told Colin, 'Mickey Rooney is a wonderful actor, but everyone knows that. You won't get any credit. Charles Durning can sing and dance and no one knows it, so you'll get all the credit.' \"<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe book of the play was restructured to make it a vehicle for Parton and Reynolds.\n\nThe plot is basically the same as that of the [[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas|stage production]], with one significant difference. In the original, Ed Earl and Miss Mona had a one-night stand 15 years earlier, but in the film, they maintain an ongoing affair.\n\nThe relationship in the film brings about not only the accusatory scene, when the sheriff&mdash;disappointed that Mona has broken her promise to close the Chicken Ranch down long enough for things to cool off&mdash;calls her a whore, but also the happy ending, when he proposes marriage to Mona, even though that might endanger his chances to be elected as a state legislator; the epilogue comments state that he is elected anyway.\n\n===Filming===\nParton described her experience as \"a nightmare.\"<ref>''Dolly on Dolly: Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton''. ed. Randy L. Schmidt</ref> For his part, Reynolds described Parton as \"very self-deprecating, at least in public.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/movie-news/burt-reynolds-james-bond/|title=Burt Reynolds: I was asked to be James Bond|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=November 19, 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{See also|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (soundtrack)}}\nMuch of [[Carol Hall]]'s original Broadway score was performed in the adaptation. Eight songs, \"Girl, You're a Woman\", \"Twenty-Four Hours of Lovin'\", \"Doatsy Mae\", \"The Anglette March\", \"The Bus from Amarillo\", \"No Lies\", \"Good Old Girl\" and \"Finale\", were omitted. Two additional Parton compositions appear in the film: \"Sneakin' Around\", performed as a duet with Parton and Reynolds, and a two-[[stanza]] rendition of Parton's 1973 composition \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\". The film version of \"I Will Always Love You\" \u2014 the original recording had been a U.S. country chart-topper for Parton in the spring of 1974 \u2014 was released as a single in July 1982, and again reached number one on the U.S. country singles chart. It was also a mid-level hit on Billboard pop and adult contemporary charts. An altered version of Hall's \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\", in which Parton sings both the chorus and the verses of the song (as opposed to the film, which is partially sung by the brothel ladies), was also released as a single, reaching the top ten on the country singles chart in late 1982.\n\nParton wrote several new songs that were filmed but ultimately unused, including \"A Gamble Either Way\" and \"Where Stallions Run\". The former was restored for the ABC network television broadcast, as the film was too short for its time slot after the censors finished their edits and additional material was needed. \"A Gamble Either Way\" replaced \"Girl, You're a Woman\" and was sung by Parton after Mona interviewed \"Shy\" (Andrea Pike) for a job at the Chicken Ranch. The characters of Shy and Angel from the Broadway show were significantly reduced in the film; their footage was eventually edited out. \"Down at the Chicken Ranch\" was written for the trailer. Parton recorded two of the deleted songs, \"A Gamble Either Way\" and \"A Cowboy's Ways\" (a reworking of \"Where Stallions Run\"), and included them on her 1983 album ''[[Burlap & Satin]].''\n\n;Musical numbers\n# \"20 Fans\"\n# \"A Lil' Ole Bitty Pissant Country Place\"\n# \"Sneakin' Around\"\n# \"Watchdog Report\"\n# \"Texas Has a Whorehouse in It\"\n# \"Texas Has a Whorehouse in It\" (reprise)\n# \"The Aggie Song\"\n# \"Courtyard Shag\" (instrumental)\n# \"The Sidestep\"\n# \"The Sidestep/Texas Has a Whorehouse in It\" (reprise)\n# \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\"\n# \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\"\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nThe film presented some difficulties for Universal, particularly with advertising. In 1982, the word \"[[whorehouse]]\" was considered [[Obscenity|obscene]] in parts of the United States, resulting in the film being renamed ''The Best Little Cathouse in Texas'' in some print ads, while television ads were either banned outright in some areas, or the offending word was censored; on [[WXYZ-TV]] in [[Detroit]], the announcer on the station's \"Now Showing\" segment merely clicked his tongue to eliminate the offending word: \"The Best Little [click, click] in Texas!\" In Canada, the title was generally left alone in print, but televised trailers used a [[bleep censor]] over the word. During interviews, Parton sometimes referred to the film as ''The Best Little Chicken House in Texas''.\n\n===Box office===\n''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' opened in 1,400 theaters on July 23, 1982 and earned $11,874,268 in its opening weekend, ranking number one in the United States box office, dethroning ''[[E.T.

Porn star [[Kay Parker]], who played one of the prostitutes in the film, had an uncredited bit role in ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas''.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe house used in the film is located at [[Universal Studios]] in Hollywood and can be viewed as part of the backlot tram tour. The inspiration for the set came from a real ranch house located outside [[Austin, Texas]], which is featured in scenes from the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/chickenranch.shtml|title=The Chicken Ranch|work=TheStudioTour.com|access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe house was shown in the ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' television series episode \"The Lost Boys\".\n\nThe house was also featured in [[Rob Zombie]]'s 2003 horror film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.\n\nThe film was mentioned in an episode of ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', where Dr. Venture mistakes it for a pornographic film, given its \"racy\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDCgSP5QoOI| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618161620/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDCgSP5QoOI| archive-date=2017-06-18 | url-status=dead|title=Dolly Parton's Racy Flick &#124; The Venture Bros. &#124; Adult Swim|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Further reading\n* Hall, Carol.
