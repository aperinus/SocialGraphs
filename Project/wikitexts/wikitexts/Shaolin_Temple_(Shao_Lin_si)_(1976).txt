It is one of the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin Temple]] themed [[martial arts film]]s and concerns their rebellion against the Qings, with an all-star cast featuring the second and third generations of Chang Cheh's stable of actors including [[David Chiang]], [[Ti Lung]], [[Alexander Fu Sheng]] and [[Chi Kuan Chun]], as well as cameo appearances by several of the actors that would later become collectively known as the Venoms mob. The film serves as a pseudo prequel to ''[[Five Shaolin Masters]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with the chief Shaolin Monks realizing that time is not on their side and they must train more fighters to fight the [[Qing]]s. The monk Hai Hsien (Shan Mao) opposes this as he is secretly working for the court. Outside many men are sitting in front of the temple waiting to be accepted in, [[Fong Sai-yuk|Fang Shih Yu]] (Alexander Fu Sheng), Ma Chao-hsing (Tony Liu) and others, as the temple tests the will of potential students by making them wait outside for days, eventually the two are accepted in for \"training\". Fang Shih Yu becomes frustrated immediately as Shaolin methods of teaching martial arts are rather obscure, although Ma Chao-hsing begins learning the five animal styles from the start.\n\nElsewhere, escaped Ming soldiers Tsai Te-cheng (Ti Lung), Hu Te-ti (David Chiang), Yen Yung-chun (Szu Shih), and Ma Fu Yi (Wang Lung Wei) arrive close to Shaolin looking for a place to hide from the Qing. Hu Te-ti suggests they go to Shaolin and they are instantly accepted, which frustrates three more students trying to get acceptance into the temple, Lin Kwong Yao (Kuo Chui), Huang Sung Han (Lee I Min), and Hu Hui Chien (Kuan-Chun Chi). The three are eventually accepted and begin their obscure training. Tsai Te-cheng learns the [[wing chun]] style from a strange female monk and Hu Te-ti learns the iron whip. This forces Hai Hsein to secretly go to the court and report to Prince Hoo (Lu Feng) that Shaolin has been training new fighters.\n\nThe Qing scheme to destroy Shaolin. Hai Hsein returns to Shaolin looking to recruit more traitors to set up the temple for a raid. All the accepted students become close friends and proficient in their kung fu, except for Fang Shih Yu (who is unknowingly learning tiger boxing but is impatient). He keeps getting into fights with Ma Fu Yi, who is disgruntled with being at Shaolin. A mysterious figure at night (perhaps his friend Ma Chao-sing) begins teaching Fang Shih Yu the tiger-crane style and he defeats Ma Fu Yi in a friendly spar. This sparks the curiosity of Hai Hsein as he takes Ma Fu Yi under his wing and recruits him as a traitor. Things begin to go sour at the temple due to the treachery of Hai Hsein and Ma Fu Yi and it is eventually attacked by thousands of Qing soldiers, and an all-out battle occurs at Shaolin Temple with only eight Shaolin devotees escaping the ensuing massacre.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Chiang]] \u2013 Hu Te-Ti\n* [[Ti Lung]] \u2013 Tsai Te-Cheng \n* [[Yueh Hua]] \u2013 Li Se Kai \n* [[Wang Chung (actor)|Wang Chung]] \u2013 Fang Ta Hung \n* [[Tony Liu]] \u2013 Ma Chao-Hsing \n* [[Wang Lung Wei]] \u2013 Ma Fu Yi\n* [[Alexander Fu Sheng]] \u2013 Fang Shih-Yu ([[Fong Sai-yuk]])\n* [[Chi Kuan Chun|Kuan Chun Chi]] \u2013 Hu Hui Chien \n* Frankie Wei Hung \u2013 Hung Hsi-Kuan\n* [[Kuo Chui]] \u2013 Lin Kwong-Yao\n* Lee Yi-Min \u2013 Huang Sung Han \n* Tang Yen-Tsan \u2013 Chu Tao\n* Shan Mao \u2013 Shaolin monk Hai Hsein\n* [[Chiang Sheng]] \u2013 Shaolin monk Man Yue\n* [[Shih Szu]] \u2013 Yen Yung-Chun\n* [[Ku Feng]] \u2013 King Man Kuei\n* [[Lu Feng]] \u2013 General Hu Pei-Chi \n* Tsai Hung \u2013 General Ching\n* Wong Ching \u2013 General Shin\n* [[Lo Mang]] \u2013 Junior monk \n* Wei Pai \u2013 Junior monk (slain by Manchu archers)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0075202|Shaolin Temple}}\n* {{AllMovie title|id=133174|title=Shaolin Temple}}\n\n{{Chang Cheh}}\n\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:1976 action films]]\n[[Category:1976 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chang Cheh]]\n[[Category:Films set in 18th-century Qing dynasty]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:1970s Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:Prequel films]]\n[[Category:Shaw Brothers Studio films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong prequel films]]\n[[Category:1970s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
