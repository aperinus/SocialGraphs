The film was the first motion picture concerning [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]] that was given permission to film on location.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=October 2015}}\nIn 1936, golfer [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], while traveling to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], makes a stop in [[Scotland]] to visit the [[Old Course at St. Andrews]]. Anxious about his reception, he is warmly welcomed by many spectators, some of whom have closed their local shops for the day to watch him play.\n\nThe scene changes to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where Jones, a young boy, observes his father \"Colonel\" Jones playing golf, poorly. The more young Bobby watches, the more he emulates the better players he sees, such as [[Stewart Maiden]], a club professional originally from Scotland. By the time he is 14, Jones wins the 1916 Georgia State Amateur Championship and makes the quarterfinals of the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] that same year. Notable sportswriters of the era such as O.B. Keeler and [[Grantland Rice]] take a keen interest in him.\n\nWith [[World War I]] coming to an end, Jones participates in war-relief matches with several famous golfers such as the colorful [[Walter Hagen]], who eventually becomes Bobby's chief rival on the course. He also attends [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], where he receives a diploma and meets Mary Malone, whom he ultimately marries. Despite his great skill as a golfer, he also has a hot temper that affects his game and reputation. His first time at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St. Andrews]], in [[1921 Open Championship|1921]], Jones walks off the course after 11 holes of the third round, expressing his dislike for the course. His idol [[Harry Vardon]], who would win [[The Open Championship]] six times during his career, cautions Bobby never to quit, particularly at St. Andrews, which he considers the greatest golf course of all.\n\nIn 1923, Jones finally overcomes his temper troubles and wins his first major championship at the [[1923 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], defeating [[Bobby Cruickshank]] in a playoff. In the following years, great success follows as Bobby wins 2 more U.S. Opens, 4 U.S. Amateurs, and 2 Open Championships through 1929. During that timeframe, Jones attends [[Harvard College]] and later [[Emory University School of Law]], becoming a lawyer by profession (which was his grandfather's wish), never turning professional as a golfer. By 1930, Jones begins to lose interest in tournament golf. He tells Mary his final goal is to win all 4 majors in the same year and will then retire. That year, Jones accomplishes that goal, becoming the first and still only golfer to win the calendar [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]]. Soon after, Bobby keeps his word and he shocks the sports world by retiring from tournament golf at only 28 years old.\n\nA title card reveals that after retirement, Jones would continue to make contributions to the game of golf such as founding the [[Augusta National Golf Club]] and [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. He served in the [[United States Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. In 1948, Jones was diagnosed with [[syringomyelia]] which crippled him for the rest of his life until his death in 1971.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] \u2013 [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Robert Tyre \"Bobby\" Jones, Jr.]]\n** [[Devon Gearhart]] \u2013 young Bobby\n**[[Bubba Lewis]] \u2013 teenage Bobby\n* [[Claire Forlani]] \u2013 Mary Malone Jones\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] \u2013 [[Walter Hagen]]\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] \u2013 O.B.
