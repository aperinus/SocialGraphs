Otherwise, he will lose his job. The customer is the obtusely nagging and prickly accountant Arturo Filini, who suffers from heavy nearsightedness and does not realize that the manor he is interested in is actually [[Count Dracula]]'s castle. \n\nOnce on the spot, Fracchia is terrified at the going-ons while Filini, in true [[Mister Magoo]]-style, dismisses them as 'tricks' to dissuade him from the estate deal. Meanwhile, a young and attractive [[vampire hunter]] ([[Isabella Ferrari]]) arrives. She is determined to avenge her brother's death, who perished trying to rid the world of Dracula and his cohorts. The events turn even more farcical when Dracula's sister confesses her love for Fracchia to try to avoid being engaged to the [[Frankenstein Monster]]. In the end an ash-tipped umbrella seems to solve the situation, but...was it all for real or just a horror-film fueled nightmare?\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Paolo Villaggio]] as Giandomenico Fracchia\n* [[Edmund Purdom]] as Count Vlad / Dracula\n* [[Gigi Reder]] as Ragionier Filini\n* [[Ania Pieroni]] as Countess Oniria\n* [[Giuseppe Cederna]] as Boris\n* [[Isabella Ferrari]] as Luna\n* [[Susanna Martinkov\u00e1]] as Catarina\n* [[Romano Puppo]] as the Frankenstein Monster\n* [[Filippo De Gara]] as butler of Dracula \n* [[Federica Brion]] as Stefania\n* [[Paul Muller (actor)|Paul Muller]] as employer of Fracchia\n* [[Lars Bloch]] as the doctor}}\n\n==Release==\n''Fraccia contro Dracula'' was distributed theatrically in Italy by [[Titanus]] on December 19, 1986.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=127}} The film grossed a total of 818,235,000 [[Italian lire]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=127}} Film historian and critic Roberto Curti stated that the film was a commercial disappointment being released at a fruitful time of the year and only becoming the 60th highest grossing film in Italy of that year.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=129}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last= Curti | first= Roberto | title= Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1980-1989 |publisher= McFarland |year= 2019 |isbn= 978-1476672434}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0128221}}\n\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Neri Parenti}}\n[[Category:1985 films]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:Italian vampire films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Neri Parenti]]\n[[Category:Films set in castles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Aosta Valley]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films set in Transylvania]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:1985 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-Italy-film-stub}}\n{{comedy-horror-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
