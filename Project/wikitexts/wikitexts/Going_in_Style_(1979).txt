It was Brest's first commercial feature film.<ref name=\"Canby\" />\n\n==Plot==\nJoe ([[George Burns]]), Al ([[Art Carney]]), and Willie ([[Lee Strasberg]]) are three senior citizens who share a small apartment in Queens, [[New York City]]. Their days are spent on a park bench, and Joe is desperate to break the monotony. One day Joe suggests that they go on a \"stick-up\". They have no experience as criminals, but after some reluctance the two others agree.\n\nAl surreptitiously borrows three pistols from the gun collection of his nephew, Pete ([[Charles Hallahan]]), who lives with his wife and children a few miles away. The trio, disguised with [[Groucho glasses|novelty glasses]], pulls off the heist, netting [[United States dollar|$]]35,000. The excitement is too much for Willie, who soon suffers a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Joe and Al give $25,000 to Pete and his family, claiming it is the proceeds from Willie's life insurance policy. They decide to splurge the remaining $10,000 on a trip to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Al and Joe win over $70,000 playing [[craps]], but the trip, which they make right after Willie's funeral, exhausts Al and he dies in his sleep.\n\nJoe informs Pete that his uncle has died, then tells him about the bank heist and the Las Vegas adventure. He gives Pete the remaining bank loot and the Vegas winnings, and tells him to store the cash in his safe deposit box and never tell anyone about it. The next day, on his way to Al's funeral, Joe is arrested. He confesses to the robbery but refuses to say what happened to the money.\n\nPete visits Joe in prison and suggests giving back at least the stolen portion of the money in the hope of a lighter sentence. Joe explains that he is an old man with no family and now, no friends, and is resigned to his fate. He tells Pete to enjoy his \"inheritance\" before he heads back to his cell.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Burns]] as Joe\n*[[Art Carney]] as Al\n*[[Lee Strasberg]] as Willie\n*[[Charles Hallahan]] as Pete\n*[[Pamela Payton-Wright]] as Kathy\n*Siobhan Keegan as Colleen\n*Brian Neville as Kevin\n\n==Reception==\nCritic [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three and a half stars, remarking that it \"treats old age with a lot of bitterness.  And my suspicion is that this picture will be a healthy catharsis for anyone who is old or is thinking about becoming old.\"  Siskel added that \"what this remarkable movie is after is duplicating the texture of being old in America.  And, as we spend the final days with these three characters, we discover that what growing old is about for so many people is being alone.  In one heart-tugging scene after another, we see the maturity it takes to make peace with yourself as you grow old.  We see the strength it takes to be willing to sit quietly.\"  Siskel offered particular praise for Burns' performance, stating that \"Fans of George Burns . . . will be startled by his performance in this film.  Burns, who has always seemed so cheerful on film, lets out some of his rage at growing old.  He does this in a controlled, quiet way that reveals he is one remarkable actor.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Siskel, Gene|authorlink=Gene Siskel|title='Going in Style' gives aging a bad name beautifully|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|page=E8|archivedate=May 30, 2020|url=https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/386764622/?terms=going%2Bin%2Bstyle%2Bsiskel|date=December 26, 1979|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530134334/https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/image/386764622/?terms=going%2Bin%2Bstyle%2Bsiskel}} [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/12/26/page/64/article/going-in-style-gives-aging-a-bad-name-beautifully Alt URL]</ref>\n\nA ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer, [[Vincent Canby]] said that the film \"means to be both moving and comic\" but \"never elicits any emotional response more profound than curiosity.\"<ref name=\"Canby\">{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |authorlink1=Vincent Canby |title=Movie: 3 Widowers Try 'Going in Style' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/25/archives/movie-3-widowers-try-going-in-style.html |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=25 December 1979 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film has an 82% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Going in Style|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/going_in_style/}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\n{{main|Going in Style (2017 film)}}\nIn 2015, [[Warner Bros.]] and [[New Line Cinema]] began production on a remake of ''Going in Style'', directed by [[Zach Braff]], written by [[Theodore Melfi]] and starring [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[Alan Arkin]].
