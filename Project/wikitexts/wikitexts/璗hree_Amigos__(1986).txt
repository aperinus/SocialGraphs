It is the story of three [[silent film]] stars who are mistaken for real heroes by the suffering people of a small Mexican village. The actors must find a way to live up to their reputation and stop a malevolent bandit.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1916, the bandit El Guapo and his gang collect protection money from the Mexican village of Santo Poco. Carmen, daughter of the village leader, searches for someone who can rescue her townspeople. Visiting a village church, she sees a silent film featuring The Three Amigos, a trio of gunfighters who protect the vulnerable from villains. Believing them to be real heroes, Carmen sends a [[Telegraphy#Telegram services|telegram]] asking them to come and stop El Guapo.\n\nLucky Day, Dusty Bottoms, and Ned Nederlander, the actors who portray the Amigos, demand a salary increase for their next project and are fired by their boss Harry Flugelman. He has them evicted from the studio mansion, banned from his lot, and the clothes they borrowed from wardrobe repossessed. They soon receive Carmen's telegram, misinterpreting it as a job offer to perform a show in Santo Poco. The Amigos break into the studio to retrieve their costumes and head for [[Mexico]].\n\nStopping at a cantina near Santo Poco, they are mistaken for associates of a fast-shooting German pilot who arrived just before they did, also in search of El Guapo. They perform \"My Little Buttercup\" at the cantina, confusing the locals. The German's real associates arrive at the cantina, proving themselves lethal with their pistols when everybody laughs at them. Relieved, Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are pampered in the best house in town.\n\nThe next morning, when three of El Guapo's men raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men bemused. The bandits ride off, making the villagers think they have defeated the enemy. In reality, the men inform El Guapo of what has happened and he decides to return the next day to kill the Amigos.\n\nThe village throws a victory party for the Amigos. The next morning, El Guapo and his gang come to Santo Poco and call them out, but they think it's another show. After Lucky gets shot, they realize they are facing real bandits and beg for mercy. El Guapo allows the Amigos to live, then lets his men loot the village and kidnaps Carmen. They leave Santo Poco in humiliation.\n\nNed persuades Lucky and Dusty to go after El Guapo as they have nothing worth going back to in America and this is their chance to be real heroes. They spot a plane and follow it; it is flown by the German, who has brought a shipment of rifles for the gang. El Guapo's 40th birthday party is being prepared and he plans to bed Carmen that night. The Amigos fling themselves over the wall to infiltrate the hideout with mixed results: Lucky is immediately captured and chained in a dungeon, Dusty crashes into Carmen's room, and Ned ends up suspended from a [[pi\u00f1ata]].\n\nLucky frees himself, but Dusty and Ned are discovered and held hostage. The German, having idolized Ned's quick-draw and gun-spinning pistol skills in childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned kills the German and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape in the German's plane.\n\nReturning to Santo Poco with El Guapo's army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves. The villagers are uncertain as all they are good at is sewing. Drawing inspiration from one of their films, they have the villagers create improvised Amigos costumes. The bandits arrive, are shot at by Amigos from all sides, and fall into hidden trenches. El Guapo's men either ride off or are shot, and he takes a fatal wound. Before he dies, the villagers, dressed as Amigos, step out to confront him. El Guapo congratulates them, then shoots Lucky in the foot before dying.\n\nThe villagers offer the Amigos all the money they have, but the Amigos refuse it with: \"Our reward is that justice has been done.\" They then ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Dusty Bottoms, a silent film actor.\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Lucky Day, a silent film actor.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Ned Nederlander, a silent film actor.\n* [[Alfonso Arau]] as \"El Guapo\", the leader of a group of banditos.\n* [[Tony Plana]] as \"Jefe\", El Guapo\u2019s second in command.\n* [[Patrice Martinez]] as Carmen, the daughter of the head of the village.\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Harry Flugleman, the head of Goldsmith Pictures that Lucky, Dusty, and Ned work for.\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Sam, one of Flugleman's personal assistants.\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Morty, one of Flugleman's personal assistants.\n* [[Tino Insana]] as Studio Guard\n* Loyda Ramos as Conchita\n* Phillip Gordon as Rodrigo\n* [[Kai Wulff]] as The German, an unnamed German fighter pilot.\n* [[Fred Asparagus]] as The Bartender\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] and [[Brian Thompson]] as The German's friends\n* [[Randy Newman]] as Voice of the Singing Bush\n* [[Rebecca Ferratti|Rebecca Underwood]] as Hot Senorita (kisses Ned at the close of the film)\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by Martin, Michaels, and [[Randy Newman]]. According to Michaels, Martin approached him with the idea for the film and asked him to co-write it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com|title=Norm Macdonald Has a Show: Season 1, Episode 10: Lorne Michaels|website=www.netflix.com|access-date=September 19, 2018}}</ref> Martin originally had the working title ''Three Caballeros'', the same as the [[Disney]] [[The Three Caballeros|cartoon]].\n\nNewman contributed three original songs: \"The Ballad of the Three Amigos\", \"My Little Buttercup\", and \"Blue Shadows on the Trail\", and the [[Film score|musical score]] was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]].

Martin had been attached to the project since 1980 and he, [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[John Belushi]] were originally going to star. At one point, [[Steven Spielberg]] was slated to direct; he wanted Martin, [[Bill Murray]], and [[Robin Williams]] to play Lucky, Dusty, and Ned, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=February 17, 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|access-date=May 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=May 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Landis has said that [[Rick Moranis]] would have been cast as Ned had Short been unavailable.<ref name=\"split\"/> When Aykroyd became unavailable, Chase replaced him.
