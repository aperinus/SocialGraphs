[[Vincente Minnelli]] directed the film, which stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Lauren Bacall]], and [[Dolores Gray]], and features [[Sam Levene]] and [[Chuck Connors]]. The film earned [[George Wells (screenwriter)|George Wells]] an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Beverly Hills, California]], covering a golf tournament, New York sports reporter Mike Hagen correctly chooses the winning golfer in the reporters' betting pool. With the $1,200 he won, Mike begins buying drinks. The next morning he awakes with no memory of the night before. Hung over and believing that he failed to file his story, Mike sits beside the hotel pool drinking coffee. When an unfamiliar woman, Marilla Brown, approaches him. Mike, through a series of misunderstandings, assumes she is a prostitute. As Marilla heatedly begins to correct him, he receives a call from his editor telling him he had received Mike's story, but that a corrupt boxing promoter was threatening Mike. Ending the call, Mike returns to Marilla who explains that she had helped him write his story. This begins a whirlwind eight-day romance which ends with marriage. Only on the flight back to New York does Mike begin to discover that Marilla had hidden the details of her job, wealth and family connections in order to land Mike. This quickly causes friction.\n\nMike is a sportswriter and poker enthusiast with working-class friends. Marilla designs clothes for a wide array of artistic personalities. Their friends clash memorably one Wednesday night when his Poker Club and her Drama Society both convene at Marilla's apartment.\n\nMarilla becomes suspicious of Mike after she finds a photograph of Lori Shannon, Mike's former girlfriend. Mike tries to hide his former relationship, but fails miserably. Complicating matters even further is Mike's continuing series of expos\u00e9s of the activities of crooked boxing promoter Martin Daylor. Mike's life is in danger, but he hides that from his wife as well. What results is a series of misunderstandings and mishaps.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Mike Hagen\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Marilla Brown Hagen\n* [[Dolores Gray]] as Lori Shannon\n* [[Sam Levene]] as Ned Hammerstein, Mike's editor\n* [[Tom Helmore]] as Zachary Wilde, Marilla's former boyfriend\n* [[Mickey Shaughnessy]] as Maxie Stultz, a [[punch-drunk]] ex-boxer friend of Hagen\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Charlie Arneg\n* [[Chuck Connors]] as \"Johnny O\", one of Daylor's henchmen\n* [[Edward Platt]] as Martin J.

She gives an interview/screen test in the DVD's special features.\n\n[[Lauren Bacall]] was dealing with husband [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s terminal illness during the shooting. According to her autobiography, she took the role (which was originally intended for [[Grace Kelly]]) to avoid her home situation, but in interviews she said that this film was among her favorites, and that she desperately wanted the part, even accepting a lower salary. She said that Kelly considered the part to have been written for her, and would never forgive Bacall, who added, \"She got the prince, I got the part.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/aug/13/lauren-bacall-14-of-her-best-quotes |title=Lauren Bacall: 14 of her best quotes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBogart died January 14, 1957, four months before the film's release.\n\nBoth [[James Stewart]] and [[Cary Grant]] turned down the role that went to Peck, with Grant citing the heavy drinking of the character as the main reason for his declination.\n\n==Box office==\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $2,175,000 in the US and Canada and $1,575,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $136,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Designing Woman'' ended up being one of both Bacall and Peck's more successful films both critically<ref name=\"Tomatoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/designing_woman/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes reviews |publisher=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> and commercially, with [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' comparing the leading couple with [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Spencer Tracy]] and stating, \"(the film) obviously endeavors to generate the same kind of verve and general sardonic humor as flowed from that older comedy team.

This, in turn, may explain why ''Designing Woman'' remains an amazingly obscure film, given its two high-profile stars and director--it's 'about' issues and ideas that aren't easy to discuss or delineate, and is far more challenging and sophisticated than its plot description would indicate.\"<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/designing-woman-v149833/review Elder, Bruce.
