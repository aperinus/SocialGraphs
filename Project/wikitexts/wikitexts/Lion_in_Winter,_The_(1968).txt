The film was directed by [[Anthony Harvey]]; written by [[James Goldman]] (based on his own [[The Lion in Winter|play of the same name]]); produced by [[Joseph E. Levine]], Jane C. Nusbaum, and [[Martin Poll]]; and starred [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[John Castle]], [[Anthony Hopkins]] (in his first major film role), [[Jane Merrow]], [[Timothy Dalton]] (in his film debut) and [[Nigel Terry]].\n\nThe film was a commercial success and won three [[Academy Award]]s, including Hepburn's historic tie with [[Barbra Streisand]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], making Hepburn the first three-time winner in the category. A television [[The Lion in Winter (2003 film)|remake]] of the film was made in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Lion in Winter'' is set during Christmas 1183, at [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]'s (Peter O'Toole) ch\u00e2teau and primary residence in [[Chinon]], [[Touraine]], in the medieval [[Angevin Empire]]. Henry wants his youngest son, the future [[John, King of England|King John]] (Nigel Terry), to inherit his throne, while his estranged and imprisoned wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] (Katharine Hepburn), temporarily released from prison for the holidays, favours their eldest surviving son, the future [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]] (Anthony Hopkins). Meanwhile, King [[Philip II of France]] (Timothy Dalton), the son and successor of [[Louis VII of France]], Eleanor's ex-husband, has given his half-sister [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alais]] (Jane Merrow), who is currently Henry's mistress, to the future heir, and demands either a wedding or the return of her [[dowry]].\n\n[[File:Hep-lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], a role for which she won an Oscar]]\nAs a ruse, Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard and make him heir-apparent. He makes a deal with Eleanor for her freedom in return for [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], to be given to John and Richard marrying Alais. When the deal is revealed at the wedding, Richard refuses to go through with the ceremony. After Richard leaves, Eleanor masochistically asks Henry to kiss Alais in front of her, and then looks on in horror as they perform a mock marriage ceremony. Having believed Henry's intentions, John, at the direction of middle brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]], plots with Philip to make war on England. Henry and Philip meet to discuss terms, but Henry soon learns that Philip has been plotting with John and Geoffrey, and that he and Richard were once lovers.\n\nHenry dismisses all three sons as unsuitable and locks them in a wine cellar, telling Alais, \"the royal boys are aging with the royal port.\"<ref>Quote from the 1968 movie, ''The Lion in Winter''.</ref> He makes plans to travel to Rome for an [[annulment]], so that he can have new sons with Alais, but she says he will never be able to release his sons from prison or they will be a threat to his future children. Henry sees that she is right and condemns them to death, but cannot bring himself to kill them, instead letting them escape. He and Eleanor go back to hoping for the future, with Eleanor returning on the barge to prison, laughing it off with Henry before she leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], [[Duke of Normandy]] and of [[Duke of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], [[Count of Anjou]] (This is the second time O'Toole portrayed Henry II, after 1964's ''[[Becket (1964 film)|Becket]]'' with Richard Burton.)\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], his estranged Queen\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], their eldest son\n* [[John Castle]] as [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], their middle son\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as [[John, King of England|John]], their youngest son\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], [[King of France]] \n* [[Jane Merrow]] as [[Alys of France, Countess of Vexin|Alais]], Philip's half-sister and Henry's mistress, betrothed to Richard by prior agreement\n* [[Nigel Stock (actor)|Nigel Stock]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|Captain William Marshall]]\n* [[Kenneth Ives]] as Queen Eleanor's guard\n* [[O. Z. Whitehead]] as [[Hugh de Puiset]], the [[Bishop of Durham]]\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe original stage production had not been a success, getting a bad review in ''The New York Times'' and losing $150,000. Producer [[Martin Poll]] optioned Goldman's novel ''Waldorf'' for the movies. They discussed ''Lion in Winter'', which Poll had read and loved. He hired Goldman to write a screenplay.\n\n===Casting===\nPoll was meant to make a film with [[Joseph E. Levine|Joseph Levine]] and [[Peter O'Toole]], ''The Ski Bum'' (which would be written by James Goldman's brother William). That project fell through and Poll suggested they do ''Lion in Winter'' instead.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Smith, C.|title='Lion in winter'--play that refused to die.|date=Dec 1, 1968|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|id={{ProQuest|156111474}}}}</ref> O'Toole, who was 36, portrays Henry II at age 50.

The Vexin is located northwest of Paris, between it and Rouen.]]\n\nThough the background and the eventual destinies of the characters are generally accurate, ''The Lion in Winter'' is fictional: while there was a Christmas court at [[Caen]] in 1182, there was none at [[Chinon]] in 1183. In reality, Henry had many mistresses and many illegitimate children; the \"[[Rosamund Clifford|Rosamund]]\" mentioned in the film was his mistress until she died. The [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174]] provides the historical background leading to the play's events. There was also a second rebellion, when Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted in 1183, resulting in Young Henry's death. While some historians have theorized that [[Richard I of England#Speculation regarding sexuality|Richard was homosexual]], it is not certain.\n\nGeoffrey died in 1186 in a jousting tournament held in Paris (with some speculation that Geoffrey was involved in plotting against Henry with Philip at the time). A third rebellion against Henry by Richard and Philip in 1189 was finally successful, and a decisively defeated Henry retreated to Chinon in Anjou, where he died. Richard the Lionheart succeeded Henry II, but spent very little time in England (perhaps 6 months), after which he became a central Christian commander during the [[Third Crusade]], leading the campaign after the departure of Philip. Richard won some considerable victories, but he did not succeed in retaking Jerusalem. John finally succeeded Richard in 1199 after Richard's death. During his unsuccessful reign he lost most of his father's holdings in Northern France and angered the English barons, who revolted and forced him to sign the [[Magna Carta]]. John is also known for being the villain in the [[Robin Hood]] legends.
