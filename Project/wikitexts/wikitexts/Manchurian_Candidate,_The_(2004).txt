In the original, the protagonist was captured in the [[Korean War]] and brainwashed by the Chinese in the actual [[Manchuria]]. In the 2004 film, with the Korean War replaced by the [[Gulf War]], ''Manchurian'' is used, instead, as the name of a sinister multinational company.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Major (United States)|Major]] Bennett Marco commanded a famous [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] unit during a Gulf War raid in 1991. For his role in that mission, Sergeant First Class Raymond Shaw was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for single-handedly defeating the enemy and rescuing all but two of his men. By 2008, the U.S. has become dominated by [[xenophobia]], ''de facto'' [[Martial law in the United States|martial law]], [[environmental degradation]], and increasing [[Corporatocracy|corporate influence]]; Shaw is a famous U.S. congressman. His ruthless mother, [[Virginia]] Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, uses her influence to secure his nomination as a vice-presidential candidate over the favorite, Senator Tom Jordan. Raymond is shy and withdrawn, but opens up to his mother and his childhood sweetheart Jocelyn, Senator Jordan's daughter.\n\nAl Melvin, one of Marco's former soldiers, tells Marco of his confusing memories and dreams about their lost army unit. Though clearly mentally ill, he shows Marco his drawings of images from his dreams. Soon, Marco also dreams of the raid, where  Raymond and he are captured and brainwashed to kill members of their platoon. Their captors included scientists led by a mysterious South African man.\n\nMarco starts investigating what really happened. He travels to [[New York City]]: on the train he meets an outgoing supermarket clerk who had already identified him earlier, named Eugenie or Rosie. She offers him a place to stay in New York. While showering at Eugenie's apartment, Marco feels a small lump on his upper back.  He uses a knife to dig at the spot, and pulls out a tiny metallic object, but accidentally drops it down the bathroom sink drain after Eugenie, having listened to Marco's subtle sounds of distress, forces her way inside.\n\nMarco confronts Raymond at campaign headquarters, wrestles him down, and bites into his back in an attempt to remove same implant he suspects is there. He has the implant analyzed and finds it is a [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] experiment connected with Manchurian Global, a powerful [[Private equity|private-equity]] firm with major political connections including Raymond's mother Senator Pritchett. Researching the firm, Marco recognizes the South African man from his nightmares as a South African geneticist-turned-mercenary Dr. Atticus Noyle. He brings his findings to Senator Jordan, who confronts the Shaws and suggests that Raymond withdraw from the campaign. Instead, Eleanor \"activates\" Raymond and orders him to kill Jordan. Jocelyn is also killed when she tries to stop Raymond.\n\nMarco suspects he's been followed, and when Marco tries to confront Rosie, she reveals she works for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), which has been monitoring the conspiracy for years. Having found an implant in Melvin, who\u2014like all of Raymond and Marco's squadmates\u2014died mysteriously, the FBI arranges a meeting between Marco and Raymond to convince them they were brainwashed under an assassination plot, which takes place just as Governor Arthur and Raymond win the White House. Raymond receives a phone call intended for Marco from Eleanor, who is deeply linked with Manchurian. Using trigger words, she commands Marco to assassinate the [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] so that Raymond can become President and admits that she voluntarily gave him to the brainwashers for the country's benefit, but Raymond resists the mind-control techniques, empowered by Jocelyn's death.\n\nAt the climactic moment, Raymond deliberately places himself between the entranced Marco and the President-elect. As Eugenie rushes through the crowd to find Marco, Raymond looks at the vent where Marco is hiding and nods as a signal to kill the President-elect. Raymond dances with his mother and steers them into the marked position, where Marco kills them both with a single rifle shot. Marco prepares to kill himself, but after seeing Raymond's nod, Eugenie arrives and prevents his suicide by wounding him.\n\nThe FBI frames a deceased Manchurian Global contractor as the shooter. Manchurian executives watch their entire conspiracy revealed on television, but do not attempt to flee. Eugenie takes Marco to the remote island compound where he was conditioned. After reflecting on his time there, Marco drops a photo of his Army unit and Raymond's Medal of Honor into the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Major Bennett Marco\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Congressman Raymond Prentiss Shaw\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Senator Thomas Jordan\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Eugenie Rose\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Jocelyn Jordan\n* [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Corporal Al Melvin\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Atticus Noyle\n* [[Bruno Ganz]] as Delp\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Congressman Healy\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Congresswoman Beckett\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Lieutenant Colonel Howard\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Colonel Garret\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Mark Whiting\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Lieutenant General Sloan\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as David Donovan\n* [[Tom Stechschulte]] as Governor Robert \"Bob\" Arthur\n* [[Pablo Schreiber]] as PFC Eddie Ingram\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as PFC Robert Baker III\n* [[Robyn Hitchcock]] as Laurence Tokar\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Senator Wells\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Vaughn Utly\n* [[John Bedford Lloyd]] as Jay \"J.B.\" Johnston\n{{div col end}}\n\n;Cameos\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Al Franken]] as a reporter\n* [[Sidney Lumet]] as a political pundit\n* [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as a political pundit\n* [[Roy Blount Jr.]] as a political pundit\n* [[Fab Five Freddy|Fred Brathwaite]] as a political pundit\n* [[Roger Corman]] as the Secretary of State\n* [[Beau Sia]] (on a TV screen) as a presenter\n* [[Gayle King]] (on a TV screen) as a presenter\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Tina Sinatra]] was a co-producer of the film. Her father [[Frank Sinatra]] portrayed Marco in the original 1962 film and owned that film's legal distribution rights into the late 1980s, never re-releasing it during that time (although it did air on network television several times). In the original, nationally released during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the premise was based on communists taking control; in this remake, big corporate influence serves as the evil faction, a twist to maintain the \"Manchurian connection\". The remake does not follow the original film's plot details on several occasions.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Manchurian Candidate'' was released July 30, 2004, alongside ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', ''[[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|Thunderbirds]]'', & ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]].'' The film grossed $65,955,630 in North America and $30,150,334 in other territories, totaling $96,105,964 worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|title=The Manchurian Candidate (2004)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=manchuriancandidate.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics.

She has the [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] hair and the [[Karen Hughes]] attack-dog energy, but the charm, the inspiration, and the constant invention are her own. She gives us a senator who's a [[monomania]]c, a mad mommy and master politician rolled into one, a woman firing on so many levels that no one can keep up \u2013 someone who loves being evil as much as Streep loves acting.
