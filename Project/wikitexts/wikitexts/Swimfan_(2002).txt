Starring [[Jesse Bradford]], [[Erika Christensen]], and [[Shiri Appleby]], the film is about a high school swimming star who finds himself stalked by a teenage seductress after a one-night stand.\n\nThe plot drew comparisons to similar films like ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' and ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', and was also panned by critics.\n\n==Plot==\nBen Cronin is a star swimmer of his high school's swim team. His coach informs him that [[Stanford University]] scouts will appear at next week's swim meet. Ben and his girlfriend Amy discuss their future plans. Amy wants to attend school in [[Rhode Island]] but explains she will go to school in [[California]] to stay close to Ben. The next day, Ben nearly runs his car into Madison Bell and gives her a ride home as an apology. Later, he realizes that Madison left her notebook in his car. The notebook is filled with music notes, and Ben spots his initials written inside a staff. When he returns the notebook, he meets Madison's cousin, Christopher. Madison appears stressed and explains she has not eaten, so Ben offers to take her to a diner. At the diner, Ben tells Madison about his girlfriend, but Madison does not appear too bothered and explains that she has a boy waiting for her in [[New York City]].\n\nBen shares some of his past with Madison: he began doing drugs five years ago, which led to crime and six months in [[juvenile hall]], which \"saved him\" because he ultimately realized his passion and talent for swimming. Although Ben tries to end the date, Madison convinces him to go to the pool. Her aggressive flirtation lures Ben in, and despite his initial hesitancy, the two have sex. Both agree to remain friends and not to discuss their encounter.\n\nThe next night, Ben goes to a party at Amy's house. Amy introduces Ben to her new friend, who turns out to be Madison. The two pretend to have not met one another. Shortly after, Madison obsesses over Ben\u2014she stops by his house to meet his mom and bombards Ben with e-mails and instant messages. Ben realizes her unhealthy behavior and demands her to leave him alone. Ben's lying eats at him, but before he confesses, Madison tells Amy first. Madison dates Ben's rival teammate, Josh. Right before their biggest swim competition, Ben is disqualified for having [[steroid]]s in his urine. Outraged and suspecting Madison had Josh set him up, he confronts Josh about the drug test, revealing his suspicion. Days later, Madison accidentally calls Josh by Ben's name while they are kissing in a car. Josh realizes that Madison's obsession with Ben is real and tells her off.\n\nBen tries to tell Amy everything, but she doesn\u2019t believe him. The next day, he goes to the pool, where he finds Josh dead. The police suspect that Ben murdered Josh, so to prove his innocence, Ben breaks into Madison's room to find evidence, where he discovers a bottle of steroids and a creepy shrine of his personal belongings she has been secretly stashing. Christopher warns Ben of a similar case regarding a man named Jake Donnelly. When Ben visits Jake in the hospital, a nurse tells him that Jake's girlfriend Madison survived the crash.\n\nDisguising herself as Ben, Madison steals his car, follows Amy home from school and runs her off the road, with Ben being framed for the crime. That night at the hospital, Ben and a few friends record Madison confessing her crime and intentions, resulting in her arrest. She escapes custody by stealing an officer's gun and shooting the two policemen escorting her, then enters Ben's house and drags Amy to the school's swimming pool. After watching Madison throw a handcuffed and chairbound Amy into the pool, Ben dives in. Madison attacks them with the handle of a pool cleaner, and Ben grabs one end, pulling her into the pool. Unable to swim, Madison drowns while Ben frees the drowned Amy from her handcuffs, carries her out of the pool, and then resuscitates her via [[mouth-to-mouth]] [[artificial respiration]]. Later, after watching a swim meet, Ben goes outside to his car, where he and Amy kiss and drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Ben Cronin\n* [[Erika Christensen]] as Madison Bell\n* [[Shiri Appleby]] as Amy Miller\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Carla Cronin\n* [[Clayne Crawford]] as Josh\n* [[Jason Ritter]] as Randy\n* [[Kia Goodwin|Kia Joy Goodwin]] as Rene\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Coach Simkins\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Mr. Tillman\n* [[Nick Sandow]] as Detective John Zabel\n* [[Pamela Isaacs]] as Mrs. Egan\n* [[Phyllis Somerville]] as Aunt Gretchen \n* James DeBello as Christopher\n* Monroe Mann as Jake Donnelly\n* [[Patricia Rae]] as Jake's nurse\n\n== Filming ==\nThe film was shot in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hadadi |first=Roxana |date=2022-04-06 |title=Erika Christensen Answers Every Question We Have About Swimfan |url=https://www.vulture.com/2022/04/erika-christensen-answers-every-question-about-swimfan.html |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |language=en-us}}</ref> It was partly financed by [[Further Films|Furthur Films]], a production company founded by actor [[Michael Douglas]].\n\n==Release==\n''Swimfan'' opened in the number one spot at the North American box office in its first week of release, earning $12.4 million and beating ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' and ''[[City by the Sea]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Karger |first=Dave |date=September 9, 2002 |title=''Swimfan'' debuts at No. 1 at the box office |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/09/swimfan-debuts-no-1-box-office/ |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=[[EW.com]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Bill |date=2002-09-09 |title=\u2018SWIMFAN\u2019 SINKS BOX-OFFICE COMPETITION |url=https://nypost.com/2002/09/09/swimfan-sinks-box-office-competition/ |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=New York Post |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe film was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] in most countries, but [[Icon Film Distribution]] distributed it in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/films/2002/09/20/swimfan_2002_review.shtml|title=BBC - Leicester Films - Swimfan review|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/swimfan-2002-2|title=SWIMFAN {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> The worldwide box office gross was $34.4 million; nearly a third of that came from its first-place opening weekend in the US.<ref name=\"boxoff\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=swimfan.htm|title=Swimfan|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> Director [[John Polson]] credited the film\u2019s strong opening weekend to Fox\u2019s marketing campaign.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marquez |first=Sandra |date=September 7, 2002 |title='Swimfan' Tops Weekend Box Office |url=https://www.theintelligencer.com/news/article/Swimfan-Tops-Weekend-Box-Office-10510030.php |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=[[The Edwardsville Intelligencer]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 14% of 91 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10.
