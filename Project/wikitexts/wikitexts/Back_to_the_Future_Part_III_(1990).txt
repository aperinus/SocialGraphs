The film was directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], and stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]], and [[Lea Thompson]]. The film continues immediately following ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989); while stranded in 1955 during his [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] adventures, [[Marty McFly]] (Fox) discovers that his friend [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd), trapped in 1885, was killed by [[Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]] (Wilson), [[Biff Tannen|Biff]]'s great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with [[Clara Clayton]] (Steenburgen).\n\n''Back to the Future Part III'' was filmed in [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and was produced on a $40&nbsp;million budget [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''[[Back to the Future Part II|Part II]]''. ''Part III'' was released in the United States on May 25, 1990, six months after the previous installment, and grossed $245 million worldwide during its initial run, making it the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 1990]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1990/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|title=1990 Worldwide Box Office|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=March 7, 2020|archive-date=May 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515202657/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1990/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|url-status=live}}</ref> The film received a positive response from critics, who noted it as an improvement over its predecessor.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1955, moments after witnessing [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] disappear in his [[DeLorean time machine|DeLorean]], [[Marty McFly]] learns that Doc was sent to 1885.{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989).}} Using information from Doc's 1885 letter, Marty and the 1955 Doc find and repair the DeLorean so Marty can return to 1985. However after finding it, Marty comes across a tombstone with Doc's name, with the inscription stating that Doc was shot by [[Biff Tannen]]'s great-grandfather, Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen, six days after writing the letter.\n\nDespite the letter's warnings, Marty travels back to 1885 to save Doc, arriving amidst a [[United States Cavalry|cavalry]] pursuit of [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Americans]], tearing the car's fuel line in the process. Chased by a [[American black bear|bear]], he is knocked out and found by his Irish-born great-great-grandparents [[Maggie McFly#Seamus and Maggie McFly|Seamus and Maggie McFly]], who allow him to stay for the night. The next morning, under the alias [[Clint Eastwood]], he arrives in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] but runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford tries hanging Marty, but Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after learning his fate, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach its required {{convert|88|mph|km/h}}. He thus proposes using a [[steam locomotive]] to push the DeLorean to that speed.\n\nWhile inspecting a [[Branch line|rail spur]], Doc saves the town\u2019s new schoolteacher [[Clara Clayton]] from falling into the ravine, averting her death from the original timeline. They fall in love at first sight and form a close relationship. At a town festival for the courthouse, Buford tries shooting Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford then challenges him to a showdown in two days; an angry Marty accepts, believing that he and Doc would have left by then. Doc urges Marty not to react to provocation, letting slip that Marty has a life changing accident in the future.\n\nAlthough he is reluctant to return to 1985, Doc eventually visits Clara to end their relationship and bid her goodbye. However, feeling insulted, she dismisses his story about being from the future. Despondent, he goes for a [[Binge drinking|binge]]. In the morning, Buford arrives for Marty, who sees his alias appear in the photograph of the tombstone and refuses to duel. Doc passes out after downing just one shot and eventually revives but is taken hostage by Buford's gang, forcing Marty into the duel. Fooling Buford into believing he was fatally shot, Marty knocks him into a wagon of [[manure]]. Buford is promptly arrested for an earlier robbery.\n\nOn the train to [[San Francisco]], Clara learns how heartbroken Doc is and runs back to town. She finds the model of the time machine at his shop. Realizing Doc was telling the truth, she heads back to intercept him. Using a stolen locomotive, Doc and Marty push the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive and tries to reach the car, but she falls, hanging by her dress. Marty, in the DeLorean, passes his [[hoverboard]] to Doc, and he uses it to save Clara and carry her to safety. Marty hits 88&nbsp;mph and vanishes as the locomotive falls off the unfinished bridge.\n\nArriving in 1985, Marty escapes from the powerless DeLorean just before an oncoming freight train destroys it. Reuniting with Jennifer, Marty declines a street race with Douglas J. Needles, thus avoiding the future accident Doc warned him about. Jennifer opens the fax message she kept from 2015 and watches as the text regarding Marty's firing disappears.\n\nAs Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a steam locomotive suddenly appears, operated by Doc, Clara, and [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|their children]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of them standing next to the town clock in 1885. When Jennifer asks Doc about the blank fax, he says it means that their future has not yet been written and encourages them to make it a good one. Doc and his family bid farewell and fly off in the locomotive to an unknown time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Back to the Future characters}}\n* [[Michael J.

During filming for the original, director Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time period he would like to see. Fox replied that he wanted to visit the [[American frontier|Old West]] and meet [[cowboy]]s. Zemeckis and writer/producer [[Bob Gale]] were intrigued by the idea, but held it off until ''Part III''.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> Rather than use existing sets, the filmmakers built the 1885 Hill Valley from scratch.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The western scenes were filmed on location in [[Oak Park, California]], and [[Monument Valley]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\">Back to the Future 2002 DVD Feature: Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale Q&A recorded at the [[University of Southern California]]</ref> Some of the location shooting for the 1885 Hill Valley was done in [[Jamestown, California]], and on a purpose-built set at the Red Hills Ranch near [[Sonora, California]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\" /> Some of the train scenes were filmed at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |title=Railtown 1897 State Historic Park Film Credits |website=railtown1897.org|access-date=October 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203053007/http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |archive-date=December 3, 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Jensen | first =Larry | authorlink = | title =Hollywood's Railroads: Sierra Railroad | publisher =Cochetopa Press | series = | volume =Two | edition = | date =2018 | location =Sequim, Washington | pages =61\u201364 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RNswEACAAJ&dq=Hollywood%27s+Railroads&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKgvSWqYncAhXqhFQKHQdfCaAQ6AEINjAE | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-692-06472-6 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date =May 8, 2022 | archive-date =May 7, 2022 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20220507223541/https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RNswEACAAJ&dq=Hollywood%27s+Railroads&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKgvSWqYncAhXqhFQKHQdfCaAQ6AEINjAE | url-status =live }}</ref> a [[heritage railroad|heritage line]] in Jamestown.

The most grueling part was editing ''Part II'' while filming ''Part III'', and Zemeckis bore the brunt of the process over a three-week period. While Zemeckis was shooting most of the train sequences in Sonora, Gale was in Los Angeles supervising the final dub of ''Part II''.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" /> Zemeckis would wrap photography and board a private plane to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where Gale and engineers would greet him on the dubbing stage with dinner.

The following morning, Zemeckis would drive to the [[Burbank Airport]], board a flight back to the set in Northern California, and continue to shoot the film.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" />\n\nAlthough the schedule for most of the personnel involved was grueling, the actors found the remote location for ''Part III'' relaxing, compared to shooting its predecessor.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" />\n\nThe role of Clara Clayton was written with Mary Steenburgen in mind.

Wilson, who played Buford Tannen, chose to perform his own stunts and spent a great deal of time learning to ride a horse and throw his [[Lasso|lariat]]. Filming was halted when Fox's father died and when his son was born.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" />\n\n[[Alan Silvestri]], through his longtime collaboration with Zemeckis, returned to compose the [[Film score|score]] for ''Back to the Future Part III''. Rather than dictate how the music should sound, Zemeckis directed Silvestri as he would an actor, seeking to evoke emotion and treating every piece of music like a character.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" />\n\nThe photography in ''Part III'' was a \"dream\" for cinematographer [[Dean Cundey]], who agreed with much of the crew in his excitement to shoot a western. The filmmakers sought a bright, colorful picture for each scene, with a hint of sepia tone in certain shots.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" /> Zemeckis wished to create a spectacular climax to the film. He coordinated the actors, a live 4-6-0 ten wheeler [[steam locomotive]], [[pyrotechnics]], and special effects, and countless technicians all at once.<ref name=\"dvdint2\" /> As they had done with the previous two films in the trilogy, the visual effects for ''Part III'' were managed by effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]]; the head of its animation department, [[Wes Takahashi]], returned to once again animate the DeLorean's time travel sequences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=October 21, 2015|title=The future is today: how ILM made time travel
