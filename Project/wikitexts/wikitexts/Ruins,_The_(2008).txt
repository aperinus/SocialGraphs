The film stars [[Jonathan Tucker]], [[Jena Malone]], [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Laura Ramsey]], and [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo young American couples \u2014 Jeff, Amy, Eric, and Stacy \ngo on vacation to Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological dig]] at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias' friend. The group reaches the ruins of a [[Mayan temple]], and are confronted by [[Maya peoples|Mayan villagers]] armed with knives, bows, arrows, and a gun. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally steps on some [[vine]]s, the villagers become extremely agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.\n\nAt the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. They hear a phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. The group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope, but it breaks and Mathias falls, becoming paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines which hit a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and will not let them leave as they have all touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to rescue Mathias.\n\nThe next morning, Stacy sees a tendril of vine has crept into a wound on her leg. The vines have also wrapped themselves around Mathias' lower legs and eaten them down to the bone. Eric and Jeff are barely able to remove the vines from Stacy, but cannot get them off of Mathias. The phone is heard again from deep in the shaft so Stacy and Amy descend again. In a small, vine-covered room, the two find the body of the young archaeologist, Heinrich's friend, and a broken phone. They then realize that the ringing sound was made by the flowers of the vine. As Amy touches one flower, the vines attack and the two barely escape.\n\nAs Mathias' condition worsens, Jeff [[Amputation|amputates]] his legs to avoid an infection. Stacy becomes jealous at Eric comforting a distraught Amy and accuses them of having sex. While the four argue, the vines suffocate Mathias.\n\nIn the morning Eric brings Amy and Jeff into the tent and tells Stacy to show them the vines underneath her skin. Eric uses a knife to remove the vine from her leg and spine. Stacy tries to take the knife, claiming that the vines are in her head. The rest of the group watches her as a vine moves under the skin in her forehead, revealing that her fears are true.\n\nThe next morning, Stacy awakens and leaves the tent where the rest of the group is sleeping. She finds a backpack, which contains a knife. Jeff hears moans coming from outside and goes to see what is going on, and finds Stacey covered in open wounds slicing her body open to get the vines out.  He touches her and she flails the knife at him, slicing his palm. Eric also tries to calm her, but she spins around and fatally stabs him in the chest. While the rest try to restrain Stacy, Eric is dragged away by the vines. Overcome with remorse, Stacy begs Amy to kill her, and Jeff kills her as an act of mercy.\n\nJeff makes a plan for Amy to escape. He smears Stacy's blood all over her, then carries her to the bottom of the temple and lays her on the ground. He then provokes and berates the Mayans, drawing their attention away from Amy. The Mayans eventually shoot Jeff with arrows. Amy gets up and runs through the jungle with the Mayans chasing after her. Jeff is killed by the Mayan leader with a gunshot to the head. After escaping from the Mayans, Amy reaches the Jeep and manages to drive away.\n \nAfter Amy's escape, Dimitri's two Greek friends are seen walking through the woods and come up to the temple, looking for him.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn the unrated version, as Amy manages to drive away in the jeep, a close shot of her face is shown crawling with moving vines, indicating she too is infected. An extended version of this ending exists as a deleted scene. Following the previous scene, a caretaker is seen walking among the headstones in a cemetery sometimes later, whistling \"[[Fr\u00e8re Jacques]]\". When he hears the same tune coming from a grave, he goes forward to investigate and the camera follows, revealing the grave to be Amy's and several red flowers around the headstone. As the caretaker reaches for one, the music surges and the scene cuts to black.\n\nDirector Carter Smith told an interviewer, \"We shot a bunch of different stuff to see which one would work best with the finished film. There's a testing process you go through with a studio movie and as frustrating as it can be, it also really gives you a good sense of how an audience feels about an ending. Our final decision was informed by what audiences found the most satisfying after watching a really punishing film. I love the ending of the book, but if the movie had ended the same way, the audience would have wanted to kill themselves.\"<ref name= \"MH\">{{cite news |last= Rodriguez |first= Rene |title= ''The Ruins'': Scott Smith's Novel Comes to the Big Screen |work= [[The Miami Herald]] |location= Miami |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] |date= 4 April 2008 |page= G6}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Jeff\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Amy \"Ame\"\n* [[Laura Ramsey]] as Stacy \"Stace\"\n* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as Eric\n* [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Mathias\n* Sergio Calder\u00f3n as Lead Mayan\n* Jesse Ramirez as Mayan Bowman\n* Balder Moreno as Mayan Horseman\n* Dimitri Baveas as Dimitri\n* Patricio Almeida Rodriguez as Taxi Driver\n* [[Luis Antonio Ramos]] as Mayan Rifleman\n* Walter Quispe as Mayan Rifleman\n* Pauline Whyman as Wailing Woman\n* Chris Argirousis as Greek\n* Alexander Gregory as Greek\n* Michelle Atkinson as Archeologist\n* [[Bar Paly]] as Archeologist\n* [[Jordan Patrick Smith]] as Heinrich\n* [[Karen Strassman]] as Additional Vine Vocal (voice)\n\n==Production==\nThe shooting of this film took place in [[Queensland, Australia]]. According to ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', \"Smith was two-thirds done with the book when [[Ben Stiller]]'s production company, [[Red Hour Productions|Red Hour Films]], bought the screen rights based on an outline. 'They told me they wanted me to write the screenplay, too,' Smith says. 'So while I was writing the last third of the book, I already knew I'd be adapting it for the movies.'\"<ref name= \"MH\" />\n\nDirector Carter Smith said, \"If the audience is going to buy that this vine moves and can get into your body and all that, the world of the film has to be absolutely realistic. We took elements from lots of different real-life plants when designing our vine. It's in practically every single shot in the film after the characters reach the hill, so it has to look like something that could really be growing there. But it also has to look menacing once you realize what it is capable of doing.\"<ref name= \"MH\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe teaser trailer was released in December 2007.
