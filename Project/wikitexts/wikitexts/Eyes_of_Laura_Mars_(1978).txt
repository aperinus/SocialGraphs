The screenplay was adapted (in collaboration with [[David Zelag Goodman]]) from a [[Screenplay#Spec scripts|spec script]] titled ''Eyes,'' written by [[John Carpenter]]; it was Carpenter's first major studio film. [[H. B. Gilmour]] later wrote a novelization.\n\nProducer [[Jon Peters]], who was dating [[Barbra Streisand]] at the time, bought the screenplay as a starring vehicle for her, but Streisand eventually decided not to take the role because of \"the kinky nature of the story\", as Peters later explained. As a result, the role went to Dunaway, who had just won an Oscar for her performance in ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]].'' Streisand nevertheless felt that \"Prisoner\", the [[torch song]] from the film, would be a good [[power ballad]] vehicle for her. She sang it on the soundtrack and garnered a moderate hit as a result (the record peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]).\n\n''Eyes of Laura Mars'' is said to be an example of an American version of the Italian [[giallo]] genre. Peters commissioned photographer [[Helmut Newton]] to provide the images that stand in for Laura Mars' portfolio.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Nancy|title=Hit & Run How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood|last2=Masters|first2=Kim|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1996|isbn=0-684-80931-1|location=New York|pages=54}}</ref> The film is also noted for its use of [[red herring]]s and its [[twist ending]].\n\n==Plot==\nLaura Mars is a glamorous fashion photographer who specializes in stylized violence. In the middle of controversy over whether her photographs glorify violence and are degrading to women, Laura begins seeing, in first person through the eyes of the killer, real-time visions of the murders of her friends and colleagues.\n\nJohn Neville, the lieutenant in charge of the case, shows Laura unpublished police photographs of unsolved murders that very closely mirror Laura's fashion shoots. Laura's visions continue, including visions of the killer stalking her and continuing to murder those around her. Meanwhile, Laura and Neville fall in love. He gives her a gun as protection. Meanwhile, the police consider Laura's driver Tommy and ex-husband Michael to be their prime suspects. When they find photographs of murdered models in Tommy's apartment, the police try to arrest him but shoot him dead when he tries to escape.\n\nAt her apartment, Laura is affected by a vision of the killer murdering Michael. The killer attempts to break in through her front door, but Laura deadbolts it before they can enter. Upon hearing her distress, Neville (who had been on his way to meet her) breaks through her balcony window. He proceeds to tell Laura that Tommy was the killer and begins an elaborate explanation of his motivations and back story. Knowing Tommy well, Laura recognizes this as a lie. Neville, still talking about the killer, uses \"I\".  Laura realizes that Neville is the killer. Neville details more of his own story, slipping between [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]]. When the violent personality tries to kill Laura, his more sensitive personality reasserts dominance. He takes her hand, which holds the gun he gave her, and asks her to kill him. Distraught, she does so then calls the police.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Laura Mars\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Lieutenant John Neville\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Tommy Ludlow\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Donald Phelps\n* [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] as Michael Reisler\n* [[Frank Adonis]] as Detective Sal Volpe\n* [[Lisa Taylor (model)|Lisa Taylor]] as Michelle\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Lulu\n* [[Rose Gregorio]] as Elaine Cassel\n* [[Bill Boggs]] as Himself\n* Steve Marachuk as Robert\n* [[Meg Mundy]] as Doris Spenser\n* Marilyn Meyers as Sheila Weissman\n* [[John Sahag]] as Hairdresser\n\n==Production==\nThe film's source story was written by [[John Carpenter]], as was the earliest version of the screenplay. Producer [[Jack H. Harris]] had worked with Carpenter on the latter's feature-film directorial debut, ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]],'' and it was Harris who optioned Carpenter's 11-page treatment, then titled simply ''Eyes.''\n\nHarris planned to make the film independently of the major studios with privately raised finance and [[Roberta Collins]] in the lead. But Harris's friend [[Jon Peters]] read the treatment, and upon reading it, he became enthusiastic about its potential as a vehicle for Peters's then-girlfriend [[Barbra Streisand]]. Peters got interest from [[Peter Guber]] at Columbia and they agreed to finance the project's development. Streisand pulled out of the film, but Columbia were sufficiently enthusiastic about the script to move forward with another actress, and [[Faye Dunaway]] was cast. However, as a condition of this, the studio insisted on the script being rewritten; [[David Zelag Goodman]] shouldered that burden.<ref name=\"jack\">Jack H Harris, ''FATHER OF THE BLOB: The Making Of A Monster Smash & Other Hollywood Tales'' 2015</ref>\n\n\"It wasn't a pleasant experience\", said Carpenter. \"The original script was very good, I thought.

It was reported that Peters and Dunaway had a tense relationship while making the film.\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release, the film received mixed critical reviews, but it was a box office hit, earning $20 million from a $7 million budget.\n\nThe movie received a broadly positive review in ''The New York Times,'' in which [[Janet Maslin]] called the ending of the film \"dumb\", but otherwise liked it. She wrote of it: \"It's the cleverness of ''Eyes of Laura Mars'' that counts, cleverness that manifests itself in superlative casting, drily controlled direction from Irvin Kershner, and spectacular settings that turn New York into the kind of eerie, lavish dreamland that could exist only in the idle noodlings of the very, very hip.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E5DC1F3EE432A25757C0A96E9C946990D6CF \"Screen: 'Eyes of Laura Mars':In The Netherworld\"], Janet Maslin, ''The New York Times'', August 4, 1978</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] was less enthusiastic, giving the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and criticizing what he called the film's clich\u00e9d \"woman in trouble\" plot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eyes-of-laura-mars-1978 |title=Eyes of Laura Mars |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=1978|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2022, the film has an approval rating of 55% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10.

The side two reprise version does contain instrumentation from the film score at the beginning and during the first sections of the song, which is featured in its entirety.
