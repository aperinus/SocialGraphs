It stars [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Angela Bassett]]. The film's plot surrounds a retired [[Major League Baseball]] player who makes a comeback at age 47 in order to attain [[3,000 hit club|3,000 hits]]. ''Mr. 3000'' received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box-office flop]], grossing $21 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nStan Ross is the franchise player of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[baseball]] team. After recording his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th hit]], the selfish, narcissistic Ross immediately retires, leaving the team without one of its star players in the middle of the [[1995 Milwaukee Brewers season|1995]] [[Playoffs#Major League Baseball|playoff]] race, showing every bit of disregard for his teammates' feelings. During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name \"Mr. 3000\" that make him increasingly wealthy.\n\nIn 2004, the Brewers [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retire Ross' number]] to boost attendance for their now-struggling team. Although many fans do come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars [[Robin Yount]], [[Cecil Cooper]], and [[Paul Molitor]], stay away. Only his best friend Anthony (Boca) Carter and a [[middle relief pitcher]] from his early days in the majors named Bill (Big Horse) Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.\n\nRoss learns that, due to a [[clerical error]], he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]<ref name=\"hof\">Voters have elected all eligible ([[Pete Rose]] is ineligible) players with 3,000 or more hits to the Hall of Fame, except for controversial player [[Rafael Palmeiro]].</ref> and makes his \"Mr. 3000\" marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits, secure his place in the record books, and keep his local post-career marketing gimmick intact.\n\nA top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross' number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the [[September call-up|September roster expansion]]. The team's younger players only know of Ross as a self-centered player, and team superstar Rex \"T-Rex\" Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, sees him as unneeded and too old to play. Manager Gus Panas refuses to speak to Ross because of his abrupt retirement, and the [[sportswriting|sportswriters]] continually criticize him.\n\nDespite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form. He goes hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is reported by television sportscaster Maureen \"Mo\" Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.\n\nRoss becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes as a baseball star and to be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him \u2013 all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with [[Jay Leno]] and begin boasting again.\n\nIn his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to be a hero, Ross has a vision of his earlier years, when he was considered always dependable for the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] instead so the team can win a game and finish third in [[National League Central|its division]]. Although Ross never reaches the \"3,000\" milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame. He renames his businesses \"Mr. 2,999\", and is last seen driving an [[ice cream truck]] with the slogan \"2,999 possible combinations!\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Stan \"Mr. 3000\" Ross (#21, 1B)\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Maureen Simmons\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Anthony \"Boca\" Carter\n* [[Brian J.
