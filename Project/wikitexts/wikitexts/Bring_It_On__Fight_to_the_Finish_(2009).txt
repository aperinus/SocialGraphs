Lina not only finds herself a fish-out-of-her-environment at her new school, but she faces off against Avery, the wealthy, popular and ultra-competitive all-star cheerleading captain to qualify for a spot on her new school's cheerleading team. With the help of her new sheltered stepsister, Skylar, her former teammates, Gloria and Treyvonetta, and Sky's underachieving cheer team, the Sea Lions, they realize their full potential both on and off the court. But when Avery gets wind that Lina is not only coming after her cheer team but her younger brother, Evan, as well, Lina learns just how dirty she is willing to play.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Christina Milian]] as Catalina \"Lina\" Cruz\n* [[Rachele Brooke Smith]] as Avery Whitbourne\n* Cody Longo as Evan Whitbourne\n* Vanessa Born as Gloria\n* [[Gabrielle Dennis]] as Treyvonetta (Trey)\n* [[Holland Roden]] as Sky\n* [[Nikki SooHoo]] as Christina\n* [[Meagan Holder]] as Kayla\n* [[Laura Cer\u00f3n]] as Isabel Cruz\n* [[David Starzyk]] as Henry\n* Brandon Gonzales as Victor\n* [[Prima J]] as Themselves\n\n== Production {{Anchor|Production details|Production}}==\nThe movie was filmed at locations around [[Malibu, California|Malibu]].
