By 1864, almost all of the students, teachers, and slaves have left. In addition to Farnsworth herself, only five students and one teacher, Edwina Morrow, remain. While out in the woods searching for mushrooms, Amy, a pupil, comes across John McBurney, a [[corporal]] in the [[Union Army]] who was wounded in the leg during battle, and has since [[Desertion|deserted]]. Amy brings McBurney to the school where he falls unconscious. The women lock McBurney in one of the rooms while Miss Farnsworth tends to his wounds. All the women and girls in the school are immediately fascinated by the handsome man.\n\nInitially, some of the school's residents want McBurney to be delivered as a [[prisoner of war]] to the [[Confederate Army]], but Miss Farnsworth decides that they will let his leg heal before they decide what they will do with him. When Confederate soldiers arrive at the school, Miss Farnsworth does not tell them that a Union soldier is on the premises. While McBurney is recovering, the women and girls subtly vie for his affection by giving him presents, wearing jewelry, and preparing a lavish dinner for him. He returns the affection, concentrating especially on Miss Morrow and Miss Farnsworth. When he is able to move again, he begins to help in the garden. It becomes clear that he fears returning to battle.\n\nWhen Miss Farnsworth indicates that McBurney is healthy enough and will have to leave the school in a few days, he tries to convince her to let him stay as a gardener, and tells Miss Morrow that he has fallen in love with her. One night, he tells Miss Morrow to await him in her room. When he does not appear and she hears strange noises, she investigates and finds him in bed with Alicia, a teenage pupil. McBurney tries to calm the angry Miss Morrow down, but she pushes him away, causing him to fall down the stairs, badly break his already injured leg and fall unconscious. Miss Farnsworth decides that the only way to save his life is to amputate the leg.\n\nWhen he awakes the next day and realizes he has lost his leg, McBurney is devastated and furious, accusing the women (and especially Miss Farnsworth) of having punished him for choosing Alicia's room instead of theirs. He is locked up in his room but threatens Alicia, who gets him the room key. He then breaks out, steals a gun, and loudly threatens the women before storming off. Miss Morrow follows him to his room, where she initiates a sexual encounter.\n\nMeanwhile Miss Farnsworth tries to find a solution. One of the students suggests killing McBurney by preparing him a dinner of [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]], to which Miss Farnsworth agrees. During the dinner, Miss Morrow, unaware of the plan, is deterred by the others at the last minute from putting the mushrooms on her own plate, but McBurney's suspicions are not aroused. Promptly after eating the mushrooms, he falls to the floor in the throes of death. While the others are sewing McBurney's body into a [[shroud]], Miss Morrow looks on, devastated. The film ends with the women dragging McBurney's body to the road so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by.\n\n==Cast==\n <!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Miss Martha Farnsworth\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Corporal John McBurney\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Miss Edwina Morrow\n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Alicia\n* [[Oona Laurence]] as Amy\n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Jane\n* [[Addison Riecke]] as Marie\n* Emma Howard as Emily\n* [[Wayne P\u00e9r\u00e9|Wayne Pere]] as The Captain\n* Matt Story as Confederate Soldier\n* Joel Albin as Cavalry Man\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is based on the 1966 book of the same name by author [[Thomas P.
