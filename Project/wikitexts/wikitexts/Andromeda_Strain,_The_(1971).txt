Retrieved May 21, 2012.</ref>\n}}\n'''''The Andromeda Strain''''' is a 1971 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] produced and directed by [[Robert Wise]]. Based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1969 [[The Andromeda Strain|novel of the same name]] and adapted by [[Nelson Gidding]], the film stars [[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]], [[James Olson (actor)|James Olson]], [[Kate Reid]], and [[David Wayne]] as a team of scientists who investigate a deadly organism of [[Outer space|extraterrestrial]] origin. With a few exceptions, the film follows the book closely. The [[special effect]]s were designed by [[Douglas Trumbull]]. The film is notable for its use of [[split screen (video production)|split screen]] in certain scenes.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Main Control in The Andromeda Strain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Main Control Laboratory at the Wildfire complex<br />{{Ffdc|1=Main Control in The Andromeda Strain.jpg|log=2017 August 27}}]] -->\nThe story unfolds in flashback, told by Dr. Jeremy Stone as he testifies before the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|United States Senate Committee on Space Sciences]] in 1971:\n\nAfter a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] satellite crashes near the small rural town of Piedmont, [[New Mexico]] on February 5, nearly all the residents are dead. A military recovery team from [[Vandenberg Space Force Base|Vandenberg Air Force Base]] tries to recover the satellite but is unsuccessful. Suspecting that the satellite has brought back an [[extraterrestrial life|alien organism]], the military activates an elite team of scientists.\n\nWearing [[environmental suit|protective suits]], Dr. Stone, the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall, a surgeon, are dropped into Piedmont by helicopter. They discover the town's doctor opened the satellite in his office and that all of his blood has crystallized into a powder. They soon discover that almost all of the town's victims' blood has crystallized, causing rapid death. Two other townspeople have committed suicide after going insane. Stone and Hall retrieve the satellite and find two survivors, a 69-year-old [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] man named Peter Jackson and a six-month-old crying infant, Manuel Rios.\n\nIn addition to Stone and Hall, the elite team also includes Dr. Charles Dutton and Dr. Ruth Leavitt, who are summoned to a top-secret Nevada underground facility, code named Wildfire. Upon arrival, they undergo extreme decontamination procedures, descending through four disinfection levels to a fifth level where laboratories are located. This underground lab complex has sophisticated technology, including [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] computer displays and [[lasers]]. If the organism threatens to escape, the Wildfire facility includes an automatic nuclear [[self-destruct]] mechanism to incinerate all [[Pathogen|infectious agents]]. Under the \"[[odd man hypothesis]]\", Dr. Hall is entrusted with the only key that can deactivate the device, the theory being that an unmarried male is the most dispassionate person within a group to make critical decisions in a crisis.\n\nBy examining the satellite with powerful cameras, the team discovers the microscopic [[Introduced species|alien organism]] causing the deaths in New Mexico. The greenish, throbbing life form is assigned the code name \"Andromeda.\" Inhaled through the lungs, Andromeda kills biological life almost instantly via a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] in the [[brain]] and [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] causing [[asphyxiation]]. It appears to be highly [[Virulence|virulent]]. The team studies the organism using animal subjects, an [[electron microscope]], and [[microbiological culture|culturing]] in various [[growth medium|growth media]] in an attempt to learn how it behaves. The microbe contains [[chemical element]]s required for terrestrial life ([[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]]) and appears to have a crystalline structure, but lacks the [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[protein]]s, and [[amino acid]]s present in all forms of terrestrial life, and directly [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|transforms energy to matter]] with no discernible byproducts. Hall tries to determine why the two Piedmont residents survived.\n\nA military jet crashes near Piedmont after the pilot radios that his plastic [[oxygen mask]] is dissolving. Meanwhile, Dr. Stone, who created the Wildfire laboratory, is accused by Dutton and Leavitt of designing the lab for [[biological warfare]] research. Unknown to other team members, Leavitt's research on the germ is impaired by her undisclosed [[epilepsy]].\n\nHall realizes that the alcoholic Jackson survived because his blood was acidic from drinking [[Sterno]], and that the baby lived due to his blood being too alkaline from constant crying, suggesting that the organism, Andromeda, can survive only within a narrow range of [[Acid\u2013base homeostasis|blood pH]]. Just as he has this insight, the organism mutates into a non-lethal form that degrades [[synthetic rubber]] and [[plastic]]s. Andromeda escapes the [[biocontainment|containment]] room into the lab where Dutton is working. Once all the laboratory's seals start decaying due to Andromeda's escape, a five-minute countdown to nuclear destruction is initiated.\n\nHall rescues Leavitt from an [[epileptic seizure]], triggered by the flashing red lights of Wildfire's alarm system. Meanwhile, the team realizes that the microbe would thrive on the energy of a [[nuclear explosion]] and would consequently be transformed into a super-colony that could destroy all life on Earth. Hall races against the laboratory's automated defenses to reach a station where he can disable the nuclear bomb with his key. He endures multiple attacks by automated lasers as he climbs through the laboratory's central core. He finds a working station, disables the bomb with seconds to spare, and collapses.\n\nHall awakens in a hospital. His colleagues reveal that clouds are being [[cloud seeding|seeded]] over the [[Pacific Ocean]], which will cause rain to sweep Andromeda from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and into [[alkali]]ne [[seawater]], rendering it harmless. Stone finishes testifying to a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] by saying that while they were able to defeat the alien pathogen, they may be unable to do so in the future. The film ends with a computer feed suddenly stopping and the computer flashing the number \"601\", the Wildfire code for information coming in too fast to analyze.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Arthur Hill (Canadian actor)|Arthur Hill]] as Dr. Jeremy Stone\n*[[James Olson (actor)|James Olson]] as Dr. Mark Hall\n*[[David Wayne]] as Dr. Charles Dutton\n*[[Kate Reid]] as Dr. Ruth Leavitt\n*[[Paula Kelly (actress)|Paula Kelly]] as Karen Anson (nurse, laboratory technician)\n*[[George Mitchell (actor)|George Mitchell]] as Mr. Peter Jackson (Piedmont)\n*[[Mark Jenkins (actor)|Mark Jenkins]] as Lt.

Screenwriter [[Nelson Gidding]] suggested the change to Wise, who at first was not enthusiastic, as he initially pictured the female Dr. Leavitt as a largely [[Physical attractiveness|decorative]] character reminiscent of [[Raquel Welch]]'s character in the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''. When Gidding explained his take on Leavitt, Wise resolved the question by asking the opinion of a number of scientists, who were unanimously enthusiastic about the idea. Eventually Wise came to be very happy with the decision to make Leavitt female, feeling that Kate Reid's Dr. Leavitt was \"the most interesting character\" in the film.<ref>''The Making of The Andromeda Strain'', DVD documentary.</ref> Another minor change was the character of Burton in the novel, who became Charles Dutton in the film; no reason was given for this name change.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n''The Andromeda Strain'' was one of the first films to use advanced computerized photographic visual effects, with work by [[Douglas Trumbull]], who had pioneered effects for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', along with James Shourt and [[Albert Whitlock]] who worked on ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''.<ref name=\"filmsite\" /> Reportedly $250,000 of the film's budget of $6.5&nbsp;million was used to create the special effects, including Trumbull's simulation of an electron microscope.<ref>[http://vfxvoice.com/douglas-trumbull-ves-advancing-new-technologies-for-the-future-of-film/ DOUGLAS TRUMBULL, VES: Advancing New Technologies for the Future of Film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626001420/http://vfxvoice.com/douglas-trumbull-ves-advancing-new-technologies-for-the-future-of-film/ |date=June 26, 2018 }} VFXVoice.com.
