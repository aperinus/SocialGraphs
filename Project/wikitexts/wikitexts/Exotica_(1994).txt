Set primarily in the fictional Exotica [[strip club]] in [[Toronto]], the film concerns a father grieving over the loss of a child and obsessed with a young stripper. It was inspired by Egoyan's curiosity about the role strip clubs play in sex-obsessed societies. ''Exotica'' was filmed in Toronto in 1993.\n\nMarketed as an erotic thriller on its release in Canada and the United States, the film proved to be a major box office success for English Canadian cinema, and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, including the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] and eight [[15th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n== Plot ==\nFrancis Brown, a [[auditor|tax auditor]] for [[Canada Revenue Agency|Revenue Canada]], is a regular visitor to a Toronto [[strip club]] called Exotica. He always has Christina, an [[exotic dancer]]  dressed in a [[Uniform fetishism|schoolgirl uniform]], give him a private dance. This inspires the jealousy of the club's DJ, Eric, Christina's former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club's owner, Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold's teenage daughter, Tracey, to \"babysit\". However, Francis has no children and the girl merely practices music alone on his piano until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis' friendship with Harold is strained, as Francis found out that Harold and Francis' wife were having an affair after she died in a car accident, which also left Harold a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]]. Francis' daughter Lisa was kidnapped and murdered a few months before the accident, and he was one of the suspects but was later exonerated. These events have left a huge psychological scar on Francis.\n\nIn his professional life, Francis is sent to audit an [[exotic pet]] store owned and operated by Thomas Pinto, an introverted [[gay men|gay]] man profiting from the illegal import of a rare bird species. Thomas has been smuggling [[hyacinth macaw]] eggs, and his operation has afforded him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, spurring suspicion from Canadian authorities. Francis soon discovers these illegal activities in Thomas' financial records.\n\nFrancis is eventually banned from Exotica when Eric manipulates him into touching Christina during one of her dances, violating the club's rules. Having realized that Eric intentionally set out to get Francis banned from the club, he vows to murder him. Armed with the knowledge of Thomas's tax evasion, Francis [[blackmail]]s Thomas into visiting Exotica, and instructs him to touch Christina during one of her dances, so that Thomas too will be kicked out of the club; Francis intends to use this as an opportunity to infiltrate the club and murder Eric.\n\nFrancis affixes Thomas with a [[Covert listening device|wiretap]] so that he can listen in on Thomas's visit to Exotica. While Christina gives Thomas a lap dance, he attempts to glean information from her, and the two have a conversation which Francis listens to from his parked car. Christina explains to Thomas that she and Francis share a relationship of mutual dependency, and reveals to Thomas personal details about Francis's life, specifically his daughter's murder. A distraught Francis exits his car and waits for Eric outside the club. Confronting Eric with a gun, Francis is defused when Eric reveals he and Christina, who met each other while volunteering in a search party for the missing Lisa, were the ones who discovered Lisa's dead body. Francis embraces Eric.\n\nIn a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Francis drives a teenage Christina\u2014who, at that time, worked for Francis and his wife as Lisa's babysitter\u2014to her parents' home. During these routine drives, Francis would often comfort Christina over her troubled home life. As Francis drops Christina off at her house, he assures her that she can always confide in him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Francis Brown\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Eric\n* [[Mia Kirshner]] as Christina\n* [[Don McKellar]] as Thomas Pinto\n* [[Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian]] as Zoe\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Tracey Brown\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Harold Brown\n* [[David Hemblen]] as Customs inspector\n* Calvin Green as Customs officer\n* Peter Krantz as Man in taxi\n* [[Damon D'Oliveira]] as Man at opera\n* [[Jack Blum]] as Scalper\n* [[Billy Merasty]] as Man at opera\n* [[Ken McDougall]] as Doorman\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Atom Egoyan Arsinee Khanjian.jpg|upright|thumb|Director [[Atom Egoyan]] focused on [[strip club]]s as outlets for society's sexual obsessions, while his pregnant wife [[Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian]] played Zoe.]]\nDirector [[Atom Egoyan]], who wrote the screenplay, first conceived of the story in the fall of 1992, intrigued by the ritualistic nature of [[table dance]]s and the rule that clients can not touch the dancers, envisioning a story of a dancer having a main customer.<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite web|url=http://playbackonline.ca/1994/09/12/3748-19940912/ |title=Exotica |last=Lee |first=Janice |date=12 September 1994 |access-date=12 August 2016 |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]}}</ref> He believed a strip club could be an important setting for a film because of society's sexual obsessions, and the roles of such clubs as \"a collective sexual outlet\".
