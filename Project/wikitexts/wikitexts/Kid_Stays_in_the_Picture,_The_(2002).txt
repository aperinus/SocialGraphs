A [[film adaptation]] of the book was released in 2002.\n\nThe title comes from a line attributed to studio head [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who was defending Evans after some of the actors involved in the film ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957) had recommended he be removed from the cast.\n\nThe film adaptation was directed by [[Nanette Burstein]] and [[Brett Morgen]] and released by [[USA Films]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3110701/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Kid Stays in the Picture |access-date=2009-11-04 |work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Book===\nThe book chronicles Evans' rise from childhood to radio star to film actor to production chief of [[Paramount Pictures]] to independent producer, his marriage to [[Ali MacGraw]], his downfall including his 1980 cocaine bust and implication in the murder of [[Roy Radin]], aka \"The Cotton Club Murder\", his banishment from Paramount Pictures, and his return to the studio in the early 1990s.\n\nThe audiobook version was read by Evans himself, with (presumably impromptu) additions.\n\nA revised edition of the book, published in 1995, adds several chapters of new material, including material on his projects after his return to Paramount Pictures.\n\n===Film===\nThe film version, released in 2002, uses Evans' narration interspersed mostly with photographs from Evans' life as well as brief film footage from films such as ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'', ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and ''[[The Godfather]]'', along with interviews to tell the story from his discovery by [[Norma Shearer]] for ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957) to his return to Paramount Pictures.\n\nAccording to the commentary by directors Burstein and Morgen on the DVD, many elements from the book, such as Evans' childhood and his other marriages (the film concentrates only on his marriage to Ali MacGraw), were dropped because they felt they did not move the story along.\n\n==Critical response==\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 7.69/10.
