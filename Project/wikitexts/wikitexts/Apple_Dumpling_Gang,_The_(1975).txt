The plot is about a slick gambler named Russell Donovan ([[Bill Bixby]]) who is duped into taking care of a group of orphans who eventually strike gold. The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]].\n\nThe film is based on the 1971 [[The Apple Dumpling Gang|novel of the same name]] by [[Jack M. Bickham]]. Don Tait wrote the screenplay. The so-called \"Apple Dumpling Gang\" are named after their favorite American dessert treat, the [[apple dumpling]]. It is also known as being the first film to feature the comedy duo of [[Don Knotts]] and [[Tim Conway]].<ref name=don>{{cite book|title=The Incredible Mr. Don Knotts|last1=Cox|first1=Stephen|last2=Marhanka|first2=Kevin|publisher=Cumberland House|isbn=9781581826586|year=2008|page=125}}</ref> Knotts and Conway developed different styles of pulling off their comedy; Conway's characters were usually the less intelligent of the two, which made Knotts usually the brains of the group, though they were both equally inept. [[Paul J. Smith (composer)|Paul J. Smith]] and [[Buddy Baker (composer)|Buddy Baker]] composed the music for it and its 1979 sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]''. The song \"The Apple Dumpling Gang\", as heard in the opening and [[closing credits]], was composed by Shane Tatum and was sung/performed by [[Randy Sparks]] and [[The Back Porch Majority]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the [[Wild West]] in the year 1879, a slick gambler named Russell Donovan (Bill Bixby) comes to the town of Quake City en route to open a casino in [[New Orleans]]. In Quake City, Donovan meets his old associate, John Whintle. Whintle is leaving for [[San Francisco]] that night and asks Donovan to sign for valuables coming in on tomorrow\u2019s [[stagecoach]]. Donovan accepts a down payment and promises to pick up the valuables. The next day, Donovan realizes he has been duped into taking care of three little orphans, Bobby, Clovis, and Celia Bradley. The stagecoach driver Magnolia \u201cDusty\u201d Clydesdale ([[Susan Clark]]) explains that Whintle is in fact the children\u2019s relative and their de facto legal guardian. With their relative gone and Donovan promising to care for the \u201cvaluables\u201d, they are now wards of Donovan.\n\nThe town's [[sheriff]], [[barber]], [[Justice of the Peace]], and judge Homer McCoy ([[Harry Morgan]]) tells Donovan that he is legally obligated unless he can have someone else take custody of the children. The children inadvertently cause Donovan much grief by offending all prospective new guardians. The Bradleys wreak havoc in Quake City while riding in an old mine cart destroying much private property. The town\u2019s citizens demand that Donovan pay for the damages, losing him most of his funds for his trip to New Orleans.\n\nAs soon as Donovan arrived in Quake City, he is the target of the \u201cHashknife Outfit\u201d. The Outfit consists of two ne\u2019er-do-well former members of the Stillwell Gang, Amos Tucker ([[Tim Conway]]) and Theodore Ogelvie ([[Don Knotts]]). They were once very threatening, until they were ousted by their former boss, Frank Stillwell ([[Slim Pickens]]), for shooting him in the leg. Amos and Theodore continuously try to rob Donovan during his stay in town to miserable results.\n\nBobby, Clovis, and Celia decide to help their guardian make money by going to the gold mine that they inherited. They come across Amos and Theodore at their hideout and become acquainted. They direct the kids to the mine after mistaking them for a posse. Despite the gold veins drying up years previously, the Bradley children end up finding a massive gold nugget. This incentivizes many people to adopt the children as it would give them access to the gold. Fearing that the people would not have the children's best interests at heart, Donovan has arranged a sham marriage with Dusty so she can keep custody of the Bradley children while he goes to New Orleans. However, things become complicated when Whintle returns. Whintle has heard of the gold and schemes to get the children back. His attorney has a court order demanding immediate return of the Bradleys. McCoy is forced to adhere to Whintle\u2019s demands.\n\nAt the same time, Amos and Theodore attempt to steal the Bradleys' gold from the local bank and escape to Mexico. The Hashknife Outfit proves unsuccessful when they try to enter the skylight and wrap themselves up in their rope used for rappelling down. McCoy finds them guilty for attempted robbery and sentences them to hang to scare them out of town.  The two men flee to their hideout.\n\nThe Stillwell Gang enters town and plans to steal the nugget. Frank impersonates a priest to gain more information about the transportation of the gold from Colonel T.R. Clydesdale ([[David Wayne]]). Frank is able to coerce Colonel Clydesdale into disclosing the time and place the nugget will be moved. The children, who have grown attached to Donovan and Dusty, go to Theodore and Amos and give them permission to steal the gold. If the gold goes missing, Whintle will have no more desire for the children and will return custody.\n\nThe next day, the Stillwell Gang enters the bank and takes the nugget. Simultaneously, the kids help the Hashknife Outfit rob the bank. Amos and Theodore are recognized by Frank and are almost killed. They are saved when one of the Stillwell Gang starts a shootout with the lawmen and distracts Frank. Frank decides to leave the gold and escape, taking Celia as a hostage. Donovan saves her from Stillwell with the help of Dusty and they realize their love for one another and embrace. Amos and Theodore retreat to the bank\u2019s safe to escape gunfire. Their dynamite is shot by one of the townsfolk, obliterating the bank and the gold nugget gets blown into many smaller nuggets. Whintle renounces his guardianship and leaves town. Stillwell\u2019s bounty is awarded to Donovan, giving him enough money for his casino in New Orleans. He instead buys a ranch for himself, Dusty, and the Bradley children. While on their way to the ranch, a reformed Amos and Theodore catch up with the newfound family asking for work as farmhands, to which Donovan agrees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bill Bixby]] as Russell Donovan\n*[[Susan Clark]] as Magnolia Dusty Clydesdale\n*[[Don Knotts]] as Theodore Ogelvie\n*[[Tim Conway]] as Amos Tucker\n*[[David Wayne]] as Col.
