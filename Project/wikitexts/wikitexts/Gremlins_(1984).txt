It draws on legends of folkloric mischievous creatures that cause malfunctions\u2014\"[[gremlin]]s\"\u2014in the British [[Royal Air Force]] going back to [[World War II]].

[[Steven Spielberg]] was the film's [[executive producer]], with the film being [[Film producer|produced]] by [[Michael Finnell]].\n\n''Gremlins'' was theatrically released on June 8, 1984 by [[Warner Bros.]] to a critical and commercial success. However, it was heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences.  In response to this and to similar complaints about ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |access-date=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128082721/https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |access-date=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG |archive-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127205822/https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |url-status=live }}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

Inside, Randall encounters a small, furry creature called a {{lang|yue-Latn|mogwai}} ([[Cantonese]]: {{wikt-lang|yue|\u9b54\u602a}}, 'devil'). The owner, Mr. Wing, refuses to sell Randall the creature, but his grandson secretly does, warning Randall to remember three important rules: do not expose the ''mogwai'' to light, especially sunlight, which will kill it; do not let it come in contact with water; and above all, never feed it after midnight.\n\nRandall returns home to Kingston Falls where he gives the ''mogwai'' to Billy as a pet. Billy works in the local bank, but fears that his dog Barney will be put down by the widowed, miser Mrs. Deagle. Randall names the ''mogwai'' \"Gizmo\" and explains the three rules. When Billy's young friend Pete accidentally spills water over Gizmo, five more ''mogwai'' spawn from his back, a more troublemaking sort led by the aggressive Stripe, named for the tuft of fur on his head. Billy shows one of the ''mogwai'' to his former elementary school science teacher, Mr. Hanson, spawning another ''mogwai'', on whom Hanson experiments. Back at home, Stripe and his fellow ''mogwai'' trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by severing the power cord on his alarm clock. They form [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s, as does Hanson's ''mogwai'', which soon hatch, emerging as mischievous, dark green, reptilian monsters, who then torture Gizmo and attack Billy's mother, Lynn. Hanson is killed by his gremlin.\n\nLynn and Billy are able to kill off the gremlins, except for Stripe, who escapes to a local [[YMCA]]. There, Stripe jumps into the [[swimming pool]], spawning an army of gremlins who wreak havoc in Kingston Falls. Many people are injured or outright killed by the gremlins' rampage, including Mrs. Deagle.\n\nAs Billy rescues his girlfriend, Kate Beringer, they hide in the now-abandoned bank where Kate reveals to Billy and Gizmo why she hates Christmas: when she was nine years old, her father went missing on [[Christmas Eve]] and did not come home on [[Christmas Day]] either; several days later, he was found dead in their chimney while dressed as [[Santa Claus]]. Planning to surprise her and her mother, he had accidentally slipped and broken his neck while climbing down the chimney. Still suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] because of the event, Kate confesses this is how she discovered the truth about Santa Claus.\n\nBilly and Kate discover that the town has fallen silent and the gremlins are watching ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in the local theater. They set off a natural gas explosion, incinerating all the gremlins except for Stripe, who left to commandeer more candy at a [[Montgomery Ward]] store across the street. As morning approaches, they follow Stripe into the department store, where Stripe attempts to use a [[water fountain]] to spawn more gremlins. Gizmo opens a [[skylight]], exposing Stripe to sunlight, killing him.\n\nAs the local news reports on the day's mysterious tragedies, Mr. Wing reclaims Gizmo at the Peltzer home. He criticizes both the Peltzers' and [[Western world|Western society]] for their carelessness with Nature. However, as he turns to leave, Gizmo, having bonded with Billy, bids the young man goodbye. A touched Mr. Wing then concedes that Billy may be ready one day, and until then, Gizmo will be waiting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Zach Galligan]] as Billy Peltzer\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Kate Beringer\n* [[Hoyt Axton]] as Randall \"Rand\" Peltzer\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Ruby Deagle\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Lynn Peltzer\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Gerald Hopkins\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Murray Futterman\n* [[Glynn Turman]] as Roy Hanson\n* [[Keye Luke]] as Mr. Wing\n* [[Scott Brady]] as Sheriff Frank Reilly\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Pete Fountaine\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Deputy Brent Frye\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Roland Corben\n* [[Jackie Joseph]] as Sheila Futterman\n* [[Belinda Balaski]] as Mrs. Joe Harris\n* [[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Mr. Anderson\n* [[Nicky Katt]] and [[Tracy Wells]] as Schoolchildren\n*  John Louie as Mr. Wing's Grandson\n*  Kenny Davis as Dorry\n*  Mushroom as Barney\n* [[John C.

According to Professor [[No\u00ebl Carroll]], ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', released the same weekend as ''Gremlins'', and the comic strip ''[[The Far Side]]'' also followed this trend. Carroll argued that there was now a new genre emphasizing sudden shifts between humorous and horrific scenes, drawing laughs with plot elements that have been traditionally used to scare.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carroll |first=No\u00ebl |date=Spring 1999 |title=Horror and Humor |journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism: Aesthetics and Popular Culture |volume=57 |number=2 |page=145|doi=10.1111/1540_6245.jaac57.2.0145 }}</ref>\n\nThe notion of gremlins was first conceived during the 1920s when mechanical failures in [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircraft were jokingly blamed on the small monsters. The term \"gremlins\" also entered popular culture as children's author and RAF pilot [[Roald Dahl]] published a book called ''[[The Gremlins]]'' in 1943, based on the mischievous creatures.{{sfn|Bilstein|2001|p=318}} [[Walt Disney]] considered making a film of it. A [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon of the era, ''[[Falling Hare]]'', has him battling a gremlin on an airplane. Joe Dante had read ''The Gremlins'' and said that the book was of some influence on his film. In 1983, Dante publicly distanced his work from earlier films, explaining, \"Our gremlins are somewhat different\u2014they're sort of green and they have big mouths and they smile a lot and they do incredibly, really nasty things to people and enjoy it all the while\".<ref name=\"Featurette\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Joe Dante|Dante, Joe]], [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg, Steven]] |date=2002 |title=Gremlins: Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Joe Dante|Dante, Joe]] |date=2002 |title=Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins'' Special edition audio commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Chris Columbus.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] conceived of the idea for ''Gremlins'' and wrote the initial draft as a [[spec script]].]]\nThe story of ''Gremlins'' was conceived by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]. As Columbus explained, his inspiration came from his loft, when at night \"what sounded like a platoon of mice would come out and to hear them skittering around in the blackness was really creepy\".<ref name=\"Behind Scenes\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Columbus, Chris]] |date=2002 |title=Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins'': Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref> He then wrote the original screenplay as a [[spec script]] to show potential employers that he had writing abilities. The story was not actually intended to be filmed until Steven Spielberg took an interest in turning it into a film.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> As Spielberg explained, \"It's one of the most original things I've come across in many years, which is why I bought it.\"<ref name=\"Featurette\" />\n\nAfter deciding to executive produce the film, Spielberg chose Dante as his director because of his experience with horror-comedy; Dante had previously directed ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling (1981)]]''; however, in the time between ''The Howling'' and the offer to film ''Gremlins'', he had experienced a lull in his career.<ref name=\"DVD\" />  Dante began doing storyboard work on the film while also working as a director on ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), a film which Spielberg also served as a director on.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_037_c2c_1984_Gremlins_smog777-DREGS|title=Gremlins director Joe Dante provides a behind-the-scenes look at this summer's big-budget creature-feature.|last=Everitt|first=David|publisher=Fangoria (37)|year=1984|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_037_c2c_1984_Gremlins_smog777-DREGS/page/n21 20]\u201322}}</ref> The film's producer was [[Michael Finnell]], who had also worked on ''The Howling'' with Dante. Spielberg took the project to Warner Bros. and co-produced it through his own company, [[Amblin Entertainment]].\n\nThe film's script went through a few drafts before a shooting script was finalized. The first version was much darker than the final film. Various scenes were cut, including one which portrayed Billy's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins, with her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives. Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted. There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy's dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a [[McDonald's]], eating customers instead of burgers. Also, instead of Stripe being a ''mogwai'' who becomes a gremlin, there was originally no ''mogwai'' named Stripe; rather, Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin. Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo was cute and that audiences would want him to be present throughout the film.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nThe film mentions an urban legend<ref>{{cite web | title=Santa Claustrophobia | url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/santa-claustrophobia/ | work=[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]] | date=October 23, 1999 | access-date=December 7, 2020 | archive-date=May 3, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503010423/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/santa-claustrophobia/ | url-status=live }}</ref> in which Kate reveals in a speech that her father died at Christmas when he dressed as [[Santa Claus]] and broke his neck while climbing down the family's chimney. After the film was completed, studio executives insisted upon its removal, because they felt it was too ambiguous as to whether it was supposed to be funny or sad. Dante refused to take the scene out, saying it represented the film as a whole, which had a combination of horrific and comedic elements. Spielberg did not like the scene but, despite his creative control, he viewed ''Gremlins'' as Dante's project and allowed him to leave it in.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> A parody of this scene is featured in ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]''.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Zach Galligan at the Chiller Theatre Expo in NJ, October 26, 2013.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Zach Galligan]] was a relatively unknown actor when cast as the lead character Billy.]]\n[[Phoebe Cates]] was cast as Kate, Billy's girlfriend, despite concerns that she was known for playing more risqu\u00e9 parts, such as Linda Barrett in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982). Spielberg urged the casting of the relatively unknown [[Zach Galligan]] as Billy because he saw chemistry between Galligan and Cates during auditions. Galligan later compared himself to Billy, saying he was a \"geeky kid\", and that being in the film \"was really kind of a dream\" given \"what I get to do, what my character gets to do, blow up movie theatres\", adding that he \"got to work with great people\".<ref name=\"Galligan\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Zach Galligan|Galligan, Zach]], [[Joe Dante|Dante, Joe]] |date=2002 |title=Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins'' Special edition audio commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref>  Spielberg commented when Galligan was testing with Cates that \"he's in love with her already\" and that was how Galligan won the part.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Jack|title=How we made Gremlins|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/04/how-we-made-gremlins-steven-spielberg-joe-dante-zach-galligan|access-date=4 December 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 December 2017|archive-date=December 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204232250/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/04/how-we-made-gremlins-steven-spielberg-joe-dante-zach-galligan|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Galligan, many of the supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor [[Glynn Turman]] portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn ''mogwai'' leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and emerges as a vicious gremlin. [[Dick Miller]], who was a regular in Dante's films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a [[World War II]] veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by [[Hoyt Axton]], who was always the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role even though it was widely contested by other actors.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Axton's experience included acting as the father in ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to ''Gremlins'' was cut, Axton's voice earned him the added role of the narrator to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by [[Keye Luke]], a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality he was around 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n[[Corey Feldman]], who up to that time had primarily been in commercials, played Pete Fountaine, establishing his early credentials as a child actor. [[Polly Holliday]], an actress best known for her role in ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', played Mrs. Deagle. Dante considered the casting fortunate, as she was well-known and he considered her to be talented. Two other well-known actors, ''Fast Times''{{'}} [[Judge Reinhold]] and character actor [[Edward Andrews]], received roles that were significantly reduced after the film was edited; they played Billy's superiors at the bank.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n=== Special effects ===\n[[File:HowieMandelM07.jpg|upright|thumb|Comedian [[Howie Mandel]] provided the voice for Gizmo.]]\nSome of the performances were shot on the [[Courthouse Square]] and [[Colonial Street]] sets of the [[Universal Studios Lot]] in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], California (Mrs. Deagle's house was one such set as well as the opening street scenes in Chinatown, which were filmed on the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]] backlot). This required fake snow; Dante also felt it was an atmosphere that would make the special effects more convincing. As the special effects relied mainly on puppetry (an earlier attempt to use [[monkey]]s was abandoned because the test monkey panicked when made to wear a gremlin head),<ref name=Empire>{{cite web |url=https://empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=41383 |title=Gremlins Reunion: First Look At The Empire Photoshoot |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date=25 June 2014 |access-date=26 June 2014 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130414/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=41383 |url-status=live }}</ref> the actors worked alongside some of the puppets. Nevertheless, after the actors finished their work for good, a great deal of effort was spent finishing the effects. Numerous small rubber puppets, some of which were mechanical, were used to portray Gizmo and the gremlins. They were designed by [[Chris Walas]]. There was more than one Gizmo puppet, and occasionally Galligan, when carrying one, would set him down off camera, and when Gizmo appeared again sitting on a surface it was actually a different puppet wired to the surface. These puppets had many limitations. The Gizmo puppets were particularly frustrating because they were smaller and thus broke down more. While Walas recommended making the ''mogwais'' larger to make their creation and functioning easier for the special effects team, Dante insisted on keeping their size small to enhance the cuteness of the creatures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_038|title=Chris Walas|last=Martin|first=R. H.|publisher=Fangoria (38)|date=October 1984|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_038/page/n44 44]\u201345}}</ref> Consequently, to satisfy the crew, a scene was included in which the gremlins hang Gizmo on a wall and throw darts at him. This was included on a list that the crew created known to them as the \"Horrible Things to do to Gizmo\" list.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nA few [[marionette]]s were also used. Other effects required large ''mogwai'' faces and ears to be produced for close-ups, as the puppets were less capable of conveying emotion. Consequently, large props simulating food were needed for the close-ups in the scene in which the ''mogwai'' feast after midnight. An enlarged Gizmo puppet was also needed for the scene in which he multiplies. The new ''mogwai'', who popped out of Gizmo's body as small, furry balls which then started to grow, were balloons and expanded as such. Walas had also created the exploding gremlin in the microwave by means of a balloon that was allowed to burst.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n[[Howie Mandel]] provided the voice for Gizmo, and prolific voice actor [[Frank Welker]] provided the voice for Stripe. It was Welker who suggested Mandel perform in ''Gremlins''. The puppets' lines were mostly invented by the voice actors, based on cues from the physical actions of the puppets, which were filmed before the voice work. When developing the voice for Gizmo, Mandel explained, \"[Gizmo was] cute and naive, so, you know, I got in touch with that...

The novel offered an origin for ''mogwai'' and gremlins as a prologue. Supposedly, ''mogwai'' were created as gentle, contemplative creatures by a scientist on an [[alien world]]. However, it was discovered their [[physiology]] was unstable. The end result was only 1 in 10,000 ''mogwai'' would retain their sweet, loving demeanor. The rest would change into creatures the novel referred to as \"mischievous\".  The minority ''mogwai'' (the 1 in 10,000) are immortal by human standards, though Gizmo explains to Stripe if he were to undergo the transformation himself, he would become like the others, \"short lived and violent.\" This origin is unique to the novel but is referred to in the novelization of ''Gremlins 2'' by [[David Bischoff]]. No definitive origin for ''mogwai'' or gremlins is given in either ''Gremlins'' film. The novelization contains a subplot that was cut from the original film, where the [[National Guard]] plans to neutralize the gremlins with fire hoses.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{Main|Gremlins (video game)}}\n{{anchor|gremlins_5200}}{{anchor|gremlins_un}}{{anchor|gremlins_vs}}\n\n==== Action-oriented video games ====\nSeveral officially licensed [[video game]]s based on the film have been produced.
