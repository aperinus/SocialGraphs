The sequel to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990), it is the second installment in the original trilogy. Directed by [[Michael Pressman]] and written by [[Todd W. Langen]], the film stars [[Paige Turco]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] with the voices of [[Brian Tochi]], [[Robbie Rist]], Adam Carl, and Laurie Faso.\n\nThe film follows the adventures of the four Turtles, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], and their [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Master Splinter]]. Resuming from the events of the last film, the villain, [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]], returns to take back command of the [[Foot Clan]], and work towards getting revenge on the Turtles. When he learns the secret behind the Turtles' mutation, he becomes more dangerous than ever. The film sheds some light on the origins of Splinter and the Turtles, as well as introduces two new villains, [[Tokka and Rahzar]]. Unlike the first film, it differs in the use of the Turtles' weapons. They instead fight bare-fisted for much of this film, as part of an attempt to tone down the violence of the previous installment.<ref name=\"janetmaslin\" />\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on March 22, 1991, by [[New Line Cinema]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who felt it departed from the much darker tone of the original 1990 film. However, it was financially successful, grossing $78.7 million against a budget of $20 million, becoming the thirteenth highest-grossing film domestically in the year of its release.<ref name=\"yearlyboxoffice\">{{cite web | title=1991 Domestic Grosses| work=Boxofficemojo.com | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=wide&view=domestic&yr=1991&p=.htm | access-date=19 September 2006 }}</ref> The film is dedicated to [[Jim Henson]], who died less than a year before this film's release. Henson's [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop|Creature Shop]] created the animatronic creature costumes for the film, like the first film.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'', was released in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[New York City]], a young [[pizza delivery]] boy named Keno inadvertently encounters [[Burglary|burglars]] on his route and tries to stop them. The burglars attack Keno, who proves to be a skilled [[Martial arts|martial artist]], but he is soon overwhelmed before the arrival of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. They vanish after rescuing Keno, tying the burglars up, and taking the pizza he was delivering, leaving behind the money to pay for it.\n\n[[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], along with their master [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], are currently living with [[April O'Neil]] while looking for a new place to live following the events of their [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|last adventure]]. Splinter wants to remain in the shadows, while Raphael thinks they should live out in the open. At a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] where the remnants of [[Foot Clan|The Foot]] and [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder's]] second-in-command Tatsu are hiding out, they are met by their master, who has been disfigured by his previous defeat and vows revenge on the Turtles.\n\nApril interviews Professor Jordan Perry of Techno Global Research Industries (TGRI) about a possible [[toxic waste]] leak. He assures her that everything is fine, but their scientists secretly discover [[dandelion]]s which have been mutated by the leak. Freddy, a spy for the Foot posing as April's cameraman, discovers this and reports it to his master, who decides to have Perry interrogated. Back at April's apartment, Splinter reveals to her and the Turtles that the canister of mutagen (dubbed \"Ooze\" by the Turtles) which mutated them 15 years prior was created by TGRI, and they too decide to talk to Perry. The Foot gets to Perry first and kidnaps him, salvaging the last canister of ooze in the process. The Turtles attempt to get the canister back, but ultimately fail. Afterward, Keno gets into April's apartment under the guise of delivering pizza and discovers Splinter and the Turtles.\n\nAt the Shredder's hideout, Perry is forced to use the remaining ooze on a [[Common snapping turtle|snapping turtle]] and a [[wolf]], which mutate into [[Tokka and Rahzar]], respectively. With the imminent threat to April's safety by the Foot, the Turtles start to actively look for a new home. After an argument with Leonardo, Raphael breaks off from the group, while Michelangelo discovers an abandoned subway station and deems it a perfect hideout. Raphael and Keno defy Splinter's orders and implant Keno into the Foot Clan to find their hideout. However, they are caught and Raphael is captured, while Keno escapes to warn the others. When they come, they are ambushed by the Shredder and the Foot; Splinter saves the group, but leaves as they face Tokka and Rahzar, who prove too strong to defeat. Donatello finds a bound and gagged Perry after being tossed into a building by Tokka, and the five of them make a tactical retreat. Once back in their hideout, Perry explains that the creation of the ooze was an accident, disheartening Donatello, Leonardo and Raphael, who saw a higher purpose for their existence.\n\nThe Shredder unleashes Tokka and Rahzar into a nearby neighborhood to cause damage. The next day, Freddy sends a message to April that Tokka and Rahzar will be released into [[Central Park]] if the Turtles don't meet the Foot Clan at the construction site. Perry develops an antidote to the mutations, but it must be ingested to work. When the Turtles confront the Foot at the site, they try using donuts to trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating the antidote. They discover the trick and brutally attack, throwing Raphael into a public dance club where [[Vanilla Ice]] is performing. A big fight ensues among hundreds of witnesses and eventually the Turtles revert Tokka and Rahzar back to their natural state. The Turtles fight with Shredder on the dock, who has transformed into a Super Shredder after consuming the last of the ooze. The heavily-mutated Super Shredder is too strong for the Turtles to fight, but is defeated when he rips the dock apart in his rampage, causing it to collapse onto him.\n\nIn a press release, April reads a note from Perry, thanking the Turtles for saving him. When they return home, the Turtles deny being seen by the humans, but Splinter holds up the evening's newspaper on which they are front-page news. He then orders the four of them to do 10 flips as punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Paige Turco]] as [[April O'Neil]], a news reporter, and the human companion of the Turtles and Splinter.

The character of [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], who was prominent in the first movie, did not appear here (though he did return in the following movie). Ernie Reyes Jr., who was Donatello's fight double in the first film, was cast as a new character, Keno, as the producers admired Reyes and his performance in the first movie so much they asked him to join the sequel. Todd W. Langen returned from the first film to write the screenplay.\n\nThe characters of [[Bebop and Rocksteady]], which were popular villains in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated series]], could not be used due to [[Kevin Eastman]] and [[Peter Laird]] objecting, with the latter stating that \"their constant one-note shtick in the first animated series [was] extremely annoying and silly to the point of being stupid.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beresford |first1=Jack |title=What Went Wrong With Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze? |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/what-went-wrong-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2-secret-of-the-ooze/ |website=Den of Geek |date=22 March 2021 |access-date=9 June 2022}}</ref> As a result, Tokka and Rahzar were created.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ask PL #13|url=http://peterlairdstmntblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/ask-pl-13.html|quote=It is true that I didn't want them in any of the movies, which is why instead of Bebop and Rocksteady in the second movie (The Secret of the Ooze\") there were Tokka and Rhazar.

Trains pass through the station daily as they turn around to head uptown, passengers are allowed to ride through the station, but the train does not stop and so they cannot disembark. During filming of the scene where the Turtles are trapped in the net and fall to the ground, one of the stuntmen broke an ankle.

In terms of the plot, this song was to trick the audience into believing the fight was a harmless \"show\" and thus not to panic.\n\nA music video was also produced for \"Ninja Rap\" at the time of the film's release.
