Romero]], with a screenplay by [[John A. Russo|John Russo]] and Romero, and starring [[Duane Jones]] and [[Judith O'Dea]]. The story follows seven people who are trapped in a rural farmhouse in western [[Pennsylvania]], which is under assault by an enlarging group of [[cannibalism|flesh-eating]], [[undead]] [[ghoul]]s.\n\nHaving gained experience through directing [[television commercial]]s and [[industrial film]]s for their [[Pittsburgh]]-based production company The Latent Image, Romero and his friends Russo and [[Russell Streiner]] decided to fulfill their ambitions to make a feature film. Electing to make a horror film that would capitalize on contemporary commercial interest in the genre, they formed a partnership with Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman of Hardman Associates called Image Ten. After evolving through multiple drafts, Russo and Romero's final script primarily drew influence from [[Richard Matheson]]'s 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''. [[Principal photography]] took place between July 1967 and January 1968, mainly on location in [[Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City]]; aside from the Image Ten team themselves, the cast and crew consisted of their friends and relatives, local [[Stage actor|stage]] and [[Amateur theatre|amateur]] actors, and residents from the area. Although the film was his [[directorial debut]], Romero utilized many of the [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques he had honed in his commercial and industrial work to complete the film on a [[Film budgeting|budget]] of approximately {{US$|100,000}}.\n\nFollowing its theatrical premiere in Pittsburgh on October 1, 1968, ''Night of the Living Dead'' eventually grossed {{US$|12 million}} [[Cinema of the United States|domestically]] and {{US$|18 million}} internationally, earning more than 250 times its budget and making it one of the most profitable film productions ever made at the time. Released shortly prior to the adoption of the [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|Motion Picture Association of America rating system]], the film's explicit violence and gore was considered groundbreaking and unprecedented for the time, leading to widespread controversy and negative reviews upon its initial release. It eventually garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and acclaim among critics, and has appeared on lists of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest and most influential films ever made]] by such outlets as ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Total Film]]''. Frequently identified as the first modern [[zombie film]] and a touchstone in the development of the horror genre, retrospective scholarly analysis has focused on its reflection of the social and cultural changes in the United States during the [[1960s]], with particular attention being directed towards the casting of Jones, an [[African-American]], in the leading role.<ref name=\"Anarchy\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5390-night-of-the-living-dead-mere-anarchy-is-loosed|title=Night of the Living Dead: Mere Anarchy Is Loosed|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|date=February 13, 2018|last=Klawans|first=Stuart|access-date=January 31, 2021|archive-date=January 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123020548/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5390-night-of-the-living-dead-mere-anarchy-is-loosed|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"CNN\"/><ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web|url=https://popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead|last=Ma\u00e7ek III|first=J.C.|date=June 14, 2012|work=[[PopMatters]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703220514/https://popmatters.com/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Preserving the Silver Screen (December 1999) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9912/nfb.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.loc.gov|archive-date=April 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414042353/https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9912/nfb.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Night of the Living Dead'' spawned a successful [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|franchise]] that includes five official sequels released between 1978 and 2009, all of which were also directed by Romero.

Their car radio goes off the air due to technical difficulties. As they are leaving, a strange, ashen-faced, stumbling man wearing a tattered suit kills Johnny and attacks Barbra. She flees and takes shelter in a farmhouse but finds the woman who lived there dead and half-eaten. She sees a multiplying number of strange ghouls, led by the man from the cemetery, approaching the house. A man named Ben arrives, secures the farmhouse by boarding the windows and doors, and drives away the ghouls with a [[Winchester Model 1894|lever-action rifle]] he finds in the closet and with fire, which the ghouls fear.\n\nBarbra, in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state from shock, is surprised when Harry Cooper and Tom emerge from the cellar. Harry has been taking shelter there with his wife Helen and their young daughter Karen after a group of the same monsters overturned their car and bit Karen on the arm, leaving her seriously ill. Tom arrived with his girlfriend Judy after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal killings. Tom aids Ben in securing the farmhouse while Harry angrily protests that it is unsafe before returning to the cellar, which he believes is safer. Ghouls continue to besiege the farmhouse in ever-increasing numbers. [[File:Night of the Living Dead (1968).webm|thumb|thumbtime=44|250px|upright=1.5|right|''Night of the Living Dead'' (full film)]]\n\nThe refugees listen to radio and television reports of a wave of [[mass murder]] being committed across the [[east coast of the United States]] by an army of cannibalistic, reanimating corpses, and posses of armed men patrolling the countryside to kill the ghouls. They confirm that the ghouls can be stopped with a bullet or heavy blow to the head or by being burned, as Ben discovered, and that various rescue centers are offering refuge and safety. Scientists theorize that the reanimations are occurring due to [[radiation]] from a [[space probe]] that exploded in [[Earth]]'s atmosphere on the way back from [[Venus]].\n\nBen devises a plan to obtain medical supplies for Karen and transport the group to a rescue center by refueling his truck. Ben, Tom, and Judy drive to a nearby gas pump, holding the ghouls off with torches and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. However, the gas from the pump spills and causes the truck to catch fire and explode, killing Tom and Judy. Ben runs back to the house on his own and breaks down the door when Harry does not let him back in. Ben beats Harry for his cowardice. While the ghouls feast on the remains of Tom and Judy, the remaining survivors attempt to find a way out. However, the ghouls break through the barricades. In the ensuing chaos, Harry is shot dead by Ben. Karen dies from her injuries, reanimates, begins to eat her father's remains, and stabs Helen to death with a masonry [[trowel]]. Barbra recovers from her catatonic state and tries to help Ben keep the ghouls out but is dragged away by a reanimated Johnny and the other ghouls.\n\nAs the horde breaks into the house, Ben takes refuge in the cellar, where he shoots Harry and Helen's reanimating corpses. The next morning, an armed posse arrives and begins dispatching the remaining ghouls in the area. Awoken by their gunfire and sirens, Ben emerges from the cellar but is shot and killed when they mistake him for a ghoul. His body is thrown onto a bonfire and burned with the rest of the ghouls.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Duane Jones NLD.jpg|thumb|right|Ben, played by [[Duane Jones]]]]\n* [[Duane Jones]] as Ben.

Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones:\n\n{{quotation|The script had been written with the character Ben as a rather simple truck driver. His dialogue was that of a lower class/uneducated person. Duane Jones was a very well educated man [and he] simply refused to do the role as it was written. As I recall, I believe that Duane himself upgraded his own dialogue to reflect how he felt the character should present himself.<ref name=\"Hardman/Eastmaninterview\"/>}}\n\nEastman modified cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper.<ref name=\"Hardman/Eastmaninterview\"/> According to lead actress Judith O'Dea, much of the dialogue was improvised. She told an interviewer, \"I don't know if there was an actual working script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it ''should'' be done\".{{sfn|Collum|2004|p=4}} One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death:\n\n{{quotation|The sequence where Ben is breaking up the table to block the entrance and I'm on the couch and start telling him the story of what happened [to Johnny] it's all ad-libbed.

There was a concern we didn't get the sound right, but fortunately they were able to use it.{{sfn|Collum|2004|pages=3\u20134}}}}\n\nAlthough the film is regarded as one of the launching pads for the modern zombie movie, the screenplay itself never uses the word.<ref name=\"Walkdead\">{{cite web|last1=Robey|first1=Tim|title=George A Romero: Why I don't like The Walking Dead|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10436738/George-A-Romero-Why-I-dont-like-The-Walking-Dead.html|website=Telegraph|access-date=February 13, 2017|archive-date=December 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201207023543/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10436738/George-A-Romero-Why-I-dont-like-The-Walking-Dead.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, Romero would later confess that he felt the film's antagonists were distinct enough from Haitian zombies that they were \"something completely new\" with Romero actively avoiding any similarities between the two creatures although he notes that they may have subtly inspired him.<ref name=\"Walkdead\"/>\n\nThe lead role was initially written for someone of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] descent, but upon casting African-American actor Duane Jones, Romero intentionally did not alter the script to reflect this.<ref name=\"Walkdead\"/> Asked in 2013 if he took inspiration from the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] that same year, Romero responded in the negative, noting that he only heard about the shooting when he was on his way to find distribution for the finished film.<ref name=\"Walkdead\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\n==== Principal photography ====\n[[File:EvansCityCemetery PA.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City]] Cemetery in 2007]]\n[[File:Evans City Cemetery Chapel, Evans City, PA - February 2009.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cemetery Chapel in 2009]]\n[[File:Gravestone of Nicholas Kramer in Evans City Cemetery, Evans City, PA - July 2017.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Tombstone that the character Barbra ([[Judith O'Dea]]) clutches in the opening scene of the movie.

According to Hardman, \"We knew that we could not raise enough money to shoot a film on a par with the classic horror films with which we had all grown up.

Retrieved June 24, 2006.</ref> Critics saw the influence of the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s in Romero's directorial style. Stephen Paul Miller, for instance, witnessed \"a revival of fifties schlock shock ... and the army general's television discussion of military operations in the film echoes the often inevitable calling-in of the army in fifties horror films\". Miller admits that \"''Night of the Living Dead'' takes greater relish in mocking these military operations through the general's pompous demeanor\" and the government's inability to source the zombie epidemic or protect the citizenry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Stephen Paul|title=The Seventies Now: Culture as Surveillance|publisher= Duke University Press|year= 1999|page= 81|isbn=978-0-8223-2166-8}}</ref> Romero describes the mood he wished to establish: \"The film opens with a situation that has already disintegrated to a point of little hope, and it moves progressively toward absolute despair and ultimate tragedy.\"<ref name=royer/> According to film historian Carl Royer, Romero \"employs [[chiaroscuro]] ([[film noir]] style) lighting to emphasize humanity's nightmare alienation from itself.\"<ref name=royer>{{cite book|last=Royer|first=Carl|title=The Spectacle of Isolation in Horror Films: Dark Parades|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2005|page=15|isbn=978-0-7890-2264-6}}</ref>\n\nWhile some critics dismissed Romero's film because of the graphic scenes, writer [[R. H. W. Dillard]] claimed that the \"open-eyed detailing\" of [[taboo]] heightened the film's success. He asks, \"What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother? And Karen, in the film, offers a particularly vivid opportunity to commit the forbidden deed vicariously.\"{{sfn|Dillard|Waller|1988|p=15}} Romero featured social taboos as key themes, particularly [[cannibalism]]. Although zombie cannibals were inspired by Matheson's ''I Am Legend'', film historian Robin Wood sees the flesh-eating scenes of ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a late-1960s critique of American capitalism. Wood asserts that the zombies represent capitalists, and \"cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism\". He argues that the zombies' victims symbolized the repression of \"[[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]\" in bourgeois American society, namely activists in the [[civil rights movement]], [[Second-wave feminism|feminists]], homosexuals, and [[counterculture|counterculturalists]] in general.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Robin|chapter=An Introduction to the American Horror Film|title=Movies and Methods|volume=II|editor=Nichols, Bill|publisher=University of California Press|year=1985|page=[https://archive.org/details/moviesmethodsa00nich/page/213 213]|isbn=978-0-520-05409-7|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/moviesmethodsa00nich/page/213}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nMembers of Image Ten were involved in filming and [[Film editing|post-production]], participating in loading [[camera magazine]]s, [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffing]], constructing props, recording sounds and editing.{{sfn|Russo|1985|p=7}} Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated in an interview that a \"number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints as I made the exposures.

According to WRS, \"We chose a selection of music for each of the various scenes and then George made the final selections. We then took those selections and augmented them electronically\".

Following the 1968 film, Romero released ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', ''[[Diary of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Survival of the Dead]]''. Each film traces the evolution of the living dead epidemic in the United States and humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods in which they were released.\n\n=== ''Return of the Living Dead'' series ===\n{{Main|Return of the Living Dead (film series)}}\n\nThe same year ''Day of the Dead'' premiered, ''Night of the Living Dead'' co-writer John Russo released a film titled ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' that offers an alternate [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] to the original film than ''Dawn of the Dead''. Russo's film spawned four [[Return of the Living Dead (film series)|sequels]]. ''Return of the Living Dead'' sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with ''Day of the Dead'' as a sequel to the original film. In the case ''Dawn Associates v. Links'', Romero accused Russo of \"appropriat[ing] part of the title of the prior work\", plagiarizing ''Dawn of the Dead'''s advertising slogan (\"When there is no more room in hell ... the dead will walk the earth\"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a restraining order that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.<ref>Patrick J.

George Cameron Romero's script is intended to be an homage to his father's work, a glimpse into the political turmoil of the mid-to-late 1960s, and a bookend piece to his father's original story. Despite raising funds for the film on [[Indiegogo]] in 2014, the film has yet to go into production as of 2021.

It was based on the original screenplay but included more gore and a revised plot that portrayed Barbra ([[Patricia Tallman]]) as a capable and active heroine. [[Tony Todd]] played the role of Ben.
