It co-stars [[Richard Crenna]] as Rambo's mentor Sam Trautman and [[Brian Dennehy]] as Sheriff Will Teasle. It is the first installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''.\n\nThe film is based on the 1972 novel ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'' by [[David Morrell]], which many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the 1970s. In the film, Rambo is a troubled and misunderstood [[Vietnam veteran]] who must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by police and government troops near the fictional small town of Hope, Washington.\n\n''First Blood'' was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film was a box office success, grossing $156 million at the box office. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, it has been reappraised by critics, with many highlighting the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre.\n\nIts success spawned a [[Rambo (franchise)|franchise]], consisting of four sequels (co-written by and starring Stallone), an animated television series, a comic books series, a novel series, several video games, and Indian remakes.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, travels to the town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in search of an old comrade, only to learn that his friend had died of cancer, brought on by exposure to [[Agent Orange]] during the war.\n\nAfter mocking him for his unkempt hair, army jacket, and messy appearance, sheriff Will Teasle drives Rambo to the outskirts out of the town and drops him off. Despite the way he is treated by the sheriff, Rambo tries to return to Hope. Enraged, Teasle arrests Rambo on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife before bringing him to the police station.\n\nLed by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's officers [[police brutality|pressure]] Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured in [[Vietnam]]. When they try to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo snaps. He overwhelms the policemen, fights his way out of the station and flees into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter.\n\nDefying Teasle's orders, Galt attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter after spotting him. Rambo tries to hide, injuring his right arm in the process. With Galt still shooting at him, Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter, cracking its windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Losing his balance, Galt falls to his death. Rambo tries to persuade Teasle and his men that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the officers shoot at him, forcing him to flee once more. Teasle swears revenge.\n\nWith guerrilla tactics, Rambo non-lethally subdues the deputies, using improvised booby traps and his bare hands. Overpowering Teasle, Rambo holds a knife to his throat. He threatens to \"give him a war he won't believe\" if Teasle does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The State Police and Washington National Guard are brought in to assist Teasle, along with Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer, Colonel [[Sam Trautman]].\n\nTrautman advises that Rambo should be allowed to escape to the next town in order to defuse the situation, then be permitted to surrender peacefully later. Confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, Teasle refuses. He allows Trautman to contact Rambo and try to persuade him to give himself up. Rambo recognizes Trautman but refuses to come in, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse.\n\nAt the entrance of an abandoned mine, a National Guard detachment corners Rambo. Against Teasle's orders to wait for him, the guardsmen use a rocket launcher, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. But he survives, and is forced to go deeper into the rat infested mine. Eventually, Rambo finds a way out and hijacks an Army supply truck carrying an [[M60 machine gun]] and ammunition. He decides to return to town and cause as much damage as possible.\n\nTo distract his pursuers, Rambo blows up a gas station, shoots out most of the town's power, and destroys a gun store near the police station. Trautman, knowing that the sheriff is outmatched, tries again to convince Teasle to leave Rambo be, but the sheriff ignores him and goes to kill Rambo himself. Rambo spots Teasle on the police station's roof, and the two engage in a brief gunfight that ends with Teasle being shot and falling through a skylight.\n\nAs Rambo prepares to kill him, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed if he does not surrender, reminding him that he is the last survivor of his elite unit of Green Berets. Now cornered, Rambo rages about the horrors of war before collapsing in tears and talking about his traumatic experiences: watching his friends die in Vietnam, being unable to hold a job due to his [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], the cruel treatment he received from his fellow Americans when he came home, and being forgotten by the country that he sacrificed so much for.\n\nAfter being comforted and validated by Trautman, Rambo surrenders and is taken into federal custody, while Teasle is taken to a waiting ambulance.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

[[Richard Brooks]] was slated to direct, and intended to have the film be an allegory on differing American perceptions of [[World War II]] and [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam War veterans]], with Sheriff Teasle portrayed more sympathetically than in the novel. The film would have ended with Teasle ordering his men to drop their guns to try to reason with Rambo, who would have then been fatally shot by an unknown assailant.

Pictures]] for $125,000 with the thought of casting either [[Robert De Niro]] or [[Clint Eastwood]] as Rambo. A screenplay was written by [[Walter Newman (screenwriter)|Walter Newman]] with [[Martin Ritt]] intended to direct. The film would have criticized American military culture and portrayed Colonel Trautman as the film's villain, ending with both Rambo and Teasle dying. [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Bregman]] also considered directing the film, with Bregman hiring [[David Rabe]] to write a script. After Bregman departed [[Mike Nichols]] considered directing Rabe's script.\n\nWilliam Sackheim and Michael Kozoll wrote the screenplay that would be the basis of the final film in 1977, originally intending for [[John Badham]] to direct. Producer [[Carter DeHaven]] purchased Sackheim and Kozoll's script from Warner Bros. for $375,000. DeHaven secured the Cinema Group as a financer and hired [[John Frankenheimer]] as director with production to begin in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. This was also the first version of the script in which Rambo survived the film. However, the project stalled again after the distributor [[Filmways]] was acquired by [[Orion Pictures]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Broeske|first=Pat H.|date=1985-11-25|title=The Curious Evolution of John Rambo: How He Hacked His Way Through the Jungles of Hollywood|page=AB32|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publication-place=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] of Anabasis Investments read the book, they got interested in doing an adaptation as the first production of their studio [[Carolco Pictures]] funded by \"in-house sources\".

The time since the end of the Vietnam War and Stallone's star power after the success of the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' films]] enabled him to rewrite the script to make the character of John Rambo more sympathetic. Morrell's book has Rambo kill many of his pursuers, and Kozoll and Sackheim's draft had him killing sixteen people, but in the movie Rambo does not directly cause the death of any police or national guardsmen. Stallone also decided to let Rambo survive the film, unlike in the book. A suicide scene was filmed but Kotcheff and Stallone opted to have Rambo turn himself in at Trautman's urging.<ref name=\"drawing\" /> Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script, which was performed by [[Larry Gross]] and [[David Giler]].\n\n=== Casting ===\nBrooks originally wanted to cast [[Bette Davis]] as a psychiatrist and either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Lee Marvin]] as Sherriff Teasle.

However, Pacino decided not to be involved because he found the story too dark.<ref name=\"prime\"/> When Badham was considered as director he wanted to cast [[John Travolta]] as Rambo, [[George C.

Marvin, another Oscar winner, turned down the part of Colonel Trautman. [[James Mason]] and [[Richard Jaeckel]] were also considered. [[Kirk Douglas]] was eventually hired, but just before shooting began, Douglas quit the role of Colonel Trautman over a script dispute; Douglas wanted to retain the novel's original ending of Rambo and Teasle fatally wounding each other, Trautman finishing Rambo with a kill shot, then sitting with the dying Teasle for the sheriff's final moments.
