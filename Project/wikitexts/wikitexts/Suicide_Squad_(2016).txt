Produced by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]], [[DC Films]], and [[Atlas Entertainment]], and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures,<ref name=\"BFI\" /> it is the third installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU), it was written and directed by [[David Ayer]] and stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Will Smith]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Joel Kinnaman]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Jai Courtney]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], [[Scott Eastwood]], and [[Cara Delevingne]]. In the film, a secret government agency led by [[Amanda Waller]] [[Black project|recruits]] imprisoned [[supervillains]] to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a powerful threat in exchange for reduced sentences.\n\nBy February 2009, a Suicide Squad film was in development at Warner Bros., Ayer signed on to write and direct in September 2014, and by October, the casting process had begun. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on April 13, 2015, with additional filming in [[Chicago]], and ended in August that year.\n\n''Suicide Squad'' premiered in [[New York City]] on August 1, 2016, and was released in the United States in [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]], and [[IMAX 3D]] on August 5, 2016. Following a strong debut that set new box office records, the film grossed over $746 million worldwide, making it the [[2016 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth-highest-grossing film of 2016]]. The film received <!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WORDING--> generally negative reviews<!--DO NOT CHANGE THIS WORDING--> from critics for its plot, Ayer's direction, screenplay, pacing, and Leto\u2019s performance, although Robbie\u2019s performance was praised. The film was nominated for and won multiple awards across various categories, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]]. It was followed by the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'', starring Robbie, in 2020, and a standalone sequel ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2021, with Robbie, Kinnaman, Davis, and Courtney returning.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the aftermath of <!-- do not link this to Batman v Superman because it's an easter egg link-->[[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Superman]]'s death,{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016).}}<!--be explicit, see WP:EASTEREGG--> intelligence officer [[Amanda Waller (DC Extended Universe)|Amanda Waller]] convinces the US Government to greenlight [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]], a response team of criminals and [[supervillain]]s. The team will be used to combat [[metahuman]] threats, under Waller's control via [[nanite]] bombs implanted in each criminal's neck, which can be remotely detonated if they try to rebel or escape. If successful, they will have their sentences shortened.\n \nDr. June Moone, an American archaeologist, becomes possessed by a witch called [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]]. Waller can control the Enchantress by seizing her magical heart, which wounds her if it is struck. Waller's subordinate Colonel [[Rick Flag (DC Extended Universe)|Rick Flag]] is in love with Moone, and is made a member of Task Force X. However, Enchantress betrays Waller, conquering Midway City, transforming humans into monsters, and summoning her brother Incubus to destroy mankind.\n \nTask Force X is formed to stop Enchantress, using six inmates from [[Belle Reve (DC Comics)|Belle Reve]] penitentiary. The roster consists of hitman [[Floyd Lawton (DC Extended Universe)|Deadshot]], who wants to reunite with his daughter Zoe; [[Harley Quinn (DC Extended Universe)|Harley Quinn]], a former psychiatrist-turned-girlfriend of Gotham crime lord [[Joker (DC Extended Universe)|Joker]]; Australian thief [[George Harkness (DC Extended Universe)|Captain Boomerang]]; pyrokinetic ex-gangster [[El Diablo (comics)#Chato Santana|El Diablo]]; mutant cannibal [[Killer Croc]]; and mercenary [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]]. The team are led by Flag and joined by his associate [[Katana (DC Comics)|Katana]], a Japanese swordswoman. Waller and Flag deliberately hide the latter's relationship with Moone.\n \nUpon arrival in Midway City, the team's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to travel on foot. Boomerang convinces Slipknot to take off, believing the bombs are a ruse, but Flag kills Slipknot when he tries to escape, proving Boomerang's theory false. Scaling a skyscraper, the team discover Waller is their mark, trying to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' revolt. Meanwhile, the Joker learns of Harley's predicament, locates [[A.R.G.U.S.]] scientist Dr. Van Criss and blackmails him into disabling Harley's bomb.\n \nAs Waller and the squad await helicopter extraction, the Joker intervenes, disables Harley's bomb, and helps her escape. Waller shoots down the Joker's helicopter, though Harley survives and rejoins the squad, believing the Joker is dead. Enchantress captures Waller to regain her heart. Deadshot finds Waller's top-secret files and discovers Flag's relationship with Moone. The team abandon Flag, sharing a drink in an abandoned bar, where El Diablo reveals his powers and criminal lifestyle led to the deaths of his family. Flag relieves the squad of their mission, but realizing they have the opportunity to prove themselves, the group set out to save the city.\n \nThe squad attack Enchantress, while Killer Croc and Flag's platoon of [[Navy SEAL]]s plant a bomb beneath the subway to kill her brother. El Diablo embraces his pyrokinesis, sacrificing himself to maneuver and keep Incubus in the right spot. Enchantress invites the squad to join her, and Harley pretends to be tempted to get close enough to cut out Enchantress's heart. Flag crushes her heart, killing her and releasing Moone from her control. Waller deducts ten years off each squad member's sentence and fulfill their requests (except for Boomerang, who is instead detained). The Joker, alive, breaks into Belle Reve and rescues Harley.\n \nIn a mid-credits scene, Waller meets with [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne]], who agrees to protect her from the legal consequences of the events in Midway City in exchange for government files on the growing [[Metahuman|metahuman community]]. He reveals his plans to contact the heroes in the file, including [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Flash]] and [[Arthur Curry (DC Extended Universe)|Aquaman]], in order to build his own superhero team.{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017) and its 2021 [[Zack Snyder's Justice League|director's cut]].''}}{{refn|name=Justice League|group=N|The team is identified off-screen as the [[Justice League]].}} She advises him to stop working late nights, implying she knows Bruce is Batman.
