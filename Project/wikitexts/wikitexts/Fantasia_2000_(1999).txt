Produced by [[Roy E. Disney]] and [[Donald W. Ernst]], it is the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|38th Disney animated feature film]] and sequel to 1940's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. Like its predecessor, ''Fantasia 2000'' consists of animated segments set to pieces of classical music. Celebrities including [[Steve Martin]], [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Bette Midler]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Penn & Teller]], [[James Levine]], and [[Angela Lansbury]] introduce a segment in live action scenes directed by [[Don Hahn]].\n\nAfter numerous unsuccessful attempts to develop a ''Fantasia'' sequel, [[The Walt Disney Company]] revived the idea shortly after [[Michael Eisner]] became chief executive officer in 1984. Development paused until the commercial success of the 1991 home video release of ''Fantasia'' convinced Eisner that there was enough public interest and funds for a sequel, to which he assigned Disney as executive producer. The music for six of the film's eight segments is performed by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[James Levine]]. The film includes ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' from the 1940 original. Each new segment was produced by combining [[traditional animation]] with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\n''Fantasia 2000'' premiered on December 17, 1999, at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]] as part of a concert tour that also visited London, Paris, Tokyo, and Pasadena, California. The film was then released in 75 [[IMAX]] theaters worldwide from January 1 to April 30, 2000, marking the first animated feature-length film to be released in the format. Its general release in regular theaters followed on June 16, 2000. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised several of its sequences, while also deeming its overall quality uneven in comparison to its predecessor. Budgeted at about $80\u2013$85 million, the film grossed $90.8 million worldwide.\n\n==Program==\n{{See also|List of Disney's Fantasia characters}}\nThe film begins with the sound of an orchestra tuning and [[Deems Taylor]]'s introduction from ''Fantasia''. Panels showing various segments from ''Fantasia'' fly in outer space and form the set and stage for an orchestra. Musicians take their seats and tune up as animators and  artists draw at their desks before [[James Levine]] approaches the conductor's podium and signals the beginning of the first piece.\n\n# ''[[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Abstract patterns and shapes that resemble hundreds of colorful triangle-shaped butterflies in dozens of magentas, reds, oranges, yellows, greens, cyans, turquoises, blues, indigos, violets, purples, pinks, grays, whites, and browns in various shades, tints, tones, and hues explore a world of light and darkness whilst being pursued by a swarm of dark black pentagon or hexagon-shaped bats. The world is ultimately conquered by light and color. Introduced by surviving archival recordings by [[Deems Taylor]].\n# ''[[Pines of Rome]]'' by [[Ottorino Respighi]]. A family of [[humpback whale]]s are able to fly. The calf is separated from his parents, and becomes trapped in an [[iceberg]]. Eventually, he finds his way out with his mother's help. The family join a larger pod of whales, who fly and frolic through the clouds to emerge into outer space. Introduced by [[Steve Martin]] and [[Itzhak Perlman]].\n# ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' by [[George Gershwin]]. Set in New York City in the 1930s, and designed in the style of [[Al Hirschfeld]]'s known caricatures of the time, the story follows four individuals who wish for a better life. Duke is a construction worker who dreams of becoming a jazz drummer; Joe is a down-on-his-luck unemployed man who wishes he could get a job; Rachel is a little girl who wants to spend time with her busy parents instead of being shuttled around by her governess; and John is a harried rich husband who longs for a simpler, more fun life. The segment ends with all four getting their wish, though their stories interact with each other's without any of them knowing.<ref name=\"Holden212-213\">[[#Holden2001|Holden 2001, pp. 212\u2013213.]]</ref> Introduced by [[Quincy Jones]] with pianist Ralph Grierson.\n# ''[[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102]]'' by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. Based on the fairy tale \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], a broken toy soldier with one leg falls in love with a toy ballerina and protects her from an evil jack-in-the-box.<ref name=\"ebert1999\" /> Unlike the original story, this version has a happy ending. Introduced by [[Bette Midler]] featuring pianist [[Yefim Bronfman]].\n# ''[[The Carnival of the Animals|The Carnival of the Animals (Le Carnival des Animaux), Finale]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]. A flock of [[flamingo]]es tries to force a slapstick member, who enjoys playing with a [[yo-yo]], to engage in the flock's \"dull\" routines. Introduced by [[James Earl Jones]] with animator [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]].\n# ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' by [[Paul Dukas]]. Based on the 1797 poem \"[[Der Zauberlehrling]]\" by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], the segment is the only one featured in both ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Fantasia 2000''. It tells the story of [[Mickey Mouse]], an apprentice of [[Sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerer]] Yen Sid who attempts some of his master's magic tricks before knowing how to control them. Introduced by [[Penn & Teller]] rather than using archived recording of Deems Taylor introducing the segement like in the original film. The scene where Mickey shakes hands with Levine's predecessor [[Leopold Stokowski]] is the same like in the original film but [[Wayne Allwine]] redubbed his lines and recorded some new dialogue for Mickey during the subsequent segment's introduction.\n# ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance&nbsp;\u2013 Marches 1, 2, 3 and 4]]'' by [[Edward Elgar]]. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]] from the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Donald Duck]] is [[Noah]]'s assistant and [[Daisy Duck]] is Donald's wife. Donald is given the task of gathering the animals to the Ark, and misses, loses, and reunites with Daisy in the process. Introduced by [[James Levine]] featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.\n# ''[[The Firebird|Firebird Suite\u20141919 Version]]'' by [[Igor Stravinsky]]. A Sprite is awoken by her companion, an [[elk]], and accidentally wakes a fiery spirit of destruction in a nearby volcano who destroys the forest and seemingly the Sprite. The Sprite survives and the elk encourages her to restore the forest to its normal state. Introduced by [[Angela Lansbury]].\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|width=25%|align=left|quote=''Fantasia'' is timeless. It may run 10, 20 or 30 years. It may run after I'm gone.

Initially he planned to have the film on continual release with new segments replacing older ones so audiences would never see the same film twice. The idea was dropped following the film's initial low box office receipts and a mixed response from critics. Following preliminary work on new segments, the idea was shelved by 1942 and was not revisited for the remainder of Disney's life. In 1980, animators [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] and [[Mel Shaw]] started preliminary work on ''Musicana'', a feature film \"mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art&nbsp;... following the old ''Fantasia'' format\" that was to present \"ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Warga|first=Wayne|title=Disney Films: Chasing the Changing Times|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 26, 1980}}</ref> The project was cancelled in favor of ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983).<ref>[[#Solomon1995|Solomon 1995]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Roy E.

In December 1997, after rejecting pitches from four other animators, Disney and Ernst asked Hunt for his ideas.<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, pp. 22\u201323.]]</ref> Hunt first thought of the story on a morning walk in Pasadena, California, one depicting a battle of \"good\" against \"evil\" and how the conflict resolves itself.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Symphony No. 5: Creating Symphony No. 5'' at 00:32\u201300:44]]</ref> It took Hunt approximately two years, from start to finish, to complete the segment. Disney and Ernst decided to go with Hunt's idea; Hunt avoided producing an entirely abstract work because \"you can get something abstract on every computer screen\" with ease.<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 24.]]</ref> Hunt divided the segment into 31 mini-scenes, noting down points in which he would employ vivid color when the music was bright and fluid, and then switch to darker hues when the music felt darker and denser.<ref name=culhane29/> To gain inspiration in how the shapes would move, Hunt and his associates visited [[San Diego Zoo]], a butterfly farm, and observed slow motion footage of bats.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Symphony No. 5: Creating Symphony No. 5'' at 01:14\u201301:24]]</ref> The segment combines hand drawn backgrounds using pastels and paint that were scanned into the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS), and [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) of abstract shapes and effects, which were layered on top.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Symphony No. 5: Creating Symphony No. 5'' at xx:xx\u2013xx:xx]]</ref> Hunt explained that scanning each drawing \"was a one-shot deal\" as the [[platen]] that pressed onto it would alter the pastel once it had been scanned.<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 35.]]</ref> At one point during production, Hunt and Yasuda completed 68 pastel drawings in eight days.<ref name=culhane29>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 29.]]</ref> The segment was produced using [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]] animation software.<ref name=cgw2000/>\n\n====''Pines of Rome''====\n''Pines of Rome'' was the first piece Disney suggested for the film, as well as the first to be animated; designs appeared in the studio's [[dailies]] as early as October 1993.<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 13.]]</ref> Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story.<ref name=culhane12/> The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of \"something flying\".<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 39.]]</ref> Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow [[Post-it note]]s.<ref name=culhane45>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 45.]]</ref> The story originally involved the whales flying around from the perspective of a group of penguins, but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character. The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it \"never felt quite right\", leading to the decision to have them break through a cloud ceiling and enter a different world by the supernova.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating Pines of Rome'' at 2:52\u20133:49]]</ref> Butoy created a \"musical intensity chart\" for the animators to follow which \"tracked the ups and downs of the music&nbsp;... as the music brightens so does the color\", and vice versa.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 9:51\u201310:17]]</ref> He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development, the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move. When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system, Butoy found the whales were either moving too fast or had less weight to them. The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and \"more believable\".<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 10:32\u201311:59]]</ref> The eyes of the whales were drawn by hand, as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating Pines of Rome'' at 2:30\u20132:51]]</ref> Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible; the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time-consuming and would have produced undesired results.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 12:27\u201313:30]]</ref> The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into, overlap, or go through each other. The same technique was used for the stampede scene in ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), which was produced at the same time.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 14:56\u201315:19]]</ref>\n\n====''Rhapsody in Blue''====\n[[File:Eric Goldberg.jpg|thumb|[[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]], director of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' and ''The Carnival of the Animals, Finale'']]\n''Rhapsody in Blue'' is the first ''Fantasia'' segment with music from the American composer [[George Gershwin]]. It originated in 1992 when director and animator [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]] approached [[Al Hirschfeld]] about the idea of an animated short set to Gershwin's composition in the style of Hirschfeld's illustrations. Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to use and adapt his previous works for the segment.<ref>[[#Culhane1999|Culhane 1999, p. 58.]]</ref> Goldberg's wife Susan was art director.

It originated in the 1930s when Walt Disney wished to adapt a collection of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] fairy tales into an animated film. The artists completed a series of preliminary designs based on the stories, including ones for ''[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]'' from 1938 by [[Bianca Majolie]]<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: 1938 Storyboards by Bianca Majolie'']]</ref> that were stored in the studio's animation research library and used for a 1991 Disney book that retold the story accompanied with the storyboard sketches. When Disney suggested using the Shostakovich piece, Butoy flipped through the book and found the story's structure fit to the music.<ref>[[#DVD2|''Bonus Material: The Making of Fantasia 2000'' at 24:54\u201326:27]]</ref> When Humphries saw the sketches he designed the segment with works by [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]] in mind to give the segment a \"timeless\" feel, while keeping the colors \"as romantic as possible\" during the scenes when the soldier and ballerina are first getting acquainted.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 31:46\u201331:55]]</ref><ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 30:32\u201331:07]]</ref> Live action footage of a real ballerina was used as a guide for the toy ballerina's movements.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 31:13\u201331:27]]</ref> Butoy found the Jack-in-a-box a difficult character to design and animate with its spring base and how he moved with the box. His appearance went through numerous changes, partly due to the lack of reference material available to the team.<ref>[[#DVD2T2|''Segment Directors Audio Commentary'' at 32:29\u201332:51]]</ref>\n\nThe segment marked the first time the Disney studio created a film's main characters entirely from CGI;<ref name=cgw2000/> only backgrounds, secondary, or tertiary characters had been produced using CGI beforehand.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating Piano Concerto No. 2'' at 00:06\u201300:30]]</ref> Initially Butoy asked [[Pixar Animation Studios]] to handle the computer graphics, but CGI artist Steve Goldberg convinced him to let Disney's own team produce it.<ref name=cgw2000/> The backgrounds were completed by hand. Originally the drain sequence included friendly rats who performed comical gags, but the team found it did not fit the mood of the rest of the segment. The drains became a more scary environment, something that Butoy said was \"what the music was telling us to do\".<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating Piano Concerto No. 2'' at 02:57\u201303:38]]</ref> Rain animation from ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942) was scanned into the CAPS system and digitally altered to fit into the segment.<ref name=cgw2000/> The ending was to feature the original ending with the soldier and ballerina melting in the fire, but the music was too upbeat to animate it and was changed.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating Piano Concerto No. 2'' at 03:48\u201304:27]]</ref> An excerpt of the segment was shown at the 1998 [[SIGGRAPH]] conference.<ref name=cgw2000/>\n\n====''The Carnival of the Animals, Finale''====\n''The Carnival of the Animals, Finale'' was directed by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator [[Joe Grant]], one of the two story directors on ''Fantasia'' who loved the ostriches in ''Dance of the Hours''. When development for ''Fantasia 2000'' began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of ''The Carnival of the Animals''. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen.<ref>[[#DVD2|''Bonus Material: The Making of Fantasia 2000'' at 28:28\u201329:24]]</ref> Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director [[Mike Gabriel]], who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995).<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Creating \"Carnival of the Animals (Le Carnival des Animaux) Finale'' at xx:xx\u2013xx:xx]]</ref> The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 [[watercolor painting]]s on heavy bond paper.<ref name=latimes1999/> Susan chose a distinct colour palette for the segment which she compared to the style of a Hawaiian shirt.

She becomes a Neutral Sprite where her growth trail stops and an Ash Sprite when the forest has been destroyed. The segment ends with her as a Rain-Wave Sprite, followed by the Grass Sprite. The segment originally ended with the Sprite in the form of a flowing river that rises up into the sky and transforms into a Sun Sprite, but this was abandoned.<ref>[[#DVDsupp|''Supplemental Features: Firebird Suite\u20131919 Version: Character Designs: Sprite'']]</ref> The elk's antlers were produced by CGI and placed on top of its body that was drawn traditionally. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.<ref name=cgw2000/>\n\n===Music===\nThe music to ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was already recorded on January 9, 1938 for the first film at [[Culver Studios]], California with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting a group of session musicians. The recording of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' used in the film is an edited version of [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]]'s orchestration of the piece performed by the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] with conductor [[Bruce Broughton]]. The shortened version was made by cutting 125 [[bar (music)|bars]] of piano solo in three different places.<ref>[[#Banagale2014|Banagale 2014, p. 153.]]</ref> A recording of James Levine conducting both pieces with the Philharmonia appears on the [[#Soundtrack|film's soundtrack]].<ref name=soundtrack.net/>\n\nThe remaining six pieces were recorded at the [[Medinah Temple]] in Chicago, performed by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Levine.<ref>[[#DVD2|''Bonus Material: The Making of Fantasia 2000'' at xx:xx\u2013xx:xx]]</ref> ''Pines of Rome'' was re-arranged in 1993 by [[Bruce Coughlin]], who reduced the four-movement piece by cutting the second movement and trimming sections of the third and fourth movements. The piece was recorded on March 28, 1994.<ref name=culhane177/> The second recording involved ''Symphony No. 5'', ''Carnival of the Animals'', and ''Pomp and Circumstance'', on April 25, 1994.<ref name=culhane177/> ''Carnival of the Animals, Finale'' uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky.

He found ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' fit well with the rest of the film and the battle in ''Symphony No. 5'' too abbreviated to amount to much.<ref name=Holden212-213/> He found the segment with the whales failed in that the images \"quickly become redundant\".<ref name=Holden212-213/> He found ''Rhapsody in Blue'' to be the second-best in the film with its witty, hyper-kinetic evocation of the melting pot with sharply defined characters. He found the segment with the flamingos cute and the one with the tin soldier to be romantic.<ref name=Holden212-213/> [[James Berardinelli]] found the film to be of uneven quality. He felt ''Symphony No. 5'' was \"dull and uninspired\", the yo-yoing flamingos \"wasteful\", and the New York City-based story of Rhapsody in Blue interesting but out of place in this particular movie. He found the story of the tin soldier to successfully mix its music with \"top-notch animation\" and \"an emotionally rewarding story\". He felt the Firebird section was \"visually ingenious\", and ''Pomp and Circumstance'' the most light-hearted episode and the one with the most appeal to children, in an otherwise adult-oriented film. To him ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' was an enduring classic.<ref name=Berardinelli55-56/>\n\nDavid Parkinson of British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' rates the film three stars out of five, calling it a \"curate egg, with moments of hilarity and beauty alternating with the pompous and the banal\". Moments of ''Symphony No. 5'' and ''The Firebird'' he thought lacked the \"abstract grace\" from ''Toccata and Fugue'' from the original, and ''Pines of Rome'' was \"even less successful\" due to the computer imagery which affected its quality. He claims ''Rhapsody in Blue'' is \"guilty of some dubious racial and sexual caricaturing\", but hailed the film's IMAX presentation as \"a breathtaking spectacle\". He summarized the film as \"slightly more successful\" than the original ''Fantasia'', more child-friendly and a \"mixed bag of delights\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=5520|title=Fantasia 2000|first=David|last=Parkinson|work=Empire|access-date=August 9, 2015|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924135901/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=5520|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote a positive review of the film, citing ''Pines of Rome'' as \"a superb, uplifting flight of the spirit\" and ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' \"a gorgeous blend of traditional and computer animation\".

He pointed out that though the film includes moments of comedy and pastoral, \"the themes running through the old 'Fantasia' \u2013 the struggle between light and dark, the war between chaos and order, the ultimate triumph of goodness \u2013 find only a pale equivalent in this new version\". He compared the film's orchestra set to scenes from ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946) and thought the CGI in ''Symphony No. 5'' lacked the technical qualities of ''Toy Story''. Sibley argued the film lacked an even quality, highlighting ''Pines of Rome'' with its \"breathtaking\" opening before \"its magic has been overtaken by chronic boredom\" when the baby whale reunites with his parents. ''Pomp and Circumstance'', he thought, contained \"shamefully sloppy animation\" but is saved by Donald's comical gags, but pointed out ''Rhapsody in Blue'', with its \"strong lines and vivid, flat colours that are fashionably retro\", and the \"classic Disneyesque&nbsp;... exquisite beauty and raw natural violence\" in ''Firebird Suite'', as the film's most successful segments as they \"ironically, hark back to older times\".<ref name=bfi1999>{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/357|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803095809/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/357|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-08-03|title=Fantasia 2000|date=June 2000|first=Brian|last=Sibley|work=BFI: Sight & Sound|access-date=August 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades {{anchor|Awards}}===\n{| class=\"plainrowheaders wikitable\" border=\"1\"  style=\"margin:auto; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\"| [[Annie Award|28th Annie Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annieawards.org/28thwinners.html |title=Legacy: 28th Annual Annie Award Nominees and Winners (2000) |publisher=International Animated Film Society |access-date=May 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424041350/http://annieawards.org/28thwinners.html |archive-date=April 24, 2008 }}</ref> || Outstanding Achievement in An Animated Theatrical Feature || Walt Disney Pictures || {{nom}}\n|-\n| Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation || Eric Goldberg || {{won}}\n|-\n| Outstanding Individual Achievement for Production Design In an Animated Feature Production || Susan McKinsey Goldberg || {{won}}\n|-\n| Outstanding Individual Achievement for Production Design In an Animated Feature Production || Paul Brizzi, Gaetan Brizzi and Carl Jones || {{nom}}\n|-\n| Individual Achievement in Storyboarding || Ted C.

Plans were made to include ''[[One by One (2004 film)|One by One]]'' by [[Pixote Hunt]] and ''[[The Little Matchgirl (film)|The Little Matchgirl]]'' by [[Roger Allers]] in the film before the project was cancelled in 2004 for unknown reasons, with the proposed segments instead being released as standalone short films.\n\n''[[Destino]]'' is an animated short film released in 2003 by The Walt Disney Company. ''Destino'' is unique in that its production began in 1945, 58 years before its eventual completion. The project was originally a collaboration between Walt Disney and Spanish surrealist painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], and features music written by Mexican songwriter Armando Dom\u00ednguez and performed by Dora Luz. In 1999, Walt Disney's nephew, [[Roy E. Disney]], while working on ''Fantasia 2000'', unearthed the dormant project and decided to bring it back to life.\n\n''[[Lorenzo (film)|Lorenzo]]'' is a 2004 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation about a cat named Lorenzo who is \"dismayed to discover that his tail has developed a personality of its own\". The short was directed by [[Mike Gabriel]] and produced by Baker Bloodworth. It premiered at the [[Florida Film Festival]] on March 6, 2004 and later appeared as a feature before the film ''[[Raising Helen]]''; however, it did not appear on the DVD release of the film. Work on the film began in 1943, but was shelved. It was later found along with ''Destino''.\n\n''One by One'' is a traditionally animated short film directed by Pixote Hunt and released by Walt Disney Pictures on August 31, 2004, as an extra feature on the DVD release of ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' Special Edition.\n\n''[[The Little Matchgirl (2006 film)|The Little Match Girl]]'' is a 2006 animated short film directed by Roger Allers and produced by [[Don Hahn]]. It is based on an original story by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] entitled ''The Little Girl with the Matches'' or ''[[The Little Match Girl]]'', published in 1845.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animationarchive.net/Deleted%20Movies/Fantasia%202006/Notes/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122014557/http://animationarchive.net/Deleted%20Movies/Fantasia%202006/Notes/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-01-22 |title=Disney Animation Archive: Deleted Movies/Fantasia 2006/Notes/index.php |access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Banagale|first=Ryan|title=Arranging Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue and the Creation of an American Icon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-997840-3|ref=Banagale2014}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Berardinelli|first=James|author-link=James Berardinelli|title=ReelViews 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video|year=2005|publisher=[[Justin, Charles & Co.]]|isbn=978-1-932112-40-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1LmH8ld1yoC&q=Fantasia+2000&pg=PT68|ref=Berardinelli2005|access-date=October 24, 2020|archive-date=October 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020163638/https://books.google.com/books?id=y1LmH8ld1yoC&q=Fantasia+2000&pg=PT68|url-status=live}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Culhane|first=John|title=Fantasia 2000: Visions of Hope|publisher=Disney Editions|year=1999|isbn=0-7868-6198-3|ref=Culhane1999}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Previn|first=Andr\u00e9|author-link=Andr\u00e9 Previn|title=No Minor Chords: My Days in Hollywood|publisher=Doubleday|year=1991|isbn=978-0-385-41341-1|ref=Previn1991|url=https://archive.org/details/nominorchordsmyd00prev}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=The New York Times Film Reviews 1999\u20132000|year=2001|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=978-0-415-93696-5|ref=Holden2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_E350jJ-Ui4C&q=Fantasia+2000&pg=PA212|access-date=October 24, 2020|archive-date=May 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220506013237/https://books.google.com/books?id=_E350jJ-Ui4C&q=Fantasia+2000&pg=PA212|url-status=live}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=Disney That Never Was: The Stories and Art of Five Decades of Unproduced Animation|publisher=Hyperion|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7868-6037-1|ref=Solomon1995}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Stewart|first=James B.|author-link=James B.
