Produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], it is the sequel to the 2010 film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' and the second installment in the [[How to Train Your Dragon|trilogy]]. The film was written and directed by [[Dean DeBlois]], and stars the returning voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]], along with [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], and [[Kit Harington]] joining the cast. The film takes place five years after the first film, featuring Hiccup and his friends as young adults as they encounter Valka, Hiccup's long-lost mother, and Drago Bludvist, a madman who wants to conquer the world.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Giardina|first1=Carolyn|title=Annie Awards: 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' Director on Toothless' Storyline in Next Film|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/annie-awards-how-train-your-768932|access-date=March 1, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 1, 2015|archive-date=February 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217183627/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/annie-awards-how-train-your-768932|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDeBlois, who co-directed the first film, agreed to return to direct the second film on the condition that he would be allowed to turn it into a trilogy. He cited ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' as his main inspirations, with the expanded scope of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' being particularly influential. The entire voice cast from the first film returned, and Blanchett and Hounsou signed on to voice Valka and Drago, respectively. DeBlois and his creative team visited [[Norway]] and [[Svalbard]] to give them ideas for the setting. Composer [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]] returned to score the film. ''How to Train Your Dragon 2'' benefited from advances in animation technology and was DreamWorks' first film to use scalable multicore processing and the studio's new animation and lighting software.\n\n''How to Train Your Dragon 2'' premiered at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 16, 2014, and was released in the United States on June 13. The film received positive reviews for its animation, voice acting, musical score, action sequences, emotional depth, and darker, more serious tone compared to its predecessor. It grossed over $621 million worldwide, making it the 12th-highest-grossing film of 2014. It earned less than its predecessor at the US box office, but performed better internationally. The film won six [[Annie Award]]s, including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The final installment in the trilogy, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'', was released on February 22, 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nFive years after the [[Vikings|Viking]] villagers of Berk and the dragons made peace,{{Efn|As depicted in ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' (2010)}} they live together in harmony. Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless the Night Fury, discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup feels unsure he is ready.\n\nWhile investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon-trappers. Their leader Eret attempts to capture their dragons for their employer, Drago Bludvist, who plots to capture and enslave all dragons into becoming his soldiers. Hiccup and Astrid escape and warn Stoick about Drago. Stoick fortifies Berk to prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe war is inevitable, and flies off to talk to Drago. Stoick tries to stop him, explaining that he once met Drago at a gathering of chieftains, where Drago had offered them protection from dragons if they pledged to serve him; when they laughed it off as a joke, he had his dragons attack them, with Stoick the sole survivor.\n\nUndeterred, Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him. They instead meet a mysterious dragon-rider, who is revealed to be Hiccup's long-lost mother Valka. She explains that she, like her son, could not bring herself to kill dragons. After being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent 20 years rescuing dragons from Drago and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic, ice-spewing [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]] dragon called a \"Bewilderbeast\", which is able to control smaller dragons by emitting hypnotic sound waves. Stoick and his lieutenant Gobber track Hiccup to the nest, where Stoick discovers his wife is alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders force Eret to lead them to Drago, who captures them and their dragons and, learning of Berk's dragons, sends his armada to attack the dragon nest. He also attempts to have Eret executed, but Astrid's dragon, Stormfly, saves him. A grateful Eret later helps her and the others escape.\n\nAt the nest, a battle ensues between the dragon-riders, Valka's dragons, and Drago's armada, during which Drago reveals he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the alpha. The two colossal dragons fight, ending with Drago's Bewilderbeast killing its rival and becoming the new alpha. Drago's Bewilderbeast seizes control of all the adult dragons. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders his Bewilderbeast to have Toothless kill him. The hypnotized Toothless fires a plasma bolt towards Hiccup, but Stoick pushes him out of the way and is killed instead. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives Toothless away in a fit of despair over his father's death. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. Stoick is given a [[Norse funeral|Viking funeral]] and Hiccup, now having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encouragingly tells him he alone can unite humans and dragons. Inspired by her words and his father's, Hiccup and his allies return to Berk to stop Drago by riding the baby dragons, which are immune to the Bewilderbeast's control.\n\nBack at Berk, they find that Drago has attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. With a heartfelt apology, Hiccup frees Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control, much to Drago's surprise. Hiccup and Toothless confront Drago, but the Bewilderbeast encases them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice and enters a glowing super-powered state, where he is immune to the Bewilderbeast's control, enraged that the Bewilderbeast tried to hurt Hiccup. Toothless then challenges the Bewilderbeast to protect his rider, shooting it in the face repeatedly, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new alpha. All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats with Drago on his back.\n\nThe Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk, while all the dragons from both Berk and Valka's sanctuary bow before Toothless as their new king. Afterwards, Berk undergoes repairs, with Hiccup feeling certain that its dragons can defend it.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction   = horizontal\n| total_width = 320\n| image1      = Cate Blanchett Cannes 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1        = [[Cate Blanchett]]\n| width1      = 566\n| height1     = 723\n| image2      = Djimon Hounsou Cannes 2014.jpg\n| alt2        = [[Djimon Hounsou]]\n| width2      = 413\n| height2     = 481\n| footer      = [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]], who joined the cast as Valka and Drago Bludvist, respectively, attending the film's premiere at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].\n}}\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] \u2013 Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the son of the Viking chief Stoick the Vast and Valka.\n* [[America Ferrera]] \u2013 Astrid Hofferson, Hiccup's fiancee.\n* [[Gerard Butler]] \u2013 Stoick the Vast, chieftain of the Viking tribe of Berk, Hiccup's father and Valka's husband.\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] \u2013 Valka Haddock, Stoick's wife, Hiccup's long-lost mother and a dragon rescuer.<ref name=\"UTBlanchettFiery\">{{cite news|last=Truitt|first=Brian|title=Blanchett lends 'fiery strength' to ''Dragons'' sequel|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/15/cate-blanchett-how-to-train-your-dragon-2/3911613|access-date=December 15, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=December 15, 2013|archive-date=December 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216051251/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/15/cate-blanchett-how-to-train-your-dragon-2/3911613/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] \u2013 Gobber the Belch, Stoick's closest friend and a seasoned warrior.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clow|first=Mitchel|title='How to Train Your Dragon 2' director reveals how cat videos on YouTube inspire his dragons|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/04/22/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-jay-baruchel-dean-deblois-interview/2/|publisher=Hypable|access-date=April 29, 2014|date=April 22, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/2014.04.29-183226/http://www.hypable.com/2014/04/22/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-jay-baruchel-dean-deblois-interview/2/|archive-date=April 29, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]] \u2013 Fishlegs Ingerman.\n* [[Jonah Hill]] \u2013 Snotlout Jorgenson.\n* [[T.J.
