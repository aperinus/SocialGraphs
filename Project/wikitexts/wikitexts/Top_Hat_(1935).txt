He meets and attempts to impress Dale Tremont ([[Ginger Rogers]]) to win her affection. The film also features [[Eric Blore]] as Hardwick's valet Bates, [[Erik Rhodes (actor, born 1906)|Erik Rhodes]] as Alberto Beddini, a fashion designer and rival for Dale's affections, and [[Helen Broderick]] as Hardwick's long-suffering wife Madge.\n\nThe film was written by [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]] and [[Dwight Taylor (writer)|Dwight Taylor]]. It was directed by [[Mark Sandrich]]. The songs were written by [[Irving Berlin]]. \"[[Top Hat, White Tie and Tails]]\" and \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\" have become American song classics. It has been nostalgically referred to \u2014 particularly its \"Cheek to Cheek\" segment \u2014 in many films, including ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' (1999), and ''[[The Boss Baby]]'' (2017).\n\nAstaire and Rogers made nine films together at RKO, including: ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''Top Hat'' (1935), ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936), ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936), ''[[Shall We Dance (1937 film)|Shall We Dance]]'' (1937), and ''[[Carefree (film)|Carefree]]'' (1938). ''Top Hat'' was the most successful picture of Astaire and Rogers' partnership (and Astaire's second most successful picture after ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]''), achieving second place in worldwide box-office receipts for 1935.<ref name=\"Mueller\">Mueller (1986), pp.76\u201387</ref> While some dance critics maintain that ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' contained a finer set of dances,<ref name=\"Mueller\"/><ref name=\"Croce\">Croce (1972), pp.54\u201379</ref> ''Top Hat'' remains, to this day, the partnership's best-known work.<ref name=\"Hyam\">Hyam (2007)</ref> ''Top Hat'' was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] in its second year, 1990, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn American dancer, Jerry Travers comes to London to star in a show produced by the bumbling Horace Hardwick. While practicing a tap dance routine in his hotel bedroom, he awakens Dale Tremont on the floor below. She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly in love with her and proceeds to pursue her all over London.\n\nDale mistakes Jerry for Horace, who is married to her friend Madge. Following the success of Jerry's opening night in London, Jerry follows Dale to [[Venice]], where she is visiting Madge and modelling/promoting the gowns created by Alberto Beddini, a dandified Italian fashion designer with a penchant for [[malapropism]]s.\n\nJerry proposes to Dale, who, while still believing that Jerry is Horace,  is disgusted that her friend's husband could behave in such a manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto. Fortunately, Bates, Horace's meddling English valet, disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony; Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale.\n\nOn a trip in a [[gondola]], Jerry manages to convince Dale and they return to the hotel where the previous confusion is rapidly cleared up. The reconciled couple dance off into the Venetian sunset, to the tune of \"The Piccolino\".<ref>Adapted from Billman (1997)</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Jerry Travers\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Dale Tremont\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Horace Hardwick\n* [[Erik Rhodes (actor, born 1906)|Erik Rhodes]] as Alberto Beddini\n* [[Helen Broderick]] as Madge Hardwick\n* [[Eric Blore]] as Bates\n\nNotable bit parts:\n\n* [[Lucille Ball]] as Flower shop clerk\n* [[Gino Corrado]] as Venice hotel manager\n* [[Leonard Mudie]] as Flower salesman\n* [[Dennis O'Keefe]] as Elevator passenger / Dancer\n* [[Tom Ricketts]] as Nervous Thackeray Club waiter ''(uncredited)''\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Top-Hat-Rogers-Astaire.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Fred Astaire]] in ''Top Hat'']]\n{{external media\n| align  = right\n| width  =\n| video1 = [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2293/Top-Hat/videos.html Top Hat clips at TCM Movie Database]\n}}\n\n''Top Hat'' began filming on April 1, 1935, and cost $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June and the first public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of approximately ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed to show off the huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut<ref>Cut scenes included one where Blore poses as a gondolier and insults an Italian policeman \u2013 this scene is restored in some prints. cf. Croce (1972), p.78</ref> before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s.<ref name=\"Billman\">Billman (1997), pp.88\u201390</ref> After ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', it made more money than any other film released in 1935.<ref name=\"Croce\" />\n\n===Script development===\n[[Dwight Taylor (writer)|Dwight Taylor]] was the principal screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that \"it is patterned too closely after ''The Gay Divorcee''\", and \"I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour\".<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]], for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who would go on to serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout.<ref name=\"Croce\"/> The [[Production Code|Hays Office]] insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: \"For the women the kiss, for the men the sword\" which originally ran: \"For the men the sword, for the women the whip.\"<ref name=\"Croce\"/><ref>reviewing the film in England, author [[Graham Greene]] was pleased to find the film \"quite earnestly bawdy\" and took satisfaction in how this had escaped the British censor. cf Mueller (1986), p.80.</ref> Of his role in the creation of ''Top Hat'', Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared \"a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture can be summed up in the word ''inconsequentiality''. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'\"<ref name=\"Croce\"/><ref>The claims that ''Top Hat'' was adapted by [[Karl Noti]] from ''A Scandal in Budapest'' by Aladar Laszlo and Alexander Farago have been examined and dismissed by [[Arlene Croce]], cf. Croce (1972), p.70; however, they are supported by [[Turner Classic Movies]], cf. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2293/Top-Hat/screenplay-info.html \"Top Hat: Screenplay info\"] [[TCM.com]], and by Evans (2011), p.6</ref> On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]''.<ref name=\"Billman\"/>\n\n===Musical score and orchestration===\nThis was composer Irving Berlin's first complete film score since 1930 and he negotiated a unique contract, retaining the copyrights to the score with a guarantee of ten percent of the profits if the film earned in excess of $1,250,000.<ref name=\"Billman\" /> Eight songs from the original score were discarded as they were not considered to advance the film's plot.<ref name=\"Billman\" /> One of these, \"Get Thee Behind Me, Satan\", was also used in ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936). All five songs eventually selected became major hits and, in the September 28, 1935 broadcast of ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'', all five featured in the top fifteen songs selected for that week.<ref name=\"Billman\" />\n\nAstaire recalled how this success helped restore Berlin's flagging self-confidence. Astaire had never met Berlin before this film, although he had danced on stage to some of his tunes as early as 1915. There ensued a lifelong friendship with Berlin contributing to more Astaire films (six in total) than any other composer. Of his experience with Astaire in ''Top Hat'' Berlin wrote: \"He's a real inspiration for a writer. I'd never have written ''Top Hat'' without him. He makes you feel so secure.\"<ref name=\"Mueller\" />\n\nAs Berlin could not read or write music and could only pick out tunes on a [[Transposing piano|specially designed piano]] that transposed keys automatically, he required an assistant to make up his piano parts. [[Hal Borne]] \u2013 Astaire's rehearsal pianist \u2013 performed this role in ''Top Hat'' and recalled working nights with him in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel: \"Berlin went 'Heaven...' and I went ''dah dah dee'' 'I'm in Heaven' ''(dah-dah-dee)''. He said, 'I love it, put it down.'\"<ref name=\"Croce\" /> These parts were subsequently orchestrated by a team comprising Edward Powell, Maurice de Packh, Gene Rose, Eddie Sharp, and Arthur Knowlton who worked under the overall supervision of [[Max Steiner]].<ref name=\"Mueller\" />\n\nBerlin broke a number of the conventions of American songwriting in this film, especially in the songs \"[[Top Hat, White Tie and Tails]]\" and \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\",<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite book\n  | last = Green\n  | first = Benny\n  | title = Let's Face the Music: The Golden Age of Popular Song\n  | publisher = Pavilion-Michael Joseph\n  | year =1989\n  | location = London\n  | page = 171\n  | isbn = 1-85145-489-6 }}</ref> and according to Rogers, the film became the talk of Hollywood as a result of its score.<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\n===Set design===\nIn an Astaire-Rogers picture, the Big White Set \u2014 as these [[Art Deco]]-inspired creations were known \u2014 took up the largest share of the film's production costs, and ''Top Hat'' was no exception. A winding canal \u2014 spanned by two staircase bridges at one end and a flat bridge on the other \u2014 was built across two adjoining sound stages. Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in \"Cheek to Cheek\". Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza, a giant stage coated in red bakelite that was the location for \"The Piccolino\". This fantasy representation<ref>Croce (1972), p.56: \"Venice as a celestial powder room\"</ref> of the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] of [[Venice]] was on three levels comprising dance floors, restaurants and terraces, all decorated in candy-cane colors, with the canal waters dyed black. The vast Venetian interiors were similarly inauthentic, reflecting instead the latest Hollywood tastes.<ref>Descriptions adapted from Croce (1972), p.76</ref>\n\nCarroll Clark, who worked under the general supervision of Van Nest Polglase, was the unit art director on all but one of the Astaire-Rogers films. He managed the team of designers responsible for the scenery and furnishings of ''Top Hat''.\n\n===Wardrobe: The \"feathers\" incident===\nAlthough [[Bernard Newman (designer)|Bernard Newman]] was nominally in charge of dressing the stars, Rogers was keenly interested in dress design and make-up.<ref>Rogers' preoccupation lost on the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' critic who wrote: \"she is again badly dressed, while her facial make-up and various coiffeurs give her a hard appearance\", cf. Billman (1997), p.90. Croce (1972), p.66, disagrees.</ref>  For the \"Cheek to Cheek\" routine, she was determined to use her own creation: \"I was determined to wear this dress, come hell or high water. And why not? It moved beautifully. Obviously, no one in the cast or crew was willing to take sides, particularly not my side. This was all right with me. I'd had to stand alone before. At least my mother was there to support me in the confrontation with the entire front office, plus Fred Astaire and Mark Sandrich.\"<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book\n  | last = Rogers\n  | first = Ginger\n  | title = Ginger, My Story\n  | publisher = Harper Collins\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = New York\n  | page = [https://archive.org/details/gingermystory00roge/page/143 143]\n  | isbn = 0-06-018308-X\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/gingermystory00roge/page/143\n  }}</ref>\n\nDue to the enormous labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire \u2014 who normally approved his partner's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals \u2014 saw the dress for the first time on the day of the shoot,<ref>Astaire had approved the costume sketch. cf. Billman (1997), p.89.</ref> and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: \"It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, I never saw so many feathers in my life.\"<ref name=\"Astaire\">{{cite book\n  | last = Astaire\n  | first = Fred\n  | title = Steps in Time\n  | publisher = Heinemann\n  | year = 1959\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 205\u2013211\n  | isbn = 0-241-11749-6 }}</ref><ref>[[David Niven]] attended the shoot in the company of Astaire's wife, Phyllis, who suffered from a speech impediment. He recalled her verdict: \"she looks like a wooster\", cf. Billman (1997), p.89</ref> According to choreographer [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, \"came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young.\"<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite book\n  | last = Thomas\n  | first = Bob\n  | title = Astaire, the Man, the Dancer\n  | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson\n  | year = 1985\n  | location = London\n  | page = 112\n  | isbn = 0-297-78402-1 }}</ref>\nAn additional night's work by seamstresses resolved much of the problem, however careful examination of the dance on film reveals feathers floating around Astaire and Rogers and lying on the dance floor.<ref name=\"Mueller\" /> Later, Astaire and Pan presented Rogers with a gold feather for her charm bracelet, and serenaded her with a ditty parodying Berlin's tune:\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>Feathers \u2014 I hate feathers\nAnd I hate them so that I can hardly speak\nAnd I never find the happiness I seek\nWith those chicken feathers dancing\nCheek to Cheek<ref name=\"Billman\" /><ref>Since Astaire and Pan had to create a tap track to accompany the routine, they also created a joke version, replete with melodramatic female sighs and creaking sounds to accompany backbends for Rogers' amusement. cf. Mueller (1986), p.86</ref></poem>}}\n\nThereafter, Astaire nicknamed Rogers \"Feathers\" \u2014 also a title of one of the chapters in his autobiography \u2014 and parodied his experience in a song and dance routine with [[Judy Garland]] in ''Easter Parade'' (1948).<ref name=\"Mueller\" />\n\nAstaire also chose and provided his own clothes. He is widely credited with influencing 20th century male fashion and, according to ''[[Forbes]]'' male fashion editor, G. Bruce Boyer, the \"Isn't It a Lovely Day?\" routine: \"shows Astaire dressed in the style he would make famous: soft-shouldered tweed sports jacket, button-down shirt, bold striped tie, easy-cut gray flannels, silk paisley pocket square, and suede shoes. It's an extraordinarily contemporary approach to nonchalant elegance, a look [[Ralph Lauren]] and a dozen other designers still rely on more than six decades later. Astaire introduced a new style of dress that broke step with the spats, celluloid collars, and homburgs worn by aristocratic European-molded father-figure heroes.\"<ref name=\"Boyer\">{{cite book\n  | last = Boyer\n  | first = G.

Jerry Travers is literally footloose, he's bumptious, he's a disturber of the peace.\" Also Mueller (1986), p.78: \"this urge becomes a motif in the film as Astaire's dancing feet, usually irritating somebody or other, send the plot skittering along.\"</ref> There are eight musical numbers.\n\nIn the \"Opening Sequence\", after the RKO logo appears, Astaire, shown only from the waist down, dances onto a polished stage floor, backed by a male chorus sporting canes. On pausing his name appears. Rogers then follows suit and the two dance together as the picture dissolves to reveal a top hat. A similar concept was used in the opening sequence of ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'' (1949).\n\nThe second is \"[[No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)]]\".  On retiring to his hotel suite, Horton advises him to get married. Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song \u2013 this number was the brainchild of scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts \u2013 emerges naturally and in mid-sentence. Astaire sings it through twice<ref>As Mueller notes, repeating a song was extremely unusual for Astaire, who by way of variation, mixes two drinks during the repetition</ref> and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump, accompanied by leg beats, and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles ''sur place'', via traveling patterns, to rapid-fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands. On his return to the center of the room, where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage, the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed, awake and irritated.<ref>Described by Croce (1972), p.59 as \"rising from her satin pillows, like an angry [[naiad]] from the foam.\". This scene is also referenced in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s 2003 film ''[[The Dreamers (2003 film)|The Dreamers]]''.</ref> As she makes her way upstairs, Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management. Astaire incorporates this into his routine, first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously to the telephone. As Horton leaves to investigate, Astaire continues to hammer his way around the suite, during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror \u2013 a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face. The routine ends as Astaire, now dancing with a statue, is interrupted by Rogers' entrance,<ref name=\"Mueller\" /> a scene which, as in ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' and ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'', typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers, only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance.<ref name=\"Hyam\" />\n\nIn \"No Strings (reprise)\", Rogers, after storming upstairs to complain, returns to her room at which point Astaire, still intent on dancing, nominates himself her \"[[sandman]]\", sprinkling sand from a [[cuspidor]] and lulling her, Horton and eventually himself to sleep with a soft and gentle sand dance, to a ''diminuendo'' reprise of the melody, in a scene which has drawn considerable admiration from dance commentators,<ref name=mueller80>Mueller (1986), p.80: \"at once tender and erotic...This scene is one of the most memorable in Astaire's career,\" and Croce (1972), p.59: \"in the movie's sexiest scene, dances...with caressive little strokes.\"</ref> and has been the subject of affectionate screen parodies.<ref>In his 1936 comedy short ''Grand Slam Opera'' [[Buster Keaton]] parodies the entire \"No Strings\" number</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Isn't This a Lovely Day?|Isn't This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain)]]\", while Rogers is out riding, a thunderstorm breaks<ref>The script originally called for a scene in a zoo, but as Berlin provided this song, the script was adapted accordingly. cf. Mueller (1986), p.80</ref> and she takes shelter in a bandstand. Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire's rendering of this, one of Berlin's most prized creations. Astaire sings to Rogers' back, but the audience can see that Rogers' attitude towards him softens during the song, and the purpose of the ensuing dance is for her to communicate this change to her partner.<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> The dance is one of flirtation and, according to Mueller, deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical [[minuet]]: sequential imitation (one dancer performs a step and the other responds) and touching. Initially, the imitation is mocking in character, then becomes more of a casual exchange, and ends in a spirit of true cooperation. Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching, then with a crook of her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in.<ref>Croce (1972), p.62: \"that ecstatic embrace when they pivot together in a wide circle all around the stage...a shining moment in the history of the musical film.\"</ref> The routine, at once comic and romantic, incorporates hopping steps, tap spins with barrages, loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices. The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers' clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end.<ref name=\"Mueller\"/>\n\nFor \"[[Top Hat, White Tie and Tails]]\", probably Astaire's most celebrated<ref>Hyam (2007), p.104: \"It epitomises the elegance and sophistication that are synonymous with his name.\"</ref> [[Fred Astaire's solo and partnered dances|tap solo]], the idea for the title song came from Astaire who described to Berlin a routine he had created for the 1930 Ziegfeld Broadway flop ''Smiles'' called \"Say, Young Man of Manhattan,\" in which he gunned down a chorus of men \u2013 which included a young [[Bob Hope]] and [[Larry Adler]]<ref name=\"Billman\"/> \u2013 with his cane.<ref>Astaire recounts how he got the idea at 4.00 a.m. and woke his sister [[Adele Astaire|Adele]] as he cavorted around his bedroom with an umbrella. After explaining to his awakened sister that he had just had an idea for the Manhattan number, she replied: \"Well, hang on to it, baby \u2014 you're going to need it in this turkey.\" cf. Astaire, p.184</ref> Berlin duly produced the song from his trunk and the concept of the film was then built around it. In this number Astaire had to compromise on his one-take philosophy, as Sandrich acknowledged: \"We went to huge lengths to make the 'Top Hat' number look like one take, but actually it's several.\"<ref name=\"Satchell\">{{cite book\n  | last = Satchell\n  | first = Tim\n  | title = Astaire \u2013 The biography\n  | publisher = Hutchinson\n  | year = 1987\n  | location = London\n  | page =128\n  | isbn = 0-09-173736-2 }}</ref> Astaire's remarkable ability to change the tempo within a single dance phrase is extensively featured throughout this routine and taken to extremes \u2013 as when he explodes into activity from a pose of complete quiet and vice versa.<ref name=\"Mueller\" /> This routine also marks Astaire's first use of a cane as a prop in one of his filmed dances.<ref>Mueller (1986), p.16: \"Trudy Wellman, a secretary who worked on ''Top Hat'' recalls: 'He gets very annoyed with himself, just himself....He would take that cane and he would break it across his knee, just like that, and, of course, we were all shocked because we knew we only had 13 canes....It was a good thing we had that 13th cane because that was the take we printed.'\"</ref> The number opens with a chorus strutting and lunging in front of a backdrop of a Parisian street scene. They make way for Astaire who strides confidently to the front of the stage and delivers the song, which features the famous line: \"I'm stepping out, my dear, to breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class,\" trading the occasional tap barrage with the chorus as he sings. The dance begins with Astaire and chorus moving in step. Astaire soon lashes out with a swirling tap step and the chorus responds timidly before leaving the stage in a sequence of overlapping, direction-shifting, hitch steps and walks. In the first part of the solo which follows, Astaire embarks on a circular tap movement, embellished with cane taps into which he mixes a series of unpredictable pauses. As the camera retreats the lights dim and, in the ''misterioso'' passage which follows, Astaire mimes a series of stances, ranging from overt friendliness, wariness, surprise to watchful readiness and jaunty confidence.<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> [[James Cagney|Jimmy Cagney]] attended the shooting of this scene and advised Astaire, who claims to have ad-libbed much of this section.<ref>Astaire, p.210: \"Jimmy watched and whispered to me after about the third take, 'Don't shoot it again, kid \u2014 you got it on the second take. You'll never top that one.' I insisted on one more, but Jimmy was right. Next morning when I saw the rushes, that second take was the one.\"</ref> The chorus then returns in a threatening posture, and Astaire proceeds to dispatch them all, using an inventive series of actions miming the cane's use as a gun, a submachine gun, a rifle and, finally, a bow and arrow.<ref>This sequence was parodied in a scene in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Astaire Rogers Cheek to Cheek.jpg|right|thumb|225px|The final supported backbend \u2013 Astaire and Rogers in the climax to \"Cheek to Cheek\"]]\n\nAstaire's first seduction of Rogers in \"Isn't This a Lovely Day,\" falls foul of the mistaken-identity theme of the plot, so he makes a second attempt, encouraged by Broderick, in the number \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\". As in \"No Strings,\" the song emerges from Astaire's mid-sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor. Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day, and, at 72 measures, it is the longest song he ever wrote.<ref name=\"Billman\" /> He was very appreciative of Astaire's treatment of the song: \"The melody keeps going up and up. He crept up there. It didn't make a damned bit of difference. He made it.\"<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> As he navigates through this difficult material, Rogers looks attracted and receptive and, at the end of the song, they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby. According to Mueller's analysis, the duet that follows \u2013 easily the most famous of all the [[Fred Astaire's solo and partnered dances#Dances grouped by dance partner|Astaire-Rogers partnered dances]]<ref>This did not dissuade Croce from describing it as \"a bit too ritzy, a bit too consciously \"poised\".\" For a comparison of critical opinions see Hyam (2007), pp.205,207</ref> \u2013 reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves. No longer flirting, as in \"Isn't This a Lovely Day?,\" the pair are now in love. But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire's advances \u2013 in effect, fall out of love with him. Therefore, Astaire's purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings (which are a mystery to him) and surrender completely to him. The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend, exploiting Rogers' exceptionally flexible back. The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in \"Isn't This a Lovely Day?\". The pair spin and lean, dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced. The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin, collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked-arm stroll forward, repeats the spin but this time encircles her while she turns and then takes her in his arms. As the music becomes more energetic, the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers, moving against the music, suddenly falls into a deeper backbend, which is then repeated, only deeper still. The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering, and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears. With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera, then away in a series of bold, dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers' dress<ref>Hyam (2007), p.205: \"Rogers' feathered dress creates dazzling spirals of white.\"</ref> before abruptly coming to a halt in a final, deepest backbend, maintained as the music approaches its closing bars. They rise, and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began, come to rest next to a wall. Rogers, having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away, as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed.<ref name=\"Hyam\"/><ref>Dance description principally condensed and adapted from Mueller (1986), pp.83\u201386</ref>\n\nBy now, Rogers has learned Astaire's true identity although neither of them yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: \"Let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we have to face him,\" which serves as the cue for the music of \"The Piccolino\", the film's big production number. A gondola parade is followed by the entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choreographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song<ref>Mueller (1986), p.87: \"I love it, the way you love a child that you've had trouble with. I worked harder on 'Piccolino' than I did on the whole ''Top Hat'' score.\"</ref> designed it as a [[pastiche]] of \"The Carioca\" from ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933) and \"[[The Continental (song)|The Continental]]\" from ''[[The Gay Divorcee]]'' (1934),<ref>Unlike its predecessors, \"The Piccolino\" never became a national craze. cf. Mueller (1986), p.86</ref> and the lyric communicates its fake origin: \"It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in [[Brooklyn]]/and gazed at the stars.\"<ref name=\"Croce\"/> It is a song about a song<ref>Croce (1972), p.75: \"When Pan objected that Berlin's lyric was about a song rather than a dance ('Come to the Casino/ And hear them play the Piccolino'), Berlin suggested that the dance could be called 'The Lido,' and then the lyric could run 'Come and do the Lido / It's very good for your libido.'\"</ref> and Rogers sings it to Astaire<ref>Hyam (2007), p.121: \"a thoroughly appealing performance, lively and expressive without any suspicion of exaggeration.\" Also Mueller (1986), p.86: \"a lively rendition\"</ref> after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, [[Busby Berkeley]]-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance \u2014 all shot in one take \u2014 with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the [[vamp (music)|Latin vamp]] in the accompaniment.<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting out to the side of the body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody's final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.<ref name=\"Mueller\"/>\n\n\"The Piccolino (reprise)\": After the various parties confront each other in the bridal suite, with Rogers' \"marriage\" to Rhodes revealed as performed by a fake clergyman, the scene is set for Astaire and Rogers to dance into the sunset, which they duly do, in this fragment of a much longer duet \u2013 the original was cut after the July 1935 previews \u2013 but not before they parade across the Venetian set and reprise the Piccolino step.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York on August 29, 1935<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 28, 1935|title='Diamond Jim' A $45,000 Sparkle on B'way, State Leaps for $35,000|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety119-1935-08#page/n200/mode/1up|page=9|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref> and set a house record with a gross of $134,800 in its first week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 18, 1935|title='Hat' Quits M.H. with $345,000, 3d.
