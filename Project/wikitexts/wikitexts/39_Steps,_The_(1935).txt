It is very loosely based on the 1915 adventure novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' by [[John Buchan]].<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-39-steps-1935|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The 39 Steps (1935)|work=Brenton Film|date=February 2020}}</ref> It concerns a Canadian civilian in London, [[Richard Hannay]], who becomes caught up in preventing an organisation of spies called \"The 39 Steps\" from stealing British military secrets. After being mistakenly accused of the murder of a counter-espionage agent, Hannay goes on the run to [[Scotland]] and becomes tangled up with an attractive woman while hoping to stop the spy ring and clear his name.\n\nSince its initial release, the film has been widely acknowledged as a classic. Filmmaker and actor [[Orson Welles]] referred to it as a \"masterpiece.\" Screenwriter [[Robert Towne]] remarked, \"It's not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with ''The 39 Steps''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Scragow|first1=Michael|title=Rewatching Hitchcock's \"The 39 Steps\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/rewatching-hitchcocks-the-39-steps|magazine=The New Yorker|date=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Forth Rail Bridge from north Josh von Staudach.jpg|thumb|[[Forth Bridge]] in 2007]]\nAt a London music hall theatre, [[Richard Hannay]] is watching a demonstration of the superlative powers of recall of \"Mr. Memory\" when gun shots are heard inside the theatre. In the ensuing panic, Hannay finds himself holding a seemingly frightened woman, who persuades him to take her back to his flat. There she says her name is Annabelle Smith. She tells him that she is a spy and that she fired the shots to create a diversion so she could escape pursuing assassins. She claims that she has uncovered a plot to steal vital British military information, masterminded by a man missing the top joint of one finger. She mentions \"The 39 Steps\", but does not explain the phrase.\n\nLater that night, Smith bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee, before dying with a knife in her back. Hannay finds a map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] clutched in her hand, showing the area around [[Killin]], with a house or farm named \"Alt-na-Shellach\" circled. He sneaks out of his flat disguised as a milkman to avoid the assassins waiting outside. He then boards the [[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]] express train to Scotland. He learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt for Smith's murderer. When he sees police searching the train, he enters a compartment and starts kissing the sole occupant, Pamela, in a desperate attempt to avoid capture. She alerts the policemen, who stop the train on the [[Forth Bridge]]. Hannay escapes.\n\nHe walks toward Alt-na-Shellach, staying the night with a poor [[crofter]] (farmer) and his much younger wife. Early the next morning, the wife sees a police car approaching and warns Hannay; she also gives him her husband's coat. Hannay flees. The police chase after him, even employing an [[autogyro]], but he eludes them. He eventually reaches the house of Professor Jordan. The police arrive, but Jordan sends them away and listens to Hannay's story. Hannay states that the leader of the spies is missing the top joint of the little finger of his left hand, but Jordan shows his right hand, which is missing that joint, then shoots Hannay and leaves him for dead.\n\nLuckily, the bullet is stopped by a hymn book in the coat pocket. Hannay goes to the sheriff. When more policemen arrive, the sheriff reveals that he does not believe the fugitive's story, since Jordan is his best friend. Hannay jumps through a window. He tries to hide at a political meeting and is mistaken for the introductory speaker. He gives a rousing impromptu speech, but is recognized by Pamela, who gives him away to the police once more. He is taken away by the policemen, who insist Pamela accompany them. When they drive the wrong direction, Hannay realises they are agents of the conspiracy. When the men get out to disperse a flock of sheep blocking the road, they handcuff Pamela to Hannay. Hannay manages to escape, dragging the unwilling Pamela along with him.\n\nThey make their way across the countryside and stay the night at an inn. While Hannay sleeps, Pamela manages to slip out of the handcuffs, but then overhears one of the fake policemen on the telephone, confirming Hannay's story. She returns to the room. The next morning, she tells him that she overheard the spies saying that Jordan will be picking something up at the [[London Palladium]]. He sends her to London to alert the police; however, no secret documents have been reported missing, so they do not believe her. Instead, they tail her, hoping that she will lead them to Hannay.\n\nShe goes to the Palladium. When Mr. Memory is introduced, Hannay recognizes his theme music \u2014 a [[Earworm|catchy tune]] he has been unable to forget. Hannay, upon seeing Jordan signal Mr. Memory, realizes that there is no physical document, as Mr. Memory has memorized the secret contents. As the police are about to take Hannay into custody, he shouts, \"What are The 39 Steps?\" Mr. Memory compulsively answers, \"The 39 Steps is an organisation of spies, collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of...\", at which point Jordan shoots Mr. Memory before he is apprehended by the police while trying to escape capture. The dying Mr. Memory begins reciting his memorized information: the design for a silent aircraft engine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Donat]] as [[Richard Hannay]]\n* [[Madeleine Carroll]] as Pamela\n* [[Lucie Mannheim]] as Annabella Smith\n* [[Godfrey Tearle]] as Professor Jordan\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Margaret, the crofter's wife\n* [[John Laurie]] as John, the crofter\n* [[Helen Haye]] as Mrs. Louisa Jordan, the professor's wife\n* [[Frank Cellier (actor)|Frank Cellier]] as Sheriff Watson\n* [[Wylie Watson]] as Mr. Memory\n* [[Gus McNaughton]] as Commercial Traveller\n* [[Jerry Verno]] as Commercial Traveller\n* [[Peggy Simpson]] as Maid\n* [[Matthew Boulton (actor)|Matthew Boulton]] as Fake Policeman\n* [[Frederick Piper]] as Milkman (uncredited)\n* [[Ivor Barnard]] as Political Meeting Chairman (uncredited)\n* [[Elizabeth Inglis]] as Pat, Professor Jordan's daughter (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Adaptation===\nThe script was originally written by Charles Bennett, who prepared the initial treatment in close collaboration with Hitchcock; Ian Hay then wrote some dialogue.<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\"/>\n\nThe film's plot departs significantly from [[John Buchan]]'s novel, with scenes such as in the music hall and on the Forth Bridge absent from the book. Hitchcock also introduced the two major female characters, Annabella the spy and Pamela, the reluctant companion. In this film, ''The 39 Steps'' refers to the clandestine organisation, whereas in the book and the other film versions it refers to physical steps, with the German spies being called \"The Black Stone\".<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\"/>{{Sfn|Spoto|1999|p=145}} By having Annabella tell Hannay she is travelling to meet a man in Scotland (and produce a map with Alt-na-Shellach house circled) Hitchcock avoids the coincidence in Buchan's novel where Hannay, with the whole country in which to hide, chances to walk into the one house where the spy ringleader lives.\n\n===Conception===\n''The 39 Steps'' was a major British film of its time. The production company, Gaumont-British, was eager to establish its films in international markets, and especially in the United States, and ''The 39 Steps'' was conceived as a prime vehicle towards this end. Where Hitchcock's previous film, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', had costs of \u00a340,000, ''The 39 Steps'' cost nearly \u00a360,000. Much of the extra money went to the star salaries for leads Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll. Both had already made films in Hollywood and were therefore known to American audiences. At a time when British cinema had few international stars, this was considered vital to the film's success.<ref name=glancy>{{harvp|Glancy|2003|pp=29, 63}}</ref> Hitchcock had heard that Scottish industrialist and aircraft pioneer [[James George Weir|James Weir]] commuted to work daily in an [[autogyro]] and worked the aircraft into the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Travelling at the edge of space|url=http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|access-date=8 December 2012|date=10 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310093203/http://ewds.strath.ac.uk/space/OnDemandSeminar/tabid/4560/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Travelling-at-the-edge-of-space--10-March-2010.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nHitchcock had worked with Jessie Matthews on the film ''[[Waltzes from Vienna]]'' and reportedly did not like her very much. Nevertheless he used the song \"Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle \" (from the film ''[[Evergreen (film)|Evergreen]]'' which starred Matthews) as the music underscoring Mr. Memory's dying words and fade-out music in ''The 39 Steps''. He also used an orchestrated version of her song \"May I Have The Next Romance With You\" in the ballroom sequence of his 1937 film ''[[Young and Innocent]]''.<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\"/>\n\n===Hitchcockian elements===\n''The 39 Steps'' is another in a line of Hitchcock films based upon an innocent man being forced to go on the run, including ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'' (1926), ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). The film contains a common Hitchcockian trope of a [[MacGuffin]] (a plot device which is vital to the story, but irrelevant to the audience); in this case, the designs for a secret silent aeroplane engine.\n\nThis film contains an [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock cameo]], a signature occurrence in most of his films. At around seven minutes into the film, both Hitchcock and the screenwriter Charles Bennett can be seen walking past a bus that Robert Donat and Lucie Mannheim board outside the music hall.<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\"/> The bus is on London Transport's [[London Buses route 25|number 25A route]], which ran from [[Oxford Street]] through the [[East End of London|East End]] and on to [[Ilford]]. As author Mark Glancy points out in his 2003 study of the film, this was familiar ground to Hitchcock, who lived in Leytonstone and then in [[Stepney]] (in the East End) as a youth. The director's appearance can thus be seen as an assertion of his connection with the area but he was by no means romanticising it. As the bus pulls up he litters by throwing a cigarette packet on the ground.<ref name=glancy/>{{rp|p. 45}} Hitchcock is also seen briefly as a member of the audience scrambling to leave the music hall after the shot is fired in the opening scene.\n\nIn the middle of the film, Hannay is shot in the chest with a pistol at close range and a long fade out suggests that he has been killed. This jarringly unusual development\u2014the main character is apparently killed while the story is still unfolding\u2014anticipates Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and the murder of Marion Crane in the Bates Motel. Hannay was not dead, in the next scene it is revealed that a hymn book in the pocket of his borrowed coat prevented the bullet from killing him.<ref name=glancy/>\n\nThe film established the quintessential English 'Hitchcock blonde' [[Madeleine Carroll]] as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies.<ref name=\"39StepsHitchcockGuide\"/> Of Hitchcock heroines as exemplified by Carroll, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote: \"The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again: They were blonde. They were icy and remote. They were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. They mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every Hitchcock woman was humiliated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958 |title=Vertigo|date= 13 October 1996| work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Ebert, Roger|access-date=9 April 2017}}</ref> In keeping with many of Hitchcock's films, key sequences are set in familiar locations; in this instance [[London King's Cross railway station|Kings Cross station]], [[Piccadilly Circus tube station|Piccadilly Circus station]] and a dramatic sequence on the [[Forth Bridge]].\n\n==Reception==\nContemporary reviews were very positive. [[Andre Sennwald]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"If the work has any single rival as the most original, literate and entertaining melodrama of 1935, then it must be ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' which is also out of Mr. Hitchcock's workshop.
