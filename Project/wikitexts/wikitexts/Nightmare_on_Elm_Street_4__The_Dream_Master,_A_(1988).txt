The film was directed by [[Renny Harlin]] and stars [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Lisa Wilcox]], and [[Danny Hassel]].

After completing his revenge against the families who killed him, Krueger uses Kristen's best friend, [[Alice Johnson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Alice Johnson]], to gain access to new victims in order to satiate his murderous needs. The film is a sequel to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' (1987) and was followed by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' (1989). It is often popularly referred to as \"the [[MTV]] Nightmare\" of the franchise.<ref name=\"hollywoodmonster\">{{Cite book |title=Hollywood Monster: A Walk Down Elm Street with the Man of Your Dreams |last1=Englund |first1=Robert |author-link1=Robert Englund|last2=Goldsher |first2=Alan |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] | year=2009 |page=175|isbn=9781439163252 | chapter=Nightmare #8 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnAg3mh_grgC&pg=PA175}}</ref><ref name=\"joblo\">{{cite web | website=[[JoBlo.com]] | url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-4  |title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - Horror Movie Reviews | date=2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627055617/http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-4|archive-date=2013-06-27}}</ref><ref name=\"rogueshollow\">{{cite web | website=RoguesHollow.com | url=https://rogueshollow.com/review-nightmare-on-elm-street-4-the-dream-master/ | title=Retro Movie Review: Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master | date=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''The Dream Master'' was released on August 19, 1988, and grossed $49.4 million at the domestic box office on a budget of $6.5 million, which made it the highest-grossing film in the franchise in the United States until the release of ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', a crossover with the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]], in 2003. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988, a year after the events of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors|the previous film]], Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey have been released from Westin Hills and are back to their lives as normal teenagers with their families. However, Kristen believes [[Freddy Krueger]] will come back and when she dreams that she is in Freddy's old boiler room, she summons Joey and Kincaid into the dream. Kincaid and Joey are upset that she has reverted to her old ways back when they were at Westin Hills. To keep her calm, they take her to the boiler and show her that it is ice cold. Kristen had also summoned Kincaid's dog Jason into the dream. The dog jumps out of the boiler, bites Kristen, and they all awaken in their rooms. The next day, Kristen meets up with her boyfriend, martial arts enthusiast Rick Johnson ([[Andras Jones]]), and their friends\u2014Rick's shy and quiet sister Alice ([[Lisa Wilcox]]), Sheila (Toy Newkirk), an [[asthma]]tic genius, and Debbie ([[Brooke Theiss]]), a tough girl who does not like bugs. Kincaid and Joey confront Kristen at school about the dream. They tell her to let it go, that their days of fighting in dreams are over, and if she keeps going at it she might accidentally bring Krueger back.\n\nThat night, Kristen stays awake to keep herself from dreaming, but Kincaid falls asleep. He awakens in a junkyard, where Freddy has been accidentally resurrected. Kincaid puts up a good fight against Freddy, but Freddy overpowers him. Kincaid screams for Kristen but Freddy reaches him and kills him. Joey watches MTV and listens to music in his room. He begins to fall asleep and discovers a model from one of his posters swimming in his [[waterbed]]. Freddy jumps out of the waterbed and attempts to drown Joey. Joey screams for Kristen to help him but Freddy stabs and kills him. At school the next day, Kristen panics when she notices that Joey and Kincaid are missing and accidentally knocks herself out as Rick attempts to calm her. Freddy tries to attack Kristen as the school nurse wakes her up. Kristen feels guilty about staying awake when she learns that Kincaid and Joey were found dead. She later tells Rick, Alice, and Alice's crush Dan Jordan ([[Danny Hassel]]) about Freddy. She vows to avenge Kincaid and Joey.\n\nKristen realizes that her mother has put sleeping pills in her dinner but falls asleep as she tries to run out of the dining room. Kristen starts to dream; Freddy overcomes her attempts to repel him and forces her back to his home. Since Kristen is the last of the Elm Street children still alive, Freddy goads Kristen into summoning one of her friends into the dream, so that his fun can begin anew. She calls Alice into her dream, and Freddy throws Kristen into his boiler but before she dies, Kristen gives Alice her dream power. Alice wakes up with the sense that something is wrong and takes Rick to Kristen's house. When they get there, they see that Kristen's bedroom is on fire with her in it.\n\nLater, Alice falls asleep during class and inadvertently brings Sheila into her dream. Freddy kills Sheila and makes it look like an [[asthma]] attack. Rick starts to believe Alice, but the following day, he has a dream where an invisible Freddy attacks him in a martial arts dojo. Rick fights him, and manages to knock his knife glove off. However, the glove levitates and stabs him, killing him.  With each death, Alice changes\u2014she gains the abilities and personalities of her dead friends. She makes plans with Debbie and Dan to fight and kill Freddy together, but when her father keeps her in, Alice falls asleep. Through Alice, Freddy stalks Debbie, transforms her into a cockroach, and crushes her in a [[Roach Motel|roach motel]]. Using Debbie's temper, Alice tries to ram Freddy but collides with a tree in reality, injuring Dan. As Dan is rushed into surgery, Alice returns home and readies herself to join him and face Freddy.\n\nIn a dream, Alice rescues Dan, and the two find themselves in an old church. Dan gets injured in the dream which prompts his surgeons to wake him up. Alice now has to face Freddy alone. Freddy has the upper hand due to his experience, but she uses her friends' dream powers against him. When he is about to win, Alice remembers a nursery rhyme called \"The Dream Master\". She recites it and forces Freddy to face his own reflection which causes the souls within him to revolt. The strain tears Freddy apart. Alice's friends' souls are released and leave Freddy as a hollow husk. Months later, Dan and Alice are on a date when Dan tosses a coin into a fountain. For a moment, Alice sees Freddy's reflection in the water (implying that Freddy is still alive), but she ignores it. Dan asks her what she wished for, but Alice does not tell him as they walk away from the fountain.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lisa Wilcox]] as [[Alice Johnson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Alice Johnson]]. Wilcox was not initially considered for the lead role of Alice (see below for more details). In this film she plays a more timid version of the character who would later return in the sequel.\n* [[Danny Hassel]] as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Dan Jordan|Dan Jordan]]. Hassell was not expecting to be cast and assumed that the producers giving his character the same name as himself meant they were not that interested in his role in the script. Nonetheless Hassell, along with Wilcox, would return in the sequel the following year.\n* [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]] and nurse (without make-up). Englund returned for his fourth appearance in the role of Krueger; the time-loop sequence of Alice and Dan trying to save Debbie is often quoted by him as his favourite in the whole series.\n* [[Tuesday Knight]] as [[Kristen Parker]]. Knight assumes the role of Kristen which had been played by Patricia Arquette in the previous film. Knight would contribute the film's soundtrack and, in 2010's documentary ''[[Never Sleep Again]]'', other cast members suggest that her prominence was the result of a relationship with director Renny Harlin<ref name=\"castro\">{{cite web|last=Castro|first=Adam-Troy|title=7 never-before-revealed Nightmare on Elm Street secrets |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/7-never-before-revealed-nightmare-on-elm-street-secrets|work=[[SyFy]]|date=December 14, 2012|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref> something both Harlin and Knight deny.<ref name=\"castro\"/>\n* [[Brooke Theiss]] as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Debbie Stevens|Debbie Stevens]]. Theiss would later star with original Elm Street star [[Heather Langenkamp]] in ABC sitcom ''[[Just the Ten of Us]]''. Theiss was pleased that her character later became an action figure.\n* [[Ken Sagoes]] as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Roland Kincaid|Roland Kincaid]]. Sagoes returns from the previous film although he recalled in 2010 telling his friends not to buy any popcorn and go straight into the film as his onscreen appearance was minimal.\n* [[Rodney Eastman]] as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Joey Crusel|Joey Crusel]]. Eastman, like Sagoes, returns from the previous film and also meets his demise relatively early in the picture. \n* [[Andras Jones]] as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Rick Johnson|Rick Johnson]]. Jones plays Rick, the brother of Alice and boyfriend of Kristen. Jones would later recall being stalemated by the rest of the cast after shooting had completed and hinted at a possible conflict with director Renny Harlin.\n* Toy Newkirk as [[List of characters in the Nightmare on Elm Street series#Sheila Kopecky|Sheila Kopecky]]. Newkirk plays Sheila, a maths and science expert who helps Debbie with her Maths homework. An asthmatic, she is suffocated by Krueger midway through the film. Newkirk recalled in ''Never Sleep Again'' that she was asked to redub all her lines after initial filming in order \"to sound more black\".\n* [[Nicholas Mele]] as Mr. Dennis Johnson. Mele plays Rick and Alice's alcoholic father; his character was slated to die in this film in a cut scene where Krueger forces his head through a fridge door. The scene was cut for time constraints and Mele returned in the next film. \n* [[Brooke Bundy]] as Elaine Parker. Bundy was surprised to be asked back after her character appeared to be killed by Krueger at the conclusion of the previous film; it was later suggested that this was a dream of Kristen's. Elaine inadvertently kills Kristin when she spikes her food with sleeping tablets, allowing Krueger to attack her whilst dreaming.\n* [[Linnea Quigley]] as soul from Freddy's chest<ref>{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Danny|title=10 Linnea Quigley movies to watch while you celebrate her birthday|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/linnea-quigley-movies|work=[[SyFy]]|date=May 27, 2017|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref> \n{{div col end}}\n[[Robert Shaye]] appears uncredited in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] as Alice's teacher talking about a [[Gates of horn and ivory|positive and a negative gate of dreams]] and [[On Dreams|Aristotle's dream philosophy]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nFranchise originator [[Wes Craven]] presented his own [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the fourth Elm Street film, but producers Sara Risher and [[Robert Shaye]] turned it down, instead going with the 'Dream Master' pitch as a progression of the Dream Warriors concept from the previous film. Risher explained that: <blockquote style=\"width: 75%\">Initially, I approached Wes for an idea for the fourth film. I always go to Wes first each time. His idea was illogical. It was about [[time travel]] within dreams that broke all the rule of dreams. We decided not to go with that. When we decided to go with [[William Kotzwinkle|&#91;William&#93; Kotzwinkle]]'s 'Dream-master' idea, which we thought was terrific, I told Wes we were doing that.</blockquote> Shaye felt that Craven's idea did not have the impact the producers were looking for. Craven and his writing partner [[Bruce Wagner]] were later contacted about doing rewrites for the script, but turned down the offer as Craven felt that they should have been approached as artists of the original material.<ref name=\"cin1988\">{{cite magazine | last=Clarke | first=Frederick S. | date=July 1988 | magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] | title=BYE BYE FREDDY!

His one caveat was that he wanted creative control. The studio could not adhere to the demand, specifically because they had already begun filming without any director. McLoughlin said, <blockquote style=\"width: 75%\">\"When I finished ''Friday'', I was offered ''Nightmare 4'' and went to New Line, met with them, and I said, 'I love Freddy, I would love to do one of these, but I really want to do what I just did, where I had creative control',\" he explained. \"And they go, 'Well, we're already shooting.' 'What?' 'Yeah, we're already shooting, we're shooting like two different units for the visual effects' and something else, puppets or something. And I said, 'Without a director?' 'Yeah, we kind of know how we're going to make these things.' And I went, 'That's not the way I work.'

[[Rachel Talalay]] claims that she and the other producers felt that since the audience was so familiar with Freddy at this stage, it would be harder to replicate the scare factor of the first two films; instead they decided to continue in the same vein of ''Dream Warriors'' rather than focus on pure horror.

It very effectively mirrors the anxieties of the teen-age audience for which it is primarily intended.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Thomas then went on to commend Wilcox's portrayal of Alice, stating, <blockquote>\n\nIt matters not to Freddy that these kids' parents had nothing to do with his torching. In essence, however, the film is about how a shy, lovely teenager named Alice (Lisa Wilcox) with a widowed alcoholic father gradually gathers the courage to assert herself in taking on Freddy\u2014and in the process wins the love of the handsomest boy (Danny Hassel) in her school. If the nightmare sequences are impressive with their Inferno-like images, the film's young cast is no less so. Nightmare 4 provides Wilcox with an exceptionally challenging screen debut.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=22935898#spot=22935898|title=Imaginative Balance of Wit, Gore in 'Nightmare on Elm Street 4'|last=Thomas|first=Kevin|date=August 19, 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> </blockquote>While criticizing the plot for being derivative of the previous films, critic John H.
