The film stars [[Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki|Ryunosuke Kamiki]], [[Hiroyuki Miyasako]], [[Chiaki Kuriyama]], and [[Mai Takahashi]].\n\nThe film focuses largely on creatures from [[Japanese mythology]] known as ''[[y\u014dkai]]'' (\u5996\u602a, variously translated as \"apparition\", \"goblin\", \"ghoul\", \"spirit\", or \"monster\"), which came to prominence during the [[Edo period]]{{sfn|Suzuki|2011|p=232}} with the works of [[Toriyama Sekien]].{{sfn|Shamoon|2013|p=277}} It also draws inspiration from [[Hiroshi Aramata|Aramata Hiroshi's]] ''[[Teito Monogatari]]'', with the novel's antagonist [[Yasunori Kat\u014d|Kat\u014d Yasunori]] appearing as the main antagonist in the film.{{sfn|Papp|2009|p=233}}\n\nThe film is considered a loose remake of the 1968 film ''[[Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare]]'', but also draws influence from [[Shigeru Mizuki|Mizuki Shigeru's]] ''[[GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d]]'' [[manga]] series of the same name. All three are retellings of the famous Japanese tale of [[Momotar\u014d]], which features the title character driving a group of demons away from [[Kikaijima|Kikaigashima]] with the help of native animals.{{sfn|Papp|2009|p=227}} While these previous adaptations have been read mostly as nationalist narratives, with the native ''y\u014dkai'' driving out invading forces,{{sfn|Papp|2009|p=230}} ''The Great Y\u014dkai War'' has been read instead for the clash between Japan's traditional landscape and its modern culture.{{sfn|Papp|2009|p=233-234}} This is largely due to the film's use of ''kikai'' (\u6a5f\u68b0, lit. \"machine monsters\"), created by Kat\u014d fusing the ''y\u014dkai'' with machines, and the absence of invading Western or otherwise foreign forces.{{sfn|Papp|2009|p=234}}\n\nMizuki Shigeru, whose work is considered an important part of ''y\u014dkai'' discourse and culture due to his contributions in pop culture and academic study, acted as an advisor for the film and even made an appearance as the Great Elder Y\u014dkai.{{sfn|Foster|2008|p=9}} The cameo is not only a nod to Mizuki's status as a ''y\u014dkai'' expert, but his closing words also resonate closely with the theme of his manga of the same name.{{sfn|Lukas|Marmysz|2010|p=139}} Similarly, his role as a peace-keeper is one referenced throughout his work, and is born of his own experiences from real war.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=173-174}}\n\n''The Great Yokai War'' was theatrically released in Japan on August 6, 2005, and [[Gross rental|grossed]] \u00a52 billion. In 2006, the film was released internationally by [[Media Blasters|Tokyo Shock]]. A [[The Great Yokai War: Guardians|sequel]], was released in Japan on August 13, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nA young boy named Tadashi Ino moves to a small town after his parents' [[divorce]]. At a local festival, he is chosen to be that year's Kirin Rider, referring to the legendary Chinese chimera, the [[Qilin]]:{{efn|group=trans|\u9e92\u9e9f, usually translated as \"unicorn\"}} a protector of all things good. He soon discovers that his new title is quite literal, as a nefarious spirit named [[Yasunori Kat\u014d]] appears. Kat\u014d - a demon whose mystical powers are born of his rage at the annihilation of Japan's local tribes - desires vengeance against the modern Japanese for their actions against the ''y\u014dkai''.{{sfn|Lukas|Marmysz|2010|p=139}} To carry out his revenge, Kat\u014d allies himself with a ''y\u014dkai'' named Agi, summoning a fiery spirit called Yomotsumono: a creature composed of the resentment carried by the multitudinous things mankind has discarded. Kat\u014d feeds ''yokai'' into Yomotsumono's flames, fusing them with the numerous discarded tools and items to form ''kikai''. These ''kikai'' - under Kat\u014d's control - capture other ''y\u014dkai'' to build their numbers while killing humans. One such ''yokai'', a ''[[sunekosuri]]''{{efn|group=trans|\u811b\u64e6\u308a, lit. \"shin rubber\"}} escapes and befriends Tadashi who attempts to obtain the Daitenguken{{efn|group=trans|\u5927\u5929\u72d7\u5263, lit. \"great ''[[Tengu]]'' sword\"}} from the mountain as a right of passage for the role of Kirin Rider.\n\nScared by the tales told of the mountain, Tadashi falters upon his arrival at the mountain and tries to flee. However, tricked by the sea spirit [[Sh\u014dj\u014d]],{{efn|group=trans|\u7329\u3005, lit. \"heavy drinker\" or \"orangutan\"}} who picked Tadashi out, he manages to overcome a test to prove his worth. Accompanied by Sh\u014dj\u014d, Kawahime,{{efn|group=trans|\u5ddd\u59eb, lit. \"river princess\"}} and [[Kappa (folklore)|Kawatar\u014d]],{{efn|group=trans|\u5ddd\u592a\u90ce, lit. \"river-boy\"}} Tadashi makes his way to the [[Tengu#Great and small demons|Daitengu]]{{efn|group=trans|\u5927\u5929\u72d7, lit. \"great ''Tengu''\"}} who gives him the sword before being taken away by the ''kikai''. In spite of Tadashi's attempts, the sword is broken as Agi takes the ''sunekosuri'' as her captive before the boy is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen Tadashi comes to his senses, he finds himself among ''y\u014dkai'' as they discuss how to fix the sword; they ultimately decide to request the aid of the blacksmith Ippondatara.{{efn|group=trans|\u4e00\u672c\u8e0f\u97b4, lit. \"one-legged bellows\"}} Upon learning that Ippondatara was also captured, General [[Nurarihyon]]{{efn|group=trans|\u6ed1\u74e2, lit. \"slippery gourd\"}} and his group leave. Kawataro restrains an [[ittan-momen]],{{efn|group=trans|\u4e00\u53cd\u6728\u7dbf, lit. \"one [[Japanese units of measurement#Area|''tan'']] (a unit of measurement) of cotton\"}} praising the bumbling [[Azukiarai]],{{efn|group=trans|\u5c0f\u8c46\u6d17\u3044, lit. \"bean washer\"}} unaware that he only remained behind due to his foot getting numb.\n\nWhen Kat\u014d's industrial fortress takes flight towards Tokyo, Tadashi and company pursue it. They arrive shortly after the fortress ingests [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Tokyo's Shinjuku]] [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building|Capital Building]], finding Ippondatara who reforges the sword. Ippondatara refuses to talk about how he escaped, ashamed that the ''sunekosuri'' took his place in becoming a ''kikai''. Donning new attire, Tadashi and company go into battle. They are greatly outnumbered until they receive unlikely aid from thousands of ''y\u014dkai'' who believe they are coming to a party; their festival brawl with the ''kikai'' allows Tadashi and Kawahime to enter the fortress safely, followed by a ''y\u014dkai''-obsessed reporter named Sata whom Kawahime saved in the past.\n\nTadashi is forced to slay the ''kikai'' that the ''sunekosuri'' became, restoring it to its original form yet leaving it gravely injured. In a rage, Tadashi battles Agi before she is called back by Kat\u014d to begin the final phase by joining with Yomotsumono. Despite Tadashi's attempts, Kat\u014d outmatches him. Kawahime attempts to protect the boy, stating that while she hates humans due to them abandoning her, she has no desire for revenge as she considers it a human emotion. Unfazed, Kat\u014d takes the two out as Azukiarai awkwardly arrives.\n\nKat\u014d calls Agi to join him. However, her love for him is a hindrance to the process, so Kat\u014d kills her instead before entering the oven to become one with Yomotsumono. However, due to Sata's actions, one of Azukiarai's [[adzuki bean]]s ends up in the mix with Kat\u014d, causing a chain reaction of positive emotion that destroys Yomotsumono.\n\nAfter the ''yokai'' take their leave, Tadashi and Sata find themselves on the street and the boy tells his first white lie to the reporter about Kawahime's feelings towards him. Years later, Tadashi is a grown man who has lost the ability to see ''yokai'', even the ''sunekosuri''. The film ends with the ''sunekosuri'' being confronted by an Azuki-pupiled Kat\u014d.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
