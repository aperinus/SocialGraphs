It is a first-person narrative about a serial killer. Dennis ([[Michael Gunther]]) describes a series of ritual murders in letters to his sometime lover and best friend Julian ([[Jaie Laplante]]) and Julian's younger brother Kevin ([[Raoul O'Connell]]), an object of desire to Dennis.\n\nVerow once explained in an interview \"we really need to concentrate on what makes us unique, what makes us interesting and what makes us dangerous\".<ref>Carl Stychin and Didi Herman (Editors) {{google books|1hYIr80mf74C|Sexuality in the Legal Arena|page=82}}</ref>\n\nIt is banned in the UK due to its content.
