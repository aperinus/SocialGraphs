''FLCL'' is a story following [[Naota Nandaba]], a twelve-year-old boy whose suburban life is disturbed by the arrival of the mysterious [[Haruko Haruhara]]. The six-episode series was released in Japan from April 2000 to March 2001 alongside a [[manga]] and novel adaptation.\n\nIn 2016, two new seasons totaling 12 episodes were announced as a co-production between Production I.G, [[Toho]], and [[Adult Swim]]. The second season, ''FLCL Progressive'', premiered on June 3, 2018 on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block, while the third season, ''FLCL Alternative'', premiered on September 8, 2018. In Japan, ''Alternative'' and ''Progressive'' had theatrical screenings as compilation films with ''Alternative'' opening on September 7, 2018 and ''Progressive'' opening on September 28, 2018. The first episode of ''FLCL Alternative''  premiered unannounced on [[April Fools' Day]] 2018 at 12 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on Toonami in Japanese with English subtitles as part of Adult Swim's annual [[Adult Swim#April Fools' Day stunts|stunt]].\n\nTwo additional seasons were ordered by Adult Swim in 2022, titled ''FLCL: Grunge'' and ''FLCL: Shoegaze'', respectively. Both seasons will premiere in 2023.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Main|List of FLCL characters}}\nThe first season of ''FLCL'' is a [[coming-of-age story]] and revolves around Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old, working-class boy living with his widowed father and grandfather. His life in the city of Mabase is interrupted by the arrival of a [[Vespa]]-riding maniac named Haruko Haruhara. She runs over Naota then revives him with CPR before hitting him on the head with her left-handed, electric bass guitar (a blue, vintage [[Rickenbacker 4001]]) and proceeds to stalk him. Finding Haruko weaseling her way into his life as a live-in maid, Naota discovers that the head injury she caused created an \"N.O.\" portal, which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge from periodically. The first of these robots is hit on the head by Haruko and becomes a friendly service robot later named Canti. Canti ingests Naota to assume the reddened form he first had when fighting the robots sent after him.\n\nHaruko claims she is an alien investigator from the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood, and her presence places Naota and those around him in danger. The Interstellar Immigration Bureau's Commander Amarao, whom Haruko has a history with, asserts rather that she is an apathetic seductress seeking a space-manipulating being called Atomsk who was partially contained within Canti. Every time Naota is absorbed by Canti, Atomsk is gradually brought to Earth. As Atomsk is held in Medical Mechanica's custody and Haruko ultimately places Earth under threat, the company eventually turns their factory stationed on the planet into a doomsday terraforming device, attempting to have Naota and Canti absorbed by the doomsday device's Terminal Core. Haruko's plan fails as Naota ends up becoming Atomsk's host and then releases him into the universe after a brief battle that ends Medical Mechanica's attack on Earth. Haruko follows after Atomsk, and Mabase returns to some normalcy.\n\nIn the second season, ''FLCL Progressive'', Haruko returns to Mabase years later after a failed attempt to contain Atomsk, although she did manage to absorb him. Placing herself as a middle school homeroom teacher, Haruko targets a 14-year-old girl named Hidomi Hibajiri through her classmate and eventual love interest Ko Ide. Haruko finds opposition in both the headphones Hidomi wears and Julia Jinyu, a more stoic offshoot of Haruko that splintered from her during her initial attempt to control Atomsk's power. Haruko eventually eats Julia to restore herself, and uses Ide to get to Hidomi. Like before, this causes conflict between Medical Mechanica and the Interstellar Immigration Bureau, as the latter was reverse-engineering Canti's technology to utilize the N.O. Channel's energies for their own use. Atomsk appears on Earth as planned, but Haruko ends up failing again with a freed Julia taking her leave. Haruko regains her composure and resumes her hunt for Atomsk as Hidomi and Ide begin their relationship while Mabase rebuilds after much of it was destroyed by Medical Mechanica.\n\nIn the third season, ''FLCL Alternative'', Haruko enters the life of high school student Kana Koumoto and her friends as she became a mentor of sorts to Kana in helping the teen's transition into adulthood as Medical Mechanica begins its assault on Earth.\n\n==Production==\nThe first season of ''FLCL'' was directed by [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]] and produced by the ''FLCL'' Production Committee, which included [[Gainax]], [[Production I.G]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works/04_/000088.html|title=FLCL|work=Work List|publisher=[[Production I.G]]|access-date=December 19, 2013|archive-date=December 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220035311/http://www.productionig.com/contents/works/04_/000088.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and Starchild Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starchild.co.jp/e/special/library/032.html|title=FLCL|publisher=Starchild|access-date=December 19, 2013|archive-date=April 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402051200/http://www.starchild.co.jp/e/special/library/032.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTsurumaki has said that he tried to \"break the rules\" of anime when making ''FLCL'', for example, by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack, and patterning the style more after \"a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video\", creating a work that is \"short, but dense-packed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/6.03/flcl_05.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508110103/http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/6.03/flcl_05.shtml|title=PULP : : The Manga Magazine : : 6.03 FLCL|archive-date=May 8, 2006|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''FLCL''{{'}}s localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show. The in-jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences. One example was a reference to [[Cheerio (drink)|Cheerio]], a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time, [[Crystal Pepsi]].<ref name=\"at\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=34|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305000511/http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=34|archive-date=March 5, 2004|title=Anime Tourist Interview: Behind the Scenes of FLCL.|publisher=Anime Tourist|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> Director Kazuya Tsurumaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating \"comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.com/furiKuri.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220121354/http://www.production-ig.com/furiKuri.html|archive-date=December 20, 2002|title=FURI KURI|publisher=Production I.G|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron. The character Amarao describes Medical Mechanica's goal as the destruction of all thought. ''FLCL'' uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of \"thought\" by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brain's wrinkles. For English localization, the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=33|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040116113414/http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=33|archive-date=January 16, 2004|title=Interviews: Anime Tourist Interview: Behind the Scenes of FLCL|publisher=Anime Tourist|access-date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Original video animation===\n{{Main|List of FLCL episodes}}\nThe six-episode series was released in Japan from April 26, 2000 \u2013 March 16, 2001.
