It stars [[Paul Newman]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Jack Warden]], [[James Mason]], [[Milo O'Shea]], and [[Lindsay Crouse]]. A down-on-his-luck alcoholic lawyer accepts a [[medical malpractice]] case to improve his own situation, but discovers along the way that he is doing the right thing.\n\n''The Verdict'' garnered critical acclaim and box office success. The film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] (Sidney Lumet), [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Paul Newman), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (James Mason), and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (David Mamet).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400 to 700 words ONLY-->\nOnce-promising attorney Frank Galvin is an alcoholic [[ambulance chaser]]. As a favor, former partner Mickey Morrissey sends him a [[medical malpractice]] case which is all but certain to be settled out-of-court for a significant amount. The case involves a young woman given general [[anesthesia]] during childbirth at a Catholic hospital, after which she choked on her vomit and was left [[coma]]tose and on a ventilator. The [[plaintiff]]s, her sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care.\n\nGalvin is deeply affected upon seeing the comatose woman. A representative of the Catholic diocese offers a substantial settlement. Without consulting the family, Galvin declines and states his intention to take the case to trial, stunning all parties, including the [[judge]] who hears the case. While preparing for the trial, Galvin encounters Laura in a bar and becomes romantically involved with her.\n\nThe case experiences several setbacks: The hospital's attorney, Ed Concannon, has a large legal team that is masterful with the press. The comatose woman's brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannon's team told him of the settlement and Galvin's rejecting it. Galvin's [[expert witness|medical expert]] disappears before testifying, and a hastily-arranged substitute's credentials are challenged. Judge Hoyle resents Galvin's refusal to settle the case, and undermines his questioning of the substitute. Nobody who was in the operating room is willing to testify that negligence occurred.\n\nIn chambers during the trial, Judge Hoyle threatens Galvin with [[disbarment]], but he angrily dismisses the judge as a [[bagman]] and \"[[defendant]]'s judge\" who couldn't \"hack it\" as a lawyer, then asks for a mistrial. The judge denies the request and threatens to have Galvin arrested by the bailiff. Galvin storms out.\n\nKaitlin Costello, the nurse who admitted the woman to the hospital, is now a pre-school teacher in New York City; Galvin travels there to seek her help. As Laura hastily arranges to meet him there, Morrissey discovers a check from Concannon in her handbag and realizes Concannon is paying her to provide inside information on Galvin's legal strategy. Morrissey informs Galvin of Laura's betrayal, after which Galvin confronts her in a bar. He strikes her, knocking her to the floor. Back in Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannon's ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue.\n\nIn the courtroom, Costello testifies that she wrote that the patient ate a full meal one hour before being admitted, which contradicts the note (which has been admitted as evidence) stating a nine-hour interval. On cross-examination, an incredulous Concannon asks her how she can prove this; Costello reveals that before she was asked to make the change, she made a photocopy of the original note, and that she brought the copy to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the note in evidence is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]] later confessed to her that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia, which is not proper for someone who ate only an hour previously. As a result, the patient vomited and choked. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costello's career if she did not change the \"1\" to a \"9\u201d.\n\nAfter Costello is dismissed, Concannon again objects on the grounds that the original has precedence. The judge agrees and declares Costello's testimony [[Motion to strike (court of law)|stricken from the record]]. Afterwards a diocese lawyer praises Concannon's performance to the diocese's bishop, who then asks, \"But do you believe her?\" \u2014 and is met with embarrassed silence.\n\nDespite believing his case is hopeless, Frank gives a brief but passionate [[closing argument]]. The jury (whose members apparently did not \"strike from their record\" the altered note)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gardenstatecle.com/|title=Legal Lessons from 'The Verdict'|access-date=19 October 2022|website=The Verdict: Why Ask Why?|quote=(legal discussion available for viewing on YouTube)}}</ref> finds in favor of the comatose woman; in addition, the jury foreman asks the judge whether the jury can award more than the amount the plaintiffs sought; the judge resignedly replies that they can. As Galvin is congratulated outside the courtroom, he catches a glimpse of Laura watching him from across the atrium before vanishing.\n\nThat night, a drunk Laura drops her whiskey on the floor, drags her telephone towards her and dials Galvin's office number. As his phone rings, Frank sits with a cup of coffee. He moves to answer the call but then stops and lets the phone continue to ring. The film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Paul Newman]] as attorney Frank Galvin\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Laura Fischer\n* [[Jack Warden]] as attorney Mickey Morrissey\n* [[James Mason]] as attorney Ed Concannon\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Judge Hoyle\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Kaitlin Costello Price\n* [[Edward Binns]] as Bishop Brophy\n* [[Julie Bovasso]] as Maureen Rooney\n* [[Roxanne Hart]] as Sally Doneghy, the victim's sister\n* [[James Handy]] as Kevin Doneghy\n* [[Wesley Addy]] as Dr. Towler\n* [[Joe Seneca]] as Dr. Thompson\n* [[Lewis J.

A number of actors, including [[Roy Scheider]], [[William Holden]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Cary Grant]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]], expressed interest in the project because of the strength of the lead role. [[Arthur Hiller]] was originally attached to direct while [[David Mamet]] was hired to write a screenplay.<ref name=\"William Goldman p 62-67\">William Goldman, ''Adventures in the Screen Trade'', 1982 pp. 62-67</ref>\n\nThough Mamet had made a name for himself in the theater, he was still new to screenwriting (his first film credit had come in 1978).<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Joe Mantegna|date=21 April 2009|website=The A.V. Club|url=https://www.avclub.com/joe-mantegna-1798216310|accessdate=19 October 2022}}</ref> The producers were uncertain whether Mamet would take the job given the standards he set with his own previous work, but according to [[Lindsay Crouse]], who was then married to Mamet, the film was actually a big deal for him. Crouse also recalled Mamet struggling initially with Galvin's closing summation, but he finally came up with the scene after staying up an entire evening working on it.<ref name=dvdextra1>{{cite AV media|title=Milestones in Cinema History: The Verdict|type=featurette|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nMamet's original draft ended the film after the jury left the courtroom for deliberations, giving no resolution to the case. Neither Zanuck and Brown believed they could make the film without showing what happened, and Zanuck met with Mamet to convince him to re-write the ending. However, Mamet told Zanuck that the ending he wanted was \"old-fashioned\" and would hurt the film. He also reacted negatively to Zanuck's use of sarcasm to make his point, as Zanuck claimed his copy of the script was missing its final pages before telling Mamet the film title would need a question mark after it.<ref name=dvdextra1/>\n\nHiller also disliked Mamet's script, and left the project. The producers commissioned another screenplay from [[Jay Presson Allen]], which they preferred, and they were later approached by [[Robert Redford]] to star in the film when he obtained a copy of the script from Allen.<ref name=\"William Goldman p 62-67\"/><ref name=dvdextra1/>\n\nRedford suggested [[James Bridges]] as a writer-director, and he had Bridges write several drafts of the screenplay, more or less sanitizing the lead character as he was concerned about playing a hard-drinking womanizer.<ref name=dvdextra1/><ref name=\"William Goldman p 62-67\"/> Neither the producers nor Redford were happy with the rewrites and soon Bridges left the project. Redford then began having meetings with [[Sydney Pollack]] without telling the producers; irritated, they fired Redford.<ref name=\"William Goldman p 62-67\"/>\n\nZanuck and Brown then hired [[Sidney Lumet]] to direct, sending him all versions of the script. After several rewrites, Lumet decided the story's original grittiness was fast devolving and chose Mamet's original script. This was agreed to by Paul Newman, who ultimately agreed to star.<ref>Shawn Levy, ''Paul Newman: A Life,'' p. 436.</ref> Lumet recalled that they had to rework only one or two scenes, mainly giving the trial a resolution as Zanuck and Brown had originally requested. Unlike Zanuck, when Lumet approached Mamet, he was able to get his approval to make that change to his original work.<ref name=dvdextra1/>\n\nLumet then recruited Warden and Mason, both of whom he had worked with before. He wasn't sure if Mason, a renowned actor in that era, would take a supporting role, but Mason liked Mamet's script and did not object.<ref name=dvdextra1/>\n\nPrior to filming, Lumet held extensive dress rehearsals, standard practice for Lumet's films but not common on Hollywood productions. Newman was appreciative as they proved crucial in developing his performance, giving him the time he needed to tap into the emotional bankruptcy of his character.<ref name=dvdextra2>{{cite AV media|title=Hollywood Backstories: The Verdict|type=featurette|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nAt one point during production, Newman barely avoided serious injury when a light estimated to weigh several hundred pounds fell about three feet away from him after breaking through its supports. The wood planks were apparently weakened by overnight rain.<ref name=dvdextra2/>\n\n[[Bruce Willis]] and [[Tobin Bell]] have uncredited background appearances.<ref name=\"Jokic\">{{cite news|last=Jokic|first=Natasha|date=8 January 2022|title=15 Super-Famous Actors Who You Might Be Surprised Started Off As Extras|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/natashajokic1/celebrity-actor-extras|work=BuzzFeed|location=New York, NY}}</ref> They are seated together as extras in the final courtroom scene.<ref name=\"Jokic\"/>\n\nThe producers were reluctant to keep the scene where Newman strikes Rampling, believing it would turn the audience against his character and even damage his public image. Newman insisted on keeping it, believing it was right for the story.<ref name=dvdextra2/>\n\nAfter the film was finished, the studio's executives sent Lumet several suggestions and urged him rework the ending with Galvin finally answering Laura's phone call, but Zanuck said that Lumet had final cut authority, and the film would remain as completed.<ref name=dvdextra1/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 89%, with an average rating of 7.8/10, based on 36 reviews.
