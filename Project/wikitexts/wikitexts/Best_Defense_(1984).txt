In 1984, Murphy is US Army Lt. T.M. Landry, an American tank commander sent to [[Kuwait]] to demonstrate the \"XM-10 Annihilator\", America's latest [[main battle tank]], which is equipped with Cooper's system. Because of the tank's poor design and shoddy construction, Landry and his crew are barely able to control or navigate the XM-10 before it leaves the proving grounds and wanders into a combat zone during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.\n\nCooper and Landry never directly interact during the film, but the plot shows how the decisions made by Cooper affect Landry's tank.\n\nCooper, an engineer for a troubled [[defense contractor]], is in charge of designing the \"DYP-gyro\", a [[gyroscope]] for the army's new tank. The company's future hinges on the success of the project. Cooper's gyro fails a crucial test, dooming the company. Downtrodden, Cooper later crosses paths with another engineer named Frank Holtzman (Noonan) who has also designed a DYP-gyro. Holtzman, fearful of what will happen in his meeting with Jeff (Rasche), a deep-cover KGB agent, secretly hides the plans in Cooper's briefcase. After Holtzman is murdered, Cooper discovers the plans. Cooper's co-worker and best friend Steve Loparino (Dzundza) later puts Cooper's name on the plans, and when the \"new\" gyro works, Cooper is hailed for saving the company.\n\nIn 1984, Landry's tank comes under fire from [[Iraqi Air Force|Iraqi]] jets, leading Landry to plead that he does not belong in this war, shouting \"I'm from [[Cleveland]]!\" at the attacking planes.\n\nBack in 1982, Cooper is contacted by Jeff who tries to obtain the DYP plans. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], knowing that Cooper took credit for somebody else's work, forces him to act as bait for Jeff in a set-up operation. The set-up nearly fails - Jeff is killed during a gun battle, and Cooper himself is shot. Realizing his mortality while being put on an ambulance, Cooper confesses to Clair (Shaver), an attractive co-worker, that he stole the DYP. This triggers an angry response from Clair and also from his wife Laura (Capshaw) who, arriving on the scene, realizes that Cooper has been cheating on her. Surviving the bullet, Cooper receives even worse news from a co-worker: the DYP-gyro he claimed credit for will not work, because it will cause overheating in the WAM, another critical component, crippling the tank's fire control and, in a combat situation, dooming the tank.\n\nThe film reaches its climax in a sequence weaving between 1982 when a more conscientious Cooper, having recovered, confronts his employers about the flaws in the DYP, while in 1984, Landry attempts to fire the main gun while under attack by an Iraqi [[Attack helicopter|gunship]]. As had been predicted, the DYP causes failure in the WAM, suggesting that Wylie's protest was ignored.\n\nInstead, the camera cuts to the innards and shows that the DYP has been redesigned according to an idea that Cooper had in 1982 while fixing one of his son's toys. The redesign works, enabling the tank's [[Surface-to-air missile|air defense rockets]] to launch and destroy the Iraqi gunship. The film ends with Cooper and Landry as heroes in their respective jobs.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dudley Moore]] as Wylie Cooper\n*[[Eddie Murphy]] as Lieutenant T.M.

Additionally, several other scenes that were important to the original plot were cut in order to fit the newly shot scenes with Murphy into the film, thus contributing to the film's poor reception and reputation as a \"meandering mess\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rabin |first1=Nathan |title=My Year Of Flops Case File # 15: Best Defense |url=https://film.avclub.com/my-year-of-flops-case-file-15-best-defense-1798210918 |website=www.AVclub.com |publisher=AV Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Aiming for the zaniness of Catch-22, this comedy misfires. |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002061_best_defense |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nWhen Murphy hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' about five months after the film was released, he admitted in his opening monologue that he knew the film was awful and did it for the money: \"After I did ''[[48 Hrs.|48 Hours]]'' and ''[[Trading Places]]'', all these scripts started comin\u2019 from everywhere, and I picked up a script called ''Best Defense''. There\u2019s a movie that sucked real bad! At first, I wasn\u2019t gonna do it because I read the script, and I felt like I was an actor at first. But the money they gave me to do ''Best Defense'', y\u2019all woulda done ''Best Defense'' too, okay? ... I was like, 'What?! How dare you give me a script like this! Oh, that much money? Let\u2019s go!' ''Best Defense'' turned out to be the worst movie ever done in the history of anything, and all of a sudden, I wasn\u2019t that hot no more.
