It tells the story of three friends stranded in a [[chairlift]] after a day of [[skiing]], forced to make life-or-death choices in order to survive and get down.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nDan Walker, his girlfriend Parker O'Neil, and his best friend Joe Lynch, travel to a ski resort to enjoy a day on the slopes. Before departing, the three friends convince the ski lift operator to let them go on one last run down the mountain before the resort closes for a long weekend. The ski lift operator gets relieved from duty by a second operator. The first operator tells the second one that there are three people who still needed to come down, but the second operator mistakes three mingling skiers for Dan, Parker and Joe and turns the ski lift off as the three friends dangle many feet above the ground.\n\nTrapped on the ski lift chair, the trio argues over how to escape before Dan jumps off the chair in an attempt to get help. The fall breaks both of Dan's legs and he is subsequently attacked and killed by a pack of wolves while his friends watch helplessly.\n\nJoe attempts to traverse the ski lift cable, making it onto a nearby support tower, but doing this causes the bolt holding the chair to the cable to become dangerously loose.\n\nOn the ground, the wolves have gathered below, waiting for Joe. After being attacked, he manages to scare them off using a [[ski pole]] and then slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help, but the wolves chase after him. Joe does not return by the next morning, so Parker attempts to reach the support pole herself. As she stands in the chair, the bolt fails and the lift falls to a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps from the chair, but the chair then falls and [[Ankle fracture|fractures her ankle]].\n\nParker begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse and, too occupied with eating, they ignore Parker as she continues down, eventually reaching a road. While a car passes without noticing her, another eventually appears and the driver stops. He drives her to a local hospital, telling her that she will be okay. Parker closes her eyes as she misses Dan and remembers him telling her that she will survive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as Joe Lynch, Dan's best friend\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Dan Walker, Joe's best friend\n* [[Emma Bell]] as Parker O'Neil, Dan's girlfriend\n* [[Rileah Vanderbilt]] as Shannon\n* Ed Ackerman as Jason\n* Adam Johnson as Rifkin\n* Christopher York as Ryan\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as Cody\n* [[Will Barratt]] as Sullivan\n* [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] as Guy on Chairlift #1\n* Joe Lynch as Guy on Chairlift #2\n* Peder Melhuse as Driver\n* [[Dee Snider#Personal life|Cody Blue Snider]] as [[Twisted Sister]] fan in cafeteria\n\n==Production==\n''Frozen'' was filmed at [[Snowbasin]] near [[Ogden, Utah]], in February 2009<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35118/official-frozen-website-opens-its-doors|title=Official Frozen Website Opens its Doors|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2009-12-28|access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> and distributed by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18348|title=Sundance '10: First Hi-Res Look at Adam Green Chiller 'Frozen'|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2009-12-10|access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the 2010 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18393 |title=Sundance '10: Low Quality Look at the Official One Sheet for 'Frozen'|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2009-12-15|access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> It was released in North American theaters on February 5, 2010,<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Steve|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34913/first-stills-adam-greens-frozen|title=First Stills from Adam Green's ''Frozen''|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2009-12-10|access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> with distribution from Anchor Bay Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18513|title=New 'Season of the Witch' Stills, 'Frozen' Website Launch|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2009-12-27|access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref>\n\nWhile playing at Sundance, the film caused quite a stir with numerous faintings reported from audience members that could not handle the tension of the film.
