It is partly based upon the [[minor league baseball|minor-league baseball]] experiences of writer/director [[Ron Shelton]] and depicts the players and fans of the [[Durham Bulls]], a [[minor-league baseball]] team in [[Durham, North Carolina]].\n\nThe film stars [[Kevin Costner]] as [[Crash Davis|\"Crash\" Davis]], a veteran catcher from the [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[Gwinnett Stripers|Richmond Braves]], brought in to teach rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh ([[Tim Robbins]]) about the game in preparation for reaching the major leagues. Baseball [[groupie]] Annie Savoy ([[Susan Sarandon]]) romances Nuke but finds herself increasingly attracted to Crash. Also featured are [[Robert Wuhl]] and [[Trey Wilson]], as well as popular baseball \"clown\" [[Max Patkin]].\n\n''Bull Durham'' was a commercial success, grossing over $50 million in North America, well above its estimated budget, and was a critical success as well. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' ranked it the #1 Greatest Sports Movie of all time. ''[[The Moving Arts Film Journal]]'' ranked it #3 on its list of the 25 Greatest Sports Movies of All-Time.  In addition, the film is ranked #55 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies.\" It is also ranked #97 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]\" list, and #1 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' list of the 53 best-reviewed sports movies.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Minor League baseball]] single-A team the [[Durham Bulls]] are dealing with another sparsely attended losing season, with one thing working for them; Ebby Calvin LaLoosh<!-- not yet \"Nuke\", so don't call him that here -->, a hotshot rookie [[pitcher]] known for having a \"million dollar arm, but a five cent head,\" who has potential to become a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] talent.  \"Crash\" Davis, a 12-year veteran in [[minor league baseball]], is sent down as the team's [[catcher]] to educate LaLoosh and control his haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \"Meat\", and they get off to a rocky start.\n\nThrown into the mix is Annie, a \"baseball groupie\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \"Church of Baseball\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much of a veteran to \"try out\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \"believes in\", ending with, \"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \"Nuke\").\n\nCrash forces Nuke to learn \"not to think\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke shakes off his signs), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \"heat\" ([[fastball]]s). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in major league, which he briefly lived for \"the 21 greatest days of my life\" and to which he has tried for years to return. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.\n\nAfter a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season, adding to the Bulls' good fortunes and, in the end, he is called up to the major leagues. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. Nuke leaves, Annie ends their relationship, and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice. The Bulls, now having no use for Nuke's mentor, release Crash. Crash then presents himself at Annie's house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend-long lovemaking session. Crash then leaves Annie's house to seek a further minor-league position.\n\nCrash joins another team, the [[Asheville Tourists]], and breaks the minor-league record for career [[home run]]s. Nuke is seen one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clich\u00e9d answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with \"boys.\" Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for [[Visalia Rawhide|a minor-league team in Visalia]]. The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie's candle-lit living room.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Lawrence \"Crash\" Davis\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Annie Savoy\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" Laloosh\n* [[Trey Wilson]] as Joe \"Skip\" Riggins\n* [[Robert Wuhl]] as Larry Hockett\n* [[William O'Leary (actor)|William O'Leary]] as Jimmy\n* David Neidorf as Bobby\n* Jenny Robertson as Millie\n* [[Danny Gans]] as Deke\n* [[Max Patkin]] as Himself\n}}\n\n==Background==\nThe film's name is based on the nickname for [[Durham, North Carolina]], since 1874, when [[W. T. Blackwell and Company]] named its product \"Bull\" Durham tobacco, which soon became a well-known trademark. In 1898, [[James B. Duke]] purchased the company and renamed it the [[American Tobacco Company]]. By this time, the nickname \"Bull City\" had already stuck.\n\nThe film's writer and director, Ron Shelton, played [[minor league baseball]] for five years after graduating from [[Westmont College]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Initially playing second base for the [[Baltimore Orioles]]' farm system, he moved from the Appalachian League to California and then Texas before finally playing [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA baseball]] for the [[Rochester Red Wings]] in the [[International League]]. Shelton quit when he realized he would never become a major league player. \"I was 25. In baseball, you feel 60 if you're not in the big leagues. I didn't want to become a Crash Davis\", he said.<ref name= \"Ansen, David\">{{cite news| last = Ansen | first = David | author-link = David Ansen| title = A Major-League Romp| work = [[Newsweek]]| date = June 20, 1988}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to school and earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in sculpture at the [[University of Arizona]] before moving to Los Angeles to join the city's art scene. However, he felt more kinship in telling stories than in creating performance art.
