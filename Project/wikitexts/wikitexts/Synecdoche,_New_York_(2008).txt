He suffers from numerous physical ailments and has been growing increasingly alienated from his artist wife, Adele. He hits bottom when Adele leaves him for a new life in [[Berlin]], taking their four-year-old daughter, Olive, with her.\n\nAfter the success of his production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', Caden unexpectedly receives a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]], giving him the financial means to pursue his artistic interests. He determines to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]], he directs a celebration of the mundane, instructing the cast to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly [[Mimesis|mimetic]] of the city outside, Caden continues to seek solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is being groomed by Adele's friend Maria. After a failed attempt at a fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his [[autonomic nervous system]].\n\nAs the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]s. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden's relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide.\n\nAs he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele's custodian. He lives out his days in the model of Adele's apartment under the replacement director's instruction while some unexplained calamity occurs in the warehouse leaving ruins and bodies in its wake. Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen's mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden says that now he has an idea of how to do the play when the director's voice in his ear gives him his final cue: \"Die.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Caden Cotard\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Hazel\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Claire Elizabeth Keen\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Adele Lack\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Tammy\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Ellen Bascomb / Millicent Weems\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Maria\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Madeleine Gravis\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as Sammy Barnathan\n* Sadie Goldstein as Olive Cotard\n* [[Robin Weigert]] as adult Olive\n* [[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]] as Mrs. Bascomb\n* [[Jerry Adler]] as Caden's father\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as Caden's mother\n* [[Josh Pais]] as Ophthalmologist\n* [[Daniel London]] as Tom\n* [[Stephen Adly Guirgis]] as Davis\n* [[Amy Wright]] as Burning House Realtor\n* [[Paul Sparks]] as Derek\n* [[John Rothman]] as Dentist\n* [[Frank Wood (actor)|Frank Wood]] as Evaluative Services Doctor\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as Warehouse Realtor\n* [[Daisy Tahan]] as Ariel\n* [[Cliff Carpenter]] as Old Man\n* [[Amy Spanger]] as Soap Actress Nurse\n* [[Nick Wyman]] as Soap Actor Doctor\n* [[Dan Ziskie]] as Leg Tremor Doctor\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as Frances\n* [[Alvin Epstein]] as Man with Nosebleed\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Needleman Actor\n* [[Joe Lisi]] as Maurice\n* [[Alice Drummond]] as Actress Playing Frances\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Actor Playing Man With Nosebleed\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Pastor\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as Emergency Room Doctor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] approached Kaufman and [[Spike Jonze]] about making a horror film.

At first showing reluctance to buy it, Hazel remarks to the real estate agent, \"I like it, I do.

Adele works on an extremely small scale, while Caden works on an impossibly large scale, constructing a full-size replica of New York City in a warehouse, and eventually a warehouse within that warehouse, and so on, continuing in this impossible cycle. Adele's name is almost a [[mondegreen]] for \"a delicate art\" (Adele Lack Cotard). Commenting on the scale of the paintings (actually the miniaturized paintings of artist [[Alex Kanevsky]]),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|last=Chocano|first=Carina|date=October 24, 2008|title=Review: 'Synecdoche, New York'|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-synecdoche24-2008oct24-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306013209/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-synecdoche24-2008oct24-story.html|archive-date=March 6, 2015|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Kaufman said, \"In [Adele's] studio at the beginning of the movie you can see some small but regular-sized paintings that you could see without a magnifying glass ... By the time [Caden] goes to the gallery to look at her work, which is many years later, you can't see them at all.\" He continued, \"As a dream image it appeals to me. Her work is in a way much more effective than Caden's work. Caden's goal in his attempt to do his sprawling theater piece is to impress Adele because he feels so lacking next to her in terms of his work\", and added, \"Caden's work is so literal. The only way he can reflect reality in his mind is by imitating it full-size ...

Caden often appears to exist in a combination of the two. Kaufman has said, \"I think the difference is that a movie that tries to be a dream has a punchline and the punchline is: it was a dream.\"<ref name=\"twitchfilm\" /><ref name=\"wsws.org\"/> Another concept in Jungian psychology is the four steps to self-realization: becoming conscious of the [[shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (recognizing the constructive and destructive sides), of the [[anima and animus]] (where a man becomes conscious of his female component and a woman becomes conscious of her male component), of the archetypal spirit (where humans take on their mana personalities), and finally [[self-realization]] (where a person is fully aware of the ego and the self). Caden seems to go through all four stages. When he hires Sammy, he learns of his true personality and becomes more aware of himself. He shows awareness of his anima when replacing himself with Ellen and telling Tammy that his persona would have made him more adept in womanhood than in manhood. In taking on the role of Ellen, he becomes conscious of the archetypal spirit and finally realizes truths about his life and about love.\n\n'''References to delusion'''\n\nIn the [[Cotard delusion]], one believes oneself to be dead or that one's organs are missing or decaying.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=7625193|year=1995|last1=Berrios|first1=GE|last2=Luque|first2=R|title=Cotard's syndrome: analysis of 100 cases.|volume=91|issue=3|pages=185\u20138|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb09764.x|s2cid=8764432}}</ref> Caden's preoccupation with illness and dying seems related.\n\nWhen Caden enters Adele's flat, the buzzer pressed (31Y) bears the name \"Capgras\". [[Capgras delusion]] is a psychiatric disorder in which sufferers perceive familiar people (spouses, siblings, friends) to have been replaced by identical imposters. This theme is echoed throughout the film as people are replaced by actors in Caden's play.\n\nIn the closing scenes of the film, Caden hears instructions by earpiece. This is similar to the auditory third-person hallucination described by [[Kurt Schneider]] as a first-rank symptom of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>Schneider, K. Clinical Psychopathology. New York: Grune and Stratton. 1959.</ref>\n\n'''Play within a play'''\n\nThe film is [[Meta-reference|meta-referential]] in that it portrays a [[play within a play]], sometimes also called ''[[mise en abyme]]''. <!-- Removed \"synecdoche\" definition - repetition from first paragraph -->\n\nThis theme has been compared to [[William Shakespeare]]'s line \"All the world\u2019s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|date=October 24, 2008|title=Movie review: 'Synecdoche, New York'|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2008/10/24/synecdoche/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424111525/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2008/10/24/synecdoche/|archive-date=April 24, 2009|access-date=April 23, 2009|work=[[Salon.com]]}}</ref><ref name=\"lvc\">{{Cite web|last=Manteris|first=Nick|title=Synecdoche, New York|url=http://www.lasvegascritics.com/reviews/synecdoche-new-york.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126040213/http://www.lasvegascritics.com/reviews/synecdoche-new-york.html|archive-date=November 26, 2010|access-date=December 19, 2010|website=Las Vegas Critics}}</ref> It has also been compared to the music video for Icelandic singer [[Bj\u00f6rk]]'s song \"[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]\",<ref name=\"lvc\" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Rocchi|first=James|date=May 23, 2008|title=Cannes Review: Synecdoche, New York|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2008/05/23/cannes-review-synecdoche-new-york/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207204632/http://www.cinematical.com/2008/05/23/cannes-review-synecdoche-new-york/|archive-date=February 7, 2009|access-date=April 23, 2009|website=Cinematical}}</ref> which portrays a woman who finds an autobiographical book about her that writes itself, which is then adapted into a play that features a play within itself.
