''Poetic Justice'' follows Justice (Jackson), a poet mourning the loss of her boyfriend from gun violence, who goes on a road trip from [[South Central L.A.]] to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] on a mail truck along with her friend (King) and a postal worker (Shakur) who she initially cannot stand but soon helps Justice deal with her depression.\n\nFollowing the success of his debut film, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', Singleton wanted to make a film that would give a voice to young African-American women. [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]], [[Lisa Bonet]], [[Monica Calhoun]] and many other popular actresses auditioned for the role of Justice, though Singleton knew from the script's draft that the role was solely intended for Janet Jackson.<ref name=Essence20th>{{cite web|last=Ade-Brown|first=Lathleen|title=EXCLUSIVE: John Singleton on the 20th Anniversary of 'Poetic Justice,' Working with Janet Jackson and Tupac|url=http://www.essence.com/2013/07/23/exclusive-john-singleton-20th-anniversary-poetic-justice-working-janet-jackson-and-tupac/|publisher=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|access-date=26 July 2013|date=23 July 2013 }}</ref> Filming took place from April 14 to July 4, 1992.\n\n''Poetic Justice'' was released in the United States on July 23, 1993. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the screenplay though praised Jackson and Shakur's performances and chemistry. It reached No. 1 in the box office its opening weekend, grossing $11,728,455. It eventually grossed a total of $27,515,786. Jackson received [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] nominations for Best Original Song for \"[[Again (Janet Jackson song)|Again]]\", which also reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The film has developed a [[cult film|cult following]], especially for the chemistry between Jackson and Shakur.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, do not expand this plot section beyond 700 words. Your additions will be removed. -->\nJustice is a young African American woman living in [[South Central, Los Angeles]], named by her late mother who gave birth to her while attending [[law school]]. After the fatal shooting of her boyfriend Markell, Justice becomes deeply depressed, spending most of her time with her cat named Whiteboy in the house that she inherited from her grandmother, and only going out to her job at a local hair salon. A talented poet, Justice reads many of her poems throughout the film, both to other characters and in voice-over.\n\nWhile she is working at the salon one day, a young postal clerk named Lucky arrives and begins flirting with her. She and her female boss Jessie rebuff his advances, pretending to be lesbians and mocking Lucky with their \"relationship\".\n\nLucky has also suffered tragedy in his life: his main focus is caring for his young daughter Keisha, whom he had to forcibly remove from the care of her crack-addicted mother (nicknamed \"Angel\"), who was using drugs and having sex with her drug dealer while leaving the child unattended in the apartment. Lucky dreams of a professional career in music and shows considerable promise, but insists that his cousin is the true talent.\n\nJustice's friend Iesha manages to talk Justice into taking a road trip to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] with Iesha's boyfriend, Chicago, Lucky's co-worker at the post office. Justice warily accepts, mainly because she has to go to Oakland for a hair show and her car had stopped working at the last minute. Unbeknownst to Justice, Lucky is also on the trip, and she will now be sharing a postal van with him and their two mutual friends. Initially, they argue, but they soften towards each other as they gradually discover their similarities.\n\nThe quartet makes a couple of detours: the first is a family reunion barbecue they see signs for on the road, where it becomes apparent (although there were ample hints earlier) that Iesha and Chicago's relationship is troubled. Iesha openly flirts with another man at the barbecue, while Chicago broods watching her behavior. Iesha and Chicago argue in the mail truck until Justice talks to Iesha about her behavior with alcohol. Iesha throws up and tearfully apologizes to her.\n\nAt the next stop, a carnival, Lucky and Justice grow closer while discussing their lives. After leaving the reunion, they stop at a beach where each of the four contemplates their separate situations in internal monologues. Afterward, the friction between Chicago and Iesha explodes when Iesha informs Chicago that she has been seeing someone on the side, and he physically attacks her. Lucky initially decides to abstain until Justice defends Iesha by kicking Chicago in the groin, who retaliates by physically and brutally attacks her. Lucky knocks Chicago out, and he, Justice and a bleeding and shaken Iesha leave him behind and continue on their journey.\n\nLucky stops the postal van at a beach, and Justice goes to see what's wrong. She begins opening up to him about her life, and Lucky becomes sympathetic. They share a kiss, and Justice walks away apparently unsure of her feelings for Lucky. She goes back to him, and they kiss again.\n\nWhen the now-trio arrive in Oakland, they receive news that Lucky's cousin, with whom he had been working on recording music, has been killed. Blaming himself for not being in Oakland sooner and believing he could have prevented the shooting had he been in town, Lucky angrily blames Justice for distracting him while they were on the road. Jessie advises Justice and Iesha about men before the hair show. Lucky's uncle and aunt give him his cousin's recording equipment. Lucky decides to give up work and take care of Keisha.\n\nMonths later, Lucky meets up with Justice again back at the hair salon, bringing Keisha. Remorseful over his conduct in Oakland and his cruel words towards Justice there, he apologizes. She smiles at him coyly and they passionately kiss. She then turns her attention to Keisha, fussing over her hair. Justice and Lucky's eyes meet over Keisha's head and they smile, as strongly connected as ever.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Janet Jackson]] as Justice, a poet\n* [[Tupac Shakur]] as Lawrence \"Lucky\", a postal clerk\n* [[Regina King]] as Iesha, Justice's friend\n* [[Joe Torry]] as \"Chicago\"\n* [[Tyra Ferrell]] as Jessie\n* [[Rose Weaver]] as Aunt Audrey\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Brad (Opening Movie)\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Penelope (Opening Movie)\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] as Simone\n* John Cothran Jr. as Uncle Earl\n* [[Maya Angelou]] as Aunt June\n* [[Norma Donaldson]] as Aunt May\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Anne, Lucky's Mother\n* [[Maia Campbell]] as Shante\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr.]] as Earl\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Kareem LaVine\n* [[Tone Loc]] as James Paul\n* [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] as Markell, Justice's boyfriend\n* [[Keith Washington]] as Dexter\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Heywood\n* [[Michael Colyar]] as Panhandler\n* [[The Last Poets]] as themselves\n\n==Production==\nOn July 23, 2013, [[John Singleton]] spoke with writer Lathleen Ade-Brown for ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine and discussed the 20th anniversary of the film. The interview mentioned that in 1993, black female leads were rare and he wanted to give a voice to young African American women. He also revealed whose idea it was for [[Janet Jackson]] to wear the now iconic [[box braids]]: \"That was a collaboration between myself, Janet, [dance choreographer] [[Fatima Robinson]] and dancer named Jossie Harris. Jossie had the braids in [[Michael Jackson]]\u2019s \"[[Remember the Time]]\" video. I brought her and Fatima and a couple of other dancers over to hang out with Janet and they all became friends. I said, \"Why don't we try and do Janet's hair like Jossie's hair?\" We got the hairstyle from [[Harlem]] and just put it in a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] movie.\".<ref name=Essence20th/>\n\n[[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]], [[Lisa Bonet]], [[Monica Calhoun]] and many other popular actresses auditioned for the role of Justice, though Singleton knew from the script's draft that the role was solely intended for Janet Jackson.<ref name=Essence20th/> Rapper and actor [[Ice Cube]] was offered the lead role of Lucky, but turned it down, stating that he was not in a point in his career that he would play in romantic movies.

[[Cineplex Odeon]] initially decided not to release the film at its [[Universal CityWalk]] Hollywood theater due to fear of violence. [[Rita Walters]] called Cineplex Odeon's decision racist and they agreed to delay the release until July 28.

By the end of the film, Justice will have learned to trust and love again, and Shakur will have learned how to listen to a woman. And all of the characters - who in one way or another lack families - will begin to get a feeling for the larger African/American family to which they belong.

The song \"Definition of a Thug Nigga\", recorded by [[Tupac Shakur]] for the film, later appeared on his 1997 posthumous album ''[[R U Still Down? (Remember Me)]]''.\n\nDue to the film's casting of two major music stars of the time, there was a lot of hype surrounding the release of the movie. Many were excited to see how the dynamic between Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur would manifest itself in the film both visually and musically. On the soundtrack, each artist was given a single song. \"Definition of a Thug Nigga\" could be seen as an example of braggadocious, violent rap music, but it could also be viewed as a cultural exposition on a lifestyle that Shakur felt to be systemic and inherent in the lives of his peers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|title=Poetic Justice|id=0107840}}\n* {{Amg movie|38522|Poetic Justice}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Singleton |first1=John |title=Poetic justice : filmmaking South Central style |date=1993 |publisher=Delta |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0385309141 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120103155818/http://corky.net/scripts/poeticJustice.html Original Poetic Justice Script]\n* [http://www.omdb.org/movie/8291 Poetic Justice] at the Open Media Database\n* [http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/27247/moviemain.jhtml VH1 Clips, Trailer and more] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731032939/http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/27247/moviemain.jhtml |date=2008-07-31 }}\n\n{{John Singleton}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1993 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:African-American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stanley Clarke]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Singleton]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Golden Raspberry Award winning films]]\n[[Category:American gang films]]\n[[Category:Hood films]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Singleton]]\n[[Category:Works about poets]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
