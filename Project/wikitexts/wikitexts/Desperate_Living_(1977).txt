A cross-dressing policeman arrests the pair and gives them an ultimatum: go to jail or be exiled to Mortville, a filthy [[shantytown]] ruled by the evil Queen Carlotta and her [[treason]]ous daughter, Princess Coo-Coo.\n\nPeggy and Grizelda choose Mortville, and engage in [[Women in prison film|lesbian prison sex]]. They become associates of self-hating [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] [[Wrestling|wrestler]] Mole McHenry, who wants a [[sex change]] to please her lover, Muffy St. Jacques. After confiscating a lottery ticket from Peggy, Mole wins the [[Maryland Lottery]] and uses the money to obtain [[gender reassignment surgery]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. However, Muffy is repulsed by Mole's [[phalloplasty]] and insists she cut it off, so Mole gives herself a [[penectomy]].\n\nMost of Mortville's social outcasts\u2014criminals, [[Nudism|nudists]], and sexual deviants\u2014conspire to overthrow Queen Carlotta, who banishes Coo-Coo after she elopes with a garbage collector named Herbert, whom Queen Carlotta's guards later shoot to death. Coo-Coo hides in Peggy and Grizelda's house with her dead lover. When Peggy betrays Coo-Coo to the Queen's guards, Grizelda fights them and dies when the house collapses on her. Peggy, however, joins the queen in terrorizing her subjects, even infecting them (and Princess Coo-Coo) with [[rabies]].\n\nEventually, Mortville's denizens, led by Mole, overthrow Queen Carlotta and execute Peggy by shooting a gun up her [[anus]]. To celebrate their freedom, the townsfolk roast Carlotta on a spit and serve her, pig-like, on a platter with an apple in her mouth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Liz Renay]] as Muffy St. Jacques\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Peggy Gravel\n* [[Edith Massey (actress)|Edith Massey]] as Queen Carlotta\n* [[Susan Lowe]] as Mole McHenry\n* [[Mary Vivian Pearce]] as Princess Coo-Coo\n* [[Jean Hill (actress)|Jean Hill]] as Grizelda Brown\n* [[Cookie Mueller]] as Flipper\n* [[Channing Wilroy]] as Lt.

The space was unheated, noisy, and poorly suited for film production according to Maier.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maier|first1=Robert|title=Low Budget Hell: Making Underground Movies with John Waters|date=2011|publisher=Full Page Publishing|isbn=978-0-9837708-0-0|pages=106\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n''Desperate Living'' was edited for 10 weeks in the basement of [[editor]] Charles Roggero's home.  It was Waters' first film with original music, by Chris Lobingier and Allen Yanus, to provide a \"cheesy ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''-type score\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=John|title=Shock Value: A Tasteful Book about Bad Taste|date=1981|publisher=Dell Publishing Co., Inc.|isbn=0-440-57871-X|page=173}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n''Desperate Living'' is the only feature film Waters made without Divine prior to the actor's death in 1988. Divine had to reluctantly back away from the film because he was committed to appearing in ''[[Women Behind Bars#1976 revival|Women Behind Bars]]''. [[Susan Lowe]], who had appeared in small or supporting roles in Waters' previous films, was chosen to take over for the role of Mole McHenry. This was also Waters' first film without [[David Lochary]], because of Lochary's addiction to drugs. Waters said \"The reason that David wasn't in ''Desperate Living'' is because of [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. That's all that's to it. I know that's why he wasn't in the film, and he knows it, too.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Lochary died a few weeks after the film's release, when he injured himself while under the influence of the drug.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dana |last=Heller |title=Hairspray |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-9162-3 |page=17}}</ref>\n\nWaters had received a copy of Liz Renay's [[autobiography]] ''My Face for the World to See'' and wanted to offer her a role in the film. He went to see Renay in a [[burlesque]] show in [[Boston]], then traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to offer her the role of Muffy St. Jacques. He offered her only a brief outline of the story, withholding some of the more graphic details for fear that she might refuse the role. Renay accepted the offer and flew to [[Baltimore]] for three weeks of shooting (which was, reportedly, all that the production could afford to pay Renay for her services).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=John|title=Shock Value: A Tasteful Book about Bad Taste|date=1981|publisher=Dell Publishing Co., Inc.|isbn=0-440-57871-X|page=162}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nAs with Waters' previous films, the premiere was held in the auditorium of the [[University of Baltimore]]. A brief controversy arose when lesbian groups attacked the film for its depiction of lesbianism, and for taking the title of a defunct prolesbian magazine. [[New Line Cinema]] blew the film up from [[16 mm film|16]] to [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] and opened it at [[Midnight movie|midnight]] in [[Manhattan]], though the original poster (featuring a cooked rat on a plate) was rejected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to run, forcing a new poster to be created three days before the opening. The new poster featured Liz Renay in a screaming pose, fashioned from a production still.\n\nCritics from ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' walked out of the film after 10 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}} Otherwise, ''[[Playboy]]'' enjoyed the film, stating it had to be \"seen to be believed\". David Chute of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' said of the film: \"In ''Desperate Living'', Waters comes close to creating a work of true trash art.\"{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}} \nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds a 70% rating based on reviews from 10 critics.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|desperate_living|Desperate Living}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n* The [[rock music|rock]] band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] include a tribute to ''Desperate Living'' on their 1994 album, ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]''. The last track on the album has a recording of Mink Stole's character, Peggy Gravel, shouting at children playing baseball who have broken her window: \"Go home to your mother! Doesn't she ever watch you? Tell her this isn't some [[Communism|Communist]] daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her!
