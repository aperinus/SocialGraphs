It is based on the 1990 article \"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\" by [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]], a poet paralyzed from the neck down due to [[polio]], who hired a [[sex surrogate]] to lose his virginity. [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] and [[Helen Hunt]] star as O'Brien and sex surrogate [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]], respectively.\n\nThe film debuted under its original title '''''The Surrogate''''' at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Award (U.S. Dramatic) and a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired the film's distribution rights and released the film in October 2012. ''The Sessions'' received highly positive reviews from critics, in particular lauding the performances of Hawkes and Hunt. Hunt was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Berkeley, California]], in 1988, Mark O'Brien is a 38 year old poet who is forced to live in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] due to complications from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a professional [[sex surrogate]]. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings.\n\nOne day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets a young woman named Susan Fernbach. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later in 1999, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl. Father Brendan gives the homily and Susan reads the poem he had previously sent Cheryl.\n\n== Themes ==\n''The Sessions'' is based upon, [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]]'s collection of personal essays in ''[[The Sun (magazine)|The Sun Magazine]]''. The film and the essays both discuss the intersection of disability and sexuality in O'Brien's life. In the essays, O'Brien writes from a \"crip/queer\" perspective to refute his own experience of sexual prohibition as a disabled person.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book |date=2014-01-01 |editor-last=Naeemah |editor-first=Clark |title=African Americans in the History of Mass Communication |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3726/978-1-4539-1206-5 |doi=10.3726/978-1-4539-1206-5|isbn=9781454192329 }}</ref> In some instances, disabled people are portrayed in film as incapable of having sex and expressing sexuality.

Disability is portrayed as a punishment for evil. For O'Brien, this brings about a sense of shame that he is not deserving of sex or sexual pleasure.<ref name=\":34\"/>\n\nOne of the main topics of ''The Sessions'' is disability and sex surrogacy. Sometimes disabled people who have more pragmatic needs to achieve sexual pleasure seek out sexual assistance by means of sex surrogates or sex workers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Citation |last=Shildrick |first=Margrit |title=Critical disability studies |date=2019-10-21 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429430817-3 |work=Routledge Handbook of Disability Studies |pages=32\u201344 |place=Second Edition. {{!}} New York : Routledge, 2020. {{!}} Series: Routledge international handbooks {{!}} Revised edition of Routledge handbook of disability studies, 2012. |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9780429430817-3 |isbn=978-0-429-43081-7 |access-date=2022-05-06}}</ref> The film depicts sex between Mark O'Brien and Cheryl Cohen-Greene, his sex therapist. The romantic bond that formulates between the two characters ensures that the concepts of disability and sex surrogacy are not seen by the audience as an emotionless act.<ref name=\":14\"/> The importance of location and disabled sex is also brought up in the film. For the first few sessions, Mark and Cheryl use an accessible home of Carmen, a disabled person Mark is interviewing for his essays about disability and sexuality.<ref name=\":34\"/> Sex requires particular settings for disabled people that can require specific technologies or settings to accommodate the person's needs.<ref name=\":14\"/>\n\nDisability Studies Professor [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] observes that the representation of disabled bodies can be juxtaposed with images of normality to make the disabled body more palpable for the audience. In ''The Sessions'', disability, more specifically, disabled sex, is more easily comprehended by the audience because the visual language in which it is presented in is framed as normal because of the presence of the able bodied character.<ref name=\":14\"/> In the end, the film shows O'Brien as a disabled person who gradually becomes more comfortable with his own sexuality and eventually finds a partner, thus separating him from the other asexual representation of disabled people in film.<ref name=\":34\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]]\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]]\n* [[William H.
