Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when he learns that [[Phoney War|Britain and France have declared war]] on Germany, but the promised aid does not come. The fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and [[Red Army|Soviet armies]] invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled [[General Government]]. Jews are soon prevented from working or owning businesses and are also made to wear blue [[Star of David]] armbands.\n\nBy November 1940, Szpilman and his family are forced from their home into the isolated and overcrowded [[Warsaw Ghetto]], where conditions only get worse. People starve, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards are brutal, starving children are abandoned, and dead bodies are everywhere. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family in an apartment across the street during a [[Roundup (history)|round-up]], including dumping an elderly man in a wheelchair out a window four stories up.\n\nOn 16 August 1942, Szpilman and his family are about to be transported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] as part of [[Operation Reinhard]]. However, a friend in the [[Jewish Ghetto Police]] recognizes W\u0142adys\u0142aw at the ''[[Umschlagplatz]]'' and separates him from his family. He becomes a slave labourer and learns of a coming Jewish revolt. He helps the resistance by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, on one occasion narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. Szpilman eventually manages to escape and goes into hiding with help from a non-Jewish friend, [[Andrzej Bogucki]], and his wife, Janina.\n\nIn April 1943, Szpilman watches from his window as the first of two uprisings, [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], which he aided, unfolds and ultimately fails. Soon thereafter, when a neighbor discovers Szpilman hiding in the flat, he is forced to flee to a second hiding place. His new hiding location is another vacant apartment, and it has a piano in it which he feels drawn to play; but he does not as he must keep quiet to avoid discovery. While in hiding at this location, malnutrition due to very limited food supplies takes effect; he loses weight and begins to suffer from [[jaundice]].\n\nIn August 1944, during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the [[Home Army]] attacks a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout. Tank shells hit the apartment, forcing him to flee. Over the course of the following months, Warsaw is destroyed. Szpilman is left alone to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. He eventually makes his way to a house where he finds a can of pickles. While trying to open it, he is noticed by ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' officer [[Wilm Hosenfeld]], who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. He asks Szpilman to play on a grand piano in the house. The decrepit Szpilman manages to play [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Ballade No. 1 (Chopin)|Ballade in G minor]]. Hosenfeld lets Szpilman hide in the attic of the empty house. Whilst there, he is regularly supplied with food by the German officer.\n\nIn January 1945, the Germans are retreating from the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time, promising he will listen to him on [[Polskie Radio|Polish Radio]] after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves. In Spring 1945, former inmates of a [[Nazi concentration camp]] pass by a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. Hosenfeld, being one of the prisoners, overhears a released inmate lamenting over his former career as a violinist. He asks him whether he knows Szpilman, which he confirms, and Hosenfeld says he helped Szpilman and begs him to tell Szpilman he is in the camp. Later, the violinist and Szpilman reach the camp but find it abandoned.\n\nAfter the war, Szpilman is back at the Polish Radio, where he performs Chopin's \"[[Andante spianato et grande polonaise brillante|Grand Polonaise brillante]]\" to a large prestigious audience. A textual epilogue states that Szpilman died on July 6, 2000, at the age of 88, and all that is known of Hosenfeld is that he died in 1952 while still in Soviet captivity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman]]\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Captain [[Wilm Hosenfeld]]\n* [[Frank Finlay]] as Samuel Szpilman\n* [[Maureen Lipman]] as Edwarda Szpilman\n* [[Emilia Fox]] as Dorota\n* [[Ed Stoppard]] as Henryk Szpilman\n* [[Julia Rayner]] as Regina Szpilman\n* [[Jessica Kate Meyer]] as Halina Szpilman\n* [[Ronan Vibert]] as [[Andrzej Bogucki]]\n* [[Ruth Platt]] as Janina Bogucki\n* [[Andrew Tiernan]] as Szalas\n* [[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]] as Jurek\n* [[Roy Smiles]] as Itzhak Heller\n* [[Richard Ridings]] as Mr. Lipa\n* [[Daniel Caltagirone]] as Majorek\n* [[Valentine Pelka]] as Dorota's Husband\n* [[Zbigniew Zamachowski]] as Customer with Coins\n* Ireneusz Machnicki as SS Officer\n* Cezary Krajewski as SS Officer{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Photograph of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman]]]]\n[[File:Ulica Ma\u0142a w Warszawie 2015.JPG|thumb|Ma\u0142a Street in [[Warsaw]]'s [[Praga-P\u00f3\u0142noc]] district used for filming of ''The Pianist'']]\nThe story had deep connections with director [[Roman Polanski]] because he escaped from the [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]] as a child after the death of his mother.

Soon after, the film crew moved to a villa in [[Potsdam]], which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned [[Soviet military]] hospital in [[Beelitz]], Germany. The scenes that featured German soldiers destroying a Warsaw hospital with flamethrowers were filmed there. On 15 March, filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the complex and technically demanding scene in which Szpilman witnesses the ghetto uprising.<ref name=\"anatomy-of-a-masterpiece\"/>\n\nFilming at the studios ended on 26 March, and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of [[Praga]] was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built onto these original buildings, re-creating [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|World War II-era Poland]] with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The [[Umschlagplatz]] scene where Szpilman, his family, and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the extermination camps was filmed at the [[National Defence University of Warsaw]].<ref name=\"theguardian-ghetto-with-Polanski\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/22/artsfeatures2|title=In the ghetto with Polanski |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=22 June 2001 |access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"mypianoworld-yolasite-com\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Pianist'' was widely acclaimed by critics, with Brody's performance, Harwood's screenplay, and Polanski's direction receiving special praise.

(Chopin)|Nocturne in C-sharp minor ''Lento con gran espressione'']], Op. posth.\n* The piano piece that is heard being played by a next door neighbour while Szpilman was in hiding at an apartment is also an arrangement of ''Um\u00f3wi\u0142em si\u0119 z ni\u0105 na dziewi\u0105t\u0105''.\n* The piano music heard in the abandoned house when Szpilman had just discovered a hiding place in the attic is the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 14 (Moonlight Sonata)]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. It would later be revealed that German officer Hosenfeld was the pianist. The German composition juxtaposed with the mainly Polish/Chopin selection of Szpilman.\n* The piano piece played when Szpilman is confronted by Hosenfeld is Chopin's [[Ballade No. 1 (Chopin)|Ballade in G minor]], Op. 23, but the version played in the movie was shortened (the entire piece lasts about 10 minutes).\n* The cello piece heard at the middle of the film, played by Dorota, is the Prelude from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]]''.\n* The piano piece heard at the end of the film, played with an orchestra, is Chopin's ''[[Andante spianato et grande polonaise brillante|Grande Polonaise brillante]]'', Op. 22.\n* Shots of Szpilman's hands playing the piano in close-up were performed by Polish classical pianist [[Janusz Olejniczak]] (b. 1952), who also performed on the soundtrack.\n* Since Polanski wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, any scene showing Brody playing was actually his playing overdubbed by recordings performed by Olejniczak. In order for Brody's playing to look like it was at the level of Szpilman's, he spent many months prior to and during the filming practising so that his keystrokes on the piano would convince viewers that Brody himself was playing.<ref name=\"Janusz-Olejniczak\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2003/08/pian-a01.html|title=A review of music from the motion picture The Pianist|access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades {{anchor|Awards}}==\n{{main|List of accolades received by The Pianist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw]] \u2013 Szpilman was one of the most notable persons to remain in [[Warsaw]] after its destruction by the Nazis and before its liberation by the [[Red Army]] in January 1945.\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|253474}}\n* {{mojo title|pianist}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|pianist}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.thepianist.info Wladyslaw Szpilman's personal Website: ''The Pianist'' -
