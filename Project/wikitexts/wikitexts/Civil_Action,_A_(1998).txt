Starring [[John Travolta]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[James Gandolfini]], [[Dan Hedaya]], [[John Lithgow]], [[William H. Macy]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], and [[Tony Shalhoub]], it tells the true story of a court case about environmental pollution that took place in [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Massachusetts]] in the 1980s. The film and court case revolve around the issue of [[trichloroethylene]], an industrial solvent, and its contamination of a local aquifer. A lawsuit was filed over industrial operations that appeared to have caused fatal cases of leukemia and cancer, as well as a wide variety of other health problems, among the citizens of the city. The case involved is [[Anderson v. Cryovac|''Anne Anderson, et al., v. Cryovac, Inc., et al.'']]. The first [[law report|reported]] decision in the case is at 96 F.R.D. 431 (denial of defendants' motion to dismiss). Duvall was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\nEnvironmental toxicants in the city of [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Massachusetts]] contaminate the area's water supply and become linked to a number of deaths of local children. Cocky [[Boston]] attorney Jan Schlichtmann and his small firm of [[personal injury lawyer]]s are asked by Woburn resident Anne Anderson to take legal action against those responsible. After originally rejecting a seemingly unprofitable case, Jan finds a major [[environmental issue]] involving groundwater contamination that has great legal potential and realizes the local [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] could be responsible for several deadly cases of [[leukemia]]. Jan decides to go forward against two giant corporations which own the tanneries\u2014[[Beatrice Foods]] and [[W. R. Grace and Company]]\u2014thinking that the case could possibly earn him millions and boost his firm's reputation.\n\nBringing a [[class action]] lawsuit in federal court, Jan represents families who demand an apology and a clean-up of contaminated areas. However, the case develops a life of its own and takes over the lives of Jan and his firm. The lawyers for Beatrice and Grace are not easy to intimidate, a judge makes a key ruling against the plaintiffs, and soon Jan and his partners find themselves in a position where their professional and financial survival has been staked on the outcome of the case. Jan stubbornly declines [[legal settlement|settlement]] offers, gradually coming to believe that the case is about more than just money. He allows his pride to take over, making outrageous demands and deciding that he must win at all costs. Pressures take their toll, with Jan and his partners going deeply into debt.\n\nAfter a lengthy trial, the case is dismissed in favor of Beatrice, after Jan turned down an offer of $20 million from Beatrice attorney Jerry Facher during jury deliberations. The plaintiffs are forced to accept a settlement with Grace that barely covers the expense involved in trying the case, leaving Jan and his partners broke. The families are deeply disappointed, and Jan's partners dissolve their partnership, effectively breaking up the firm. Jan ends up alone, living in a small apartment and running a small-time law practice. He manages to find the last key witness to the case, but lacks resources and courage to [[appeal]] the judgement. The files are archived while Jan later files for [[bankruptcy]].\n\nA postscript reveals that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], building on Jan's work on the case, later brought its own enforcement action against Beatrice and Grace, forcing them to pay millions to clean up the land and the groundwater. It takes Jan several years to settle his debts, and he now practices environmental law in [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[John Travolta]] as Jan Schlichtmann\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Jerry Facher\n* [[William H.
