It is the sequel to the 1990 film ''[[RoboCop 2]]'' and the third entry in the [[RoboCop (franchise)|''RoboCop'' franchise]]. It stars [[Robert John Burke|Robert Burke]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in the near future in a [[dystopia]]n metropolitan [[Detroit, Michigan]], the plot centers around [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its CEO (Torn), advances its program to demolish the city and build a new \"Delta City\" over the former homes of the residents. It was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Most of the buildings seen in the film were slated for demolition to make way for facilities for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] that were held in the city.\n\n''RoboCop 3'' is the first film to use digital [[morphing]] in more than one scene.<ref name=\"EGM51\"/> The film was a critical and commercial failure in the US, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the ''RoboCop'' franchise.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The two television series, ''[[RoboCop (Canadian TV series)|RoboCop]]'' and ''[[RoboCop: Prime Directives]]'', were released in 1994 and 2001, while a remake ''[[RoboCop (2014 film)|RoboCop]]'' was released in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[dystopia]]n<ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/133076-robocop-trilogy-2496116149.html 'RoboCop Trilogy': Life in Dystopian Future Detroit]. popMATTERS.com(November\n7, 2010). Retrieved on August 26, 2020.</ref> future, the conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP) have succeeded in their plan from prior films and have acquired the city of Detroit via [[bankruptcy]], but are now struggling with their plans to create the new Delta City. The Delta City dream of the now-deceased OCP [[CEO]] lives on with the help of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in OCP and is trying to finance the plan.  Kanemitsu, CEO of the Kanemitsu Corporation, proceeds with the plans to remove the current citizens in order to create Delta City, but is doubtful about the competence of his new \"partners\". \nDue to passive resistance by the [[Detroit Police Department]] toward mass eviction, OCP creates a heavily armed private security force called the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed \"Rehabs\", under the command of Paul McDaggett, to forcibly relocate the evicted citizens such as the residents of the now condemned Cadillac Heights. Nikko Halloran, a young resident of Cadillac Heights skilled with computers, loses her parents in the relocation process.\n\nRoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, but McDaggett mortally wounds Lewis, who eventually dies. Unable to fight back because of his [[RoboCop (character)#Prime directives|\"Fourth Directive\" programming]], RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance movement composed of Nikko and residents from Cadillac Heights and eventually joins them. Because he was severely damaged during the shoot-out, RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Marie Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to treat him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armory, the resistance picked up a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop's use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades to hold RoboCop.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs and OCP. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him. However, McDaggett successfully escapes and then obtains information from a disgruntled resistance member about where the resistance fighters' base is located. CEO Kanemitsu has developed his own [[ninja]] androids called \"Otomo\" and sends one to assist McDaggett overcome the resistance of anti-OCP militia forces. The Rehabs attack and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. When RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned, one Otomo unit arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his left arm and auto gun is destroyed, but eventually he successfully overcomes his opponent with his arm-mounted gun. Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists a captured Lazarus in [[Broadcast signal intrusion|broadcasting]] an improvised video, revealing OCP as responsible for the city's high crime rates and incriminating them for removing and killing the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge, financially ruining and bankrupting the company.\n\nMeanwhile, McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's callous ways, refuse to comply and instead defect to the resistance, escalating the rebellion against OCP into a full-scale war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.\n\nHaving heard Lazarus' broadcast, RoboCop provides aerial support for the entrenched resistance forces. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. RoboCop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo robots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming them using a wireless link from a laptop computer, having them attack each other. The Otomos' self-destruct system activate, forcing RoboCop to flee with Nikko and Lazarus. The flaming discharge from the jetpack immobilizes McDaggett, leaving him to perish in the blast.\n\nAs Old Detroit is being cleaned up, Kanemitsu arrives and finally comes face to face with RoboCop along with his group, while his translator tells the OCP president on Kanemitsu's behalf that he is fired, as the corporation shuts down OCP for good and plans to leave Detroit. Kanemitsu then bows to RoboCop and the group in respect. The CEO compliments RoboCop and asks for his name, to which he responds with, \"My friends call me Murphy. You call me RoboCop.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert John Burke|Robert Burke]] as [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy / RoboCop]]\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Anne Lewis\n* [[Jill Hennessy]] as Dr. Marie Lazarus\n* [[Remy Ryan]] as Nikko Halloran\n* [[Rip Torn]] as The CEO\n* [[John Castle]] as Paul McDaggett\n* Bruce Locke as \u014ctomo\n* [[Jodi Long]] as Keiko Halloran\n* [[John Posey (actor)|John Posey]] as David Halloran\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Kanemitsu\n* [[Felton Perry]] as Donald Johnson\n* [[Robert DoQui]] as Sgt.
