Since he has been in a 'funk' for a while, she is worried and goes home to console him. Finding an empty apartment, Luc\u00eda is frantic. She receives a phone call from the police while finding a suicide note, and is so afraid of bad news that she hangs up, assuming the worst. They call back, but she ignores the ringing phone, packs a bag, and flees. Looking for a new beginning, Luc\u00eda travels to the mysterious [[Balearic Islands]] that Lorenzo had always talked of, but had recently been very negative about.\n\nSix years earlier, Lorenzo is having casual sex in the ocean on a bright moon-lit night with a beautiful married woman he had just met named Elena. They part ways, expecting never to see each other again. She discovers she is pregnant with his child, and tries to find him, but is unable to since she knows little about him.\n\nLater, as Lorenzo talks with his literary agent at a restaurant, discussing his [[writer's block]], Luc\u00eda catches his attention as he gets up from his table to get cigarettes. She asks to speak to him and he joins her. She brazenly tells him that ever since she read his latest book, she has been following him and has fallen passionately in love with him. A smitten Lorenzo immediately engages the sexy, passionate Luc\u00eda and she moves into Lorenzo's apartment.\n\nThe film then interweaves the past and present, both of the characters in the film, and of the characters in Lorenzo's novel.\n\nLorenzo repeatedly stalls for time on his new book with his editor, while his relationship with Luc\u00eda deepens. About six years pass. Lorenzo learns he has a daughter as a result of his encounter with Elena and begins to visit the child outside of her school, meeting her babysitter Bel\u00e9n.\n\nBel\u00e9n tells Lorenzo her mother is a recently retired [[pornography|porn]] actress with a new hot boyfriend, and virtually seduces Lorenzo with chatter of sexual context and banter about her fantasies. Lorenzo uses these encounters and his fantasies about Bel\u00e9n and her mother as content for his book, and Luc\u00eda reads about it, thinking it fiction. Meanwhile, he does not disclose his fatherhood to Luc\u00eda or the child, nor even attempt to contact Elena.\n\nBel\u00e9n flirts with Lorenzo and eventually invites him over to Elena's house while she babysits his daughter, Luna. Lorenzo tells Luna a bedtime story, and after she falls asleep, he and Bel\u00e9n begin to have sex. They are interrupted as Luna knocks at the bedroom door, and they watch in horror as the family dog, a large [[Rotweiler]] in 'protect mode', kills Luna. Bel\u00e9n is stunned. Lorenzo runs away and falls into a deep depression.\n\nLorenzo's writing turns dark, towards depraved sex and death. He anonymously contacts Elena, who has moved to the island to find solace and recall better days, and provides her a nice story about a beautiful child that loves to swim in the sea, to cheer her spirits. But his now guilt-ridden and uncommunicative relationship with Luc\u00eda begins to collapse.\n\nBack in the present, Luc\u00eda meets a [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]] on the island, Carlos, and through him, Elena, who runs an inn on the island. Luc\u00eda rents a room, and the women bond as friends, not knowing their intimate connection. But when Luc\u00eda mentions Lorenzo by name, and his past visit to the island long ago, Elena deduces the connection. Luc\u00eda sees a picture of Luna (looking remarkably like her father and remembering the name from Lorenzo's novel) and she makes the connection too.\n\nLorenzo's editor visits Lorenzo in the hospital, where he was taken after being in an 'accident', spending several weeks in recovery. When Lorenzo asks about Luc\u00eda, the editor tells Lorenzo that Luc\u00eda probably thinks he is dead.\n\nLorenzo guesses Luc\u00eda is on the island and has the editor take him there. After both women discover that Lorenzo isn't dead, the three characters cope with and finally understand the entanglements of their interwoven relationships.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paz Vega]] as Luc\u00eda{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Trist\u00e1n Ulloa]] as Lorenzo{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Najwa Nimri]] as Elena{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Daniel Freire]] as Carlos / Antonio{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Elena Anaya]] as Bel\u00e9n{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* Silvia Llanos as Luna{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Javier C\u00e1mara]] as Pepe{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* Diana Su\u00e1rez as Madre de Bel\u00e9n{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Mej\u00edas|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Jefe{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez as Nurse{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* Alesandra \u00c1lvarez (Luna age 1){{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n* David Bulnes (por actor){{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Sogecine, the production arm of [[Sogecable]].<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://ae-ic.org/malaga2010/upload/ok/447.pdf|chapter=El papel de la televisi\u00f3n en las pol\u00edticas de fomento de la industria cinematogr\u00e1fica en Espa\u00f1a|first1=Jessica|last1=Izquierdo Castillo|first2=Andreu|last2=Casero Ripoll\u00e9s|title=Comunicaci\u00f3n y desarrollo en la era digital: congreso AE-IC. 3, 4 y 5 de febrero de 2010|year=2010|isbn=978-84-614-2818-2}}</ref> Shooting locations included [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Madrid]].{{Sfn|Stone|2007|p=218}}\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 71% based on 70 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.5/10.
