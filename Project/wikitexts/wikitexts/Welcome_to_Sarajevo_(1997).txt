The film stars [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Marisa Tomei]], Emira Nu\u0161evi\u0107, [[Kerry Fox]], [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]], [[James Nesbitt]], and [[Emily Lloyd]].\n\n''Welcome to Sarajevo'' had it's world premieres at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in May and September 1997, and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 November 1997, by [[Film4 Productions|FilmFour]], and in the United States on 26 November 1997, by [[Miramax]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1992, [[ITN]] reporter Michael Henderson travels to [[Sarajevo]], the besieged capital of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during the ongoing war. There, he meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures.\n\nHenderson and Flynn have friendly discussions and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto Bavi\u0107 to be Henderson's translator.\n\nTheir work permits them harrowing and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from Ljubica Ivezic, an orphanage located on the front lines, in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly indiscriminate attacks fail to make the lead story in the United Kingdom, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war and encourage the evacuation of the children to safety.\n\nWhen American aid worker Nina organizes a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces her to include Emira, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] girl from the orphanage, to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act \u2013 only transfers to relatives abroad have been authorised \u2013 but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story. However, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. In the final harassment, armed [[Chetniks]] halt the bus, select and forcibly disembark the Bosniak Muslim children, and take them away on their lorry, presumably to kill them.\n\nHenderson makes it home to London with Emira, adopting her into his family. After several months, Henderson receives word from a former producer in Sarajevo that Emira's estranged mother wants her back. Henderson, who didn't know that her mother was living, returns to Sarajevo, now driven not only by the siege but also by organised crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian soldier.\n\nHenderson asks him to help find Emira's mother. They discover from a relative that Emira was put into the orphanage as an infant by her mother under familial pressure. When Risto is killed in his home by a sniper, Henderson asks for help from Zeljko, a concierge at the Holiday Inn, who Henderson had helped in the past. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira's mother, who is desperate for the girl to live with her. However, she is persuaded that Emira is happy in England and so signs the adoption papers.\n\nA running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that \"the people will die happily listening to my music.\" The movie ends with Harun holding a \"concert of peace\" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajevo had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth.\n\nThe closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Dillane]] as Michael Henderson\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Jimmy Flynn\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Nina\n* Emira Nu\u0161evi\u0107 as Emira\n* [[Kerry Fox]] as Jane Carson\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Risto Bavi\u0107\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as Gregg\n* [[Emily Lloyd]] as Annie McGee\n* [[Igor D\u017eambazov]] as Jacket\n* [[Gordana Gad\u017ei\u0107]] as Mrs. Savi\u0107\n* [[Juliet Aubrey]] as Helen Henderson\n* Drazen \u0160ivak as \u017deljko\n* Vesna Orel as Munira Hod\u017ei\u0107\n* [[Davor Janji\u0107]] as Dragan\n* [[Labina Mitevska]] as Sonja\n\n==Style==\nMichael Winterbottom portrays the events with brutality. In the opening sequence, there is a sniper attack on a wedding procession. Other shocking sequences include Henderson stumbling upon a massacre at a farm-house, a Bosnian-Serb officer nonchalantly executing groups of Bosniaks and Henderson's arrival in the immediate aftermath of the first of the [[Markale Massacres]].\n\nShot just a few months after the war on locations in [[Sarajevo]] and [[Croatia]], the film uses real ruins and war debris to give the film a feeling of authenticity. Many scenes of the characters witnessing and reporting on street carnage were intercut with video footage of the historic events.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nTwo widely known pieces of music were among those used in the film. \"[[Don't Worry Be Happy]]\" by [[Bobby McFerrin]] is played against scenes of the siege of Sarajevo, with people being wounded by bombs, blood everywhere on the streets, etc. The second piece is \"[[Adagio in G minor]]\" by [[Remo Giazotto]], based on a fragment from ''Sonata in G minor'' by [[Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni]]. House of Love's \"Shine On\" (Creation, 1987) and Stone Roses' \"I Wanna Be Adored\" (Silvertone, 1989) are among the English independent rock classics featured in contrast to the dark barbarism affecting the people of Sarajevo. Rock anthems from the 1960s were used as part of the soundtracks in such Vietnam War-era movies as ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and ''Platoon.'' The anthems used in ''Welcome to Sarajevo'' were popular closer to the era of the film.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 78% approval rating based on 36 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average ranking]] of 6.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/welcome_to_sarajevo|title=Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=16 June 2022}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of a 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/welcome-to-sarajevo|title=Welcome to Sarajevo (1997)|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave ''Welcome to Sarajevo'' an \"A\u2212\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/11/28/welcome-sarajevo/|title=Welcome to Sarajevo|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=28 November 1997|accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref> ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called film's director \"crisp [and] rigorously unsentimental director\", adding that he \"was a good choice for [''Welcome to Sarajevo'']\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.timeout.com/movies/welcome-to-sarajevo-1|title=Welcome to Sarajevo|magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref> Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' praised the film for \"[b]ring[ing] up some hard questions about the sheer impossibility of foreign correspondents remaining true to their journalistic neutrality in a war zone\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1998-02-13/welcome-to-sarajevo/|last=Savlov|first=Marc|title=Welcome to Sarajevo|accessdate=10 August 2021|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=13 February 1998}}</ref> Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the film \"a compelling but jumbled film that examines the line between journalistic detachment and passion\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Sarajevo-s-Startling-Misery-Films-tells-true-3002258.php|last=Guthmann|first=Edward|title='Sarajevo's' Startling Misery / Films tells true story of girl, reporter|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=26 June 1998|accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn a more negative review, [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"However closely they mirror the real experience of Mr. Nicholson and others, some of the shocks here are too sadly predictable\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/26/movies/film-review-dangers-and-jitters-of-life-in-sarajevo.html|title=Film Review; Dangers and Jitters of Life in Sarajevo|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 November 1997|accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref> A similar opinion was shared by [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' who wrote that \"Too often we sense that the actors are drifting and the story is at sea\", in an \"air of improvisation\" that \"combines fact and fiction\", giving the film a two-star review.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/welcome-to-sarajevo-1998|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Welcome to Sarajevo|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=9 January 1998|accessdate=10 August 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film made its world premiere on May 9 at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/welcome-to-sarajevo|title=Festival de Cannes: Welcome to Sarajevo|accessdate=10 August 2021|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It was nominated for the Golden Palm and for the Golden Hugo at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]].
