The film stars [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Jack Reacher|the title character]], with [[Rosamund Pike]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Jai Courtney]], [[Werner Herzog]], and [[Robert Duvall]] also starring. The film entered production in October 2011, and was completed in January 2012. It was filmed entirely on location in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The musical score was composed by [[Joe Kraemer (composer)|Joe Kraemer]], performed by the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] and recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in [[Culver City, California]]. \n\nCruise performed all of his own driving stunts during the film's car chase sequence. The film's premiere screening in Pittsburgh was postponed after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]]; the movie was released in North America one week later on December 21,  2012, where it received generally positive reviews and was successful at the box office. A sequel was developed with Cruise titled ''[[Jack Reacher: Never Go Back]]'', based on the 2013 novel ''[[Never Go Back (novel)|Never Go Back]]'', which was released on October 21, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Pittsburgh]], a man drives a van into a parking garage across the [[Allegheny River]] from [[PNC Park]], dropping a quarter into the [[Parking meter|meter]].  Using a rifle, he shoots and kills five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before driving off. The [[Pittsburgh Police]], headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing and the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to James Barr, an ex-[[United States Army]] [[sniper]]. When the police raid his house, they find the van, the rifle, and Barr unconscious. During an interrogation by Emerson and [[District Attorney]] Alex Rodin, Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or a guaranteed [[Capital punishment|death sentence]], as Rodin has never lost a case. \n\nBarr instead  writes \"Get Jack Reacher\" on a notepad. [[Jack Reacher]] is a [[Vagrant|drifter]] and ex-[[United States Army|US Army]] [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]] investigator and [[major]]. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news broadcast about Barr. Emerson and Rodin deny Jack's request to view the evidence, but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow inmates and is now in a coma. Jack meets Barr's [[criminal defense lawyer|defense attorney]], Helen Rodin, Alex Rodin's daughter. Helen tells Jack he can see the evidence if he will be her investigator, but Jack retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his [[tour of duty]] in Iraq, but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his military contractor victims had just emerged from a weekend of assaulting numerous women, and the US Army just wanted the whole mess forgotten. \n\nJack vowed that if Barr tried anything like that again, he would take him down. Jack agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Jack goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies; a trained sniper would have shot from a van on the nearby [[Fort Duquesne Bridge]]. An apparently spurious bar fight makes Jack realize that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Jack, he suggests that the owner of local construction company Oline Archer was the real target, while the other victims served as a cover-up. Jack is later framed for the murder of the young woman who was paid to instigate the brawl. \n\nJack eventually follows up a hunch to a [[shooting range]] in neighboring [[Ohio]] owned by ex-[[United States Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery sergeant|Gunnery Sergeant]] Martin Cash. The real perpetrators are working for a ruthless construction firm led by an ex-Soviet prisoner known only as ''[[Zek (inmate)|Zek]] Chelovek'' (\"prisoner human being\"). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. Jack kills the henchmen and Emerson with Cash's help, before confronting the Zek. The Zek points out that Jack has killed all who could have testified against him and doubts that he will be convicted, while also stating that an American prison would be easy compared to his previous incarceration in [[Siberia]]. \n\nConvinced, Jack shoots him in the head. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no memory of the crime, but believes that he must be guilty. Barr's mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings matches Jack's theory. A remorseful Barr is willing to accept both responsibility and punishment. However, Helen is confident he will be cleared. Meanwhile, Jack, sitting on a bus, overhears a man verbally and physically abusing a young woman and gets up to confront him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Jack Reacher]], an ex-[[United States Army]] [[Military Police]] Investigator and [[Major]] and [[Vagrant|drifter]]\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as Helen Rodin, Barr\u2019s [[defence attorney]] and DA Rodin\u2019s daughter\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as [[District Attorney]] Alex Rodin\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as Zek Chelovek\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as [[Pittsburgh Police]] Detective Calvin Emerson\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as Charlie\n* [[Joseph Sikora]] as James Mark Barr, an ex-[[United States Army]] sniper and the prime suspect in the murders\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Martin Cash, an ex-[[United States Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] and [[Ohio]] gun shop owner\n* [[Michael Raymond-James]] as Linsky\n* [[Josh Helman]] as Jeb Oliver\n* [[Alexia Fast]] as Sandy\n* [[James Martin Kelly]] as Rob Farrior\n* [[Nicole Forester]] as Nancy Holt\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAttempts to adapt author [[Lee Child]]'s [[Jack Reacher#The Jack Reacher novel series|Jack Reacher novel series]] into a film have been made ever since the character debuted in 1997's ''[[Killing Floor (novel)|Killing Floor]]''.
