It is based on the [[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas|2006 novel of the same name]] by [[John Boyne]]. Set in [[World War II]], the [[Holocaust]] drama relates the horror of a [[Nazi]] [[extermination camp]] through the eyes of two eight-year-old boys: Bruno ([[Asa Butterfield]]), the son of the camp's Nazi commander, and Shmuel ([[Jack Scanlon]]), a [[Jews|Jewish]] [[prisoner]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nBruno, an eight-year old German boy living in [[Berlin]], is uprooted to rural [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]] with his family after his father Ralf, an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer, is promoted. Bruno notices a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] near the back garden from his bedroom window, but believes it to be a farm; his mother Elsa forbids him from going in the back garden.\n\nRalf organises Herr Liszt, a private tutor, to teach [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] and [[antisemitism]] to indoctrinate Bruno and his sister, Gretel. This combined with Gretel's crush on [[Obersturmf\u00fchrer|Lieutenant]] Kurt Kotler, a young colleague of her father's, makes Gretel fanatical in her support for the Nazi agenda. Bruno struggles to adjust to the rhetoric in the teaching after Pavel, a doctor-turned-family slave, comes to Bruno's aid after he sustains a minor injury.\n\nBruno sneaks into the woods, arriving at a barbed wire fence surrounding the camp. He befriends Shmuel, another eight-year old boy. Both boys are completely unaware of the true insidiously horrific nature of the camp: Bruno believes the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas, while Shmuel believes he is only there temporarily and that his grandparents died from an illness on the journey to the camp. Bruno meets Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food, and learns that Shmuel is a Jew who was brought to the camp with his parents.\n\nElsa inadvertently discovers from Kurt that the smell from the camp is in fact burning prisoners; she angrily confronts her husband. Later that night, Kurt reveals his father left Germany for [[Switzerland]] to avoid national service and is berated by Ralf; embarrassed, Kurt viciously beats Pavel for spilling a glass of wine. Bruno sees Shmuel working in his home, and offers him cake. Kurt finds Bruno and Shmuel socialising and berates Shmuel. After seeing him eating, Shmuel informs Kurt that Bruno offered the cake, which Bruno fearfully denies. Bruno tries to apologise to Shmuel later, but he doesn't reappear at the fence for several days. Bruno clandestinely sees his father and other soldiers reviewing a propaganda film about the camp's conditions as positive. Bruno then hugs his father.\n\nRalf informs his family that Kurt was transferred to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]; angered, Elsa reveals the reason for his transfer was because Kurt did not initially alert the authorities about his father. Bruno continues returning to the fence and eventually, Shmuel reappears, but with visible injuries. Bruno apologises and Shmuel forgives him. In Berlin, Ralf's mother Nathalie \u2013 who disapproves of the Nazi regime \u2013 is [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|killed by an Allied bombing raid]]. At the funeral, Elsa tries to remove a wreath from [[Adolf Hitler|the F\u00fchrer]] out of respect for Nathalie and her beliefs, but Ralf stops her, causing them to fall out after the service.\n\nBack home, Elsa informs Ralf she doesn't want the children living in the vicinity of the camp. In turn, Ralf then tells Bruno and Gretel their mother is taking them to live with extended family until the war is over. Bruno visits Shmuel before he leaves, and learns Shmuel's father has disappeared after being transferred to a different work gang; Bruno decides to help Shmuel find him. Shmuel provides Bruno with a prisoner's striped outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head, and Bruno digs under the fence to join Shmuel, but the boys are suddenly rounded up by the guards.\n\nGretel and Elsa learn of Bruno's disappearance, and burst into Ralf's meeting to alert him. A search is launched and a dog tracks Bruno's scent to his discarded clothing. Ralf enters the camp as the prisoners are sent to a [[gas chamber]], where [[Zyklon B|pesticide pellets]] are poured from a hole in the ceiling, filling the chamber with toxic gas. Bruno dies in the chamber along with Shmuel, leaving Ralf, Elsa, and Gretel distraught.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as Bruno, a young German boy.\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Elsa, Bruno's mother.\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Ralf, Bruno's father.\n* [[Jack Scanlon]] as Shmuel, a young Jewish boy.\n* [[Amber Beattie]] as Gretel, Bruno's older sister.\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as Lieutenant Kurt Kotler.\n* [[David Hayman]] as Pavel.\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] as Nathalie, Bruno's grandmother.\n* [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Matthias, Bruno's grandfather.\n* [[Cara Horgan]] as Maria.\n* [[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]] as Herr Liszt.\n\n==Production==\nFilming occurred during 29 April 2007 to 7 July 2007, in [[Hungary]].
