J. Abrams]] and written by [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]]. It is the 11th film in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, and is also a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] that features the main characters of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'' television series]] portrayed by a new cast, as the first in the rebooted film series. The film follows [[James T. Kirk]] ([[Chris Pine]]) and [[Spock]] ([[Zachary Quinto]]) aboard the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they combat [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]] ([[Eric Bana]]), a [[Romulan]] from their future who threatens the [[United Federation of Planets]]. The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] that features both an alternate birth location for [[James T. Kirk]] and further [[Alternate history|alterations in history]] stemming from the [[time travel]] of both Nero and the original series Spock ([[Leonard Nimoy]]).<ref name=\"MTVAlt1\" /><ref name=\"MTVAlt2\" /> The alternate reality was created in an attempt to free the film and the franchise from established [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n\nThe idea for a prequel film which would follow the ''Star Trek'' characters during their time in [[Starfleet Academy]] was discussed by series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in 1968. The concept resurfaced in the late 1980s, when it was postulated by [[Harve Bennett]] as a possible plotline for what would become ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', but it was rejected in favor of other projects by Roddenberry. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' and the cancellation of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the franchise's executive producer [[Rick Berman]] and screenwriter [[Erik Jendresen]] wrote an unproduced film titled ''Star Trek: The Beginning'', which would take place after ''Enterprise''. After the separation of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] and [[CBS Corporation]] in 2005, former [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[Gail Berman]] convinced CBS to allow Paramount to produce a new film in the franchise. Orci and Kurtzman were soon approached to write the film, and Abrams was approached to direct it. Kurtzman and Orci used inspiration from novels and graduate school dissertations, as well as the series itself. Principal photography commenced on November 7, 2007, and ended on March 27, 2008. The film was shot in locations around California and Utah. Abrams wanted to avoid using bluescreen and greenscreen, opting to use sets and locations instead. Heavy secrecy surrounded the film's production and was under the fake working title ''Corporate Headquarters''. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] used digital ships for the film, as opposed to [[miniature effect|miniatures]] used in most of the previous films in the franchise. Production for the film concluded by the end of 2008.\n\n''Star Trek'' was heavily promoted in the months preceding its release; pre-release screenings for the film premiered in select cities around the world, including [[Austin, Texas]], [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]. It was released in the United States and Canada on May 8, 2009, to critical acclaim. The film was a box office success, grossing over $385.7 million worldwide against its $150 million production budget. It was nominated for several awards, including four [[Academy Awards]] at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], ultimately winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], making it the first ''Star Trek'' film to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[sequel]]s ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2013 and 2016, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 2233, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''Kelvin'' is investigating a \"lightning storm\" in space. A [[Romulan]] ship, ''Narada'', emerges from the storm and attacks the ''Kelvin''. ''Narada''{{'}}s [[Executive officer|first officer]], Ayel, demands that ''Kelvin''{{'}}s Captain Robau come aboard to negotiate a truce. Robau is questioned about the current [[stardate]] and an \"Ambassador [[Spock]]\", whom he does not recognize. ''Narada''{{'}}s commander, [[Nero (Star Trek)|Nero]], kills him, and resumes attacking the ''Kelvin''. George Kirk, ''Kelvin''{{'}}s first officer, orders the ship's personnel, including his pregnant wife Winona<!-- Kirk-->, to abandon ship while he pilots the ''Kelvin'' on a collision course with ''Narada''. Kirk sacrifices his life to ensure Winona's survival as she gives birth to [[James T. Kirk|James Tiberius Kirk]].\n\nSeventeen years later on the planet [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Homeworld|Vulcan]], a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother, Amanda, as a \"disadvantage\", he joins [[Starfleet]] instead. On [[Earth]], Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult. Following a bar fight with Starfleet cadets accompanying [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]], Kirk meets Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]], who encourages him to enlist in [[Starfleet Academy]], where Kirk meets and befriends doctor [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy]]. Three years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized, with McCoy and Kirk boarding Pike's ship, the {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}}.\n\nRealizing that the \"lightning storm\" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap. When the ''Enterprise'' arrives, they find the fleet destroyed and ''Narada'' drilling into Vulcan's [[planetary core|core]]. ''Narada'' attacks ''Enterprise'' and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer. Kirk, [[Hikaru Sulu]], and [[chief engineer|Chief Engineer]] Olson perform a [[space diving|space jump]]<ref name=\"CNN.com\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |title=The Scene: 'Trek' actors dive onto Vulcan |last=Cargill |first=J.D. |date=May 8, 2009 |website=CNN |access-date=December 10, 2009 |archive-date=November 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118043919/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/08/the.scene.star.trek/index.html#cnnSTCText |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Bad Astronomy Review: Star Trek\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek |title=BA Review: Star Trek |last=Plait |first=Phil |date=May 8, 2009 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] |access-date=December 10, 2009 |archive-date=December 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215132830/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/08/ba-review-star-trek/ |url-status=live }}</ref> onto the drilling platform. While Olson is killed mid-jump,  Kirk and Sulu successfully reach and disable the drill, but are unable to stop Nero launching \"red matter\" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial [[black hole]] that destroys Vulcan. The ''Enterprise'' manages to rescue Spock's father, [[Sarek]], and the high council before the planet's destruction, but not his mother Amanda, who falls to her death before the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]] can properly lock onto her. As ''Narada'' moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes.\n\nWhile in pursuit, Spock maroons Kirk on Delta Vega after he attempts [[mutiny]]. On the planet, Kirk encounters an older Spock (from the original timeline), who explains that he and Nero are from 2387. In the future, [[Romulan#Romulus|Romulus]] was threatened by a [[supernova]], which Spock attempted to stop with an artificial black hole made of \"red matter\". However, his plan failed, resulting in Nero's family perishing along with Romulus, while both the ''Narada'' and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole and sent back in time. Spock quickly found they were sent back 25 years apart, during which time Nero attacked the ''Kelvin'', thus changing history and creating a parallel universe. After Spock's arrival, Nero stranded him on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction as revenge. Reaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott]], who helps them by devising a trans-warp beam system, allowing both him and Kirk to [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam]] onto ''Enterprise'' while it is travelling at warp speed.\n\nFollowing the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While ''Enterprise'' hides itself within the gas clouds of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Kirk and Spock beam aboard ''Narada''. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads ''Narada'' away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. ''Enterprise'' beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and ''Narada'' collide, igniting the \"red matter\". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming ''Narada'' to be consumed in a black hole that ''Enterprise'' is only barely able to escape.\n\nKirk is promoted to captain and given command of ''Enterprise'', while Pike is promoted to rear admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. ''Enterprise'' goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the \"[[where no man has gone before|where no one has gone before]]\" monologue.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 190\n| footer    = From top to bottom: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.\n| image1    = Chris Pine by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Zachary Quinto by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Zoe Saldana (Headshot).jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  =\n}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.
