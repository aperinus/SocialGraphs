However, it received high critical acclaim, with praise for its novel concept, story, screenplay, dialogues and performances of the cast.<ref name=\"BOI Luck gross\"/>\n\nAt the [[55th Filmfare Awards]], ''Luck by Chance'' received 5 nominations, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Rishi) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Kapadia), and won [[Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director|Best Debut Director]] (Zoya, tying with [[Ayan Mukerji]] for ''[[Wake Up Sid]]'').\n\n==Plot==\nYoung actor Vikram Jaisingh arrives in [[Mumbai]] to make it as a [[Bollywood]] film star with the help of Abhimanyu, an actor friend from his hometown, and their mutual friend Sameer, who works in a studio [[Theatrical property|prop]]s department.\n\nVikram befriends Abhimanyu's neighbor, young actress Sona Mishra, with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. Sona, the [[Mistress (lover)#:~:text=In modern times the word,mister\" or \"master\".|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] of small-time producer Satish Chowdhury, who for three years has promised her a leading role in his dream project, meanwhile works in regional films and bit parts.\n\nSona finds out that Satish has secured financing for the new project and meets him expecting him to cast her as second heroine, but he refuses saying that they need a new face and since she has acted in many regional films and other small roles she is no longer a fresh face. She argues that she can act well but he says that is not a major criterion these days in Bollywood. Sona is crying when Satish's wife enters and asks her why she is crying but Sona for unknown reasons, withholds the reasons for her emotions and answers by fabricating a lie about trouble at home. Sona while leaving the both of them gives photos of Vikram to Satish who shows it to his wife and who in turn shows them to Romy.\n\nVikram is shortlisted for Romy's new movie. Neena, the mom of Nikki, the actress cast for the movie, was a big film actress in the heyday. She sees Vikram's audition and tries to remember where has she met him before. Vikram had once approached her at a film fraternity party. Vikram is told his audition was for the lead in the film and that Neena has seen his audition. At home, he sees every movie Neena has starred in and he impresses her with his charm and knowledge about her work. Recalling past advice, Vikram successfully boosts a competing actor's ego whose overconfident acting is rejected by the director. Finally, Vikram is selected by Neena, Ranjit (director of the film), and Romy's wife, despite Romy's desire to cast the other macho, hunky actor.\n\nOn set, Vikram becomes increasingly crafty and manipulative, while Nikki is smitten by him and sneaks into his room one night while her mother is asleep in an attempt to seduce him. Vikram succumbs to her advances and a secret affair starts between the two; the affair becomes stronger when Neena has to leave the set on business for a few days. Vikram tells Nikki he has no girlfriend. Meanwhile, Sona arrives at the hotel where the cast is staying to surprise Vikram. Her friend who is also working on the film warns her of a blossoming romance between Vikram and Nikki. Since Vikram has stayed in touch with her, Sona doesn't take heed of her friend's warning but discovers the truth when she sees Vikram's unexpectedly cold behavior towards her. Hurt, she leaves the hotel. After coming back, Neena instantly recognizes that something is going on between them and makes them understand that it will be mutually beneficial not to let the press and public know of their intimacy.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mumbai, news of the affair has leaked and a friend of Sona who works at a tabloid is assigned to prepare the article, which describes Vikram as a user who has shot to stardom by manipulating Neena and her daughter Nikki. The article also mentions details of when he was struggling to land a role and Sona's part in his life as the forgotten girlfriend. Neena gets very upset and yells at the magazine editor and tells Nikki to stay away from Vikram. Vikram and Nikki have a fight, and Vikram shows his frustration to Sona as he believes she is the one responsible for the article.\n\nEventually the film is released and it becomes a superhit. Vikram rises to stardom but at the expense of his friends. At a party, he meets his idol [[Shah Rukh Khan]], who advises him to not fall into the trappings of stardom and to always stay close to the people who stood by him when he was a nobody. He tries to get back with Sona, but she points out that he only wants to be with her because he is selfish and feels guilty. She refuses and walks out of his life. Sona soon gets good roles on television and is interviewed by a reporter for her fan following. The film ends with her telling the reporter that she is happy living the life of an independent and somewhat successful actress instead of being upset about not becoming a major movie star.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Farhan Akhtar]] as Vikram Jaisingh \n* [[Konkona Sen Sharma]] as Sona Mishra \n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Rommy Rolly \n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Neena Walia\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as Minty Rolly\n* [[Hrithik Roshan]] as Zaffar Khan\n* [[Sanjay Kapoor]] as Ranjit Rolly \n* [[Isha Sharvani]] as Nikki Walia\n* [[Alyy Khan]] as Satish Chaudhary\n* [[Sheeba Chaddha]] as Pinky Chaudhary\n* [[Saurabh Shukla]] as Nand Kishore, an acting teacher\n* [[Arjun Mathur]] as Abhimanyu 'Abhi' Gupta \n* [[Sid Makkar]] as Sameer\n* Pankaj Kalra as Raju (Sona's agent)\n* Arvind Vaidya as Pandit Ji\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as Aslam Khan (Extended cameo appearance)\n\n===Guest Appearances=== \n* [[Sunny Deol]]\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Anand \n* [[Ajay Devgn]]\n* [[Akshaye Khanna]]\n* [[Ranbir Kapoor]]\n* [[Abhishek Bachchan]]\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Dinyar Sabri\n* [[Dia Mirza]]\n* [[Javed Akhtar]]\n* [[Bobby Deol]]\n* [[John Abraham]]\n* [[Karan Johar]]\n* [[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]\n* [[Mac Mohan]]\n* [[Manish Acharya]]\n* [[Manish Malhotra]]\n* [[Mushtaq Shiekh]]\n* [[Rajkumar Hirani]]\n* [[Rani Mukerji]]\n* [[Vivek Oberoi]]\n* [[Shabana Azmi]]\n* [[Ronit Roy]]\n* [[Pooja Batra]]\n* [[Shilpa Shetty]]\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Zoya Akhtar]] said in an interview that she wrote the first draft seven years ago while relaxing on [[Palolem]] beach in [[Goa]].

The rains washed out the entire set, and eventually the entire tent began to leak.

The main trailer for the movie was released in the last week of December. It introduced the main characters and set the pace for what the plot was about. ''BigFlix'', a part of Reliance BIG Entertainment Ltd., was given the task of promoting the movie. The first bit of promotion came from the music wherein winners were given signed albums by [[Farhan Akhtar]] and [[Konkona Sen Sharma]]. They promoted the whole movie across the nation in all 112 stores in 10 cities as well to the international audiences through its video-on-demand (VOD) site. The pre-release promotional activities included online marketing and publicity of the film's music videos, trailers, downloads, previews, preview shows, contests and continued with other promotional activities post-release like meet-and-greet events with the star cast at select cities.\n\nA unique promotional campaign was launched by producers [[Farhan Akhtar]] and [[Ritesh Sidhwani]] called \"Auto By Chance\". They introduced 10 \"Auto by Chance\" three-wheelers in suburban Mumbai suburbs that would transport people for free to the destination of their choice in the suburbs. The promotion was run in conjunction with [[Big FM (Indian radio station)|Big FM]] radio station and [[Godrej Group|Godrej]]. One passenger would be interviewed live by an RJ and go on air with his experience of getting lucky and enjoying the free ride. The Indian gaming portal ''[[Zapak|Zapak.com]]'' created a microsite for the movie with a game, \"''Luck by Chance'' - Lucky Break\".\n\n==Release==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nThe movie was initially scheduled to be released 23 January 2009, alongside ''[[Raaz - The Mystery Continues]]'', but was pushed to 30 January.

Anupama Chopra of ''[[NDTV]]'' wrote, \"Zoya pokes fun at Bollywood but she does it with a great affection. There are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in a super short skin-tight outfit struggling to touch her producer's feet without splitting a seam. But what makes ''Luck By Chance'' compelling is the layers beneath the laughs.
