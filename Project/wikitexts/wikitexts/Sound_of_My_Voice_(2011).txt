The plot focuses on two documentary filmmakers who attempt to expose a cult led by a charismatic leader (Marling) who claims to be from the future. The film was written by Batmanglij and Marling. It premiered at the 2011 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was also selected to close the 2011 [[SXSW Film Festival]]. The film was released by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] on April 27, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sound of My Voice Movie|url=http://www.soundofmyvoicemovie.com/index2.html|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], substitute schoolteacher Peter and aspiring writer Lorna are a couple in their twenties making a film documentary. Their subject is a secretive cult led by the mysterious Maggie, whom they plan to expose as a fraud.\n\nWhen the cult considers Peter and Lorna ready to meet Maggie, they are made to shower thoroughly and dress in white surgical gowns. Then they are driven blindfolded to a secret basement location and received by Klaus, with whom they exchange a distinctive, intricate handshake, which they have been practicing. Peter and Lorna then join eight other members and meet Maggie, who uses an oxygen tank and implies that the showering and clothing requirements are to avoid aggravating her illness.\n\nMaggie claims to be a time-traveler from the year 2054. She describes the future as riddled with war, famine and struggle, and has come back to select a special band of chosen people to prepare for what lies ahead. She leads the group in a series of intense psychological exercises and tells them about herself and the future, never proving nor disproving her extraordinary claim. Maggie's charismatic manner is powerful, and both Lorna and Peter have moments in which they waver between skepticism and belief. Lorna is especially concerned when she notices that Peter, who was initially adamant that Maggie was a charlatan, seems to now be intrigued by and even attracted to Maggie.\n\nAfter several group meetings, Maggie instructs Peter to bring her the eccentric eight-year-old Abigail Pritchett, one of his students. Maggie insists Abigail is her mother, and that Peter and Lorna will be banned from the group if he fails to comply. When Peter admits that he is considering following Maggie's orders, Lorna is outraged and accuses him of falling for Maggie's deception. After they argue, Lorna is privately approached by Carol, a woman who identifies herself as a Justice Department agent. Carol tells Lorna that Maggie is wanted for a variety of felonies. Lorna agrees to set Maggie up to be captured and to hide this plan from Peter.\n\nWith Lorna's help Peter arranges for Maggie to meet the student in public, at the [[LaBrea Tar Pits]], during a class field trip. When Maggie meets the little girl, Peter is amazed to see them wordlessly perform the cult's intricate handshake. Abigail asks Maggie how she knew her secret handshake, and Maggie reverently responds: \"You taught it to me.\" Men in police uniforms burst into the room and seize Maggie. As cult members angrily accuse Peter of betraying Maggie, he exchanges a glance with Lorna who smiles slightly, affirming her role in Maggie's capture. Abigail then asks Peter who Maggie was, and he responds, stricken, that he does not know.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Christopher Denham]] as Peter Aitken\n* [[Jack Griffo]] as Young Peter\n* Nicole Vicius as Lorna Michaelson\n* [[Brit Marling]] as Maggie\n* Davenia McFadden as Carol Briggs\n* Kandice Stroh as Joanne\n* [[Richard Wharton (actor)|Richard Wharton]] as Klaus\n* Christy Myers as Mel\n* Alvin Lam as Lam\n* [[Constance Wu]] as Christine\n* [[Matthew Carey (actor)|Matthew Carey]] as Lyle\n* Jacob Price as PJ\n* David Haley as O'Shea\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Mr. Pritchett\n* Avery Pohl as Abigail Pritchett\n* Kyle Hacker as Lucas\n{{Div end}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Sound of My Voice'' was named among the Top Indie Films at Festivals in 2011 on [[IndieWire]]'s criticWIRE.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Knegt|first=Peter|title=The Best Indie Movies of 2011 So Far: \"Sound of My Voice\" and \"The Interrupters\" Top criticWIRE|date=June 27, 2011|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/mid-year_report/#|publisher=indieWIRE|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 75% approval rating from critics based on 104 reviews.\n\n[[Manohla Dargis]] wrote in her review in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"Nobody is gutted in ''Sound of My Voice'', a smart, effectively unsettling movie about the need to believe and the hard, cruel arts of persuasion.
