Roxy is pregnant, but her husband has just walked out on her without explanation. Isabel discovers that he has a mistress, a Russian woman named Magda Tellman, whom he intends to marry after securing a divorce from Roxy. Roxy refuses to divorce him.\n\nRoxy is also in possession of a painting of [[Saint Ursula]] by [[Georges de La Tour]]; the painting belongs to the Walker family, but due to her marriage to Charles-Henri and French community property laws, the ownership is disputed between the two families. The [[Louvre]] deems the painting worthless and concludes that it is not a real La Tour. However, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] takes an interest in the painting and its curator believes that the painting was done by La Tour himself.\n\nParis-based American author Olivia Pace, a friend of Roxy's, offers Isabel a job. Isabel also meets Yves, Olivia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and they begin dating. The sisters visit Charles-Henri's family's country home for Sunday [[brunch]], where Isabel meets Charles-Henri's mother Suzanne and her handsome middle-aged brother-in-law, Edgar. Isabel is attracted to the older, wealthy and married Edgar and they begin an affair, although Isabel continues to string Yves along. Edgar begins to send Isabel various gifts, including an expensive red [[Kelly bag]] by [[Herm\u00e8s]], which Isabel carries with her at all times. During a visit to Isabel, Suzanne discovers the Kelly bag, after which she realizes that Edgar is having an affair with Isabel.\n\nCharles-Henri maintains a blas\u00e9 attitude about his infidelity and insists on a divorce. He also hopes to benefit from the French community property laws in the divorce, especially with regard to the La Tour painting. His mistress Magda is married to a man named Tellman, who begins to stalk and harass Isabel and Roxy, believing the latter to be responsible for his wife's desertion. Charles-Henri's cruelty and insensitivity take their toll on Roxy, and she attempts suicide in late pregnancy. She survives and is supported by Isabel and her lawyer Bertram.\n\nRoxy and Isabel's family arrive from the United States to support the sisters, and to also discuss the divorce proceedings and the ownership of the La Tour painting. Things are further complicated when Edgar's wife, Am\u00e9lie, discovers the affair through Suzanne. Following a brunch with both families, Suzanne and Am\u00e9lie privately inform Isabel's mother about the affair; she later confronts Isabel with this information.\n\nDuring an outing, Magda and Charles-Henri tease Tellman with their new relationship. Later, they are both murdered by Tellman in a [[crime of passion]], with Charles-Henri's body being found in Roxy's apartment complex. Roxy and Bertram come upon the scene and the stress causes her to go into labor. Tellman then follows Isabel and her family on an outing to the [[Eiffel Tower]], where he corners them and pulls a gun, demanding an opportunity to explain to Roxy why he killed her husband. After some persuasion, the distraught Tellman releases the gun to Isabel, who puts it into the Kelly bag and throws it off the Eiffel Tower.\n\nEdgar, persuaded by his socially conscious family's concern, and tiring of his young lover, casually ends his affair with Isabel with a gift of a Chanel scarf and a lunch. Afterwards, Isabel begins a real relationship with Yves. After Roxy's baby is born, she marries Bertram. The family attends an art auction where the La Tour painting sells to The Getty for 4.5 million Euros. Because its ownership is no longer disputed due to Charles-Henri's death, the money goes to the Walker family, who then go on to establish the \"Fondation Sainte Ursule\" (The Saint Ursula Foundation).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Isabel Walker\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Roxeanne de Persand\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as Suzanne de Persand\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Margeeve Walker\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Olivia Pace\n* [[Thierry Lhermitte]] as Edgar Cosset\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Piers Janely\n* [[Melvil Poupaud]] as Charles-Henri de Persand\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Tellman\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Julia Manchevering\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as Chester Walker\n* [[Marie-Christine Adam]] as Am\u00e9lie Cosset\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Roger Walker\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Maitre Bertram\n* [[Romain Duris]] as Yves\n* [[Catherine Samie]] as Madame Florian\n* Esm\u00e9e Buchet-De\u00e0k as Gennie de Persand\n* [[Samuel Labarthe]] as Antoine de Persand\n* [[Nathalie Richard]] as Charlotte de Persand\n* [[Rona Hartner]] as Magda Tellman\n\n==Locations==\n''Le Divorce'' was filmed in Paris at locations including [[Caf\u00e9 de Flore]], [[Tour Eiffel]], [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] and [[Salle Gaveau]].
