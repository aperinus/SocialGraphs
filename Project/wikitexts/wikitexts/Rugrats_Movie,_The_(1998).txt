Daily]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Christine Cavanaugh]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]], [[Cree Summer]], and [[Charlie Adler]], along with guest stars [[David Spade]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Tim Curry]]. The events of the film take place between the series' [[List of Rugrats episodes|fifth and sixth seasons]], and is the first film to be based on a Nicktoon.\n\nPlans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'' and ''[[Doug (series)|Doug]]'', began when Nickelodeon made a contract with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce films between 1993 and 1995.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when the contract expired, development of the film restarted with [[Paramount Pictures]] since Nickelodeon's parent company, [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]], purchased the studio in 1994 and production had restarted on the television series after a small hiatus.\n\n''The Rugrats Movie'' was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on November 20, 1998.<ref name=AFIRugrats/> The film received mixed reviews from critics and opened at #1 in the United States box-office. Grossing a total of $141 million worldwide, it became the first non-Disney animated film to gross over $100 million in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/rugrats-movie-has-hit-100-million|title = THE RUGRATS MOVIE has hit $100 million}}</ref> The film is followed by two sequels: ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2022}}\n[[Didi Pickles]] is pregnant with her second baby, which makes her son [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] worry how that will change the family dynamic. When the baby comes unexpectedly early, despite being told it will be a girl, Didi gives birth to a boy she and her husband [[Stu Pickles|Stu]] name [[Dil Pickles|Dil]]. When they bring him home, they find themselves struggling to cope with Dil's constant outbursts and Tommy finds his new brother hard to get along with. After Stu assures him one day they will be happy to have Dil in the family, Tommy accepts his newfound responsibility as an older brother.\n\nWith Dil still causing problems at the Pickles' home, [[Phil and Lil]] suggest using the [[Reptar]] Wagon Stu has built for a toy contest in Japan to take him back to the hospital. As Tommy and [[Chuckie Finster|Chuckie]] object, the car drives away with the babies on board. They speed recklessly through the streets and eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. At first, [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]] shows no concern until she realizes the babies have her Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, [[List of Rugrats characters|Spike]], to find them and retrieve Cynthia.\n\nTommy leads the babies toward a ranger's cabin, believing it to be the home of a magic \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]) who can grant their wish to go home. Unbeknownst to them, they are being pursued by a lone wolf. On the way, they encounter monkeys who hijacked their circus' train and crashed it in the woods. When they kidnap Dil, Tommy's friends refuse to help rescue him, believing they are better off without him and Tommy sets off after his brother alone. Meanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing, and set out to find them in the face of the media sensation that has suddenly generated around their children's disappearance.\n\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, but as he tries to take care of him, Dil continues acting selfishly. Tommy finally snaps and prepares to give Dil back to the monkeys, but Tommy's rage scares Dil into ending his behavior. At the same time, Dil's remorseful tears cause Tommy to come to his senses and the brothers finally begin to bond. After the storm, they are found by Phil, Lil, Chuckie, Angelica and Spike; together they all reach the bridge to the ranger's station where they are confronted by the wolf. When Spike saves the babies by fighting the wolf and dragging it off the bridge, they all become sad when it seems that Spike is gone.\n\nStu, looking for the babies in a [[pterodactyl]]-like glider, sees them from above and crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies ask him to bring Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and reveals Spike, who survived the fall by landing in the struts of the bridge. The children are all reunited with their parents and return home, where they accept Dil as one of the group.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rugrats characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[E. G.

The first attempt was in 1993, when [[Nickelodeon]] made a two-year contract deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to produce new material, but an unnamed Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their existing properties, one of those that was proposed was ''[[Rugrats]]'', alongside ''[[Doug (series)|Doug]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show#Film adaptation attempts|The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''.<ref name=\"RugratsRotten\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rugrats_movie/|title=The Rugrats Movie|date=November 20, 1998|work=rottentomatoes.com|access-date=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en|title = Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19930607&id=gldPAAAAIBAJ&pg=2074,1837600&hl=en|title=Toledo Blade \u2013 Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-08-13}}</ref> However, in 1994, Nickelodeon's parent company [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired [[Paramount Pictures]], and Paramount would distribute the films instead. As a result, the contract from Fox expired, with no films produced (although ''Doug'' would eventually get a [[Doug's 1st Movie|theatrical film]] from [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in 1999). Production on ''The Rugrats Movie'' started a year later in 1995.\n\nTwo months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 5 (1998)|the fifth season.]] The film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the [[List of Rugrats episodes#Season 8 (2001\u201303)|show's eighth season]] in 2002.\n\nThis film was the first ''Rugrats'' production to use [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digital ink and paint]], rather than the [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|traditional cel animation]] used in the show.\n\nTwo songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style song. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on [[CBS]] and [[Nickelodeon]] television airings of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bootlegcomparisons.com/2019/03/17/the-rugrats-movie-dvd-vs-cbs-television-broadcast/|title=The Rugrats Movie: DVD Vs.
