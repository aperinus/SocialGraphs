The film stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Joel Kinnaman]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[Ed Harris]] and follows an ex-[[Irish Mob]] [[hitman]] who goes on the run with his estranged adult son after he is forced to kill the son of a mobster boss. It also marks the third collaboration between Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra after ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.\n\nIt was released in the United States on March 13, 2015, received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $71.6 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nHaunted by his past, ex-[[Irish Mob]] [[hitman]] Jimmy \"The Gravedigger\" Conlon has become an angry drunk. His son Michael 'Mike' Conlon, a [[chauffeur]] and retired [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]] who mentors [[At-risk students|at-risk]] kids at the local gym, is disgusted by his father's actions and refuses to call him \"Dad\" or involve him in the lives of his daughters.\n\nJimmy's old boss and closest friend, Shawn Maguire, rejects an offer to allow the sale of [[Albania]]n [[heroin]] in his territory. The [[Albanian mafia|Albanians]] demand that Danny, Shawn's son, who took a large fee to arrange the deal, return their money now. Mike drives the two Albanian creditors to Danny's house. But Danny and his friend double cross and shoot the Albanians, one of whom is shot dead by Danny outside. This is witnessed by Mike and his mentee boxer, Legs, who captures the shooting on his phone. Danny spots Mike and attempts to kill him but he escapes. Danny does not notice Legs.\n\nJimmy requests Mike, at Shawn's behest, not to expose Danny but Mike refuses. As he is leaving, Jimmy spots Danny's car and goes inside to find him about to shoot Mike. Jimmy shoots Danny then calls Shawn to inform him of his son's death. Shawn sends two corrupt [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers to pick up Mike and kill him, but Jimmy rescues him and shoots one of the [[Police corruption|corrupt cops]] before taking Mike to his family. Before they can get on the subway, Jimmy and Frank fight in a washroom until Jimmy strangles Frank with a towel.\n\nJimmy meets Shawn and tells him that it was Danny who was about to kill Mike, and that he might have to speak to the NYPD about his criminal past. Shawn says that the cops care nothing for Jimmy's information, and tells Jimmy he will kill Mike and his family in revenge, then let Jimmy die.\n\nJimmy sends Mike's family to a remote cabin and takes Mike with him to retrieve proof of his innocence, but Andrew Price, an assassin contracted by Shawn, intercepts them first. Jimmy is able to subdue him, but is wounded in the fight. Jimmy later contacts Detective Harding, a cop who has not been able to prove Jimmy's role in a long list of homicides. Harding says that witnesses claim Mike was the shooter and not Danny. Jimmy makes a deal with Harding, he will prove Mike is innocent and then turn himself in with a list of all the people he murdered in his mob career.\n\nThe two hide at the house of Jimmy's brother Eddie. An incensed Eddie reveals that Jimmy is loyal only to Shawn \u2014 he once killed his own cousin to prevent him testifying against Shawn and will do the same to Mike. Disgusted and unwilling to trust his father, Mike returns to his family. Seeking to end the blood feud, Jimmy attacks Shawn's hideout and kills him and his gang. At the same time, Legs visits Harding with the video of the murder of the second Albanian and Harding has the ballistics on Danny's gun checked to confirm the video.\n\nMike arrives at the cabin and alerts the police to his location. Jimmy soon arrives, and Mike finally introduces him to his grandchildren. Price arrives and attacks the cabin, shooting Jimmy and then hunting down Mike and his family. Mike is cornered by Price, but Jimmy kills him. The police arrive and confirm Legs' evidence has cleared Mike just as Jimmy dies, holding the list of his past victims for Harding as promised.\n\nIn the epilogue, Mike is back working as a boxing trainer and chauffeur and living happily with his wife and daughters. He looks wistfully at a photo of himself and Jimmy from long ago before heading to work.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Jimmy 'The Gravedigger' Conlon\n* [[Joel Kinnaman]] as Mike Conlon\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Shawn Maguire\n* [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Andrew Price\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Detective John Harding\n* [[James Martinez (actor)|James Martinez]] as Detective Oscar Torres\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Danny Maguire\n* [[Patricia Kalember]] as Rose Maguire\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Pat Mullen\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Gabriela Conlon\n* Giulia Cicciari as Catelyn Conlon\n* Carrington Meyer as Lily Conlon\n* Gavin-Keith Umeh as Officer Randle\n* [[Malcolm Goodwin]] as Officer Colston\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Kenan Boyle\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Margaret Conlon, Jimmy's mother\n* [[Aubrey Joseph]] as Curtis 'Legs' Banks\n* Lisa Branch as Angela Banks\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Frank\n* Daniel Stewart Sherman as Brendan \n* John Cenatiempo as Paul\n* Andy Murray as Tommy\n* Roderick Hill as Billy Conlon\n* Jessica Ecklund as Frank's wife\n* Radivoje Bukvi\u0107 as Victor Grezda\n* Tony Naumovski as Samir\n* Dan Domingues as Uncle Ricky\n* Dennis Duswalt as Dirty Cop\n* [[Nick Nolte]] (''uncredited'') as Eddie Conlon<ref>{{cite web|last=Lavallee |first=Eric |url=http://www.ioncinema.com/reviews/run-all-night-review |title=Run All Night &#124; Review - U.S. Indie News, Filmmaker Interviews, Film Festivals, Movie Reviews |publisher=Ioncinema |access-date=May 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/What-Was-With-Bizarre-Cameo-Run-All-Night-70323.html |title=What Was With That Bizarre Cameo In Run All Night? |publisher=Cinemablend |access-date=May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn January 2012, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired [[Brad Ingelsby]]'s script ''The All-Nighter'' for a six-figure sum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike|title=Warner Bros Lands Brad Ingelsby Spec 'The All-Nighter'|url=https://deadline.com/2012/01/warner-bros-lands-brad-ingelsby-spec-run-all-night-212793/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|date=January 10, 2012}}</ref> During the following November, [[Liam Neeson]] entered negotiations to star in the film and became a lock in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Liza|title=Liam Neeson in Negotiations for Crime Thriller 'The All Nighter' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/liam-neeson-negotiations-crime-thriller-all-nighter-exclusive-65506/|website=[[TheWrap]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|date=November 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike|title=Liam Neeson Locked To 'Run All Night;' Helmer Jaume Collet-Serra In Talks|url=https://deadline.com/2013/01/liam-neeson-locked-to-run-all-night-helmer-jaume-collett-serra-in-talks-406503/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|date=January 17, 2013}}</ref> At this time, director [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] became attached to the film and the title was changed to ''Run All Night''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Matt|title=Liam Neeson Confirmed to Star in RUN ALL NIGHT; May Reunite with UNKNOWN Director Jaume Collet-Serra|url=https://collider.com/liam-neeson-run-all-night-jaume-collet-serra/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on October 3, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Production Begins on Run All Night, Starring Liam Neeson|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=109755|access-date=October 4, 2013|publisher=comingsoon.net|date=October 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Run All Night Starring Liam Neeson Begins Production|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/run-all-night-starring-liam-neeson-begins-production|access-date=October 4, 2013|publisher=movieweb.com|date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for ''Run All Night'' was composed by [[Junkie XL]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Junkie XL to Score 'Run All Night'|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/12/04/junkie-xl-to-score-run-all-night/|access-date=December 14, 2014|website=Film Music Reporter|date=December 4, 2014}}</ref> Discussing the [[leitmotifs]], Junkie XL said, \"I thought it was much more interesting to look at this movie from an emotional point of view instead of from an actioner point of view.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross|title='Run All Night': Making Of The Soundtrack With Tom Holkenborg, AKA Junkie XL|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/run-all-night-making-of-the-soundtrack-with-junkie-xl-1201392795/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|date=March 14, 2015}}</ref> The score was recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros.
