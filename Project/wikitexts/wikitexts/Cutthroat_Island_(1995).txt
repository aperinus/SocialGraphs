Its failure caused the closing of [[Carolco Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1668 [[Jamaica]], Morgan Adams having escaped a sting operation to capture her with aid of her father's [[Boatswain]] Mr. Glasspoole and Bowen, hunts down her uncle and fellow pirate Dawg Brown, who has captured her father, Black Harry. Black Harry has one of three pieces of a map to a huge stash of gold on the remote Cutthroat Island, that only Harry and Brown's father managed to escape from. Dawg has another piece, having stolen it from the corpse of a third brother, Richard, while a fourth brother, Mordechai, has the last piece. Harry refuses to give Dawg his piece and escapes with Morgan's help, but not before being mortally wounded by Snelgrave, Dawg's one armed and one eyed [[First Mate]]. A dying Harry reveals to his daughter the location of the map piece: on his scalp. At the same time in [[Port Royal]] during a ball hosted by its corrupt Governor Ainslee, William Shaw a con man and thief is captured by Captain Trotter fleeing from the household, having fleeced several guests of their valuables.\n\nAfter [[scalping]] her dead father for the piece, Morgan, now the captain of her father's ship, the ''Morning Star'', sets out for the treasure. Unfortunately, the instructions appear to be in Latin, which no one on board reads. So, they go to nearby [[Port Royal]] to find a translator. There, they learn that one of the slaves up for auction, the very same named William Shaw, is fluent in Latin. After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction. Unfortunately, she is recognized from her wanted poster and is chased out of town, along with her crew and Shaw. Humiliated, Ainslee vows to find her, either to arrest her or form a partnership for half her profits. He enlists the help of chronicler John Reed, who often follows pirates to write his books.\n\nThe crew then goes to Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor. Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg appears (with Snelgrave capturing Morgan with a chain attached to his arm). A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is mortally wounded (with Dawg killing the pirate responsible) and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself. After they escape on the ''Morning Star'', Morgan collapses from her wound, but is saved by Shaw, who is a self-proclaimed doctor. The two start a romance. Morgan figures out that the words on the map, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island. Meanwhile, Dawg takes his rage out on one of his crew (who was delaying his ship's departure due to lack of provisions) setting off after the ''Morning Star''\n\nDawg's ship, the ''Reaper'', bears down on them. Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef and a gale. Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgan's piece, but is caught and thrown in the brig. During the storm, Reed sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee. Meanwhile, the majority of the crew led by the treacherous Scully mutinies and maroons Morgan and those loyal to her in a boat. The tide takes them straight to Cutthroat Island, which is uncharted land northeast of [[Cuba]].\n\nAs Morgan goes after the treasure, Shaw, who escaped during the storm, steals the last piece from Dawg, who's on the island. Shaw falls into quicksand and Morgan, realizing he has the piece, frees him. Together, they find the gold, only for it to be stolen by Dawg, forcing them to jump off a cliff into the tide.\n\nAfter regaining consciousness, Shaw finds Reed, who leads him into a trap set by Dawg, Ainslee, and the mutineers, who have joined forces and intend to split the gold between them, with Ainslee intending to pardon Dawg and his crew by re-classing them as privateers, leaving his conflicted second Captain Trotter at a loss. As Shaw is captured and they make their way out to sea with the gold, Morgan sneaks aboard the ''Morning Star'' and retakes it from Scully and the mutineers, throwing them overboard to swim back to Cutthroat Island (while overpowering Captain Trotter and his soldiers killing several).\n\nDawg who intends to use his newly acquired ill-gotten gains to become the new governor of Jamaica (by using its current governor to reinvent himself) convinces Ainslee to hang Shaw from his [[yardarm]]. The crew then tries to sneak attack the ''Reaper'', but Dawg counterattacks by forcing the ''Morning Star'' crew to reveal themselves (when Morgan's [[quartermaster]] Mr. Blair shoots the intended hangman). A sea fight ensues, during which Shaw escapes and Ainslee, his men, and Reed are killed by cannon fire. Realizing his future in the army is over, Captain Trotter saves Mr. Blair by killing a fellow soldier before turning on the rest his remaining comrades, while Mr. Glasspoole tricks Snelgrave into entangling himself in the anchor with his chain attached arm before dropping the [[anchor]] into the depths taking Snelgrave with it. Morgan boards the ''Reaper'' and blows out the ship's bottom to get to the gold. She then duels Dawg while Shaw gets trapped below in rapidly rising water with the treasure. Morgan kills Dawg with a cannon and saves Shaw, forced to abandon the treasure to escape the sinking ship. Morgan attached a marker barrel to the treasure beforehand, allowing them to retrieve it, and the newly rich crew sets sail for their next adventure in Madagascar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Morgan Adams\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as William Shaw\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Douglas \"Dawg\" Brown\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as John Reed\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Ainslee\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Mr. Glasspoole\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as \"Black\" Harry Adams\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Mr. Blair\n* [[Paul Dillon]] as Snelgrave\n* [[Jimmie F.

Harlin convinced producer [[Mario Kassar]] to cast Davis, who was until then known for light comedies, hoping it would turn her into an action-adventure star. [[Carolco]], already deeply in debt when the film entered preproduction, initially budgeted $60 million for the project and pinned its hopes for survival on its success. To fund it, the cash-starved company cancelled its only other project in production, ''Crusade'' starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], costing it $13 million.

Douglas eventually pulled out, claiming that Davis's role was expanded at his character's expense, while Davis wanted to quit when Douglas did, but was contractually obligated to finish the film.\n\nAfter Douglas quit, Harlin was so preoccupied with trying to find a male lead that set construction and script work were done without his input. Consequently, Harlin did not like what he saw when shooting was set to begin, leading to expensive rebuilding and rewriting.\n\n[[Tom Cruise]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Tim Robbins]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Gabriel Byrne]] all turned down the role of Shaw before Modine agreed to do the role, partly due to his experience as a [[Fencing|fencer]].<ref name=\"Mendelson\">{{Cite web |last=Mendelson |first=Scott |title='Cutthroat Island,' One Of The Biggest Flops Ever, Deserves To Be Rediscovered 25 Years Later |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/12/22/cutthroat-island-one-of-the-biggest-box-office-flops-ever-discovers-to-be-rediscovered-on-its-25th-anniversary/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=Forbes }}</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Reed]] was originally cast for a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as Mordechai Fingers, but was fired after getting in a bar fight and attempting to [[Indecent exposure|expose himself]] to Davis while intoxicated.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/may/08/books.guardianreview12 Hall of infamy No 21: Oliver Reed]</ref> [[George Murcell]] eventually took his place.\n\n===Filming===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n[[Principal photography|Shooting]] was delayed for various reasons, allowing the budget to spiral out of control. When Harlin fired the chief camera operator following a dispute, more than two dozen crew members quit. In addition, broken pipes caused raw sewage to pour into the water tank where the actors were supposed to swim. Harlin spent $1 million of his own money to rewrite the script, as Carolco Pictures was in so much debt that they could not afford to pay further.\n\nThe first week into production, the film's original cinematographer, [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]], fell off a crane and into one of the water tanks, breaking his leg; he had to be replaced by cinematographer [[Peter Levy (cinematographer)|Peter Levy]]. Wood's contributions to the film would be acknowledged in the closing credits.\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Malta]] and [[Thailand]]. Indoor scenes were shot at Mediterranean Film Studios in [[Kalkara|Kalkara, Malta]], and models were shot at the Paddock Tank at [[Pinewood Studios]], in [[Iver Heath|Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England]]. Harlin required actors to do their own stunts whenever possible. While promoting the film, Davis appeared on talk shows with clips of her doing stunts over and over (including one take where she fell out of a window too soon, rolled down the roof and under a carriage) and described the bruises and injuries she sustained while filming.\n\n===Music===\n{{see also|Cutthroat Island (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's [[Film score|orchestral score]] was composed by [[John Debney]].
