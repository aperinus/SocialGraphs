As Tonya grows up, her parents take her out of school to focus on her skating career, as she trains under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya's father leaves Tonya with her abusive mother. Tonya rapidly becomes one of the best figure skaters in the United States, but is held back by her \"[[white trash]]\" reputation, homemade costumes and unconventional choice of performance music (e.g., [[ZZ Top]]). At fifteen, she begins dating eighteen-year-old Jeff Gillooly. They marry, but Jeff becomes abusive. When LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, Tonya blames LaVona for raising her badly.\n\nAfter a dispute with Diane, Tonya fires her and hires Dody Teachman as her new coach. Tonya becomes the first female figure skater to complete two triple [[Axel jump]]s in competition. At the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], Tonya fails to stick her landings and finishes fourth. Defeated, she takes a job as a waitress, but Diane convinces her to train for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. She performs well but still gets poor scores. She confronts a judge about her scores and he tells her that they want to see a wholesome American family. Tonya first asks her mother to help who refuses and insults her so Tonya reluctantly asks Jeff to help support her. On the day of her November 1993 competition at the Northwest Pacific Regional Championships in Portland, Tonya receives a death threat and chooses not to compete. Realizing that he can sabotage Tonya's competition, Jeff instructs his friend Shawn Eckardt to send death threats to Tonya's rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. Tonya makes a phone call trying to locate Nancy's training arena and her practice times. Shawn hires two inept crooks to attack Nancy after a practice session in Detroit. [[Assault of Nancy Kerrigan|On January 6, 1994, Shawn's henchmen strike Nancy's knee]]; she cannot compete at the next day's [[1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|National competition]]. The hired henchmen are arrested.\n\nShawn's bragging quickly leads the FBI to him. He blames Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Shawn instigated the entire affair in order to get attention. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team but realizes she will be found guilty by association. She goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Shawn did, but they show her interview transcript to Jeff after his arrest, and he races home to confront her. She briefly speaks to Jeff from behind a locked door, then climbs out the window, leaving him for good. Jeff later implicates Tonya, saying she knew about the attack.\n\nLaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; however, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the crime, Tonya realizes she is [[Covert listening device|wearing a wire]] and throws her mother out. Jeff, Shawn, and the henchmen are charged, with Tonya's hearing postponed until after the Olympics. Tonya finishes eighth and [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|Nancy wins the silver medal]]. When [[Oksana Baiul]] edges out Nancy for the gold and the first ever Olympic medal for independent Ukraine, Tonya accuses Nancy of being a poor sport. Tonya avoids jail but is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time but not to take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge refuses.\n\nJeff acknowledges that he ruined Tonya's career. He changes his name, remarries, opens a hair salon, divorces, and remarries. LaVona moves to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and has no contact with Tonya. Tonya remarries, divorces, takes up professional boxing, and becomes a landscaper, house painter and deck builder. She now lives happily with her third husband and their seven-year-old son. Text at the end states that Tonya wants people to know she is a good mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Tonya Harding]]\n** [[Mckenna Grace]] as young Tonya\n** Maizie Smith as four-year-old Tonya\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Jeff Gillooly, Tonya's boyfriend, later husband\n* [[Allison Janney]] as LaVona Golden, Tonya's abusive mother\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Diane Rawlinson, Tonya's skating coach\n* [[Caitlin Carver]] as [[Nancy Kerrigan]], Tonya's skating rival and Olympic teammate, and the victim of the [[Assault of Nancy Kerrigan|1994 attack]]\n* [[Bojana Novakovic]] as Dody Teachman, another of Tonya's coaches\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as Shawn Eckardt, a bodyguard and friend of Jeff\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Martin Maddox, a former reporter\n* Dan Triandiflou as Bob Rawlinson, Diane's husband and Tonya's attorney\n* [[Ricky Russert]] as Shane Stant, hired by Jeff and Shawn to attack Nancy\n* Anthony Reynolds as Derrick Smith, Stant's uncle, previous friend of Shawn, first hired to attack Nancy before recruiting Stant himself to injure her\n* Cassidy Balkcom as [[Oksana Baiul]], Nancy's competitor in the Winter Olympics (uncredited)\n* Fi Dieter as [[Midori Ito]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] was inspired to write the film after watching a documentary about ice skating which mentioned [[Tonya Harding]].<ref name=\"sagfull\">{{cite interview|last1=Robbie|first1=Margot|last2=Rogers|first2=Steven|last3=Gillespie|first3=Craig|last4=Janney|first4=Allison|display-authors=etal|title=Conversations with I, Tonya [Cast and Crew]|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=December 23, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqysxfvC94A|work=SAG-AFTRA Foundation|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> Rogers arranged separate interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly.

However, when writing of the scene where Harding voices how she has [[Internalization (sociology)|internalized]] a [[Victim mentality|victim-like]] identity, Burr believed the filmmakers failed to appreciate the scope of what that really means to her.

It's a showy, scenery-chewing performance but it's not one-note; Janney brings an undercurrent of sorrow to the part in revealing LaVona's twisted methodology.\" Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that: 'Janney steals every scene she's in, playing LaVona, a harridan whose nodding goes beyond tough love.' Helen O'Hara from ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' called Janney's performance flawless and flamboyant, and an unforgettable one. ''[[USA Today]]'' said; \"Janney is magnificent as Tonya Harding's villainous and abusive mommy dearest.
