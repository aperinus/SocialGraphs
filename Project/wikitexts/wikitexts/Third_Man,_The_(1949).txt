Set in [[postwar]] Vienna, the film centres on American Holly Martins (Cotten), who arrives in the city to accept a job with his friend Harry Lime (Welles), only to learn that Lime has died. Viewing his death as suspicious, Martins elects to stay in Vienna and investigate the matter.\n\nThe atmospheric use of black-and-white [[expressionist]] [[cinematography]] by [[Robert Krasker]], with harsh lighting and distorted \"[[Dutch angle]]\" camera technique, is a major feature of ''The Third Man''. Combined with the iconic theme music by [[zither]] player [[Anton Karas]], seedy locations and acclaimed performances from the cast, the style evokes the atmosphere of an exhausted, cynical post-war Vienna at the start of the [[Cold War]].\n\nGreene wrote the novella of the same name as preparation for the screenplay. Karas's title composition \"[[The Third Man Theme]]\" topped the international music charts in 1950, bringing the previously unknown performer international fame; the theme would also inspire [[Nino Rota]]'s principal melody in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} ''The Third Man'' is considered one of [[List of films considered the best|the great films of all time]], celebrated for its acting, musical score and atmospheric cinematography.<ref>[[Leslie Halliwell|Halliwell, Leslie]] and John Walker, ed.

Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two British [[Royal Military Police]]: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins's books, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked by Mr. Crabbin to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, a Romanian called Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident. Before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins as well as Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\n\nAs Martins and Anna investigate Lime's death, they discover that accounts differ on whether two or three men carried away the body. The porter at Lime's apartment tells them that he saw a third man help carry away the body. Later, the porter offers to give Martins more information, but someone kills him before Martins can talk to him. Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime's death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing penicillin from military hospitals, diluting it, then selling it on the [[black market]], injuring or killing many people. Martins, convinced by hard evidence, agrees to leave.\n\nMartins visits Anna that evening. After leaving he walks the streets, until he sees someone watching from a darkened doorway. It is Harry. Martins calls out but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realizes that Lime has escaped through the sewers. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and discover that the body is the orderly who stole the penicillin for Lime. Anna is to be sent to the Soviet sector, and is questioned again by Calloway.\n\nMartins meets Lime and they ride the [[Wiener Riesenrad]]. Lime obliquely threatens Martins before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help capture Lime. Martins agrees to help on one condition, demanding Anna's safe conduct out of Vienna. Anna is about to leave on the train when she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure. She forces the plan out of him but wants no part of it. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children crippled or dying of meningitis who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin. Martins agrees to help the police again.\n\nLime arrives at a small caf\u00e9 to meet Martins, but Anna warns Lime that the police are closing in. He tries again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are there. Lime shoots and kills Paine, but Calloway shoots and wounds Lime. Badly injured, Lime drags himself up a ladder to a street grating; however, he cannot lift it. Martins finds Lime at the grate, and hears Calloway shouting to shoot Lime on sight, Lime and Martins exchange a look, and then Martins shoots and kills Lime, using Paine's revolver. Martins attends Lime's second funeral. At the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna, he waits on the street to speak with Anna, but she walks right past him without glancing in his direction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Holly Martins\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Harry Lime \n* [[Alida Valli]] (credited as Valli) as Anna Schmidt\n* [[Trevor Howard]] as Major Calloway\n* [[Paul H\u00f6rbiger]] as Karl, Lime's porter (credited as Paul Hoerbiger)\n* [[Ernst Deutsch]] as \"Baron\" Kurtz\n* [[Erich Ponto]] as Dr. Winkel\n* [[Siegfried Breuer]] as Popescu\n* [[Hedwig Bleibtreu]] as Anna's old landlady\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as Sergeant Paine\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Crabbin\n}}\n'''Uncredited'''\n{{castlist|\n* [[Annie Rosar]] as the porter's wife \n* Alexis Chesnakov as Brodsky, Russian official \n* Herbert Halbik as Little Hansel - Boy with Ball \n* [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] as British Military Policeman in the sewer chase scene \n* [[Paul Hardtmuth]] as the hall porter at [[Hotel Sacher]] \n* [[Geoffrey Keen]] as British Military Policeman \n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] as waiter at Smolka's \n* [[Reed De Rouen]] as American Military Policeman at Railroad Station \n* [[Brother Theodore]] as Man on Street \n* [[Nelly Arno]] as Kurtz's mother<ref name=BFI>{{cite web|title=Nelly Arno|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bafc07929|website=BFI|access-date=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816093402/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bafc07929|archive-date=16 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]] as actor at [[Josefstadt Theatre]] \n* Joseph Cotten as the narrator (pre-1999 US version)\n* [[Carol Reed]] as the narrator (pre-1999 UK, and all post-'99 versions)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nBefore writing the screenplay, Graham Greene worked out the atmosphere, characterisation, and mood of the story by writing a novella as a source text for the screenplay. He never intended it to be read by the general public, although it was later published under the same name as the film. In 1948, he met [[Elizabeth Varley|Elizabeth Montagu]] in Vienna. She gave him tours of the city, its sewers, and some of its less reputable night-clubs. She also introduced Greene to [[Peter Smollett|Peter Smolka]], the central European correspondent for ''The Times''. Smolka gave Greene the stories about the black market in Vienna.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Guardian |date=10 July 1999 |title=Harry in the shadow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview10 |access-date=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator in the novella is Major Calloway, which gives the book a slightly different emphasis from that of the screenplay. A small portion of his narration appears in a modified form at the film's beginning in Reed's voice-over: \"I never knew the old Vienna\". Other differences include both Martins's and Lime's nationalities; they are English in the book. Martins's given name is Rollo rather than Holly. Popescu's character is an American called Cooler. Crabbin was a single character in the novella; the screenplay's original draft replaced him with two characters, played by [[Basil Radford]] and [[Naunton Wayne]], but ultimately in the film, as in the novella, Crabbin remains a single character.\n\nThere is also a difference of ending. The novella's implies that Anna and Martins are about to begin a new life together, in stark contrast to the unmistakable snub by Anna that closes the film. In the book, Anna does walk away from Lime's grave, but the text continues:\n\n<blockquote>I watched him striding off on his overgrown legs after the girl. He caught her up and they walked side by side. I don't think he said a word to her: it was like the end of a story except that before they turned out of my sight her hand was through his arm\u2014which is how a story usually begins. He was a very bad shot and a very bad judge of character, but he had a way with Westerns (a trick of tension) and with girls (I wouldn't know what).</blockquote>\n\nDuring the shooting of the film, the final scene was the subject of a dispute between Greene and [[David O. Selznick]], who wanted the happy ending of the novella; and Reed, who stubbornly refused to end the film on what he felt was an artificially happy note.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encountering Directors|first=Charles Thomas|last=Samuels|publisher=G.

Putnam's Sons|year=1974|pages=169\u2013170|isbn=0399110232}}</ref> Greene later wrote: \"One of the very few major disputes between Carol Reed and myself concerned the ending, and he has been proved triumphantly right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-astory.html |title='The Third Man' as a Story and a Film |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 March 1950 |access-date=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nDavid O.

In Jonathan Rosenbaum's 2007 book ''Discovering Orson Welles'', Rosenbaum calls it a \"popular misconception\",<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan, ''Discovering Orson Welles'', University of California Press; 1st edition (2 May 2007), p.25 {{ISBN|0-520-25123-7}}</ref> although Rosenbaum did note that the film \"began to echo the Wellesian theme of betrayed male friendship and certain related ideas from ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.\"<ref name=rosenweb>Rosenbaum, Jonathan.

Web. 18 October 2010.</ref> In the final analysis, Rosenbaum writes, \"[Welles] didn't direct anything in the picture; the basics of his shooting and editing style, its music and meaning, are plainly absent. Yet old myths die hard, and some viewers persist in believing otherwise.\"<ref name=rosenweb/> Welles himself fuelled this theory in a 1958 interview, in which he said that he had had an important role in making ''The Third Man'', but that it was a \"delicate matter, because [he] wasn't the producer\".<ref>Welles, Orson, Mark W. Estrin. ''Orson Welles: Interviews''. Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2002. Print.</ref> However, in a 1967 interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Welles said that his involvement was minimal: \"It was Carol's picture\".<ref>Bogdanovich, Peter, ''This Is Orson Welles'', Da Capo Press (21 March 1998) p. 220, {{ISBN|978-0-306-80834-0}}</ref> However, Welles did contribute some of the film's best-known dialogue. Bogdanovich also stated in the introduction to the DVD: <blockquote>However, I think it's important to note that the look of ''The Third Man''\u2014and, in fact, the whole film\u2014would be unthinkable without ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]],'' and ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', all of which Orson made in the '40s, and all of which preceded ''The Third Man''.

Looking down on the people below from his vantage point, Lime compares them to dots, and says that it would be insignificant if one of them or a few of them \"stopped moving, forever\". Back on the ground, he notes:\n\n<blockquote>You know what the fellow said \u2013 in Italy, for 30 years under the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]], they had warfare, terror, murder, and blood-shed; but they produced [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the [[Renaissance]]. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had 500 years of democracy and peace \u2013 and what did that produce? The [[cuckoo clock]]!</blockquote>\n\nWelles added this remark \u2013 in the published script, it is in a footnote. Greene wrote in a letter,<ref>13 October 1977</ref> \"What happened was that during the shooting of ''The Third Man'' it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\" Welles apparently said the lines came from \"an old Hungarian play\"\u2014in any event the idea is not original to Welles, acknowledged by the phrase \"what the fellow said\".\n\nThe likeliest source is the painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. In a lecture on art from 1885 (published in ''Mr Whistler's \"Ten O'Clock{{\"-}}'' [1888]), he said \"The Swiss in their mountains&nbsp;... What more worthy people!&nbsp;... yet, the perverse and scornful [goddess, Art] will have none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box! For this was [[William Tell|Tell]] a hero! For this did [[Albrecht Gessler|Gessler]] die!\" In a 1916 reminiscence,<ref>''San Francisco Town Talk'', 26 February 1916, reported in [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres10hail#page/n255/mode/2up ''California Art Research'': Charles J. Dickman, Xavier Martinez, Charles R. Peters, Theodore Wores, 1936].</ref> American painter [[Theodore Wores]] said that he \"tried to get an acknowledgment from Whistler that San Francisco would some day become a great art center on account of our climatic, scenic and other advantages. 'But environment does not lead to a production of art,' Whistler retorted. 'Consider Switzerland. There the people have everything in the form of natural advantages \u2013 mountains, valleys and blue sky. And what have they produced? The cuckoo clock!\"\n\nOr it may be that Welles was influenced by [[Geoffrey Household]], who wrote in his novel ''[[Rogue Male (novel)|Rogue Male]]'': \"...Swiss. A people, my dear fellow, of quite extraordinary stupidity and immorality. A combination which only a long experience of democratic government could have produced.\"\n\n''This Is Orson Welles'' (1993) quotes Welles: \"When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks,\"<ref>Nigel Rees, ''Brewer's Famous Quotations'', Sterling, 2006, pp. 485\u201386.</ref> as the clocks are native to the German [[Black Forest]].
