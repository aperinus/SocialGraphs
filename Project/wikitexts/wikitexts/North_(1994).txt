The story is based on the 1984 novel, ''North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents'' by [[Alan Zweibel]], who wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film. The cast includes [[Elijah Wood]] in the title role, with [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Jason Alexander]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Faith Ford]], [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[John Ritter]], and [[Abe Vigoda]]. [[Bruce Willis]] narrates and plays several different roles throughout the film, and a 9-year-old [[Scarlett Johansson]] appears briefly in her film debut. This was the final theatrical film for [[Alexander Godunov]] before his death the following year. The film was shot in [[Hawaii]], [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[South Dakota]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing just $12 million against its $40 million budget,<ref name=chumps/><ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|author=Gabbi Shaw|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref> and received largely negative reviews from critics, many of whom called it [[list of films considered the worst#North (1994)|one of the worst films ever made]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Keep plot summaries below 700 words -->\nSkilled in academics, sports, and drama, and praised for his good work and obedience, North feels unvalued by his own parents. One day, while finding solace in a living room display at a mall, he complains to the [[Easter Bunny]]\u2014a man in a pink bunny suit\u2014who recommends that North simply explain his feelings to them, but North says their neglect makes them undeserving. Aided and encouraged by his best friend Winchell, who works on the school paper, North plots to \"[[emancipation of minors|divorce]]\" his parents, hiring [[Ambulance chasing|ambulance-chasing]] [[lawyer]] Arthur Belt to file the papers. The announcement greatly shocks his parents, leaving them unresponsive when Judge Buckle grants his petition, giving him one summer to find new parents or go to an orphanage.\n\nNorth's first stop is [[Texas]], where his parental candidates, Ma and Pa Tex, promise to use their wealth to fulfill North's desires. In a musical number (set to the [[Bonanza]] theme), they explain that their first son, Buck, died in a stampede and they plan to use North to replace Buck, planning out his entire life in advance, including his future wife. They also place massive quantities of food on his dinner plate, hoping that he will eat as much as Buck did (as Pa Tex had earlier mentioned Buck's obesity to North, saying \"he could eat more in one day than anyone else could eat in a whole month\"). Gabby, a sharpshooting cowboy (also the man in the Easter Bunny suit), presents North with a souvenir from his act\u2014a silver dollar with a bullet hole shot through its center\u2014and notes that North is unhappy with the Texes because he wishes to be appreciated for who he is, not made into someone else, advising him to move on.\n\nHis next stop is [[Hawaii]], where Governor and Mrs. Ho, who cannot have biological children, are eager to adopt him. Believing that North's presence in Hawaii will attract mainlanders, the governor unveils a tourism campaign that references the classic [[Coppertone]] ad by showcasing North's bare buttocks, horrifying him. On the beach, a tourist with a [[metal detector]] (also the man in the bunny suit) explains to North that parents should not use children for personal gain.\n\nIn an [[Inuit]] village in [[Alaska]], North's prospective parents calmly send their elderly grandfather [[Senicide|out to sea on an ice floe]] to die with dignity, disturbing him. As the long, dark winter arrives, he realizes that his summer is almost up. Meanwhile, his now-[[catatonia|catatonic]] real parents are put in a museum display. His quest has inspired children worldwide to leave their parents and hire Belt and Winchell, both now rich and powerful. North's next family is [[Amish]], but the lack of conveniences quickly disappoints him. His experiences in [[Zaire]], [[China]], and [[Paris]] are equally fruitless. Finally, he finds the Nelsons, an ideal family who give him attention and appreciation, but he still is unsatisfied.\n\nIn despair, North escapes to [[New York City]], where Winchell and Belt, fearing their lucrative business will fail, plot to assassinate him. On the run, he receives a videotape from his newly revived parents begging for his forgiveness and his return home. Standup [[comedian]] Joey Fingers (the same man in the bunny suit) encourages him. At the airport, a mob of kids who have followed his example confront him, angry about his returning to his parents, forcing him to ship himself home in a [[FedEx]] box. Recognizing the delivery driver from his other appearances, North asks if he is his [[guardian angel]]. The man denies meeting North, but as a FedEx representative, he resembles a guardian of important items.\n\nNorth is delivered to his house prior to the deadline, but as he runs toward his parents, an assassin takes aim. As he squeezes the trigger, North awakens in the now-empty mall. The Easter Bunny takes him home, where his parents, who have been worried during his absence, greet him warmly. It has all been a dream, but in his pocket, North discovers Gabby's silver dollar. North says he has always had it, \"for good luck\", and goes inside as his parents agree to bring him dinner in bed.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as North\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Narrator and benevolent advisors (Easter Bunny, Gabby, Tourist, Sleigh Driver, Joey Fingers, FedEx Driver)\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Arthur Belt\n* Matthew McCurley as Winchell\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as North's Father\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as North's Mother\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Judge Buckle\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Pa Tex\n* [[Reba McEntire]] as Ma Tex\n* [[Alexander Godunov]] as Amish Father \n* [[Kelly McGillis]] as Amish Mother\n* [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]] as Alaskan Father\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Alaskan Mother\n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Alaskan Grandfather\n* [[Faith Ford]] as Donna Nelson\n* [[John Ritter]] as Ward Nelson\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]]<!--This is the credit in the end credits.--> as Laura Nelson\n* Jesse Ziegler as Bud Nelson\n* [[Keone Young]] as Governor Ho\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Mrs. Ho\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Museum Curator\n* [[Taylor Fry]] as Zoe\n* [[Alana Austin]] as Hannah\n* [[Jussie Smollett]] as Adam\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Al\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Chinese Mother\n* [[Alan Rachins]] as Defense Attorney\n* [[Richard Belzer]] as Barker\n* [[Marc Shaiman]] as Piano Player\n* [[Alan Zweibel]] as Baseball Coach\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nElijah Wood was cast as the lead in 1993.
