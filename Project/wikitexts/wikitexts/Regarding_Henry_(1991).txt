Before editing this section, please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\n\nAmbitious, callous, [[narcissism|narcissistic]], and at times unethical, Henry Turner is a wealthy successful [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose obsession with his work leaves him little time for his socialite wife, Sarah, and troubled preteen daughter, Rachel. He has just won a [[malpractice]] suit, defending a hospital against a plaintiff who claims, but is unable to prove, that he warned doctors about a pre-existing condition.\n\nRunning out to a [[convenience store]] to buy cigarettes one night, Henry is shot when he interrupts a robbery. One bullet hits his right [[frontal lobe]], while the other hits his left [[subclavian artery]], causing excessive internal bleeding and [[cardiac arrest]]. He experiences [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], resulting in [[brain damage]].\n\nHenry survives but can neither move nor talk and he suffers [[retrograde amnesia]]. While in a nursing facility, he slowly regains movement and speech with the help of a [[physical therapy|physical therapist]] named Bradley. Henry's recovery creates a financial burden for the family. Upon returning home, Henry is almost childlike. As he forges new relationships with his family, he realizes he does not like who he once was.\n\nSarah enrolls Rachel into an out-of-town elite school, though she is now reluctant to go. At orientation, Henry tells Rachel a lie to help her adjust to the new school. He and Sarah grow closer, as they were when they first met. Henry also misses Rachel.\n\nHenry's firm allows him to return out of deference to his previous contributions. Sarah suggests they relocate to a smaller, less expensive residence. As his firm essentially assigns him only low-level work, he realizes he no longer wants to be a lawyer. While at a dinner party, they overhear several \"friends\" making derogatory comments about him.\n\nHenry, finding a former colleague's letters to Sarah disclosing they had an affair, becomes angry and leaves home. He is confronted by Linda, a fellow attorney, who reveals they were having an affair and that he was going to leave Sarah. Henry has second thoughts about himself and his relationships.\n\nHenry gives the documents that his firm suppressed to the plaintiff that proves their case, and he apologizes. He then resigns from the firm. He realizes that, as Sarah had said, everything had been wrong before but it is now so much better. They reconcile, then go to Rachel's school and withdraw her. She is overjoyed to be with her parents. As they leave the building, she tosses her school-uniform hat away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Henry Turner\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Sarah Turner\n* Mikki Allen as Rachel Turner\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Bradley\n* [[Rebecca Miller]] as Linda\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Bruce\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Jessica\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Charlie Cameron\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Convenience Store Robber\n* [[Robin Bartlett]] as Phyllis\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Dr. Sultan\n* [[J.
