Because his care-worn father ignores him, Duncan befriends the farm animals and adopts a chicken as his pet. Abused by his own father, an older adolescent named Perry (Jason Hayes) takes a shine to the outcast. Proclaiming they aren't gay, Duncan and Perry suppress a mutual attraction that would outrage Perry's macho friends. Directed by Michael Burke.\n\n* ''Late Summer'' (2001; Director/Writer: David Ottenhouse)\n\"Late Summer\" deals with the sort of unspecified childhood crush that both gays and straights have experienced. After his parents die in a car crash, Adam goes to live with an aunt and uncle; Adam's popular cousin Josh (Chris Nee) takes him under his wing. Responding to this all-American teen's guidance, the sheltered Adam learns how to skateboard and use a still-camera. Frozen in time, one picture celebrates how Josh lives on in his younger cousin's heart. Directed by David Ottenhouse.\n\n* ''Time Off''\n\"Time Off\" offers viewers a tour of duty with Israeli soldiers during the First Lebanon War, in 1982. In a bivouac, sensitive Yonatan (Hanoch Re'im) wonders why gung-ho Lieutenant Erez (Gil Frank) picks on him.
