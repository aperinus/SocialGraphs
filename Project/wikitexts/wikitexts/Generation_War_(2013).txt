It was commissioned by public broadcasting organization [[ZDF]], produced by the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] subsidiary TeamWorx, and first aired in Germany and Austria in March 2013. The series tells the story of five German friends, aged around 20, on their different paths through [[Nazi Germany]] and [[World War II]]: as [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], a war nurse, an aspiring singer, and a Jewish tailor. The narrative spans four years, starting in 1941 [[Berlin]], when the friends meet up for a last time before embarking on their journeys, enthusiastically vowing to meet up again the following Christmas. The story's conclusion is set shortly after the end of the war in 1945.\n\nWhen the series first aired in Germany, each episode garnered around 7 million viewers. ''Generation War'' has generated much controversy. ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that hardly any German TV drama ever caused so much public debate.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news|title=The war generation: A new television drama about wartime Germany stirs up controversy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21574531-new-television-drama-about-wartime-germany-stirs-up-controversy-war-generation|access-date=30 March 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 March 2013}}</ref> Critics have acknowledged the film to be well crafted, intense and unsparing in its depiction of combat on the eastern front.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.O.|title=A History Lesson, Airbrushed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/movies/generation-war-adds-a-glow-to-a-german-era.html|access-date=20 October 2015|work=The New York Times|date=14 January 2014}}</ref> However, aspects such as the portrayal of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] as [[Antisemitism|anti-semites]], the scant depiction of [[The Holocaust|Nazi Germany's objective to purge the Reich of Jews]],<ref name=\"Opferneid als Dreiteiler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/15529|title=Einspruch: Opferneid als Dreiteiler|author=Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland K.d.\u00f6.R.|date=19 March 2013|publisher=Juedische-allgemeine.de|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> and the blurring of differences between non-German victims and German perpetrators have been deplored by others.<ref name=\"The_News.pl\">{{cite web|title= German TV defends depiction of WWII Polish anti-semites|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/131429,German-TV-defends-depiction-of-WWII-Polish-antisemites|access-date = 28 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Der Spiegel\">{{cite web|title=TV Tiff: Polish Weekly Shows Merkel in Concentration Camp|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/polish-weekly-puts-merkel-in-concentration-camp-over-tv-miniseries-a-893589.html|date=10 April 2013|author=kla \u2013 with wire reports|access-date=12 April 2013|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref><ref name=\"tp\">{{cite news | url=http://tygodnik.onet.pl/swiat/oprawcy-mimo-woli/xr8st | title=Oprawcy mimo woli |trans-title=Torturers, but against their will | work=World | date=7 April 2013 | last=Trenkner |first= Joachim |language= pl |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085834/http://tygodnik.onet.pl/swiat/oprawcy-mimo-woli/xr8st|archive-date= 29 November 2014 |access-date=18 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThere are three 90 minute parts: ''A Different Time'' (''{{Lang|de|Eine andere Zeit}}''), ''A Different War'' (''{{Lang|de|Ein anderer Krieg}}''), and ''A Different Country'' (''{{Lang|de|Ein anderes Land}}'').\n\n===A Different Time===\nShortly before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], five close friends have a party at a pub in Berlin. Wilhelm is an officer in the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]], while his brother Friedhelm an enlisted man. Viktor is a [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jew]] whose father owns a tailor shop. Charlotte has just passed her examination to become a [[military nurse]]. Greta is a beautiful bartender who hopes to become a singer. The friends are hopeful that they will meet again by Christmas.\n\nWilhelm and Friedhelm witness some early victories as the German army advances toward Moscow. Charlotte gets used to seeing blood as she works in a military hospital near the front-line. Greta sleeps with an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] major in the to advance her career as a singer. She attempts to use her relationship to obtain documents for Viktor to flee to New York City, but Viktor is arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and is put on a train to a concentration camp.\n\n===A Different War===\n\nThe invasion is being pushed back by the [[Red Army]], causing high casualties for the Germans. During an assault in which almost his entire platoon is killed, Wilhelm is knocked unconscious by an explosion and left for dead. When he wakes up, instead of going back to the base, he finds a cabin by a lake and lives on his own for a few weeks. He is discovered by the [[Feldgendarmerie|military police]] and sentenced to death for desertion. Friedhelm, having been cut off from his unit during the earlier assault, escapes the Russians by wearing a Soviet uniform, only to be mistakenly shot by his own side when returning to his lines. He is taken to a field hospital where Charlotte discovers him and convinces the doctor to operate, saving his life. While recovering, believing his brother to be dead, he tells Charlotte that Wilhelm has been killed. Friedhelm is sent back home, but seeing his father's disappointment with Wilhelm's apparent death, and lack of appreciation for Friedhelm's survival, Friedhelm cuts short his leave and returns to his unit. Viktor is sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], but he manages to escape by breaking the wooden floor of the railroad car he is in, alongside a Polish woman called Alina, and joins a group of [[Le\u015bni|Polish partisans]]. He has to conceal his Jewish identity because they hate Jews. Charlotte feels despair over Wilhelm's apparent death and starts an affair with the doctor who saved Friedhelm. Greta visits the front-line to perform for the many soldiers. In the apartment where she stays, she is reunited with Wilhelm, Friedhelm and Charlotte for a brief moment. She visits Charlotte's workplace and becomes disillusioned by what she sees. Back in Germany, she returns to the bar where she works and tells the soldiers who have returned from the battlefield that victory is still a long way to go. The day after, she is arrested by the Gestapo and thrown into prison for making remarks in public that disapprove of the war and the Hitler regime and also probably because of her attempts to contact the same Gestapo Lt. Colonel in the first episode (calling him at home, which, as his mistress, was unacceptable). When the Lt. Colonel questions her, she tells him that she has become pregnant.\n\n===A Different Country===\n\nThe Soviets are now [[Battle of Berlin|nearing Berlin]]. Wilhelm's death sentence is reduced to probation and he is assigned to a [[Strafbataillon|disciplinary battalion]]. A sadistic sergeant abuses Wilhelm, who Wilhelm eventually kills before escaping the battalion. Charlotte befriends a Russian nurse named Sonja. After liberating prisoners from a train on the way to a labour camp, Viktor is expelled from the partisans, because they found out he was Jewish. Charlotte sees Wilhelm again and has an emotional breakdown, because she thought he was dead. Viktor crosses paths with Friedhelm, who kills an SD commander, enabling Viktor to escape. When the field hospital is overrun, Charlotte and Sonja are captured and raped by a gang of Soviet soldiers. A female Soviet officer forcibly recruits them to become nurses for the Red Army. She sees Sonja being tortured as a traitor and then being executed. After the German army falls apart, Friedhelm dies while leading a group of ''[[Volkssturm]]'', sacrificing himself to make his troops surrender. In the war's last days, Greta is executed by the German authorities for her speech crimes, and her possession of incriminating evidence about her former Gestapo lover - who, it is implied, has ordered her execution. Shortly after the end of the war, the three survivors, Wilhelm, Viktor, and Charlotte, meet in the ruins of the same pub as before and grieve together for their lost friends, but without any sense of triumph over their survival.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Wilhelm Winter===\nWilhelm ([[Volker Bruch]]) is the [[narrator]] of the story. He provides the opening monologue for the episodes, and when the plot jumps forward in time his voiceovers describe the course of the war. In the pilot episode he states that he has served in the [[invasion of Poland]] as well as in the [[Battle of France|invasion of France]]. He is somewhat aware that Charlotte has feelings for him, but tells his brother and fellow soldiers that he doesn't want to get her hopes up, presumably as he could be killed on the front lines before he could reciprocate.\n\nWilhelm firmly believes he is bound by honor to fight as a soldier for his home country. Consequently, he is determined to do what he considers his duty as a [[Wehrmacht]] officer commanding an infantry platoon and he executes a prisoner in accordance with the [[Commissar Order]]. As the war goes on he is awarded the [[Iron Cross First Class|Iron Cross 1st class]] and promoted to [[Oberleutnant]]<ref>{{Cite episode |series= Generation War |number= 2 |time= 4:10 }}</ref> but the hope for a quick victory evaporates and so does his na\u00efve idealism. Facing the death of his whole platoon to achieve a questionable objective, he walks away from the front line after suffering from a concussion caused by a [[Panzerfaust]] anti-tank explosive. He then takes refuge in an abandoned lakeside cabin where he is arrested as a deserter by [[Feldgendarmerie]] officers. Instead of being executed, he is placed in a [[Strafbattalion]] (Penal Battalion). He is continually broken down further, through the actions of his sadistic platoon leader. Charlotte encounters him as a member of the Penal Battalion and is incredulous that he is alive, but they are quickly separated. Later he kills his platoon leader and escapes with a fellow soldier, making his way to Berlin.\n\nAt the series' end, he, Charlotte, and Viktor gather in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked in occupied Berlin and toast Greta and Friedhelm.\n\n===Charlotte===\nCharlotte ([[Miriam Stein]]), referred to as \"Charly\" by the circle of friends, secretly loves Wilhelm. When the war begins she volunteers as a nurse.  She initially cannot bear to witness the suffering of wounded soldiers, but over the course of the campaign she hardens considerably.  After being expelled from the operating theatre for dropping a scalpel, she is reassigned as a general nurse. Because the medical staff are overworked and in short supply, she is allowed to get assistance from local [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] medical workers. She employs a Ukrainian assistant named Lilija who, when asked, denies being a Jew. After [[morphine]] goes missing, Charlotte investigates and discovers a photograph of Lilija's family standing in front of a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]. She confronts Lilija, who admits to being a Jewish born medical doctor. Upon hearing this admission, Charlotte wrestles with her conscience but in the end decides to report her to the authorities. However, shortly afterwards, when she sees [[Gestapo]] officers approaching the ward she tries to warn Lilija to run away. But before Lilija can act, another German nurse points her out to the authorities who are \"looking for a Jew hiding in the hospital\" and they take her away. Charlotte's grief is further compounded when a wounded Friedhelm claims that Wilhelm was killed in action and she has an affair with the chief surgeon.  Things only get worse when Wilhelm later turns up as a Penal Battalion soldier at her field hospital as the German Army is retreating on the Eastern Front. She angrily pushes Wilhelm away after confessing she is in love with him, and runs away to cry.  When she regains her composure to try and speak with him again, she finds that he is gone.\n\nAs the front very quickly closes in, Charlotte, a local aide, Sonja, and a group of seriously wounded soldiers fail to evacuate and are left behind to face the advancing [[Red Army]], whose men kill the rest of the wounded soldiers in their beds and proceed to arrest Sonja as a collaborator and rape Charlotte. Just then Lilija, having been freed by the Russians and now in their service as an officer, shows up, interrupts the rape, and saves Charlotte from further harm (execution) by arranging her inclusion as a nurse in the Soviet field hospital. She does however proceed to shoot Sonja, stating there was nothing she could do to alter a death penalty for a [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborator]], noting that she has at least saved her from suffering sexual abuse at the hand of the soldiers.\n\nAt the war's end, she, Wilhelm, and Viktor have a solemn reunion in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked.\n\n===Greta M\u00fcller===\nGreta ([[Katharina Sch\u00fcttler]]) is a bartender at a local tavern in Berlin, and an ambitious singer who wants to succeed by any means.  When the Gestapo officer Martin Dorn crashes their going-away party (in the pilot episode), she admits to possessing the [[Teddy Stauffer]] swing-dance record the five friends are dancing to in order to stall the officer and prevents her Jewish boyfriend Viktor from being discovered out past curfew. She starts a love affair with Dorn to try to worm out of the charges of incitement; Dorn, in return, promotes her career for propaganda efforts. When she becomes a threat to his own marriage, he organizes a [[United Service Organizations|USO]]-like road show in the midst of the Eastern Front.  She is briefly reunited with Friedhelm, Wilhelm, and Charlotte in her improvised dressing room after her performance, but cuts short the reunion (much to the other friends' dismay) to attend a private party held by the senior commanders.\n\nGreta is stranded when her driver and pilot leave her behind at the start of the [[Battle of Kursk]] as she takes too long to pack her belongings. Charlotte forces her to help tend to wounded Heer soldiers at her field hospital, and the experience clearly traumatizes Greta. By chance she manages to return to her bar in Berlin, where she openly expresses her doubts in the [[Endsieg]] to a group of partying soldiers, and angers Dorn by revealing their affair to his wife, both of which lead to her getting arrested and imprisoned for [[Wehrkraftzersetzung]] (\"subversion of the war effort\") and [[defeatism]]. When she is arrested, she reveals that she had become impregnated by Dorn. He is shocked by this and then punches her in the stomach hard, to end her pregnancy. She is imprisoned and eventually executed by a firing squad in the final days of the war.\n\n===Viktor Goldstein===\nViktor ([[Ludwig Trepte]]) is Greta's secret lover. Because of his [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] background both of them live in constant fear that they will be accused of [[Rassenschande]] (\"racial shame\", \"racial defilement\", or \"racial pollution\"). Attempting to help him escape deportation, Greta manipulates Dorn into giving him a passport to the US, but Dorn double-crosses him and on the day of his departure Viktor is arrested by Gestapo and sent to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. On the way there he escapes from the train, along with a Polish woman named Alina, and joins a group of Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] partisans. During his time there he has to keep his Jewish background a secret due to widespread anti-Semitism within the group. As the group is about to carry out an ambush on a motorized Wehrmacht squad, Viktor, by chance, recognizes Friedhelm as one of the drivers, and feigns his participation in the attack allowing Friedhelm to pass safely through the ambush and inadvertently saving the life of Hiemer, his [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] officer passenger. Later, the group ambushes and raids a German train for weapons, whereupon they discover that a large part of its cargo is Jewish prisoners, whom they refuse to free. A conflicted Viktor decides openly to defy them and frees the prisoners, angering the other partisans who consider executing him. However, their leader, having become sympathetic towards Viktor, allows him to walk away from the group in peace. Just after Viktor leaves, the partisans are betrayed and their hide-out is attacked by Friedhelm's squad, but Friedhelm recognizes Viktor and allows him to escape amidst the confusion, having shot SD officer Hiemer who has also appeared. After the end of the war Viktor returns to Berlin to find out that both his parents and Greta are dead, that new residents have taken over his family's apartment, and that Dorn is now a member of the allies' postwar administration under the protection of U.S. army, much to his fury.\nAt the end of the war Viktor reunites with Charlotte and Wilhelm in the rubble of the bar where Greta worked.\n\n===Friedhelm Winter===\n[[File:Friedhelm Winter (Generation War).jpg|thumbnail|Friedhelm Winter, played by Tom Schilling]]\nFriedhelm ([[Tom Schilling]]) is a sensitive young man who has no ambitions as a soldier. His comrades deride him as a foolhardy coward who puts their lives at greater risk and they beat him up after it is perceived he gave away their position to a [[Polikarpov Po-2]] \"sewing machine\" by lighting a cigarette. Friedhelm becomes emotionally hardened and ruthless throughout the Eastern front campaign, willingly executing prisoners, and leading a charge to take a Russian telegraph station after witnessing his brother's apparent death by a Panzerfaust. He is shot by his fellow soldiers when they mistake him for a Russian (when he had stolen a Russian uniform to escape from aforementioned telegraph station upon its recapture by the Red Army). Charlotte manages to save him by begging the chief surgeon of the field hospital to operate on him, despite the surgeon's bleak triage assessment. Before being sent back to Berlin he tells Charlotte (mistakenly) that Wilhelm perished in the Panzerfaust attack. He becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] officer Hiemer, who uses him as an executioner during the numerous anti-partisan actions in occupied Poland. But during a raid on a Polish partisan group, Friedhelm has a chance encounter with Viktor, and when Hiemer orders him to shoot Viktor, Friedhelm instead betrays and kills Hiemer, allowing Viktor to escape. Near the end of the war he has been promoted to the rank of ''Unteroffizier'' (equivalent to UK Corporal / US Sergeant) and leads a group of [[Volkssturm]] soldiers comprising old men and [[Hitler Youth]] boys shaped by their stubborn will to fight against the Soviets. Friedhelm orders them to stay put and walks alone towards the enemy aiming his rifle at them causing himself to be gunned down. The Volkssturm soldiers surrender after witnessing Friedhelm's futile death by fire from a [[PM M1910|Maxim machine gun]].\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Volker Bruch]]: Wilhelm Winter\n* [[Tom Schilling]]: Friedhelm Winter\n* [[Katharina Sch\u00fcttler]]: Greta M\u00fcller\n* [[Ludwig Trepte]]: Viktor Goldstein\n* [[Miriam Stein]]: Charlotte\n* [[Mark Waschke]]: Dorn\n* [[Christiane Paul]]: Lilija\n* [[Sylvester Groth]]: Sturmbannf\u00fchrer / Standartenf\u00fchrer Hiemer\n* [[Henriette Richter-R\u00f6hl]]: Hildegard\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|G\u00f6tz Schubert|de}}: Dr. Jahn\n* [[Bernd Michael Lade]]: Feldwebel Krebs\n* [[Maxim Mehmet]]: Hauptmann Feigl\n* [[Alina Levshin]]: Alina, a Pole from Warsaw\n* [[Samuel Finzi]]: Viktor's father\n* [[Dorka Gryllus]]: Viktor's mother\n* [[Johanna Gastdorf]]: Mother Winter\n* [[Peter Kremer]]: Father Winter\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Anne Diemer|de}}: Dorn's wife\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Trystan P\u00fctter|de}}: Bertok\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|David Zimmerschied|de}}: Schneider\n* [[Joel Basman]]: Bartel\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Wannek|de}}: Koch\n* [[Lucas Gregorowicz]]: Jerzy (Polish partisan leader)\n* [[Benjamin Trinks]]: Eins\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Ihnow|de}}: Francizek\n* [[Ludwig Blochberger]]: Freitag\n* [[Hildegard Schroedter]]: German head nurse\n* [[Tino Mewes]]: Zwei\n* [[Marek Harloff]]: Karow\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Denis R\u00f6mer|de}}: Russian officer in the hospital\n* [[Martin Hentschel]]: the officer who commits suicide\n* [[David Zimmerschied]]: Schneider\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Laurens Walter|de}}: Dorn's Adjutant\n* [[Kristoffer Fuss]]: Russian soldier\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Jan Niklas Berg|de}}: German soldier\n* [[Matthias Halbrock]]: Russian doctor\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Adam Markiewicz|de}}: Stanislawski\n* [[Martin Bruchmann]]: Schmidt\n* [[Andre Borning]]: Russian officer\n* [[Bruno Montani]]: soldier\n* [[Inga Jarkova]]: Sonja, Russian nurse\n* [[Bernhard Conrad]]: Feldwebel\n* [[Franziska B\u00f6hm]]: Krystyna\n* [[Florian Andreas Rittweger]]: German traitor\n* [[Kristina Skokova]] : Jewish woman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Generation War'' is an ''[[UFA GmbH|UFA]]'' production, formally known as ''TeamWorx''.

The author stressed the danger of the docu-entertainment format of movies that attempt to depict historical events with stories that are in fact purely fictional. Meyer emphasized how crucial the creation of the friends\u2018 characters in the trilogy was for the perception of the historical content, and criticized the movie's denial of the Holocaust through the creation of a Jewish protagonist who survived the war through switching sides and becoming a traitor to his heroic and self-sacrificing friends.\n\nSeveral German historians criticized the film. The historian [[Ulrich Herbert]] wrote that the film showed Nazis as \"others\", different from \"Our Mothers and Fathers\". It showed all Germans as victims. The film showed nothing of the love and trust that Hitler inspired in German youth, or of the widespread belief that Germany deserved to rule Europe. In reality, he wrote, these \"mothers and fathers\" were a highly ideological and politicized generation, who wanted Nazi Germany to win victory, because that would be right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/!113239;m/|title=\"Unsere M\u00fctter, unsere V\u00e4ter\": Nazis sind immer die anderen |first=Ulrich |last= Herbert|website=[[Taz.de]]|access-date=17 October 2015 |trans-title=\u201eGeneration War\u201c: Nazis are always the others |language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Habbo Knoch said that the film failed to show how the Nazi system functioned. The film showed 20-year-old characters who became victims of war, but missing were the 30- to 40-year-old Germans who built the Nazi system and supported it out of a mixture of conviction and self-interest. The film should have shown those who profited from the Nazi system.<ref name=\"stern.de\"/>\n\nAccording to historian Lukas Meissel, \"Historical guilt is often talked about or portrayed in a somewhat elusive way, making it easy to relativize.\" Three stereotypes are advanced to downplay Nazi German crimes: \"1. The Poles are shown as even more anti-Semitic than the Germans. Furthermore, they are presented as convinced ideological anti-Semites, whereas the German characters are portrayed mostly as not ideological. 2. Soviet soldiers are presented in a primarily negative light. ... 3. The Americans (and not the Germans) use 'former' Nazis to pursue their own interests...\"<ref>''Lessons and Legacies XII: New Directions in Holocaust Research and Education''.

Concerning the film's not showing Nazi death camps, Avnery writes \"The Holocaust is not the center of events, but it is there all the time, not as a separate event but woven into the fabric of reality.\" He describes the progression of two of the protagonists: \"Death is all around them, they see horrible war crimes, they are commanded to shoot prisoners, they see Jewish children butchered. In the beginning they still dare to protest feebly, then they keep their doubts to themselves, then they take part in the crimes as a matter of course.\" He propounds a theory of the individual in totalitarian circumstances: \"It is this element of the situation that is difficult for many people to grasp. A citizen under a criminal totalitarian regime becomes a child. Propaganda becomes for him reality, the only reality he knows. It is more effective than even the terror.\" He sees the Jews and the Germans as two still traumatized peoples. \"That's why the film is so important, not only for the Germans, but for every people, including our own.\"\n\nUri Klein's review of ''Generation War'' appeared 2 September 2014 in [[Haaretz]]. Concerning the miniseries not showing Nazi death camps, Klein writes, \"... no extermination camps are shown in the series, whose measure of brutality and blatant anti-Semitism is meted out by the Polish partisans ... and by the Russian army.\" This is due to the portrayal of the five main characters in a sympathetic light of \"heroism and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal, love and its price\" which is detached from actual historical events. Instead of history, Klein likens the production to a typical Hollywood product of action, special effects, and a romanticized story of essentially noble individuals caught up in a war not of their choice. \"The difficulties that they experience, like their personality crises, stem from the fact that, as we have learned from the movies dozens of times, war \u2013 any war \u2013 is hell.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/movies-television/.premium-1.613461|title=Nostalgic German TV Series Takes History Out of WW2|work=Haaretz.com|access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Score==\nThe score was released in Germany on 15 March 2013 on CD and in a digital format.
