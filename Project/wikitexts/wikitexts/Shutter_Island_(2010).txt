[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] stars as Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of the patients goes missing. [[Mark Ruffalo]] plays his partner and fellow deputy marshal, [[Ben Kingsley]] is the facility's lead psychiatrist, [[Max von Sydow]] is a German doctor, and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] is Daniels' wife. Released on February 19, 2010, the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2010]], and grossed $299&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nThe film was noted for its soundtrack, which prominently used classical music, such as that of [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John Cage]], [[Ingram Marshall]], and [[Max Richter]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Insanity defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island, [[Boston Harbor]] to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, who drowned her three children.\n\nThe staff, led by psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley, appear uncooperative. The marshals learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Teddy experiences [[migraine]] headaches, flashbacks of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the [[Dachau concentration camp#Liberation|liberation of Dachau]] and also vivid dreams of his wife Dolores, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. Teddy explains to Chuck that he took the case to find Laeddis, believing he is on the island. Solando suddenly resurfaces, prompting Teddy to break into a restricted ward where he meets patient George Noyce. He claims the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to a lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]], and warns Teddy that everyone is deceiving him.\n\nTeddy regroups with Chuck and they climb the cliffs toward the lighthouse but become separated. Seeing Chuck's body on the rocks below, Teddy investigates but finds only a cave where a woman claiming to be the real Solando is hiding. She states that she is a former psychiatrist who discovered experiments to develop [[mind control]] but was forcibly committed. She says that Cawley and his assistant Dr. Naehring will use Teddy's war trauma to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to have him committed. Teddy returns to the hospital and is greeted by Cawley. When Teddy asks about Chuck's whereabouts, Cawley firmly insists that Teddy does not have a partner, that he arrived on the island alone.\n\nConvinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse,  Teddy heads there but runs into Naehring, who attempts to sedate him. Teddy overpowers him and breaks into the lighthouse, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Teddy confronts Cawley and reveals his encounter with Solando, saying he believes Cawley is experimenting on him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed and insists that Teddy has not been drugged, explaining the tremors as withdrawals from Chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic medication that Teddy has been taking for two years. Chuck arrives and reveals he is in fact Dr. Sheehan. Cawley explains that \"Teddy\" is the real Andrew Laeddis, incarcerated for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife after she drowned their three children. Andrew did not seek help for Dolores when she burned down their apartment, instead moving his family to a lake house, where the tragedy struck. Cawley explains that Andrew's delusion is a result of his guilt, his migraines and hallucinations are in fact withdrawal symptoms, and recent events have been an elaborate role play designed to cure him. Overwhelmed by his sudden recall, Andrew faints.\n\nAwakening later, Andrew calmly recounts the truth, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Andrew quickly regressed. He warns this will be Andrew's last chance and if he lapses again he will be lobotomized. Some time later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan. Appearing delusional, Andrew again refers to Sheehan as \"Chuck\" and says they must leave the island. Sheehan signals to Cawley, who orders that Andrew be lobotomized. Andrew then asks Sheehan if it would be worse \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\" A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew \"Teddy\" but the latter does not respond and leaves peacefully with the orderlies.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CAST LISTINGS SHOULD MATCH CREDITS OF THE FILM.
