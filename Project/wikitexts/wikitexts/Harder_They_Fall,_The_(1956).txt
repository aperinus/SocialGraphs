It was [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s final film role.<ref name=Erickson>Erickson, Hal. {{AllMovie title|id=21565|title=The Harder They Fall}}</ref> It received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black and White]] for [[Burnett Guffey]] at the [[29th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Sportswriter]] Eddie Willis, broke after the newspaper he works for goes under, is hired as a PR man by boxing promoter Nick Benko. Nick has recruited Toro Moreno, a towering Argentinian. Despite Toro's lack of fighting ability, Nick plans to use his size as a gimmick to draw fans to his fights. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager, Lu\u00eds Agrandi, all of his fights are fixed to make the public believe that he is a talented boxer.\n\nEddie feels misgivings about the scheme, but the lure of a huge payday is enough to make him ignore the venture's dishonesty. He is able to spin Toro as a legitimate up-and-comer even when his first fight goes so disastrously wrong that the boxing commission threatens to open an investigation.\n\nAs Benko's entourage crosses the country in a bus bedecked with advertising for the fighter, Toro gradually becomes a ranked contender. Throughout the tour, Eddie handles negotiations with other boxing managers to ensure Toro's fights remain fixed.\n\nToro fights Gus Dundee, whose previous fight with champion Buddy Brannen has left him with a broken neck. After the Toro fight, Dundee collapses and dies. Toro is overcome with guilt, thinking he killed Dundee, and wishes to return to Argentina. In a last-ditch attempt to protect the upcoming bout with Brannen, Eddie tells Toro the truth: that Brannen was responsible for Dundee's condition, that Toro is no fighter, and that all his fights have been fixed.\n\nDuring the Brannen fight, Toro sustains a brutal beating. Afterward, Eddie learns that Benko has sold Toro's contract to another manager. While Eddie gets his promised payout of $26,000, Benko has rigged the accounting so Toro earns only $49.07. Ashamed of his part in the farce and not wanting to see Toro exploited any further, Eddie gives Toro the $26,000 and puts him on a plane to Argentina before Benko's men can stop them.\n\nThough Benko threatens to harm Eddie, Eddie begins writing an expos\u00e9 about the corruption.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Eddie Willis \n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Nick Benko \n* [[Jan Sterling]] as Beth Willis \n* [[Mike Lane]] as Toro Moreno \n* [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] as Buddy Brannen \n* [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] as George \n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Jim Weyerhause \n* [[Harold J.

Steiger recalled the actor's professionalism during production, even while coping with the disease:\n\n<blockquote>\"Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out altogether. Bogey didn't play those games. He was a professional and had tremendous authority. He'd come in exactly at 9am and leave at precisely 6pm. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on the lot. I shouldn't have because his work was finished for the day. I asked him why he was still on the lot, and he said, 'They want to shoot some retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery'. A little while later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey's death. Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the cancer. I thought: 'How dumb can you be, Rodney'!\"{{sfn|Fantle|Johnson|2009|p=140}}</blockquote>\n\nThe film was released with two different endings: one where Eddie Willis<ref name=Erickson/> (inspired by sports writer Harold Conrad, according to Conrad<ref name=Thomlison/>) demanded that boxing be banned altogether, and the other where he merely insisted that there be a federal investigation into boxing. The video version contains the \"harder\" ending, while most television prints end with the \"softer\" message. Occasionally inaudible in a take, some of Bogart's lines as Willis are reported to have been dubbed in post-production by [[Paul Frees]].<ref name=Erickson/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film premiered at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3643/year/1956.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Harder They Fall|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] liked the film, writing \"It's a brutal and disagreeable story, probably a little far-fetched, and without Mr. Schulberg's warmest character\u2014the wistful widow who bestowed her favors on busted pugs. But with all the arcana of the fight game that Mr. Yordan and Mr. Robson have put into it\u2014along with their bruising, brutish fight scenes\u2014it makes for a lively, stinging film.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E3DE1E3CE03BBC4852DFB366838D649EDE Crowther, Bosley], ''[[The New York Times]]'', film review, May 10, 1956.
