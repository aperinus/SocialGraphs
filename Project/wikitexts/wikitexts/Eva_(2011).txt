The film was also nominated for sixteen [[Gaud\u00ed Awards]], winning five.\n\nThe film had a limited theatrical release in the United States on 13 March 2015 by [[The Weinstein Company]].<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eva.htm|title=Eva (2015) - Box Office Mojo|website=Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2016}}\nThe film is set in 2043, in the time when humans live along with machines. \u00c1lex ([[Daniel Br\u00fchl]]), a renowned cybernetic engineer, returns to his hometown of Santa Irene after a ten-year absence on the behest of the Robotic Faculty, led by Julia ([[Anne Canovas]]), his old mentor. Julia has commissioned him to finish the SI-9, a robot built to resemble a child\u2014a project that \u00c1lex abandoned prematurely after working on it with Lana ([[Marta Etura]]), his old lover, who is now married to David ([[Alberto Ammann]]), his brother, both of whom had given up researching to teach.\n\n\u00c1lex visits Julia as she lectures students in a robotics laboratory. When a small robotic horse continually fails its tests, the pair of students decide to dismantle it with the phrase \"What do you see when you close your eyes?\" The robot falls to the ground, and \u00c1lex gently admonishes them, telling them that even if they restart the robot, it will never be the same; the phrase \"kills\" the robot by destroying its emotional memory, and thus, its soul.\n\nJulia and \u00c1lex view videos of children, trying to find a suitable child to model the SI-9 off of, but \u00c1lex considers them all too ordinary, and they would only make an ordinary robot by proxy. When he returns to his deceased father's house in order to complete his work, he is met by SI-7 robot Max ([[Llu\u00eds Homar]]), who has been sent to cook and clean for him. Max is startled by \u00c1lex's robotic cat and is frustrated when it does not listen to commands; \u00c1lex tells him that it is a \"free robot,\" illegal programming that allows it to act as a sentient being. Leaving Max to clean, \u00c1lex takes a drive to observe children in order to find a \"unique\" child to model the SI-9 off of. His attention is caught by the unusual Eva ([[Claudia Vega]]), a young girl who notices him and teasingly calls him a pervert when he admits that he was watching her. He asks if she'd like to be the model for his robot, but she refuses.\n\nDavid presses \u00c1lex to visit for dinner, and when \u00c1lex arrives, he is surprised to discover that Eva is actually Lana's child and his niece. Eva later visits \u00c1lex at his house and assists \u00c1lex with modelling the SI-9 through emotional recognition. \u00c1lex is amused by her small tantrums and shows her the SI-9 in action. Later that night, as Lana gives Eva a bath, Eva asks her about \u00c1lex; Lana tells her that both she and David were hurt and saddened when \u00c1lex left abruptly in the middle of the SI-9 project. Eva asks if she loved \u00c1lex like David, and Lana replies that she did, \"more or less.\"\n\n\u00c1lex asks Julia if the SI-9 project should be modeled after a girl and not a boy, though Julia warns against the negative emotional side-effects of the change. \u00c1lex also meets with Lana, who says that she does not want Eva to be in \u00c1lex's project. Later, David invites \u00c1lex to the upcoming graduation party, and implies that he knows that Lana was \u00c1lex's first love and that he suspects lingering feelings between the two. \u00c1lex goes ice-skating with Eva, and she leads him up a cliff to look out at the city before pointing out her own house; she tells him that David and Lana do not live together. \u00c1lex, however, realizes that she is lying when he goes to visit Lana and David returns home. He asks Eva why she lied, and she tells him that it was because it was what he wanted to hear.\n\nWhile experimenting with it, the SI-9 becomes hostile to \u00c1lex after he laughs at it in the same way Eva became upset. The SI-9 refuses to obey \u00c1lex's commands, and when it throws a [[chisel]] at him in a fury after he refuses to let it leave, he says the kill phrase and it \"dies,\" along with all of his work on it, frustrating him. He later goes to the graduation party, where Lana and David are waiting; he slow dances with Lana, much to the annoyance of David, who leaves. Lana takes \u00c1lex with her to look for him, but when \u00c1lex impulsively kisses her, she leaves, disturbed. David, who had seen the kiss, attacks \u00c1lex and tells him that he already abandoned Lana once, and that he should go.\n\nA disappointed \u00c1lex tells Julia that he is going to quit the project, and she accuses him of leaving another project half-finished. He also visits Eva to tell her that he is leaving, upsetting her. As he packs his things together back at his house, \u00c1lex is visited by Lana, who tells him that she does not want him to leave; they kiss, and after Eva approaches to see them through the lab's glass roof, Eva sees Lana tell him that Eva \"looks like us because we both made her.\" Disturbed, Eva runs off. Lana pursues her, but tells \u00c1lex to wait back at the house for her to return.\n\nLana finds Eva unconscious in the snow and opens up a panel in her back, revealing Eva to not be her and \u00c1lex's child but a robot, and the product of their research on the SI-9 (literally made by them). She replaces a vial of fluid into Eva's back and Eva regains consciousness, but Eva is frightened and hostile; when Lana tries to grab her, Eva pushes her, and Lana falls off the side of the cliff. Eva returns to \u00c1lex's house alone and faints into his arms when he answers the door. At night, \u00c1lex gets a call from David that Lana is in the hospital, and he and Eva drive over, arriving just minutes before Lana dies.\n\nEva tells Max in private that she pushed Lana, and Max relays this to \u00c1lex. Julia visits \u00c1lex and tells him that Lana finished the SI-9 project after he left, but Eva could not pass the security test and thus wasn't considered safe enough to use; despite this, Lana insisted on keeping Eva, and Julia allowed it. Julia tells \u00c1lex that Eva cannot continue to live, and though \u00c1lex insists that she's only a girl, Julia reminds him that she killed Lana. Julia offers to \"kill\" Eva, but \u00c1lex tells her that he will do it.\n\n\u00c1lex watches Eva skate one last time with Max, and he and David embrace in the shared loss of Lana. That night, \u00c1lex takes Eva to his room, preparing to dismantle her; Eva asks \u00c1lex to make sure that she doesn't do anything \"evil\" again, but quickly realizes that he can't fix her. \u00c1lex holds the frightened Eva tightly before saying the kill phrase, which ends her programming immediately. \u00c1lex looks on at the dead Eva with tears as the camera pans back, showing the \"bulbs\" of Eva's emotional memory shattering. The film ends with Eva narrating her dying dream\u2014what she \"sees,\" in response to the kill phrase: playing on a beach forever, with \u00c1lex and Lana.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as \u00c1lex, the robot engineer.\n* [[Marta Etura]] as Lana, a former lover of \u00c1lex.\n* [[Llu\u00eds Homar]] as Max, robotic butler.\n* [[Alberto Ammann]] as David, \u00c1lex's brother and Lana's lover.\n* Claudia Vega as Eva, Lana's child.\n* [[Anne Canovas]] as Julia, head of the robotics program.\n\n==Shooting==\n===Atmosphere===\nThe film combines computer generated imagery of robots and engineering devices and retro clothing and props like a [[Saab 900]] car.\n\n===Locations===\n[[File:La chaux de fond1-ag.jpg|thumb|La Chaux-de-Fonds in winter.]]\nThe film was shot<ref name=\"Higuera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lahiguera.net/cinemania/pelicula/5335/comentario.php|title=Eva, comentario sobre la pel\u00edcula|website=Lahiguera.net|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref> in the [[province of Barcelona]] (interior scenes); [[Panticosa]] in Huesca; [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], Switzerland; and [[Tenerife]] (the final scene).\n\n==Release==\n''Eva'' was first screened out of competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]], on 7 September 2011.<ref name=\"venice\">{{cite news|url=http://www.labiennale.org/it/cinema/archivio/mostra-68/film/sel-uff/fuori-concorso/eva.html?back=true |title=Fuori Concorso: Eva \u2013 Kike Ma\u00edllo |accessdate=1 March 2012 |language=Italian |work=[[Venice International Film Festival]] |date=31 August 2011}}</ref> Subsequently, it opened the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on 6 October 2011.<ref name=\"sitges\">{{cite news|url=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/film/?id=10001921 |title=EVA |work=[[Sitges Film Festival]] |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> The film had its theatrical release in Spain on 28 October.
