Thurgood, a janitor at a medical lab, orders some \n[[cannabis (drug)|weed]] from Samson, the famous local dealer, and the four smoke it. When Kenny, a gentle kindergarten teacher, is out on a munchie run, he is arrested for accidentally killing a diabetic police horse by feeding it junk food. His friends are forced to raise $1&nbsp;million to bail him out before the other prisoners take advantage of his gentle nature. While visiting Kenny in prison, Thurgood meets Mary Jane and pursues a romantic relationship, which is strained by his having to conceal his marijuana smoking from her, as she is adamantly anti-drug.\n\nThurgood gets asked one day by a scientist at the lab to get a pound of cannabis from storage and Thurgood freaks out when he realizes what the scientist had him get. The grateful scientist thanks Thurgood for the good deed by giving him some free weed. Thurgood brings it home and the three friends get high. Scarface gets the idea to have Thurgood steal medical marijuana from his work so that the three of them can sell it to raise money to free Kenny.\n\nWhen the success of the friends' marijuana business grows enough to raise the ire of local drug lord Samson Simpson, Samson extorts them for $20,000 a week, while Mary Jane dumps Thurgood when she finds out he is dealing drugs. The friends plan a robbery of the medical laboratory to increase their earnings enough to both fend off Samson and free Kenny, but are arrested when they try to execute the plan.\n\nThurgood strikes a deal with the police to wear a wire to a meeting with Samson in exchange for freeing Kenny and dropping the charges against him and his friends. They meet with Samson, but their plan is exposed when the police detectives fail to arrive as backup since they are high. However, Thurgood and his friends are able to take out Samson's henchwomen, and Samson is taken out by the ghost of [[Jerry Garcia]]. The police detectives arrive soon after to arrest Samson and his henchwomen, while Thurgood and friends are released from police custody. Thurgood meets with Mary Jane to tell her he is giving up marijuana and wants to get back together. The film ends with their reuniting.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Thurgood Jenkins/Sir Smoke-a-Lot\n** Kevin Duhaney as Young Thurgood\n* [[Jim Breuer]] as Brian\n** James Cooper as Young Brian\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Kenny Davis\n** Michael Colton as Young Kenny\n* [[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo D\u00edaz]] as Scarface\n** Matthew Raposo as Young Scarface\n* [[Rachel True]] as Mary Jane Potman\n* [[Tommy Chong]] as Squirrel Master\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as Samson Simpson\n* [[Laura Silverman]] as Jan\n* [[R.
