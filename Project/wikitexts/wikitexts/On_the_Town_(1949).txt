It is an adaptation of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage [[On the Town (musical)|musical of the same name]] produced in 1944 (which itself is an adaptation of the [[Jerome Robbins]] ballet entitled ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' which was also produced in 1944),<ref name=\"Turner Classic Movies\">{{cite web|url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/355/On-the-Town/notes.html |title=Turner Classic Movies |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220231053/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/355/On-the-Town/notes.html |archive-date=2018-12-20 }}</ref> although many changes in script and score were made from the original stage version; for instance, most of Bernstein's score was dropped in favor of new songs by Edens, who disliked the majority of  Bernstein's music for being too complex and too operatic for film audiences.  This caused Bernstein to boycott the film.\n\nThe film was directed by [[Gene Kelly]], who also choreographed, and [[Stanley Donen]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and stars Kelly, [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Betty Garrett]], and [[Ann Miller]], and features [[Jules Munshin]] and [[Vera-Ellen]]. It was a product of the [[Arthur Freed]] unit at [[MGM]], and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in [[New York City]], including at [[Columbus Circle]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].\n\nThe film was an immediate success and won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music\u2014Scoring of a Musical Picture]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Comden and Green won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical.\n\nIn 2006, the film ranked No. 19 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of Best Musicals]]. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the-shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry|title = 'Jurassic Park,' 'The Shining,' and 23 Other Movies Added to National Film Registry|newspaper = NPR|date = December 12, 2018|last1 = Kimmelman|first1 = Ruben}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThree US Navy sailors&nbsp;&ndash; Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie&nbsp;&ndash; begin their shore leave, excited for their 24 hours in New York (\"[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]\"). While riding the [[New York City Subway|subway]], Gabey falls in love with the picture of the monthly \"Miss Turnstiles,\" whose name is Ivy Smith. By chance, she's in the next subway station and Gabey gets to pose in a promotional photo of her. After she catches the next train, Gabey vows to find her again. The sailors race around New York in a frenzied search, hoping to still have time to sightsee and take dates out to the clubs.\n\nAlong the way they are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver. Claire claims that she's found her passionate \"Prehistoric Man\" in Ozzie at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Anthropological History]]. While dancing, Ozzie accidentally knocks over a dinosaur skeleton and the group flees the museum. They decide to split up in search of Ivy, during which Hildy invites Chip to \"Come Up to My Place.\"\n\nFinally locating Ivy in a dance class, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \"Main Street\" in a studio in [[Carnegie Hall|Symphonic Hall]]. He doesn't realize that she is from the same small town since she pretends to be a native New Yorker. Meanwhile, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy and tells her \"You're Awful\"&nbsp;&ndash; that is, awful nice to be with. During the evening, the three couples meet at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to celebrate a night \"On the Town.\"\n\nThe couples go to several clubs for a good time. Gabey is still convinced Ivy is a genuine celebrity, and so Hildy and Claire bribe a waiter to make a fuss in order to keep up the ruse. When an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a [[American burlesque|cooch dancer]], Gabey is despondent. Hildy has her annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler fill in as Gabey's date, but he can't be consoled. The friends lift his spirits by singing \"You Can Count on Me.\" Since Lucy has a bad cold, Gabey drops her off at her apartment and apologizes for having been a lack-luster date.\n\nThe group eventually reunites with Ivy at [[Coney Island]]. Despite her lies being revealed, Gabey doesn't care and is just happy to have found her. Unfortunately, the group has been pursued by police for the dinosaur incident. The three men are taken back to their ship and the women barely talk their way out of a night in jail. Moved by their speeches, the police escort them to the ship just as the sailors' 24-hour shore leave ends. Although their future is uncertain, each couple shares one last kiss on the pier as a new batch of sailors heads out into the city for their leave (\"New York, New York\" reprise).\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Gabey\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Chip\n* [[Betty Garrett]] as Brunhilde \"Hildy\" Esterhazy\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Claire Huddesen\n* [[Jules Munshin]] as Ozzie\n* [[Vera-Ellen]] as Ivy Smith\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Florence Bates]] as Madame Dilyovska\n* [[Alice Pearce]] as Lucy Shmeeler\n* George Meader as Professor\n* [[Hans Conried]] as Fran\u00e7ois (head waiter) (uncredited)\n* [[Murray Alper]] as Cab owner (uncredited)\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* [[Carol Haney]], Gene Kelly's assistant, performed with Kelly in the ''Day in New York'' ballet sequence, but was not credited.
