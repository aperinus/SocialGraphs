A sequel to the 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'', it was released on December 10, 1982.\n\nThe team who wrote and directed the original ''Airplane!'' ([[Jim Abrahams]], [[David Zucker (director)|David Zucker]], and [[Jerry Zucker]]) had no involvement with this sequel. Paramount, having faced a similar situation with ''[[Grease 2]]'' earlier in that year, hired Finkleman, who wrote ''Grease 2'', to write and direct ''Airplane II'' as well.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the near future, the Moon has been colonized and supports a station on its surface. A lunar shuttle known as ''Mayflower One'' is being rushed to launch from [[Houston]]. The head of the ground crew, The Sarge, does not like what is occurring, but he defers to airline management.\n\nOn the flight crew are Captain Clarence Oveur, navigator/co-pilot Unger, and first officer/flight engineer Dunn. Also on board is computer officer Elaine Dickinson. Having dumped Ted Striker, Elaine is now engaged to Simon Kurtz, a member of the flight crew, and Ted has been [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to an [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]]. He was declared [[Competence (law)|mentally incompetent]] in a lawsuit following a test flight that Ted piloted and in which the lunar shuttle crashed. Ted believes the lawsuit was meant to silence him regarding dangerous safety issues related to the lunar shuttle. He is again haunted by his actions in \"The War\" \u2013 specifically the loss of his entire squadron above \"Macho Grande\" \u2013 resulting in a [[relapse]] of his \"drinking problem\". When Ted learns of the lunar shuttle's upcoming launch, he escapes the asylum and buys a ticket for the flight.\n\nDuring the flight, ''Mayflower One'' suffers a short circuit, causing the [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] computer, ROK, to go insane and send the ship toward the [[Sun]]. Unger and Dunn try to deactivate the computer, but are blown out of an [[airlock]]. Oveur tries to stop ROK, but the computer gasses him. Simon abandons Elaine and leaves in the sole escape pod. Once again, Ted is called upon to save the day, but he must first figure out how to wrest control of the shuttle from the computer. [[Air traffic control]]ler Steve McCroskey reveals that passenger Joe Seluchi had boarded with a bomb in a briefcase, intent on committing suicide to provide an insurance payout for his wife. Ted manages to wrestle the bomb from Joe, uses it to blow up ROK, and sets course for the Moon as originally intended.\n\nThe computer's destruction results in collateral damage to the shuttle; the flight is not yet out of danger. En route to the Moon, flight control shifts to a lunar base under the command of Commander Buck Murdock. Contemptuous of Ted because of Macho Grande, he nonetheless agrees to help and they manage to land the craft safely on the Moon. Ted and Elaine fall back in love and are married at the end. After the wedding, Joe looks into the cockpit and asks for his briefcase back.\n\nA post credit message \u2013 \"Coming From Paramount Pictures: ''Airplane III''\" \u2013 inspires Murdock to remark, \"That's exactly what they'll be expecting us to do!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Hays]] as Ted Striker\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Elaine Dickinson\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Steve McCroskey\n* [[Chad Everett]] as Simon Kurtz\n* [[Peter Graves]] as Captain Clarence Oveur\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Bud Kruger\n* [[John Dehner]] as The Commissioner\n* [[Chuck Connors]] as The Sarge\n* [[Richard Jaeckel]] as Controller #2\n* [[Stephen Stucker]] as Jacobs / Courtroom Clerk\n* [[Kent McCord]] as Unger\n* James A.
