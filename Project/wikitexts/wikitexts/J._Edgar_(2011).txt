Edgar''''' is a 2011 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]]  based on the career of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], directed, produced and scored by [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmofilia.com/2010/03/15/clint-eastwood-to-direct-j-edgar-hoover-biopic |title=Clint Eastwood to Direct J. Edgar Hoover Biopic |author=Ford, Alan |date=2010-03-15 |work=FilmoFilia.com |access-date=2010-12-26}}</ref> Written by [[Dustin Lance Black]], the film focuses on Hoover's life from the 1919 [[Palmer Raids]] onward. The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in the title role, [[Armie Hammer]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Josh Lucas]], and [[Judi Dench]]. It marked [[Adam Driver]]'s film debut.\n\n''J. Edgar'' opened the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Fest 2011 in [[Los Angeles]] on November 3, 2011, and had its [[limited release]] on November 9, 2011 followed by [[wide release]] on November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, although DiCaprio's performance was widely praised, and it grossed $84 million worldwide. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2011, while DiCaprio earned a nomination for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award]] and both he and Hammer earned [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nods.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film uses a [[nonlinear narrative]], alternating between [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s role in establishing the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and his later years trying to safeguard it against perceived threats. As a [[frame story]], the aging Hoover narrates the events of the Bureau's early years to a series of agents he has assigned to [[ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] a book about it.\n\nIn 1919, Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] survives [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|an assassination attempt by anarchists]] and assigns [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] employee Hoover to a division dedicated to purging radicals. [[Helen Gandy]] rejects Hoover's awkward advances, but becomes his personal secretary and confidant. By arranging to make the anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] eligible for deportation, Hoover creates legal precedent to deport numerous other radicals. Following the [[Palmer Raids]], Palmer loses his job and his successor, [[Harlan F. Stone]], appoints Hoover as director of the department's Bureau of Investigation. Hoover has Gandy create a confidential file in which he collects incriminating information on people in power.\n\nWith the [[First Red Scare]] over, Hoover focuses the Bureau on fighting gangsters. When the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] captures national attention in 1932, he urges passage of the [[Federal Kidnapping Act]], increasing the Bureau's power. He establishes the [[FBI Laboratory]], applying [[forensic science]] techniques to the investigation, and has the registration numbers on the ransom bills monitored. Though Charles Lindbergh Jr. is found dead, these techniques lead to the arrest and conviction of [[Richard Hauptmann|Bruno Richard Hauptmann]] for the crime.\n\nWell into adulthood, Hoover continues to live with his mother, who is his moral guide. He hires [[Clyde Tolson]] to the Bureau in 1930; the two develop a close personal relationship, and Hoover promotes Tolson to Associate Director. When Hoover confesses to his mother that he is uncomfortable in romantic situations with women, she says she would rather he be dead than [[gay]]. When Tolson tells Hoover that he loves him, Hoover panics and claims that he wants to marry actress [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Tolson becomes infuriated and the two fight, culminating in Tolson kissing Hoover and threatening to end their association if Hoover ever talks about another woman again. Hoover's mother dies, and he is grief-stricken.\n\nFollowing an embarrassing line of questioning by [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] chair [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]] in 1933, Hoover becomes increasingly vengeful against those who challenge his reputation and the Bureau's. He uses [[covert listening device]]s to collect compromising information which he uses to blackmail key political figures over the years, including President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], protecting his position and increasing the Bureau's power. He starts [[COINTELPRO|an illegal counterintelligence program]] to fight what he perceives as a new wave of radicals, culminating in his unsuccessful attempt to blackmail [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] into declining the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1964 via the [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter]].\n\nTolson suffers a [[stroke]], and Hoover's strength declines with age. Fearing that President [[Richard Nixon]] will acquire his confidential files and use them to ruin the FBI's reputation, he asks Gandy to keep them out of Nixon's hands. Tolson urges Hoover to retire and accuses him of exaggerating his involvement with key events in the Bureau's history. Hoover admits his feelings for Tolson before dying at home. Gandy destroys Hoover's files before Nixon's men can seize them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[J.
