David spends his life savings on high-quality bedsheets to resell to retirement homes, but the venture fails. David runs into his old friend [[Efraim Diveroli]], who has formed his own company, AEY Inc., selling arms to the US government for the ongoing [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]]. Iz informs David she is pregnant, and Efraim offers him a job at AEY; although David and Iz vehemently oppose the war, David joins AEY and lies to Iz.\n\nEfraim explains that military equipment orders are posted on a public website, and their job is to bid for small orders ignored by larger contractors but still worth millions. Local businessman Ralph Slutzky provides them funding, under the false belief that AEY only sells arms to protect [[Israel]]. David and Efraim land a contract to provide several thousand [[Beretta]] pistols to the Iraqi Police in [[Baghdad]], but an Italian embargo blocks the shipment, which is waylaid in [[Jordan]]. Failing to deliver the cargo as promised would mean that AEY would be blacklisted from any future contracts. Meanwhile, Iz overhears the true nature of David's business.\n\nDavid and Efraim fly to Jordan, bribing locals to release the shipment, and are provided with a driver to transport them and the shipment into Iraq. The trio drives through the night, bribing a border patrol and evading armed insurgents, and arrive at the military base, where Captain Santos is impressed that they survived the [[Triangle of Death (Iraq)|Triangle of Death]]; the two are paid handsomely.\n\nAEY secures larger and more lucrative deals, expanding their operation, and David's daughter Ella is born, while Efraim grows more unstable and untrustworthy. The company has a chance at \"The Afghan deal\", their biggest yet: the US government posts a massive order worth $300 million, which requires 100 million rounds of [[7.62\u00d739mm|AK-47 ammunition]] and would net a $100 million profit. Facing a global shortage of [[AK-47]] ammunition, the duo encounters legendary arms dealer Henry Girard, who has access to massive unused weapon depots in [[Albania]]. Needing to dispose of these arsenals\u2014including over 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition\u2014in accordance with [[NATO]] treaties, and unable to deal directly with the US, Girard offers to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, despite David's discomfort at working with a man on a terrorist watchlist.\n\nThe two go to [[Albania]] to test the ammunition and win the contract, though Efraim learns they severely underbid their competitors. Iz, frustrated with David's lies, leaves to live with her mother. Preparing the shipment in Albania, David discovers virtually all the rounds are Chinese-made and illegal due to a US [[embargo]]; to conceal this, Efraim has the ammunition repackaged. Learning Henry has charged them a 400% markup, Efraim plans to cut him out of the deal, ignoring David's protests and destroying the only copy of his partnership contract with David.\n\nHenry retaliates by having David kidnapped, beaten, and threatened at gunpoint; David learns Efraim did not pay Enver, the Albanian handling the repackaging, the 100,000 USD repackaging fee. He even learns that his Albanian driver, Bashkim, went missing and starts to wonder if he has been killed.\n\nReturning to Miami, David quits AEY and demands the money he is owed, but Efraim refuses. David returns to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to move back in with him, telling her the truth about AEY. Weeks later, Efraim and Ralph offer David a paltry severance package, and David threatens Efraim with evidence of his falsified company documents. Shortly after, David and Efraim are arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], who had been contacted by the disgruntled Enver. The FBI had previously arrested Ralph, who wore a wire in an incriminating meeting with David and Efraim. Efraim is sentenced to four years in prison for numerous crimes related to conspiracy and fraud on the Afghan deal, while David pleads guilty and gets seven months' house arrest for his cooperation.\n\nMonths later, Henry apologizes to David for abducting him in Albania and shares his appreciation for not being turned in to the FBI. David asks what has happened to Bashkim, the Albanian driver, but Henry does not answer, instead offering David a briefcase of money in exchange for \"no more questions.\" The movie ends, leaving David's decision unclear.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as [[Efraim Diveroli]]\n* [[Miles Teller]] as [[David Packouz]]\n* [[Ana de Armas]] as Iz\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Henry Girard (based on  [[Br\u00fcgger & Thomet|Heinrich Thomet]])\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Ralph Slutzky\n* [[Patrick St. Esprit]] as Captain Phillip Santos\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as Marlboro\n* [[JB Blanc]] as Bashkim\n* [[Gabriel Spahiu]] as Enver\n* [[Barry Livingston]] as Army Bureaucrat\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as Hilldale Home Manager\n* [[Shashank Srini Seethula]] as Singer at Hilldale Home\n* [[Koushik Srini Seethula]] as Vegas X Supplier\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nInitially, [[Jesse Eisenberg]] and [[Shia LaBeouf]] were set to star in the film;<ref name=Jhill>{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=Miles Teller Eyed to Join Jonah Hill in Todd Phillips' 'Arms and the Dudes'|url=https://www.thewrap.com/miles-teller-eyed-to-join-jonah-hill-in-todd-phillips-arms-and-the-dudes-exclusive/|access-date=December 4, 2014|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|date=December 3, 2014}}</ref> however, Jonah Hill and Miles Teller were eventually cast.<ref name=HillCast>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Jonah Hill to Star in Crime Comedy 'Arms and the Dudes'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonah-hill-star-crime-comedy-753760|access-date=December 4, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 3, 2014|archive-date=June 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143414/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jonah-hill-star-crime-comedy-753760|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=TellerCast>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title='Whiplash' Star Miles Teller Joins Jonah Hill In 'Arms And The Dudes'|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/miles-teller-arms-and-the-dudes-whiplash-jonah-hill-1201372328/|access-date=February 16, 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 12, 2015|archive-date=February 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209195826/https://deadline.com/2015/02/miles-teller-arms-and-the-dudes-whiplash-jonah-hill-1201372328/|url-status=live}}</ref> Further casting was announced in early 2015, with [[Ana de Armas]] joining in February,<ref name=ArmasCast>{{cite news|last1=Hipes|first1=Patrick|title=Ana De Armas Joins Dudes In 'Arms And The Dudes'|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/ana-de-armas-arms-and-the-dudes-casting-1201373068/|access-date=February 16, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> and [[JB Blanc]] joining in March.<ref name=BlancCast>{{cite news|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=IFC Films Locks Up 'Stanford Prison Experiment';
