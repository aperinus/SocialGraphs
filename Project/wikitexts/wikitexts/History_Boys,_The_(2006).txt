It was directed by [[Nicholas Hytner]], who directed the original production at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London, and features the original cast of the play.\n\nThe school scenes were filmed in [[Watford]] in two schools, [[Watford Grammar School for Boys]] and [[Watford Grammar School for Girls]]. The film uses the uniform of [[Watford Grammar School for Boys|Watford Boys]]. Locations in [[Elland]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], are used to create the broader landscape of [[Sheffield]] in which the story is set.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2021}}\nIn a boys' [[grammar school]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1983, students Crowther, Posner, Dakin, Timms, Akthar, Lockwood, Scripps, and Rudge have recently obtained the school's highest-ever [[A-Level]] scores and are hoping to enter [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], by taking a seventh-term entrance exam in History. The General Studies teacher, known to staff and boys alike by his nickname \"Hector\", is much beloved, and works alongside their deputy head and regular History teacher, Mrs Lintott. The Headmaster, known by all as \"Felix\", appoints a temporary teacher, Tom Irwin, to help the boys. Irwin states that he was at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], when interviewed by the Headmaster. Prior to the entrance examinations, he says to Dakin that he was at Corpus ([[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]]). Dakin discovers on his interview day at Oxford that Irwin did not attend. Irwin is only a little older than his students but proves to be a bold and demanding teacher, and particularly difficult to impress.\n\nAs part of their General Studies, the class acts out scenes from romantic films and literature. At the conclusion of each class, Hector offers a lift to one of the students on his motorbike and it is generally known (and initially dismissed as a joke) that he touches them inappropriately on the ride. The only one he never takes along is Posner, a slight Jewish boy, who doesn't hide his infatuation with Dakin. Dakin, who characterises himself as an aspiring lecher, is currently pursuing an affair with the headmaster's secretary, Fiona. He is not displeased by Posner's attention, but finds himself increasingly interested in Irwin. Gradually, Dakin's quest to impress Irwin on an intellectual level evolves into a flirtatious, potentially sexual pursuit of his young teacher, who is visibly attracted to Dakin. Meanwhile, Hector's indiscretions are shockingly revealed and Felix instructs him to \"retire early\".\n\nThe boys continue their studies and all gain places at Oxford and Cambridge, including the dimwitted Rudge, with Posner winning a scholarship and Dakin an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] (although both Felix and Scripps later refer to it as a scholarship). On the day they gathered at school on receiving their results, Dakin calls out Irwin on his lie of attending Oxford, Irwin admits that he studied at Bristol and attended Oxford only for a teaching diploma, then Dakin asks him out for a drink, overtly revealing his sexual interest in him, much to Irwin's confusion and repressed enthusiasm. They agree to get together that very Sunday. Dakin then proceeds to the Headmaster's office and, by threatening to reveal Felix's own sexual harassment of Fiona, forces him to reinstate Hector.\n\nAs the boys prepare to leave the grammar school, Hector, revealing that he is staying at the school, agrees to give Dakin a ride home on the motorbike \"for old times' sake\". However, before they leave, the headmaster runs out and stops them, saying that Hector should not take one of the boys. He suggests that Hector take Irwin instead. Dakin gladly hands the helmet to him, and the screen fades to white as they drive off, the boys waving happily and laughing.\n\nA motorcycle accident occurs off-screen, and Hector is killed, although Irwin survives with a broken leg. Dakin (in voiceover) says that Irwin had never been on the back of a bike and so may have unbalanced Hector, causing the accident, and that he and Irwin never got a chance to meet that Sunday. The boys sing \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" at Hector's memorial service and the Headmaster gives a general speech. Mrs Lintott then turns and asks: \"Will they come to my funeral, I wonder?\" The school hall is shown with only the boys sitting and each recounts his life. Akthar is a headmaster, Crowther a magistrate, Timms a drug-taking dry-cleaning manager, and Dakin a tax lawyer. Lockwood, a junior army officer, was killed by friendly fire at the age of 28. Rudge is a builder, Scripps a journalist, and Irwin makes history TV programmes, though Mrs Lintott says they are more journalism. Posner is a teacher and takes the same approach that Hector did, save for the touching. The final shot shows the boys and teachers standing at the field trip lawn, with Hector's voice encouraging them to \"pass it on\".\n\n==Cast==\n;Staff:\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Douglas \"Hector\", English & General Studies teacher\n* [[Clive Merrison]] as Felix, the Headmaster and Geography teacher\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Mrs Dorothy Lintott, History teacher & Deputy Headteacher\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Irwin, a temporary History teacher who encourages pupils to dissent from generally accepted viewpoints.\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Mrs Hazel Bibby, Art and Art History teacher\n* [[Adrian Scarborough]] as Mr Stanley Wilkes, Physical Education teacher\n* [[Georgia Taylor]] as Fiona, school secretary\n\n;Students:\n* [[Samuel Anderson (actor)|Samuel Anderson]] as Christopher \"Chris\" Crowther\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as David Posner, a Jewish boy who believes that he may be gay.\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Stuart Dakin\n* [[James Corden]] as Anthony \"Tony\" Timms\n* [[Sacha Dhawan]] as Adi Akthar\n* [[Andrew Knott]] as James \"Jimmy\" Lockwood\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Peter Rudge\n* [[Jamie Parker]] as Donald \"Donnie\" Scripps\n\nThe majority of the main cast later appeared in Bennett's 2015 film ''[[The Lady in the Van]]'', with de la Tour in a prominent role and [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]] for Moore, Anderson, Barnett, Cooper, Corden, Dhawan, Knott, Tovey and Parker.
