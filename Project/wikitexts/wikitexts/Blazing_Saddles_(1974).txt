Le Petomane, a [[Yiddish]]-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] chief and \"a director\" in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili Von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]], and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself, appearing with his orchestra.\n\nThe film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing \"[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''.\n\nIn 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{Cite press release|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-06-234/films-added-to-national-film-registry-for-2006/2006-12-27/|title=Librarian of Congress Adds Home Movie, Silent Films and Hollywood Classics to Film Preservation List|agency=Library of Congress|date=December 27, 2006|access-date=April 23, 2020|archive-date=April 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412114840/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-06-234/films-added-to-national-film-registry-for-2006/2006-12-27/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the [[American frontier]] of 1874, a new railroad under construction will have to be rerouted through the town of Rock Ridge in order to avoid [[quicksand]]. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, conniving territorial attorney general Hedley Lamarr wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. [[Le Petomane]] appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a  black railroad worker about to be executed for assaulting Taggart. A black sheriff, Lamarr reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave Rock Ridge at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (Bart takes himself \"hostage\" to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid\", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. Bart subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, yet philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then outwits German seductress-for-hire Lili Von Shtupp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon release, Mongo vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad worksite and discover from Bart's best friend Charlie that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, but Jim outshoots them and forces their retreat. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, recruits an army of thugs, including common criminals, motorcycle gangsters, [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen, [[Nazis]], and [[Methodism|Methodists]].\n\nEast of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect copy of the town as a diversion. When Bart realizes it will not fool the villains, the townsfolk construct copies of themselves. Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway\", forcing the raiding party to send for change to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town and its population of dummies, which have been booby-trapped with dynamite. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs literally breaks the [[fourth wall]] and bursts onto a neighboring movie set where director Buddy Bizarre is filming a [[Busby Berkeley]]-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; into the studio commissary for a food fight; and spilling out of the [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. film lot]] onto the streets of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the cabbie to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]], which is showing the premiere of ''Blazing Saddles''. As he settles into his seat, he sees onscreen Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape and shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then enter the theater to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on because his work is done (and he is bored). Riding out of town, he finds Jim, still eating his popcorn, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". The two friends briefly ride into the desert before dismounting and boarding a [[limousine]], which drives off into the sunset.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|1=\n* [[Cleavon Little]] as Sheriff Bart\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Jim\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Taggart\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Hedley Lamarr\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Lili Von Shtupp\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as Governor Le Petomane / Indian Chief\n* [[Burton Gilliam]] as Lyle\n* [[Alex Karras]] as Mongo\n* [[David Huddleston]] as Olson Johnson\n* [[Liam Dunn]] as Rev.
