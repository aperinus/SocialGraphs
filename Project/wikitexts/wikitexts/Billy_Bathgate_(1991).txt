The film co-stars [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Steven Hill]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Bruce Willis]]. Although Billy is a fictional character, at least four of the other characters in the film were real people. The screenplay was adapted by British writer [[Tom Stoppard]] from [[E.L. Doctorow]]'s 1989 [[Billy Bathgate|novel of the same name]]. Doctorow distanced himself from the film for the extensive deviations from the book. It received negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing a mere $15.5 million against its $48 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Behan ([[Loren Dean]]) is a poor Irish American teenager from [[the Bronx]] in the 1920s. One day, he catches the attention of wealthy Jewish mobster [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]). Changing his last name to Bathgate after a local street, Billy goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a [[gofer]] for Schultz himself. Billy is present when Schultz personally commits two brutal murders: his trusted lieutenant, [[Abraham Weinberg|Bo Weinberg]] ([[Bruce Willis]]), who Schultz believes betrayed him after learning that Weinberg has been secretly meeting with rival bosses, is dumped in the water wearing [[cement shoes]], and his top enforcer, \"Big\" Julie Martin ([[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]]), is personally shot dead by Dutch for stealing $50,000 from the organization's accounts and defiantly stating that he's \"entitled\" to it. Despite this, Billy comes to see Schultz as a father figure and the mob as his chance to make it big.\n\nFacing criminal charges of tax evasion in a court in [[upstate New York]], Schultz brings his entourage, including Billy and his mistress Drew Preston ([[Nicole Kidman]]) (who was previously Bo's mistress), along as he temporarily moves into the local community. He successfully charms the residents, presenting himself as good natured and easygoing while doing many charitable acts. While Dutch is attending his trial, Billy is assigned to watch Drew. His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew. Realizing that Dutch intends to have Drew murdered for cheating on him, Billy is able to get in contact with her real husband Harvey ([[Xander Berkeley]]), who manages to take Drew home and out of harm's way before Schultz's men can make their move.\n\nDespite being acquitted by a sympathetic jury, Dutch is soon indicted again. After running into difficulties paying for his legal defense, he decides to have state prosecutor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] assassinated; this request is denied by the mob's governing authority, the [[The Commission (American Mafia)|Commission]], out of fear that killing Dewey will bring too much heat onto the Mafia. Schultz sends Billy to bribe a member of the Commission, but the bribe is rejected. When Billy returns with the bad news, Schultz angrily blames him for not doing enough and Billy is fired by Schultz's right-hand man, Otto Berman ([[Steven Hill]]), who lets him keep the bribe money as a gift. As Billy leaves, he is ambushed and beaten by gangsters working for Commission head [[Lucky Luciano]] ([[Stanley Tucci]]) and is then forced to watch as Luciano's men storm the restaurant where Dutch is waiting; Dutch, Berman, and the two men accompanying them are swiftly gunned down. Billy is taken to meet Luciano, who tells him that he knows where Billy's family lives if he ever speaks of what happened to Dutch, before letting him go.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Dutch Schultz|Arthur \"Dutch Schultz\" Flegenheimer]]\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Drew Preston\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Billy \"Bathgate\" Behan\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[Bo Weinberg]]\n* [[Steven Hill]] as [[Otto Berman]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Lucky Luciano|Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano]]\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Jules \"Big Julie\" Martin\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Irving Nitzberg\n* [[John Costelloe (actor)|John Costelloe]] as [[Lulu Rosenkrantz|Bernard \"Lulu\" Rosenkrantz]]\n* Billy Jaye as Mickey Marks \n* Timothy Jerome as [[Dixie Davis]]\n* Stephen Joyce as [[James Joseph Hines]]\n* [[Robert F.
