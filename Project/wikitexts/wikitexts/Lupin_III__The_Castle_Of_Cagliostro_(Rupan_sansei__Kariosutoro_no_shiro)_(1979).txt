It is the second feature film featuring [[Monkey Punch]]'s master thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], from his [[manga]] series ''[[Lupin III]]''.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite web |last=Maslin |first=Janet|author-link=Janet Maslin |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=A Wolf, A Princess, A Castle In the Alps |date=3 July 1992 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7D9143AF930A35754C0A964958260|access-date=10 August 2013|archive-date=29 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029172113/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/03/movies/review-film-a-wolf-a-princess-a-castle-in-the-alps.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was directed by Miyazaki after having previously worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]] and [[Telecom Animation Film]] and directing several television shows, including ''[[Lupin the Third Part I]]''.\n\n''The Castle of Cagliostro'' follows [[gentleman thief]] [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], who successfully robs a casino \u2013 only to find the money to be [[counterfeit]]. He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source of the bills, and attempts to save the runaway Princess Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men; the Count plans to marry Clarisse in order to cement his power and recover the fabled ancient treasure of Cagliostro, requiring Clarisse's ancestral ring. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. After becoming trapped in the dungeon under the castle, Lupin and Zenigata form a pact to escape and foil the Count's counterfeit operation and save Clarisse from her forced marriage to the Count.\n\nThe original theatrical release in Japan occurred on 15 December 1979. In North America, it was screened at various festivals in the early 1980s, while a heavily edited and shortened version became available in the form of an arcade [[laserdisc video game]], ''[[Cliff Hanger (video game)|Cliff Hanger]]'' (1983), combined with footage from the previous Lupin film ''[[Mystery of Mamo]]'' (1978). ''Castle of Cagliostro'' eventually made its American theatrical debut on 3 April 1991, with the home release following in October 1992. This first theatrical dub was produced by [[Streamline Pictures]] and released on home video the following year. A new dubbed version was produced by [[Manga Entertainment]] in 2000 and has had several releases.\n\nDespite initially underperforming at the box office, ''The Castle of Cagliostro'' has garnered high praise, with critics and historians noting the film's influence on Miyazaki's later works, and has since become the most popular and well-regarded entry in the entire ''Lupin III'' franchise. However, some have disapproved of its depiction of Lupin as a gallant hero instead of his original persona as a ruthless criminal. The film has served as a major influence on animators and directors worldwide, such as [[Pixar]] director [[John Lasseter]] and several [[Disney]] films, including titles that influenced the [[Disney Renaissance]]. The Japanese [[computer animated]] film ''[[Lupin III: The First]]'' (2019) also has a plot structure loosely modelled after ''The Castle of Cagliostro''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nMaster thief [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] and his colleague, [[Daisuke Jigen]], flee the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] with huge quantities of stolen money, but as they celebrate their latest heist, Lupin recognizes the bills as distinctively high-quality counterfeits.{{efn|In the Japanese dialogue, the counterfeit bills are called {{nihongo|\"G\u014dto-satsu\"|\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u672d}}, which is written as \"Ghoto bills\" in the heavily-simplified TMS subtitled version. The Streamline dub, which used TMS' subtitles as its primary translation source, explains that \"Ghoto\" was the name of the person responsible for the creation of Cagliostro's counterfeiting ring. The Animaze/Manga dub interprets \"G\u014dto\" as a [[transliteration]] of [[goat]] \u2013 the Japanese word for which is {{nihongo|\"yagi\"|\u30e4\u30ae}} \u2013 in part due to the abundant goat and ram-related imagery present in the film, and thus refers to the counterfeits as \"Goat bills\". However, in the Japanese version, Lupin describes the writing on Clarisse's ring as being {{nihongo|\"G\u014dto-moji\"|\u30b4\u30fc\u30c8\u6587\u5b57}}, or Gothic characters, which implies that the houses of Cagliostro are descended from the ancient [[Goths]]. The Animaze/Manga dub describes the writing as \"[[Capra (genus)|Capran]]\", furthering the film's symbolic use of goats. When preparing the English subtitles for [[Discotek Media]]'s DVD and Blu-ray, translators Shoko Oono and Reed Nelson chose to name the counterfeits \"Gothic bills\" instead of \"Goat bills\".<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\" /><ref name=\"DVD Translation Notes\">{{cite video |title=The Castle of Cagliostro (Translation Notes) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Discotek Media]] |location=\tAltamonte Springs, Florida |date=1979}}</ref>}} Deciding to seek out the source, they head to the [[Grand Duchy]] of Cagliostro, the alleged wellspring of the counterfeits.\n\nShortly after arriving, the two get passed by a young woman being chased by a group of armed thugs. They rescue the young woman, but in the ensuing mayhem Lupin is knocked unconscious and the woman gets captured, but she leaves him a signet ring. After seeing the ring, Lupin recognizes the woman as Clarisse, the princess of Cagliostro, who will soon be married to Count Cagliostro, the country's regent. The Count's [[arranged marriage]] will cement his power and recover the fabled ancient treasure of Cagliostro, for which he needs both his and Clarisse's ancestral rings.\n\nThe next night, a squad of assassins attack Lupin and Jigen at their inn, but they escape. Lupin leaves his calling card on the back of Jodot, the Count's butler and chief assassin, announcing he is going to steal Clarisse. Lupin summons [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] and tips off his longtime pursuer, Inspector [[Koichi Zenigata]], to his whereabouts to provide a distraction. Lupin disguises himself as Zenigata and makes his way into the castle, while the real Zenigata ends up trapped in the castle's catacombs. After meeting his on-off lover [[Fujiko Mine]] posing as Clarisse's lady-in-waiting, Lupin makes his way to Clarisse and returns her ring, vowing to help her to escape. Before he can act, the Count drops Lupin down a trapdoor into the catacombs. Lupin mocks the Count through the ring he gave to Clarisse \u2013 a fake containing a transmitter \u2013 and the Count sends three assassins to retrieve the real ring.\n\nLupin encounters Zenigata, and they form a pact to help each other escape. After overpowering the assassins, they escape into a room full of printing presses, the source of the counterfeits which Cagliostro has used throughout history to form a global shadow empire. Zenigata wants to collect evidence, but Lupin points out they must escape the castle first. They start a fire as a distraction and steal the Count's [[autogyro]], but as they try rescuing Clarisse, Lupin is seriously wounded. Clarisse offers the ring to the Count in exchange for Lupin's life, but after securing the ring, the Count's attempt at betrayal is foiled when Fujiko's actions allow her, Lupin, and Zenigata to flee. As Lupin recovers from his injuries, Zenigata tries convincing his superiors at [[Interpol]] to prosecute the Count for counterfeiting, but fearing political repercussions, they halt the investigation and remove him from the case. Lupin intends to stop the wedding and rescue the princess, revealing to his companions that ten years earlier she had saved his life during his unsuccessful first attempt to find the treasure of Cagliostro. Fujiko tips off Lupin on a way to sneak into the castle, and forms a plan with Zenigata to publicly reveal the counterfeiting operation under the cover of pursuing Lupin.\n\nThe wedding with a drugged Clarisse appears to go as planned, until Lupin disrupts the ceremony and, despite the Count's precautions, makes off with Clarisse and the Count's rings. To expose the Count's operations, Zenigata leads Fujiko, posing as a television reporter, to the Count's counterfeiting facility. After the Count corners Lupin and Clarisse on the clock tower's face, Lupin attempts to trade the rings for Clarisse\u2019s life, but the Count betrays him, and Lupin and Clarisse fall into the castle's lake. After using the rings on a secret mechanism built into the tower, the Count is crushed to death by the converging clock arms. Lupin and Clarisse watch as the mechanism drains the lake to reveal exquisite ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins \u2014 the true treasure of Cagliostro. Clarisse explains that she doesn\u2019t want Lupin to go, even expressing her readiness to become a thief like him, but Lupin gently rejects her, and he and his friends bid farewell to Clarisse, now the rightful ruler of Cagliostro. With Zenigata pursuing them again (for the crime of \"stealing Clarisse's heart\") and Fujiko fleeing with the [[printing plate|plates]] from the printing presses, Lupin and the gang take their leave of Cagliostro.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" | English\n|-\n! <small>[[Studiopolis|Screenmusic Studios]]/[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]] (1992)</small>\n! <small>[[Animaze|Animaze.. iNC]]/[[Manga Entertainment|Manga]] (2000)</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Yasuo Yamada]]\n!Wolf\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[David Hayter]]\n|-\n| [[Bob Bergen]]\n|-\n!

The title character, [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]], was inspired by (and is claimed in the series to be the grandson of) [[Maurice Leblanc]]'s fictional character [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], a gallant and famous outlaw able to outsmart even [[Sherlock Holmes]].<ref name=dc /> Lupin III is a [[gentleman thief]] and announces his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of the desired items. The manga's popularity led to two [[anime]] series, titled ''[[Lupin The Third Part I|Lupin III]]'' and ''[[Lupin III Part II]]''.<ref name=dc /> The first film, ''[[The Mystery of Mamo]]'', was released on 16 December 1978. ''Cagliostro'' followed the year later following the financial success of that film. This is marked as the first feature-length film to be directed by Miyazaki, who had previously co-directed episodes of the first Lupin anime series with [[Isao Takahata]] and the two directors along with  [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] would give birth to [[Studio Ghibli]] in 1985. He was also a writer and director of two episodes in the second series under the pseudonym \"Telecom\", both produced a year after ''Cagliostro''.<ref name=dc /> In works other than ''Castle of Cagliostro'' and the series episodes directed by Miyazaki and Takahata, Lupin III is portrayed as a scheming and lecherous thief, sometimes supported by his former enemies Jigen and Goemon. Miyazaki's film conflicts with the typical behavior and personality of the characters, a change that has been described as Lupin \"growing up\".<ref name=dc /><ref name=om />\n\n''Castle of Cagliostro'' marked Miyazaki's debut as a theatrical movie director, but he also was a writer, a designer, and a storyboardist on the movie.<ref name=\"om\">{{cite web |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx |title=The Castle of Cagliostro Hayao Miyazaki's First (And Most Enjoyable) Movie |publisher=Otaku USA Magazine |date=9 March 2012 | access-date=27 August 2013 |author=Surat, Daryl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018154933/http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro_4553.aspx | archive-date=18 October 2014 | url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nThe production for the film began in May 1979 with the writing of the story and storyboarding for the film.<ref name=\"hm\" /> Miyazaki began by drawing a bird's eye view of the setting before creating the story to completion.

Dani Cavallaro highlights the signature details of Miyazaki's style and form being displayed in this work and how it impacts the portrayal of the story.<ref name=dc /> Cagliostro, the country and setting, is depicted in meticulous detail and unconstrained by limitations of architecture, geography and culture, which can be described as \"''akogare no Paris''\" (Paris of our dreams), which is a fantastical view of Europe through Eastern eyes. The use of unexpected and unique camera angles and attention to individual movement of the characters are distinctive signatures of Miyazaki's style, including the opening heist scene which provides characterization and spirit to understanding the character of Lupin.<ref name=dc /> The changes made to the portrayal of the cast, depicting a heroic and selfless Lupin, a friendly Jigen, funny Goemon, and un-sexualized Fujiko, were initially not well received by fans.
