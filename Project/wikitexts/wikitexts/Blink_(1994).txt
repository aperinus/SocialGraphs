Director [[Michael Apted]] was nominated for a Crystal Globe award for the film at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], and screenwriter [[Dana Stevens (screenwriter)|Dana Stevens]] was nominated for Best Motion Picture at the [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]]s. [[Emmy Award]]-winning actress [[Laurie Metcalf]] also had a role in the film. [[Chicago]] rock band [[The Drovers]] played a support role as themselves, contributing three songs to the soundtrack. Stowe's character, Emma, is a fiddler in the group. Some scenes were filmed in Chicago, [[Illinois]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=February 2013}}\nEmma Brody is a young musician who has been [[blindness|blind]] for 20 years. New surgery techniques restore her vision but initially cause \"vision flashes\" that leave her uncertain about what she sees. One night, she is awakened by a noise in the apartment above. Peeking out her door, she \"sees\" a figure descending the stairs. She contacts the police, worried that her neighbor has been murdered, but she, (and the police) are unsure whether it was just her new vision deceiving her. The killer then begins to [[stalking|stalk]] Emma.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Actor / Actress\n!
