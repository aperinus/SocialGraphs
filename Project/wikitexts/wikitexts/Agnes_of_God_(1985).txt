It was written by [[John Pielmeier]], based on his 1979 [[Agnes of God|play of the same name]]. The plot is about a novice [[nun]] (Tilly) who gives birth and insists that the dead child was the result of a virginal conception. A psychiatrist (Fonda) and the mother superior (Bancroft) of the convent clash during the resulting investigation.\n\nDespite generally mixed reviews from critics, the film was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Bancroft), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Tilly), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. Tilly also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[convent]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, during evening prayers, the nuns hear screams coming from the room of Sister Agnes, a young novice. Agnes is found in her room bleeding profusely, and in a  basket, Mother Superior Miriam finds a dead infant.\n\nSister Agnes is suspected of killing the baby, so psychiatrist Martha Livingston is assigned by a court to determine if she is competent to stand trial. In an interview, Agnes claims she does not remember being pregnant or giving birth, and shows a lack of understanding of how babies are conceived. Mother Miriam tells Livingston that Agnes is an \"innocent\" who was kept at home by her mother and knows nothing about the world. She is desperate to keep Agnes naive, and declares that she could not have known what pregnancy was or remember the father.\n\nMother Miriam tells Livingston about the time Agnes [[anorexia|stopped eating]] in the belief she was getting fat, and then exhibited [[stigmata]] in her hand that healed itself within a day. Agnes tells Livingston of her friendship with Sister Marie-Paul, the oldest nun, who showed her a \"secret place\" \u2013 a bell tower, which she then shows Livingston. They argue about Agnes' mother and birth, and how much Agnes knows about sex and pregnancy.\n\nMother Miriam tells Livingston that Agnes must have conceived on January 23, because that is the night Agnes burned her bedsheets confessing they were \"stained\". While looking around the convent grounds, Livingston comes across a barn. She and a young [[Monsignor]] argue about whether her lack of faith will leave her unable to treat Agnes with dignity. Livingston learns that Agnes' mother was verbally and sexually abusive, telling her she was a \"mistake\"; and that Agnes is Mother Miriam's niece.\n\nLivingston receives permission from the court to hypnotize Agnes, but Mother Miriam is strongly against it, believing it will strip her of her innocence. While hypnotized, Agnes admits she gave birth and that another woman in the convent knew she was pregnant, but will not reveal who. Livingston discovers that a workroom in the convent has a concealed staircase to a tunnel leading to the barn. (A historian explains that many old convents have \"secret\" tunnels, to let the nuns move between buildings during the winter.) Mother Miriam tries to have Livingston removed from the case, but she appeals to the court authorities and is retained.\n\nLivingston obtains a second court order to put Agnes under hypnosis again. Mother Miriam admits that she knew Agnes was pregnant and put the wastebasket in her room, but denies she killed the baby. Under hypnosis, Agnes reveals that on the night Sister Marie-Paul died, she told Agnes she had seen \"Him\" from the bell tower and directed Agnes to meet \"Him\" in the barn. Under questioning, she appears to describe an encounter with a real presence \u2013 human or divine. Suddenly, Agnes exhibits stigmata in her hands, and begins bleeding profusely. Agnes declares that \"He\" raped her, and that she hates God for it. She admits that Mother Miriam was present when the baby was born, but then left briefly; whereupon Agnes killed the child believing that, like herself, the baby was a \"mistake\".\n\nAgnes is found not guilty by reason of insanity and returned to the convent where a doctor can \"visit\" periodically. She tells the judge that she heard \"Him\" singing beneath her bedroom window for six nights in a row, and then on the seventh night he lay on top of her, implying that she may have been raped and impregnated by a trespasser.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jane Fonda]] as Dr. Martha Livingston\n*[[Anne Bancroft]] as Mother Miriam Ruth ([[religious name]]) | Anna Maria Burchetti (birth name)\n*[[Meg Tilly]] as Sister Agnes Devereaux \n*[[Anne Pitoniak]] as Mrs. Livingston, the mother of Martha\n*[[Winston Rekert]] as Det.

[[Gene Siskel]] said that it played \"with some challenging ideas and some sensationalistic events, but ultimately it fails to earn its right to toy with such subjects.\" [[Roger Ebert]] similarly sided, giving it one star and saying that though it \"deals in the basic materials of a criminal investigation (cynical cops, forensic details, courtroom testimony), it has a seriously clouded agenda.\"\n\nThe film was a modest financial success, as it grossed $25,627,836 domestically.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
