The [[screenplay]], by Peckinpah and [[David Zelag Goodman]], is based upon [[Gordon Williams (writer)|Gordon M. Williams]]'s 1969 novel, ''[[The Siege of Trencher's Farm]]''. The film's title derives from a discussion in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' that likens people to the ancient Chinese ceremonial [[straw dog]], being of ceremonial worth, but afterwards discarded with indifference.\n\nThe film is noted for its violent concluding sequences and two complicated rape scenes, which were censored by numerous film rating boards. Released theatrically in the same year as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', the film sparked heated controversy over a perceived increase of violence in films generally.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|pages=137\u2013138}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyes Opening Up|first=Michael|last=Sragow|author-link=Michael Sragow|work=[[Salon.com]]|publisher=[[Salon Media Group]]|location=San Francisco, California|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/07/29/straw/index.html|date=July 29, 1999|access-date=October 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered in the UK in November 1971. Although controversial at the time, ''Straw Dogs'' is considered by some critics to be one of Peckinpah's greatest films, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music (Original Dramatic Score).<ref name=\":0\" />{{sfn|Weddle|1994|p=12}} A [[Straw Dogs (2011 film)|remake]] directed by [[Rod Lurie]] and starring [[James Marsden]] and [[Kate Bosworth]] was released on September 16, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter securing a grant to study [[stellar structure]]s, American [[Applied mathematics|applied mathematician]] David Sumner moves with his glamorous young Cornish wife Amy to a house near to her home village of Wakely in the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] moorland. Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner, along with his cronies Norman Scutt, Chris Cawsey, and Phil Riddaway, immediately resent that the meek outsider has married one of their own. Scutt, a former [[convict]], confides in Cawsey his jealousy of Venner's past relationship with Amy. David meets Venner's uncle, Tom Hedden, a violent drunkard whose flirtatious teenage daughter Janice seems attracted to Henry Niles, a mentally deficient man despised by the entire town.\n\nThe Sumners have taken an isolated farmhouse, Trenchers Farm, that once belonged to Amy's father, and still contains his furniture. They hire Scutt and Cawsey to re-roof its garage, and when impatient with lack of progress add Venner and his cousin Bobby. Tensions in their marriage soon become apparent. Amy criticizes David's condescension towards her and his escape from the volatile, politicized campus, suggesting that cowardice was his true reason for leaving America. He responds by withdrawing deeper into his studies, ignoring both the hostility of the locals and Amy's dissatisfaction. His aloofness results in Amy's attention-gathering pranks and provocative demeanor towards the workmen, particularly Venner. David even struggles to be accepted by the educated locals, as shown in conversation with the vicar, Reverend Barney Hood, and the local magistrate, Major John Scott.\n\nWhen David finds their missing cat hanging dead in their bedroom closet, Amy reckons Cawsey or Scutt is responsible. She presses David to confront the workmen, but he is too intimidated to accuse them. The men invite David to go hunting the following day. They take him to a remote location and leave him there with the promise of driving birds towards him. With David away, Venner goes to Trenchers Farm where he forces Amy sexually, who after a time submits to the assault. Afterward, Scutt enters silently, motions Venner to move away at gunpoint and rapes Amy, who responds with more resistance, while Venner holds her down. David returns much later, smarting from the practical joke the men pulled on him. Amy, though clearly upset, says nothing about the intruders and what they did to her, apart from a cryptic comment that escapes his attention.\n\nThe next day, David fires the workmen, ostensibly for their slow progress. Later, the Sumners attend a church social where Amy becomes distraught on seeing her rapists. At the social, Janice invites Niles to leave with her and, away from the crowd, she begins to seduce him. When it is discovered that Janice is missing, her brother is sent to search for her, and as he calls out for her, Niles panics and strangles Janice to death. The Sumners leave early, driving through thick fog, and accidentally hit Henry Niles as he is escaping the scene of the crime. They take him to their home and David phones the local pub to report the accident. The locals, who in the meantime have learned that Janice was last seen with Niles, are thereby alerted to Niles's whereabouts. Soon, Hedden, Scutt, Venner, Cawsey and Riddaway are drunkenly pounding on the Sumners' door. Inferring their intention to [[Lynching|lynch]] Niles, David refuses to let them take him, despite Amy's pleas. The standoff seems to unlock a [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] instinct in David: \"I will not allow violence against this house.\"\n\nScott arrives to defuse the situation, but is accidentally shot dead by Hedden during a struggle. Realizing the danger to him in witnessing this homicide, David improvises various traps and weapons, including boiling oil, to fend off the attackers. He inadvertently forces Hedden to shoot himself in the foot, knocks Riddaway unconscious and bludgeons Cawsey to death with a poker. Venner holds him at gunpoint, but Amy's screams alert both men when Scutt assaults her again. Scutt suggests Venner join him in another [[gang rape]], but Venner shoots him dead. David disarms Venner and in the ensuing fight snaps a displayed [[Mantrap (snare)|mantrap]] around Venner's neck, killing him. Reviewing the resulting carnage and surprised by his own violence, David mutters to himself, \"Jesus, I got 'em all.\" A recovering Riddaway then brutally attacks him, but is shot by Amy as he tries to break David's spine.\n\nDavid gets into his car to drive Niles back to the village. Niles says he does not know his way home; David says he does not either.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as David Sumner\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] as Amy Sumner\n* [[Peter Vaughan]] as Tom Hedden\n* [[T.

Critics accused Peckinpah of glamorizing and eroticising rape and of engaging in [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] and [[male chauvinism]],{{sfn|Weddle|1994|pages=25, 399\u2013400, 426\u2013428}} especially disturbed by the scene's intended ambiguity\u2014after initially resisting, Amy appears to enjoy parts of the first rape, kissing and holding her attacker, although she later has traumatic flashbacks. Author Melanie Williams, in her 2005 book, ''Secrets and Laws: Collected Essays in Law, Lives and Literature'', stated, \"the enactment purposely catered to entrenched appetites for desired victim behavior and reinforces [[rape myth]]s\".{{sfn|Wiliams|2005|p=71}}  Another criticism is that all the main female characters depict straight women as perverse, in that every appearance of Janice and Amy is used to highlight excessive sexuality.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Linda Ruth |last=Williams|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=402380|title=Straw Dogs: Women can only misbehave|magazine=[[Sight & Sound]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=26, 27|date=February 1995|issn=0037-4806}}</ref>\n\nThe violence provoked strong reactions, many critics seeing it an endorsement of violence as redemption, and the film as [[Fascism|fascist]] celebration of violence and [[vigilantism]]. Others see it as anti-violence, describing the bleak ending consequent to the violence. Dustin Hoffman viewed David as deliberately, yet subconsciously, provoking the violence, his concluding homicidal rampage being the emergence of his true self; this view was not shared by director Sam Peckinpah.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|pages=137\u2013138}}\n\nThe village of St Buryan was used as a location for the filming with some of the locals appearing as extras. Local author [[Derek Tangye]] reports in one of his books that they were not aware of the nature of the film at the time of filming, and were most upset to discover on its release that they had been used in a film of a nature so inconsistent with their own moral values.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Censorship===\nThe studio edited the first rape scene before releasing the film in the United States, to earn an [[Motion picture rating system|R rating]] from the [[MPAA film rating system|MPAA]].{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=137}}\n\nIn the UK, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] banned it in accordance with the newly introduced [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]]. The film had been released theatrically in the United Kingdom, with the uncut version gaining an 'X' rating in 1971 and the slightly cut US R-rated print being rated '18' in 1995. In March 1999 a partially edited print of ''Straw Dogs'', which removed most of the second rape, was refused a video certificate when the distributor lost the rights to the film after agreeing to make the requested BBFC cuts, and the full uncut version was also rejected for video three months later on the grounds that the BBFC could not pass the uncut version so soon after rejecting a cut one.\n\nOn July 1, 2002, ''Straw Dogs'' finally was certified unedited on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. This version was uncut, and therefore included the second rape scene, in which in the BBFC's opinion \"Amy is clearly demonstrated not to enjoy the act of violation\".<ref name=BBFC>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/news/press/20020701.html|title=BBFC passes STRAW DOGS uncut on video|date=2002-07-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827155323/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/news/press/20020701.html|archive-date=2008-08-27}}</ref> The BBFC wrote that: {{blockquote|The cuts made for American distribution, which were made to reduce the duration of the sequence, therefore tended paradoxically to compound the difficulty with the first rape, leaving the audience with the impression that Amy enjoyed the experience. The Board took the view in 1999 that the pre-cut version [[Eroticism|eroticised]] the rape and therefore raised concerns with the Video Recordings Act about promoting harmful activity. The version considered in 2002 is substantially the original uncut version of the film, restoring much of the unambiguously unpleasant second rape.
