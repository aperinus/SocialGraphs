Broccoli]]. The film stars [[Roger Moore]] as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], and co-stars [[Carole Bouquet]], [[Chaim Topol]], [[Lynn-Holly Johnson]], and [[Julian Glover]].\n\nThe twelfth film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' franchise]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], ''For Your Eyes Only'' was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Michael G. Wilson]], based on two [[Ian Fleming]] short stories \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#\"For Your Eyes Only\"|For Your Eyes Only]]\" and \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#\"Risico\"|Risico]]\". In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'', and ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\nAfter the science fiction-focused ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the producers wanted a return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. ''For Your Eyes Only'' followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences rather than the fantasy narrative of ''Moonraker''. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in [[The Bahamas]]. Scottish singer [[Sheena Easton]] performed the title theme song.\n\n''For Your Eyes Only'' was released in the UK on 24 June 1981 and in the US two days later; it received a mixed to positive critical reception. The film's reputation has improved over time, with reviewers praising the more serious tone in comparison to previous entries in the series. The film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by [[United Artists]]; the company was absorbed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] soon after this film's release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- ATTENTION!: Before editing this section, please see WP:FILMPLOT for more info. The plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe British information gathering vessel ''St Georges'', which holds the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system used by the Ministry of Defence to co-ordinate the [[Royal Navy]]'s fleet of [[UK Polaris programme|Polaris]] submarines, is sunk after accidentally [[trawling]] an old [[naval mine]] in the [[Ionian Sea]].  A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is asked by the British to secretly locate the ''St Georges''. However, he and his wife are murdered by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales. His daughter, [[Judy Havelock|Melina Havelock]], witnesses the murder and vows revenge.\n\nThe head of the [[KGB]], [[General Gogol]], has also learned of the fate of the ''St Georges'' and already notified his contact in Greece. [[MI6]] agent James Bond is ordered by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Minister of Defence]], [[Sir Frederick Gray]], and MI6 Chief of Staff [[Bill Tanner]] to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets since the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[ballistic missile]]s. Bond goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales.\n\nWhile spying on Gonzales's [[villa]], Bond is captured by his men, but escapes as Gonzales is killed by a crossbow bolt. Outside, he finds the assassin was Melina and the two escape. With the help of Bond, [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] uses computerised technology to identify the man Bond saw paying off Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque, and then goes to Locque's possible base in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]], Italy. There Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos, who tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, known as \"the Dove\" in the Greek underworld, Kristatos's former resistance partner during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After Bond goes with Kristatos's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]], [[figure skating|figure skater]] Bibi Dahl, to a [[biathlon]] course, a group of three men, which includes East German biathlete Eric Kriegler, chases Bond, trying to kill him. Bond escapes and then goes with Ferrara to bid Bibi farewell in an ice rink, where he fends off another attempt on his life by men in ice hockey gear. Ferrara is killed in Bond's car, with a dove pin in his hand. Bond then travels to [[Corfu]] in pursuit of Columbo.\n\nThere, at the casino, Bond meets Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, Countess Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home with Kristatos's car and driver. The two then spend the night together. In the morning, Lisl and Bond are ambushed by Locque and Lisl is killed. Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid on one of Kristatos's [[opium]]-processing warehouses in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], where Bond uncovers naval mines similar to the one that sank the ''St Georges'', suggesting it was not an accident. After the base is destroyed, Bond chases Locque and kills him.\n\nAfterwards, Bond meets Melina, and they recover the ATAC from the wreckage of the ''St Georges'', but Kristatos is waiting for them when they surface and he takes the ATAC. After the two escape an assassination attempt, they discover Kristatos's [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] point when Melina's parrot repeats the phrase \"ATAC to St Cyril's\". With the help of Columbo and his men, Bond and Melina break into St Cyril's, an abandoned mountaintop monastery. As Columbo confronts Kristatos, Bond kills Kriegler.\n\nBond retrieves the ATAC system and stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden [[flick knife]], but is killed by a knife thrown by Columbo; Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond throws it off the cliff. Bond and Melina later spend a romantic evening aboard her father's yacht while Melina's parrot fields a call from MI6 and [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], MI6 agent 007, who is sent to retrieve a stolen \"ATAC\" system that could be misused for controlling British submarines.\n<!-- start opening title cards -->\n* [[Carole Bouquet]] as [[Judy Havelock|Melina Havelock]], the daughter of marine archaeologists who are murdered while tracking down the ATAC's whereabouts.

This, along with the [[early 1980s recession]], required ''For Your Eyes Only'' to have a lower budget. ''For Your Eyes Only'' marked a change in the make up of the production crew. The previous series directors [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], [[Guy Hamilton]], [[Lewis Gilbert]], and [[Peter R.

Wilson pointed out, \"If we went through the path of ''Moonraker'' things would just get more outlandish, so we needed to get back to basics\".<ref name=inside/> To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller;<ref name=inside/> Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive.<ref name=wilson>{{cite video|people=Michael G.

Wilson.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=227}} According to Wilson, the ideas from stories could have come from anyone as the outlines were worked out in committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson and [[stunt coordinator]]s.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=135}} Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Ian Fleming short stories from the collection ''For Your Eyes Only'': ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#Risico|Risico]]'' and ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#For Your Eyes Only|For Your Eyes Only]]''.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=175}} Another set-piece from the novel of ''Live and Let Die'' \u2013 the [[keelhauling]] \u2013 which was unused in the film of the same name, was also inserted into the plot.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=135}} Other ideas from Fleming were also used in ''For Your Eyes Only'', such as the Identigraph which comes from the novel ''Goldfinger'', where it was originally called the \"Identicast\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} These elements from Fleming's stories were mixed with a [[Cold War]] story centred on the [[MacGuffin]] of the ATAC.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=227}} An initial treatment for this film was submitted by [[Ronald Hardy]], an English novelist and screenwriter in 1979. Hardy's treatment included the involvement of a character named Julia Havelock whose parents were assassinated by a man named Gonzales.<ref>{{cite book|title=The James Bond Archives |first=Paul|last=Duncan|publisher=Taschen|year=2012|page=305}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-title sequence of ''For Your Eyes Only'' has been described as either \"out-of place and disappointing\"{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=227}} or \"roaringly enjoyable\".{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=167}} The scene was shot to introduce a potential new Bond to audiences, thus linking the new actor to elements from previous Bond films{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=135}} (see [[For Your Eyes Only (film)#Casting|casting]], below).\n\nThe sequence begins with Bond laying flowers at the grave of his wife [[Tracy Bond]], before a [[Universal Exports]] helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey [[Nehru jacket]] with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] as played by [[Donald Pleasence]] or [[Telly Savalas]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=227}} Director John Glen referred to the identity of the villain obliquely: \"We just let people use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions&nbsp;... It's a legal thing\".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=137}} Originally the character was going to be explicitly identified as Blofeld, but was deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with [[Kevin McClory]], who owned the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation [[SPECTRE]], and other material associated with the development of ''Thunderball''.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Boshoff|first=Alison|title=Double agent Bond held hostage in studio wars|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 October 1997}}</ref> [[Eon Productions|Eon]] disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was \"a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character.\"{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=178}}\n\nMaibaum later said \"We tried to return to the earlier films with ''For Your Eyes Only'' but we didn't have Sean to make it real. And I was very disappointed with the way the love story was handled.
