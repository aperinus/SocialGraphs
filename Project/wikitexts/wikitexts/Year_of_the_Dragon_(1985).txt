The screenplay was written by Cimino and [[Oliver Stone]] and adapted from the novel by [[Robert Daley]].\n\nCimino's first film after the box office failure of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''Year of the Dragon'' is a New York crime drama and an exploration of [[gang]]s, the [[illegal drug trade]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[racism]], and [[stereotype]]s. Despite mixed reviews and being a [[box office flop]], it has gained a [[cult following]] in the years since its release.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley White is New York's most decorated police captain and a [[Vietnam War]] veteran assigned to New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where he makes it a personal mission to crack down on Chinese organized crime. He is obsessed with his career and neglects his marriage to his wife Connie.\n\nWhite comes into conflict with Joey Tai, a young man who ruthlessly rises to become the head of the Chinese [[Triad society|Triad]] societies, and as a result of his ambition, creates a high profile for himself and the Triads' activities. Together, they end the uneasy truce that has existed between the Triads and the police precinct, even as they conduct a personal war between themselves and the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mob]] and Thai gangsters who have traditionally been involved in their heroin supply chain.\n\nThe married captain also becomes romantically involved with Tracy Tzu, a television reporter, who comes under brutal attack from the criminals, as does White's long-suffering wife. This makes him even more determined to destroy the triads, and especially Joey Tai.\n\nWhite also hires an up-and-coming Chinese rookie cop, Herbert, to go undercover as one of Tai's restaurant workers. Herbert manages to get inside information on a drug shipment but is betrayed by corrupt cop Alan Perez and loses his life when Tai is informed by Perez that Herbert is a cop. Now that Tai has raped Tracy, killed his wife and Herbert, White wastes no time in confronting Tai just as the shipment comes in.\n\nAt the harbor, Tai and his bodyguard are on their way to the shipment when White attempts to arrest them. Perez drives by yelling abuse, White shoots and kills Perez but Tai draws a gun and shoots White in the hand, accidentally killing his bodyguard. Tai flees on a train bridge. This leads to a showdown where White and Tai run at each other while firing recklessly. White shoots Tai, leaving him wounded in both legs. Rather than suffer, and losing face, Tai asks for White's gun in order to commit suicide. He kills himself in front of White.\n\nThe movie ends happily as White and Tracy come together in the streets of Chinatown at Tai's funeral.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Capt.

When he finally agreed, Cimino realized he was unable to write and direct in the time allotted; The producers already had an approximate start date for the film. He brought in Oliver Stone, who he had met through his producer and friend Joann Carelli, to help him write the script.<ref name=Cimino>DVD commentary by director [[Michael Cimino]]. Located on the ''Year of the Dragon'' 2005 Region 1 DVD.</ref>\n\nCimino was prompted to seek out Stone after reading, and being impressed by, Stone's (at the time) unproduced ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' screenplay. Cimino asked Stone to work on ''Year of the Dragon'' for a lower-than-normal wage as part of a ''quid pro quo'' deal, namely, that ''Year of the Dragon'' producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] would help in finding the funding for Stone to make ''Platoon''. Stone agreed to this deal.\n\n\"With Michael, it's a 24-hour day\", said Stone. \"He doesn't really sleep ... he's truly an obsessive personality. He's the most Napoleonic director I ever worked with\".<ref name=Typhoon>Griffin, Nancy (February 10, 2002).

At first, Rourke did not take his physical training seriously, so Cimino hired [[Hells Angels]] member [[Chuck Zito]] to be Rourke's instructor. Rourke has often quoted in many interviews that he loved working with Cimino despite the disapproved reputation he earned himself over the years since his previous box office failures, quoting, \"He was a ball of fire.

Cimino actually had to convince the Bronx-born Kubrick that the film's exteriors were shot on the DEG backlot, and not on location.<ref name=Cimino/>\n\nOther cities used in filming included New York City, [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Bangkok]] and Shangirey. Cimino said he often liked to shoot in different cities, with interiors in one city and exteriors in another. In one scene, Joey Tai and his lawyer walk through a Chinese textile mill, past a guard-rail and into a shoddy apartment building to meet up with two of his assassins. The textile mill was in Bangkok, the guard-rail was in New York and the apartment building was in Wilmington. When one of the [[script supervisor]]s commented that the scene \"wouldn't cut\" (edit seamlessly together), Cimino bet her $1,000 that it would. Upon seeing the cut, the script supervisor conceded and Cimino won the bet but refused to take the $1,000.<ref name=Cimino/>\n\nUnlike ''Heaven's Gate'', Cimino was able to bring the film in on time and on budget.<ref name=Typhoon/>\n\n===Post-production===\nAt the end of the film, White's final line is \"You were right and I was wrong. I'd like to be a nice guy. But I just don't know how to be nice\". According to Cimino, the final line of White was supposed to be \"Well, I guess if you fight a war long enough, you end up marrying the enemy\". The studio vetoed the original line, written by Stone. Cimino feels that either the studio or the producers thought the original line was [[Political correctness|politically incorrect]].<ref name=Cimino/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened at #5 on the box office charts, grossing $4,039,079 in 982 theaters on its opening weekend of August 16, 1985.<ref name=Numbers/><ref name=Mojo>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yearofthedragon.htm \"''Year of the Dragon'' (1985)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727071643/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yearofthedragon.htm |date=2009-07-27 }}.
