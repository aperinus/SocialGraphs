An [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1980s [[Miami Vice|television series of the same name]], on which Mann was an executive producer, it stars [[Colin Farrell]] as [[James \"Sonny\" Crockett]] and [[Jamie Foxx]] as [[Ricardo \"Rico\" Tubbs]], [[Miami-Dade Police Department|MDPD]] detectives who go undercover to fight drug trafficking operations. The [[ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] includes [[Gong Li]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Barry Shabaka Henley]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Luis Tosar]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Elizabeth Rodriguez]], [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Isaach De Bankol\u00e9]], [[Eddie Marsan]] and [[Tom Towles]].\n\nFoxx brought up the idea of a ''Miami Vice'' film to Mann during a party for ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]''. This led Mann to revisit the series he co-produced. Like ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'', which also starred Foxx, most of the film was shot with the [[Thomson Viper FilmStream Camera|Thomson Viper Filmstream Camera]], while [[Super 35]] was used for high-speed and underwater shots.\n\n''Miami Vice'' premiered in Los Angeles on July 20, 2006. It was released in the United States on July 28, 2006, and in Germany on August 24, 2006. It grossed $164.2 million worldwide on a reported $135 million budget. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for Mann's directing and visual style and criticism for the hard-edged storyline, though in subsequent years, its reputation among critics and filmmakers has grown, with critic Steven Hyden writing in 2016 that the film had become a [[Cult film|cult favorite]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile working an undercover prostitute sting operation in a nightclub to arrest a pimp named Neptune, [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Miami-Dade Police]] detectives James \"Sonny\" Crockett and Ricardo \"Rico\" Tubbs receive a frantic phone call from their former informant Alonzo Stevens. Stevens reveals that he's leaving town, and, believing his wife Leonetta to be in immediate danger, asks Rico to check on her. Crockett learns that Stevens was working as an informant for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] but has been compromised.\n\nCrockett and Tubbs quickly contact FBI [[Special Agent in Charge]] John Fujima and warn him about Stevens' safety. Tracking down Stevens through a vehicle transponder and aerial surveillance, Crockett and Tubbs stop him along I-95. Stevens reveals that a Colombian [[drug cartel|cartel]] had become aware that Russian undercovers (now dead) were working with the FBI, and had threatened to murder Leonetta via a [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] necklace bomb if he didn't confess. Rico, learning of Leonetta's death by telephone call, tells Alonzo that he doesn't have to go home. Hearing this, the grief-stricken Stevens commits suicide by walking in front of an oncoming semi truck.\n\nEn route to the murder scene, Sonny and Rico receive a call from Lt. Martin Castillo and are instructed to stay away. He tells them to meet him downtown, where they are introduced in person to Fujima, head of the Florida Joint Inter-Agency Task Force between the FBI, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]]. Crockett and Tubbs berate Fujima for the errors committed and inquire as to why the MDPD wasn't involved. Fujima reveals that the Colombian group part of the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|A.U.C.]] is highly sophisticated and run by Jos\u00e9 Yero, initially thought to be the cartel's leader. Fujima enlists Crockett and Tubbs, making them [[Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force]] deputies, to lead a deep undercover operation. They continue the investigation by looking into [[go-fast boat]]s coming from the [[Caribbean]], delivering loads of narcotics from the [[Colombia|Colombians]]. They then coerce their Miami informant contact Nicholas into setting up a meet-and-greet with the cartel.\n\nPosing as highly skilled drug smugglers, Sonny and Rico offer their services to Yero, the cartel's security and intelligence man. After a high-tension meeting, they pass screening and are introduced to Arc\u00e1ngel de Jes\u00fas Montoya, [[Transnational organized crime|transnational]] drug trafficking kingpin. In the course of their investigation, Crockett and Tubbs learn that the cartel is using the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] to distribute drugs, and is supplying them with state-of-the-art weaponry, which they had used to kill the Russian undercovers. Meanwhile, Crockett tries to gather further evidence from Montoya's financial adviser and lover, Isabella, but ends up starting a secret romance with her while on a trip by speedboat to Cuba. At a club, the two dance closely, observed by Yero. Afterwards, Crockett and Isabella discuss the possibility and impossibility of running away together. Tubbs begins to fear for the team's safety with Crockett's fling. Those fears are soon realized as Trudy, the unit's intelligence agent and Rico's girlfriend, is kidnapped by the Aryan Brotherhood on Yero's order, who never trusted Crockett and Tubbs. The Aryan Brotherhood demand for Crockett and Tubbs to deliver the cartel's load directly to them. With Lt. Castillo's help and clues given by Trudy, the unit triangulates Trudy's location to a mobile home in a trailer park and perform a rescue, but she is critically injured when Tubbs fails to evacuate her before a bomb is remotely detonated by Yero. Soon afterwards, Yero reveals Isabella's betrayal to Montoya and captures her. In the showdown, Crockett and Tubbs face off against Yero, his men, and the Aryan Brotherhood in a shipyard at the port of Miami.\n\nDuring the firefight, Crockett begins to call in backup. When Isabella sees his police shield and radio, she realizes that he's a cop. Betrayed, Isabella wrestles with Crockett until he subdues her. Tubbs guns down Yero as he attempts to shoot his way to safety. After the gunfight, Crockett takes Isabella to a police safehouse and insists she will have to leave without him. Isabella tells him \"time is luck,\" holding out hope the fling can continue, but he tells her they \"have run out of time.\"\n\nCrockett arranges for Isabella to leave the country and return home in Cuba, thus avoiding arrest. Meanwhile, Tubbs is keeping watch on Trudy in hospital as she begins to awaken from her coma.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !!

He had won an Academy Award after signing onto the film but before production began, and subsequently called for upgrades in his salary and other compensation. He demanded top billing in the film's credits and was also said to have complained that he was paid less than Farrell; Foxx's salary was raised considerably and Farrell's was cut slightly to address this.<ref name=\"slate\" /> Foxx also refused to fly commercially, successfully lobbying Universal to hire a private jet for him. He also objected to filming scenes shot on boats or planes. Eventually, after gunshots were fired on set in the [[Dominican Republic]] on October 24, 2005, Foxx left the country and returned to the United States. This forced the production to abandon the script's intended ending, slated to be shot in Paraguay, and revert to a previously discarded one that Mann had written, which was set in Miami. One crew member later opined that the Miami-based ending was the dramatically inferior of the two, though Mann said that he came to prefer it.<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\n[[Sal Magluta]], the drug trafficker identified by Tubbs as running go-fast boats in the film's opening scenes, is in fact one of Miami's real-life reputed \"Cocaine Cowboys\"<ref>{{cite web|access-date=August 8, 2012|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/15/2799441/miami-woman-imprisoned-for-life.html|work=Miami Herald|title=Miami woman freed from life sentence in 'Willie and Sal' drug-murder hit|author=Weaver, Jay|date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> and is currently serving a life sentence for money laundering.<ref>{{Cite news|journal=St. Petersburg State Times|access-date=August 8, 2012|title=Reputed 'cocaine cowboy' makes prison deal: Sentencing in July will be for money laundering conspiracy and $1-million in restitution|agency=Associated Press|date=June 17, 2003|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/17/State/Reputed__cocaine_cowb.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029012432/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/17/State/Reputed__cocaine_cowb.shtml|archive-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[teaser trailer]] to appear for the film featured the [[Linkin Park]] and [[Jay-Z]] song \"[[Numb/Encore]]\".

[[Jay-Z]] and [[Linkin Park]]'s \"[[Numb/Encore]]\" is not found on the soundtrack despite being featured in both of the film's trailers and being the first song in the film. Furthermore, the version of Goldfrapp's \"Strict Machine\" is the ''[[We Are Glitter]]'' remix of the song, and both it and Freaky Chakra's \"Blacklight Fantasy\" are edits from [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha's]] [[DJ mix|mix album]] ''[[Fundacion NYC]]''. Neither version appears on the soundtrack.\n* Clips of two [[Audioslave]] songs, \"[[Wide Awake (Audioslave song)|Wide Awake]]\" and \"[[Shape of Things to Come (Audioslave song)|Shape of Things to Come]]\", are featured in the film, but the songs do not appear on the soundtrack. This was possibly because the two songs were brand new and were set to be featured on Audioslave's new album ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', which had a release date close to the film.\n* The version of Moby's \"Anthem\" on the soundtrack does not appear in the film. Instead, prominent placement is given to Moby's \"Cinematic Version\" of the song.\n* King Britt's \"New World in My View\" is featured in the film but is missing the spoken-word lyrics of Sister Gertrude.
