Herzog received special permission from the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] to film inside the cave.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\nHaving received permission, Herzog nonetheless had to film under heavy restrictions. All people authorized to enter must wear special suits and shoes that have had no contact with the exterior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/chauvet/en/|title=La Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc|website=La grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc - La Grotte Chauvet-Pont d'Arc}}</ref> Also, because of near-toxic levels of [[radon]] and [[carbon dioxide]], nobody can stay in the cave for more than a few hours per day.<ref name=\"variety\"/>\n\nHerzog was allowed to have only three people with him in the cave: the cinematographer [[Peter Zeitlinger]], a sound recordist (Eric Spitzer-Marlyn), and an assistant.

At the time of production, 3-D films were typically shot on stages with heavy use of digital manipulation. Often, foreground and background elements would be shot separately and digitally composited into the finished shot. Techniques for 3-D filmmaking in natural environments with a single camera and no compositing were largely undeveloped, and had to be worked out experimentally by the crew in post-production.<ref name=sabotage/>\n\nBefore production of ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams'', Herzog was skeptical of the artistic value of 3-D filmmaking, and had only seen one 3-D film (James Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''). Herzog still believes that 3-D is not suited for general use in cinema, but used it in ''Cave'' to help \"capture the intentions of the painters\", who incorporated the wall's subtle bulges and contours into their art.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> \nThe idea to use a 3-D camera for the film was first suggested by Zeitlinger, who had imagined before ever entering the cave that 3-D might be appropriate to capture the contours of the walls. Herzog dismissed the idea, believing 3-D to be (in Zeitlinger's words) \"a gimmick of the commercial cinema\". After visiting the cave, however, Herzog immediately decided that the film must be shot in 3-D.<ref name=sabotage>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/meet-the-cinematographer-who-pushed-werner-herzog-to-the-third-dimension/|title=Meet The Cinematographer Who Pushed Werner Herzog to the Third Dimension|last=Curtis|first=Lee|date=13 June 2011|work=[[Sabotage Times]]|access-date=13 June 2011}}</ref> After the production, Herzog stated that he had no plans to use 3-D again.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its debut on 13 September 2010, at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].
