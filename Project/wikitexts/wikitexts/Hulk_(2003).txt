Directed by [[Ang Lee]] and written by [[James Schamus]], [[Michael France]], and [[John Turman]] from a story by Schamus, it stars [[Eric Bana]] as Bruce Banner/Hulk, alongside [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Josh Lucas]], and [[Nick Nolte]]. The film explores Bruce Banner's origins. After a lab accident involving [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], he transforms into a giant, green-skinned creature known as the \"Hulk\" whenever stressed or emotionally provoked. The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] pursues him, and he clashes with his biological father, who has dark plans for his son.\n\nDevelopment for the film started as far back as 1990. At one point, [[Joe Johnston]] and then [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] were to direct the movie. Hensleigh; [[John Turman]]; [[Michael France]]; [[Zak Penn]]; [[J. J. Abrams]]; [[Michael Tolkin]]; [[David Hayter]]; [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski|Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski]] wrote more scripts before Ang Lee and [[James Schamus]]' involvement. The project was filmed primarily in [[California]] from March to August 2002, mainly in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\n''Hulk'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on June 20, 2003, and grossed $245 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[2003 in film|highest-grossing films of 2003]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' critical consensus calls it an ambitious film, with praise for its style, but criticism for its dialogue and lack of action sequences. A planned sequel was repurposed as a reboot titled ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and released on June 13, 2008, as the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be 400-700 words only-->\n[[Brian Banner|David Banner]] is a [[genetics]] researcher for the government trying to improve human DNA. His supervisor, Colonel [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]], forbids human experimentation, so David experiments on himself. His wife, Edith, soon gives birth to their son, [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]. David realizes Bruce inherited his mutant DNA and attempts to find a cure. After discovering his experiments, Ross shuts down David's research; David rigs Desert Base's gamma reactor to explode as revenge. Believing he is dangerous, David tries to kill Bruce but accidentally murders Edith when she gets between them; the trauma makes Bruce suppress his early childhood memories. Ross arrests and sends David to a mental hospital, putting the 4-year-old Bruce into foster care. Mrs. Krenzler adopts him, and Bruce assumes the surname, growing up believing his birth parents are dead.\n\nThirty years later, Bruce is a brilliant scientist working at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Berkeley Lab]] with his girlfriend and Ross's estranged daughter, [[Betty Ross]]. Representing the private research company Atheon, the shady [[Glenn Talbot]] becomes interested in the scientists' [[Nanomedicine|nanomeds]] research to create regenerating soldiers for the [[military-industrial complex]]. David reappears as a janitor in the lab building to infiltrate Bruce's life. The now-general Ross investigates, becoming concerned for Betty's safety around Bruce.\n\nBruce saves a colleague named Harper from an accident with a malfunctioning [[gammasphere]]. Bruce wakes in a hospital bed and tells Betty he feels better than ever, but Betty cannot fathom his survival since the nanomeds killed everything else; unknown to them, the radiation merged with Bruce's altered DNA. Later, David meets Bruce, revealing their relationship and hinting at Bruce's mutation. He later uses samples of Bruce's DNA for animal experimentation. Bruce's increasing rage from the tensions around him activates his gamma-radiated DNA; he becomes the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and destroys the lab. Betty finds Bruce unconscious in his home the next day, barely remembering the previous night. Ross arrives later to question Bruce before Betty locates David to investigate him. After hours of interrogation, Ross seizes the lab and places Bruce under [[house arrest]]. David calls Bruce that night, revealing he mutated his three dogs and sicced them on Betty, enraging him. Bemoaning the lab's destruction, Talbot attacks Bruce, who transforms, injuring Talbot and Ross's [[Military police|MPs]]. The Hulk finds Betty at her forest [[Log cabin|cabin]], saves her from the dogs, and changes back.\n\nBetty calls Ross the following day; the army sedates and takes Bruce to Desert Base. Deeming him doomed to follow in David's footsteps, Ross doubts helping Bruce, but Betty persuades Ross to let her try. David subjects himself to the nanomeds and gammasphere, becoming able to meld with and absorb the properties of anything he touches. Talbot wrestles control from Ross, forcing Betty to return home. Seeking to profit from the Hulk's power, Talbot fails to provoke Bruce and puts him in an [[isolation tank]]. David confronts Betty at her house, offering to surrender himself yet asking to speak to Bruce \"one last time.\" Talbot induces a nightmare from Bruce's repressed memories and triggers a transformation. Trapping the Hulk in [[sticky foam]], Talbot tries taking a sample of him, but the Hulk breaks free. Talbot gets killed after firing an explosive round that backfires, and Ross resumes command. The Hulk escapes the base, battles the army in the desert, and leaps to [[San Francisco]] to find Betty. She convinces Ross to take her to the Hulk, returning Bruce to normal.\n\nBruce and David talk at a base in the city while Ross watches, threatening to incinerate them. David has descended into megalomania, wanting Bruce's power to destroy his enemies. After Bruce refuses, David bites into a [[high-voltage cable]] when Ross powers it, absorbs the energy and mutates into a powerful electrical entity. Bruce becomes the Hulk and fights and overpowers him; they are presumed dead after Ross orders a Gamma Charge Bomb to end the battle. A year later, Ross has Betty under constant surveillance, as many Hulk sightings get reported. In exile in the [[Amazon Rainforest]], Bruce is alive as a medical camp doctor. His camp gets overrun by soldiers who try to steal their supplies. After Bruce unsuccessfully warns their commander not to make him angry, the Hulk bellows in rage.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Bana]] as [[Hulk|Bruce Banner / Hulk]]:<br />A gamma radiation research scientist. After exposure and mutation to elevated gamma radiation levels, he becomes a huge green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated, and also had ability to grow larger in size and become stronger when angered in his Hulk form.
