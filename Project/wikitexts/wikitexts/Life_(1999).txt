The film stars [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Martin Lawrence]]. It is the second film featuring Murphy and Lawrence together, the first being ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. The supporting cast includes [[Ned Beatty]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]], [[Bernie Mac]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Miguel A. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Jr.]], [[Bokeem Woodbine]], [[Guy Torry]], [[Michael Taliferro]] and [[Barry Shabaka Henley]]. The film's format is a story being told by an elderly inmate about two of his friends, Ray (Murphy) and Claude (Lawrence), who are both [[Miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of murder and sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]]. It received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]]. ''Life'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received mixed reactions from critics. The film later found a strong cult following among Murphy and Lawrence\u2019s fans, establishing ''Life'' as a cult classic.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/the-best-martin-lawrence-movies-and-how-to-watch-them-online | title=The Best Martin Lawrence Movies and How to Watch Them Online | date=25 April 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://theshadowleague.com/the-underrated-classic-buddy-comedy-life-turns-21-today/ | title=The Underrated, Classic Buddy Comedy 'Life' Turns 21 Today | date=16 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://popculture.com/movies/news/eddie-murphy-martin-lawrence-life-netlix-top-10/ | title=Beloved Eddie Murphy Comedy Laughs Its Way into Netflix's Top 10 Charts }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/eddie-murphy-netflix-life.html | title=A Forgotten 90s Eddie Murphy Movie is Now Available on Netflix | date=3 December 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]], elderly convict Willie Long tells his friends' life story at their burial. Ray Gibson and Claude Banks, New Yorkers from different worlds, meet at a club called Spanky's in 1932. Ray, a small-time thief, picks Claude as a mark. Ray convinces club-owner Spanky to let him and Claude pay off their debt via [[Smuggling|boot-legging]]. Traveling south to buy [[Mississippi]] \"hooch\", they pay for the booze and enter a local bar. Ray loses his father's prized pocketwatch to card hustler Winston Hancock. Outside, racist sheriff Warren Pike kills Hancock, framing Ray and Claude.\n\nRay and Claude are given life sentences, with hard labor at an infamous prison camp. They immediately run afoul of the guards, Sergeant Dillard and Hoppin' Bob, and also meet fellow inmates Jangle Leg (who makes a pass at Claude), Willie Long, Biscuit (another homosexual inmate, involved with Jangle Leg), Radio, Goldmouth (a bully who picks a fight with Ray), Cookie the chef, and Pokerface. Claude's cousin, an attorney, unsuccessfully appeals his conviction and seduces his girlfriend (who\u2019s grown tired of Claude\u2019s selfishness). With no chance at freedom, Claude and Ray break out, getting as far as [[Tallahatchie County, Mississippi|Tallahatchie]] before being captured.\n\nIn 1944, twelve years later, Claude and Ray meet young, mute inmate \"Can't-Get-Right\", a talented baseball player who is sighted by a [[Negro league baseball|Negro league]] scout who offers a pardon to play. Sensing opportunity, Ray and Claude introduce themselves as his handlers. Despite his talent, Can't-Get-Right is often distracted by Mae-Rose, the daughter of Camp 8's superintendent Abernathy. After Mae-Rose gives birth to a biracial boy, Abernathy demands to know who is the father. Various inmates simultaneously claim to be to confuse Abernathy and save Can't-Get-Right.\n\nDuring a dance social, Biscuit confides to Ray that he is due for release but fears returning to his family because of his homosexuality. Despite Ray\u2019s sincere encouragement to resume life on the outside, Biscuit instead commits suicide by crossing the gun line, much to the shock and heartache of the other inmates. Can't-Get-Right's release without Ray and Claude causes extreme frustration and a bitter falling out. Over the following years, Ray attempts several escapes alone unsuccessfully.\n\nBy 1972, Ray and Claude are still not speaking; as their friends have all passed away excluding Willie. One day, Claude snaps, running past armed guards to steal a pie, and he is punished by having to stand barefoot on a case of bottles for 24 hours. Dillard offers to set Ray free if he will shoot Claude should he move. Ray refuses and is given the same punishment. Touched, Claude apologizes, and they finally make amends.\n\nOne day, Ray and Claude are transferred to live and work at Superintendent Dexter Wilkins' mansion. Ray does yard work, while Claude works inside and befriends with him. Claude is entrusted to pick up the new superintendent, Sheriff Warren Pike, the man who wrongfully framed them. While on a pheasant hunt, Ray notices that Pike has his father's watch, having framed them for killing Winston Hancock 40 years prior. He tells Wilkins that Pike framed him and Claude for murder, which the sheriff admits without remorse by justifying that at least the state of Mississippi had them as cheap labor for 40 years. As Claude struggles to stop Ray from killing him, when Pike aims at them both with a Derringer. Realizing that they are both innocent, Wilkins kills Pike and covers it up as a hunting accident, but then suffers a fatal heart attack in his bathroom before he can pardon them.\n\nIn 1997, (current timeline), Ray and Claude live in the prison infirmary. Claude tells Ray a new plan, but Ray has accepted his fate. Later that night, the infirmary catches fire, and they seemingly perish in the flames. Willie concludes the tale by outlining Claude's plan: Ray and Claude would steal two bodies from the morgue, start the blaze, plant the bodies, hide and escape in the fire trucks. Willie reveals to the workers and inmates the plan worked: the bodies buried are not Ray and Claude, who have gone back to New York immediately and are watching a baseball game. They are again on good terms, free and living together in [[Harlem]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Rayford \"Ray\" Gibson\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Claude Banks\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Willie Long\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Dexter Wilkins\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as \"Jangle Leg\"\n* [[Miguel A.
