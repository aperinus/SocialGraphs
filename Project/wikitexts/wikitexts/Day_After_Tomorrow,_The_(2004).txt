Based on the 1999 book ''[[The Coming Global Superstorm]]'' by [[Art Bell]] and [[Whitley Strieber]], the film stars [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Sela Ward]], [[Emmy Rossum]], and [[Ian Holm]]. It depicts catastrophic climatic effects following the disruption of the [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|North Atlantic Ocean circulation]]. A series of [[extreme weather]] events usher in [[global cooling]] and lead to a new [[ice age]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gillis |first=Justin |title=Scientists Warn of Perilous Climate Shift Within Decades, Not Centuries|journal=The New York Times|date=22 March 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/science/global-warming-sea-level-carbon-dioxide-emissions.html|access-date=March 22, 2016|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOriginally slated for release in the summer of 2003, ''The Day After Tomorrow'' premiered in [[Mexico City]] on May 17, 2004, and was released in the United States on May 28, 2004. A major commercial success, the film became the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2004]]. Filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], it is the highest-grossing Hollywood film made in Canada (adjusted for inflation). It received mixed reviews upon release, with critics highly praising the film's special effects but criticizing its writing and numerous scientific inaccuracies.\n\n==Plot==\nJack Hall, an American [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimatologist]], and his colleagues Frank and Jason, drill for ice-core samples in the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], when the ice shelf suddenly splits away. At a [[United Nations|UN]] conference in [[New Delhi]], Jack discusses his research showing that [[climate change]] could cause an [[ice age]], but [[Vice President of the United States|US Vice President]] Raymond Becker dismisses his concerns. Professor Terry Rapson, an [[Oceanography|oceanographer]] of the Hedland Centre in [[Scotland]], befriends Jack over his views of an inevitable climate shift. When several [[buoy]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] show a severe ocean temperature drop, Rapson concludes Jack's theories are correct. Jack's and Rapson's teams, along with [[NASA]] [[meteorologist]] Janet Tokada, build a forecast model based on Jack's research. Jack tries to get Becker to consider evacuations in the Northern States, but Becker again refuses.\n\nA massive [[tropical depression]] develops in the [[northern hemisphere]]. This splits into three gigantic [[hurricane]]-like superstorms above [[Canada]], Scotland, and [[Siberia]], that siphons frozen air from the upper [[troposphere]] into their center, flash-freezing anything caught in their [[Eye (cyclone)|eyes]] with temperatures below {{convert|-150|F|C|abbr=off}}. It is confirmed by Jack that the force of the storm is so strong and the effects are estimated to be so severe that the entire Northern Hemisphere would be in a new ice age once it ends. The weather worsens across the world: [[Tokyo]] is struck by a giant hail storm, [[Los Angeles]] is devastated by a [[tornado outbreak]], and three helicopters sent to rescue the [[British Royal family]] from [[Balmoral Castle]] crash in Scotland after their fuel lines and crew freeze when they fly into their superstorm's eye. \n\nIn [[New York City]], Jack's son Sam, along with his friends Brian Parks and Laura Chapman, participate in an [[United States Academic Decathlon|academic decathlon]], where they meet a new friend JD. The North American superstorm creates a massive [[tsunami]]-like [[storm surge]] that quickly inundates [[Manhattan]], forcing Sam's group to seek shelter at the [[New York Public Library]], but not before Laura accidentally cuts her leg. While she tries to free herself, she hears a [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] lady and her daughter trapped in a taxi and she turned back to help them. When the tsunami was about to approach the library, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois girl forgets to take her purse from the cab which contains her passports. Laura goes to retrieve it for her. While cellphone communications are down, Sam is able to contact Jack and his mother Lucy, a [[physician]], through a working [[payphone]]. Jack advises Sam to stay inside and warm, as the storm will only get worse, and promises to rescue him. Rapson and his team perish in the European storm. Lucy remains in a hospital caring for bed-ridden children, where she and her patients are eventually rescued by the authorities.\n\nUpon Jack's suggestion, [[President of the United States|President]] Blake orders the southern states to be evacuated into [[Mexico]] as the northern half is doomed to be hit by the superstorm, but are warned by the government to seek shelter and stay warm. The Mexicans close the border until Blake agrees to cancel all Central and Latin American debt to the USA. Jack, Jason, and Frank make their way to New York against all odds. In [[Pennsylvania]], Frank falls through the [[skylight]] of a [[Shopping mall|mall]] that had become covered in snow and sacrifices himself by cutting his [[Rope team|rope]] to prevent his friends from falling in after him.\n\nIn the library, most survivors, as well as those from other structures, decide to head south once the floodwater outside freezes, in spite of Sam's warnings. Only a few survivors end up heeding Sam's advice to stay put and [[Book burning|burn books]] to stay warm as the temperatures drop. Meanwhile, Becker is informed that Blake's motorcade got caught in the superstorm and neither of them that are involved made it to Mexico. \n \nLaura later develops [[Sepsis|blood poisoning]] from her injury, whereupon Sam, Brian, and JD scour a Russian cargo vessel that had drifted earlier into the city for [[penicillin]], fending off a pack of escaped [[Wolf|wolves]] from the [[Central Park Zoo]], narrowly escaping back to the library as the eye of the North American superstorm shortly passes over and completely freezes Manhattan. Likewise, Jack and Jason take shelter in an abandoned restaurant.\n\nDays later, the superstorms dissipate. After finding many civilians, including those who left the library, frozen to death, Jack and Jason successfully reach the library, finding Sam's group alive. Jack then sends a radio message to US forces in Mexico.\n\nIn his first address as the [[United States presidential line of succession|new president]] from the US [[embassy]] in Mexico, Becker apologizes on [[The Weather Channel]] for his ignorance, admits his mistake and sends helicopters to rescue survivors in the Northern States. Jack and Sam's group are picked up in Manhattan, where many people have survived. On the [[International Space Station]], [[astronaut]]s look down in awe at Earth's transformed surface, now with [[ice sheet]]s extending across the entire northern hemisphere, remarking that the \"air never looked so clear\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack Hall, a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimatologist]].\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Samuel \"Sam\" Hall, Jack's son.\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Dr. Lucy Hall, a [[physician]] who is Jack's wife and Sam's mother.\n* [[Emmy Rossum]] as Laura Chapman, Sam's friend and love interest.\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Terry Rapson, a Scottish [[Oceanography|oceanographer]] of Scotland's Hedland Centre.\n* [[Arjay Smith]] as Brian Parks, a high school student and Sam and Laura's friend.\n* [[Austin Nichols]] as J.D., a high school student of very wealthy parents who befriends Sam, Laura, and Brian.\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Jason Evans, Jack's colleague\n* [[Jay O.

Paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at [[Harvard University]] [[Daniel P.

On the other, I'm concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke ... We are indeed experimenting with the Earth in a way that hasn't been done for millions of years. But you're not going to see another [[ice age]] \u2013 at least not like that.\"<ref name=\"Bowles\" /> [[J.

But the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right: humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment, including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes ... Luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades (I'd be just as surprised as Jack Hall if they did occur); at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century. And the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the 'superstorm' depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences, which we should avoid.
