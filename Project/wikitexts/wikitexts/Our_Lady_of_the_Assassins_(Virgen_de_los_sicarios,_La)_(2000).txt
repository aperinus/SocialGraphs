The film follows a Colombian author in his 50s who returns to his hometown of [[Medell\u00edn]] after 30 years of absence to find himself trapped in an atmosphere of violence and murder caused by [[drug cartel]] warfare.\n\n==Plot==\nFernando meets Alexis, a handsome gay youth, at a party of one of his old friends and immediately falls for him. The two begin a relationship which, apart from the sex, consists mainly in Fernando telling Alexis how pastoral the city was when he left, while Alexis explains to Fernando the ins and outs of everyday robbery, violence, and shootings. Even though Fernando has come home to die, his sarcastic worldview is mellowed somewhat by his relationship with Alexis.\n\nHe soon discovers that Alexis is a gang member and hitman (or ''[[wikt:sicario|sicario]]'') himself, and that members of other gangs are after him. After several assassination attempts fail because of Alexis' skillful handling of his [[Beretta]], he is finally killed by two boys on a motorcycle. Fernando is partly responsible for this, as Alexis' weapon has been lost before the murder due to Fernando's suicidal impulses.\n\nFernando visits Alexis' mother and gives her some money, and then walks through the streets aimlessly when he encounters Wilmar ([[Juan David Restrepo]]), who bears a striking resemblance to Alexis, not only in his looks but in his entire manner.\n\nHe invites Wilmar for lunch and the two begin an affair, rekindling the kind of relationship he had with Alexis. Wilmar is also a killer, but it is a shocking revelation  to Fernando when he finds out that Wilmar is the one who shot Alexis. He vows to kill Wilmar, but then learns it was Alexis who started the violence by killing Wilmar's brother, calling for vengeance on him by Wilmar.\n\nWhen Wilmar goes to say goodbye to his mother before he and Fernando leave the country together, he is killed as well. Seeing that the vicious cycle of atrocities in Medell\u00edn denies happiness, Fernando presumably commits suicide, if the last scene is taken to hint at that.\n\n==Cast==\n* {{ill|Germ\u00e1n Jaramillo|es}} as Fernando\n* {{ill|Anderson Ballesteros|es}} as Alexis\n* [[Juan David Restrepo]] as Wilmar\n* {{ill|Manuel Busquets|es}} as Alfonso\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot with early [[high-definition video]] cameras ([[Sony HDW-700]]) in the year 2000. The digital video gives the film a ''[[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' look and was one of the first uses of HD video for a feature film.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Movies depicting Colombia]]\n* [[List of Colombian films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0250809|Our Lady of the Assassins}}\n* {{AllMovie title|220965|Our Lady of the Assassins}}\n\n{{Barbet Schroeder}}\n{{Colombian submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Our Lady Of The Assassins (Film)}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2000 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Colombian crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Colombian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about Colombian drug cartels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Colombian novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Barbet Schroeder]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Barbet Schroeder]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Margaret M\u00e9n\u00e9goz]]\n[[Category:Films set in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Colombia]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:French romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Romantic crime films]]\n[[Category:Spanish crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Spanish romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
