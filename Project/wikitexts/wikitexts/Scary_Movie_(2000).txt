Starring [[Anna Faris]], [[Jon Abrahams]], [[Carmen Electra]], [[Shannon Elizabeth]], [[Kurt Fuller]], [[Regina Hall]], [[Lochlyn Munro]], [[Cheri Oteri]] and [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]], it follows a group of teenagers who accidentally hit a man with their car, dump his body in a lake and never talk about it again. A year later, someone wearing a\u00a0[[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface mask and robe]]\u00a0kills them one by one.\n\nThe film is a\u00a0parody\u00a0of multiple genres including the horror, slasher, and\u00a0mystery film\u00a0genres. Several 1990s films and TV shows are also spoofed, and the script primarily follows the plot of the slasher films\u00a0''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' and\u00a0''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]''. Some films and TV shows like ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'',  ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', and ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' were also parodied in some scenes.\n\n[[Dimension Films]] released ''Scary Movie'' in the United States on July 7. The film grossed $278 million worldwide on a $19 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\u00a0The film is the first installment in the\u00a0[[Scary Movie (film series)|''Scary Movie''\u00a0film series]], and later spawned four\u00a0sequels.\n\n== Plot ==\nDrew Decker receives a threatening phone call while home alone. Drew is chased outside by somebody dressed as [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]], who stabs her in the breast, removing one of her [[silicone]] [[breast implants|implants]]. A vehicle driven by her father, who is distracted by receiving [[fellatio]] from his wife, hits her, and she looks up to her murderer just before she is stabbed by the killer.\n\n[[Cindy Campbell]] meets up with her boyfriend Bobby and her friends, Brenda, Ray, Greg, Shorty and Buffy. Various news teams, including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm, converge on the school in the wake of Drew's murder. Gail hooks up with Buffy's [[intellectually disabled]] brother Special Officer Doofy, hoping to milk the facts out of him.\n\nWhile Cindy is in class, she notices the killer watching her from outside then she receives an ominous note and realizes Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man. After football practice, Greg notices a picture of his minuscule genitals on his locker saying \"I KNOW\" on it. He accuses Ray of taking the picture and nearly fights him. Cindy tells Greg and the others about the note she got and that they need to tell the police but Greg beats her instead telling them to not involve the police, afraid of going to prison for the murder they committed the previous year.  At Buffy's beauty pageant that evening, Greg is killed by the killer in plain view while the audience mistakes Buffy's pleas for help as being part of her act of [[dramatic reading]] but Buffy wins the pageant, forgetting about Greg.\n\nAfter Cindy goes home alone, the killer attacks her but retreats when Cindy contacts the police. Bobby arrives and is arrested after a cellphone, knife and gloves fall out of his pocket. As Cindy spends the night at Buffy and Doofy's place, she receives a mocking call from the killer.\n\nThe following day, Bobby is released from jail. Buffy is [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by the killer with a [[cleaver]], though her severed head keeps talking and is subsequently locked in a lost and found bin. That night, Gail and her cameraman, Kenny, go to Lovers Lookout, a teen makeout spot, to get a murder on camera and films the killer murdering a girl named Heather. The killer then chases Gail and Kenny into the woods and murders Kenny, while Gail gives a snot-filled apology to her family, a parody of one of the scenes in ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.\n\nLater that night, Ray and Brenda go to the movie theater to see ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', where Ray is stabbed through his ear in a bathroom stall while using a [[Glory hole (sexual slang)|glory hole]]. The killer goes after Brenda but angry movie patrons, who are fed up with Brenda's rude and obnoxious behavior, begin stabbing her to make her stop and also for ruining ''Shakespeare in Love'' and several other movies like ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', the [[Jackie Chan]] movies, ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', and ''[[Big Momma's House]]'' until Brenda drops dead, much to the audience's relief.\n\nMeanwhile, Cindy throws a house party, hoping for safety in numbers. Meanwhile, Cindy's friend, Tina goes out to the garage to get more beer but is killed while trying to escape from the killer through a cat flap. During the party, Cindy and Bobby go upstairs and have sex. While in the basement, the killer shows up and gets stoned with Shorty and his friends, but ends up killing all of them except Shorty. After Cindy and Bobby have sex, the killer appears and stabs Bobby before disappearing. Cindy gets a gun from a drawer and Bobby follows. Shorty comes up from the basement, Bobby takes the gun and shoots him. Ray arrives on the scene, still alive.\n\nBobby and Ray confront Cindy in the kitchen and announce their intention to only kill her and her father, and that they are merely copying a real killer. Bobby admits being gay, while Ray denies being so. The plan backfires when Ray viciously stabs Bobby numerous times, angry because his favorite show, ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', has been canceled. The killer abruptly arrives and stabs Ray. He and Cindy fight, with Cindy employing moves copied from ''[[The Matrix]]'' and kicking him out a window. However, the killer vanishes before the police arrive.\n\nAt the police station, Cindy and the sheriff discover that the killer was not David Keegan, the man whom Cindy and her friends accidentally killed a year earlier and realize that Doofy is the killer the whole time and was faking his disability. Doofy has already escaped with Gail Hailstorm after removing his disguise, a parody of the ending of ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. Upon finding his discarded backpack with his Ghostface mask and sharp knife in the street, Cindy begins screaming but is hit by a car, as the sheriff walks away.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Shorty is presumably giving advice on how to survive a horror movie but it is actually advice on how to successfully enact a [[robbery|Snatch-and-Run]].\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Doofy is shown in his bedroom \"breaking up\" with the vacuum cleaner as though it were a real person with whom he had a relationship.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Scary Movie (film series) characters}}{{Cast listing|\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Cindy Campbell\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Doofy Gilmore/The Killer\n* [[Jon Abrahams]] as Bobby Prinze\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Shorty Meeks\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Brenda Meeks\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ray Wilkins\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Buffy Gilmore\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Greg Phillippe\n* [[Cheri Oteri]] as Gail Hailstorm\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Sheriff Burke\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Drew Decker\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Neil Campbell\n* [[Jayne Trcka]] as Miss Mann\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park]] as Teacher\n* [[David Lander|David L.
