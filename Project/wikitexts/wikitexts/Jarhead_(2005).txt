The film was directed by [[Sam Mendes]], starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Swofford with [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Lucas Black]], and [[Chris Cooper]]. ''Jarhead'' chronicles Swofford's life story and his military service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].\n\nThe film was released on November 4, 2005, by [[Universal Pictures]]. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and was a [[box office disappointment]], grossing $97 million against a budget of $72 million. Despite the film's mixed response, it spawned a [[direct-to-video]] series with three subsequent films.\n\n\"Jarhead\" is a [[List of United States Marine Corps acronyms and expressions|slang term]] used to refer to U.S. Marines.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1989, [[Anthony Swofford|Anthony \"Swoff\" Swofford]], whose father served in the earlier [[Vietnam War]] (1961-1975), attends [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|United States Marine Corps recruit training]] before being stationed at [[Camp Pendleton]], [[California]]. Claiming that he joined the military because he \"got lost on the way to college\", Swofford finds his time at Camp Pendleton difficult, and struggles to make friends. While Swofford feigns illness to avoid his responsibilities, a \"lifer\", [[Staff Sergeant]] Sykes, takes note of his potential and offers Swofford an opportunity to attend his [[Scout Sniper]] course.\n\nAfter gruelling training, the Scout Sniper course is left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate [[Corporal]] Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When [[Kuwait]] is invaded by [[Iraq]], Swofford's unit is deployed to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] as a part of \"[[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]\" in the [[Gulf War]] (1990\u20131991). Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed (known in military slang as a \"[[Jodies|Jodie]] Wall\").\n\nSwofford obtains unauthorized alcohol and organizes an impromptu Christmas party, arranging for Fergus to cover his watch so he can celebrate. Fergus accidentally sets fire to a tent while cooking some sausages and ignites a crate of flares, waking the whole camp and enraging Staff Sergeant Sykes, who demotes Swofford from [[lance corporal]] to [[Private (rank)|private]] and puts him on \"shit-burning\" detail. The punishments, combined with the heat, the boredom, and Swofford's suspicions of his girlfriend's infidelity, give Swofford a mental breakdown, to the point where he threatens Fergus with a rifle, then orders Fergus to shoot him instead.\n\nLater, [[Operation Desert Storm]] begins and the Marines are sent to the [[Saudi Arabian]]-[[Kuwait]] border. Swofford learns from Sykes that Troy concealed his criminal record when enlisting and will be discharged when the unit returns home. Troy becomes distant from his friends. Knowing that Troy will not be allowed to reenlist, the Marines attack him with a red-hot USMC branding iron, marking him as one of their own. Following an accidental air attack from friendly forces, the Marines advance through the desert, facing no enemies on the ground. The Marines march through the infamous  \"[[Highway of Death]]\" (on the northbound road leading back to Iraq from capital [[Kuwait City]]), strewn with the burnt vehicles and charred bodies of retreating Iraqi soldiers, the aftermath of a bombing campaign. The Marines later catch sight of distant [[Kuwaiti oil fires|burning Kuwaiti oil wells]], ignited only moments before by retreating Iraqis, and they attempt to dig sleeping holes as a rain of crude oil falls from the sky. Before they can finish, Sykes orders the squad to move upwind.\n\nNear the end of the war, Swofford and Troy are finally given a sniping mission. Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski, their battalion commander, orders them to kill at least one of two high-ranking [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] officers at a nearby airfield. At the last second before Swofford takes the shot, Major Lincoln interrupts them to call in an air strike. Troy desperately pleads to make a kill, but is denied and overruled as the airplanes destroy the Iraqi airfield, much to his and Swofford's disappointment. The war ends without Swofford ever firing his rifle. During a monologue, Swofford realizes that all of his training and effort to achieve the elite status as a marine sniper is meaningless in modern warfare.\n\nAfter returning home the Marines parade through a town in a jovial celebration of victory. Swofford returns home to his family and girlfriend but discovers she has a new boyfriend. He is a Private now. Fowler is seen with a prostitute in a bar, now as a Corporal, Kruger in a corporate boardroom, Escobar as a supermarket employee, Cortez as a father of three children, and Sykes continuing his service as a [[first sergeant]] in the [[Iraq War]]. Later, Swofford learns of Troy's death during a surprise visit from Fergus. He attends his funeral, reunites with some of his old friends and afterwards reminisces about the effects of the war.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- Names are as credited and in credits order; please do not change. -->\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Lance Corporal / Private / Corporal [[Anthony Swofford]]\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]] as Drill Instructor Fitch\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Corporal Alan Troy\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Staff Sergeant Sykes\n* [[Lucas Black]] as Lance Corporal Chris Kruger\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Private First Class Fergus O'Donnell\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Private First Class Juan Cortez\n* [[Laz Alonso]] as Lance Corporal Ramon Escobar\n* [[Jocko Sims]] as Julius\n* [[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]] as Private First Class Dave Fowler\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Major Lincoln\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Corporal Harrigan\n* [[Rini Bell]] as Swoff's sister\n* [[Brianne Davis]] as Kristina \n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tobey Maguire]] were considered for the role of Anthony Swofford.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2005/08/12/jarhead-2/|title=Jarhead|website=EW.com}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a score of 61% based on 201 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10.
