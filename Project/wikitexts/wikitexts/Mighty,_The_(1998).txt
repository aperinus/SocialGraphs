Based on the book ''[[Freak the Mighty]]'' by [[Rodman Philbrick]], the film stars [[Sharon Stone]], [[Gena Rowlands]], [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Kieran Culkin]], [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Elden Henson]].\n\n==Plot==\nKevin \"Freak\" Dillon ([[Kieran Culkin]]) is a 12-year-old boy suffering from [[Morquio syndrome]] and living with his mother Gwen Dillon ([[Sharon Stone]]). He is extremely intelligent and is obsessed with flights of fancy, but due to his disability, he walks with leg braces and crutches. Meanwhile, Maxwell \"Max\" Kane ([[Elden Henson]]) is a 14-year-old beastly yet good-natured boy with learning challenges and living with his maternal grandparents Susan \"Gram\" ([[Gena Rowlands]]) and Elton \"Grim\" Pinneman ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]). He has flunked the seventh grade twice and is tormented by Tony \"Blade\" Fowler (Joseph Perrino), a teenage delinquent who is the leader of a teenage bully gang named the \"Doghouse Boys\". When Kevin is assigned as Max's reading tutor, they form a bond of friendship over the similar circumstances they share, such as both being outcasts in their school and their fathers abandoning them.\n\nFreak and Max go to a local festival to watch a firework show where they get attacked by Blade and his gang. The two then escape into a nearby lake with Freak riding on Max's shoulders. Freak later witnesses the \"Doghouse Boys\" putting someone's purse in a sewer. The two retrieve the purse but are once again confronted by Blade and his gang. They attempt to attack Freak, but Max stops them by picking up a manhole cover and throwing it at the gang, forcing them to flee in a panic. Max and Freak find that the purse belongs to a woman named Loretta Lee ([[Gillian Anderson]]). They return the purse to Loretta who is married to Iggy Lee ([[Meat Loaf]]), a former gang leader. The couple are old friends of Max's father Kenny \"Killer\" Kane ([[James Gandolfini]]) who is currently in prison for the strangulation murder of Max's mother when Max was four years old, which Max witnessed.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Max is kidnapped by Killer Kane who has been released on parole and is taken to Iggy and Loretta's apartment, where he is tied up. Loretta attempts to help Max escape but Killer attempts to strangle her. Max's seeing the attack prompts a repressed memory of Killer Kane killing his mother; he breaks free of his bonds and attacks his own father.\n\nFreak tracks Max and Killer Kane to Iggy and Loretta's apartment and breaks in, armed with a squirt gun he claims is loaded with sulfuric acid which he got for Christmas, which he sprays in Killer Kane's eyes. Just before an angered Killer Kane regains himself and attempts to hurt Freak, Max tackles him through the wall where the police are waiting; Killer Kane is then returned to prison for life without the possibility of parole while Freak and Max run home to have Christmas dinner together along with Gwen, Grim and Gram. While exchanging Christmas gifts, Freak gives Max a blank book and tells him to write in it. That night, Freak dies in his sleep due to heart problems in which the next morning Max hears the news from Gram and gives chase to the ambulance on foot. Max recalls the research center Freak had mentioned earlier and rushes there, only to discover that Freak lied: the research center in question is nothing other than a commercial laundromat. Heartbroken, Max breaks down in grief among the laundry workers.\n\nThe following weeks, Max continues attending school but spends his spare time locked in the basement, even missing Freak's funeral and seeing Gwen moving away. He later runs into Loretta at a bus stop, who advises him that \"doing nothing's a drag, kid\". He takes this advice to heart and even works up the courage to answer a question from his teacher during a lecture. Inspired by their bond, Max remembers Freak and all the adventures they had so he decides to write it all in the empty book Freak had given him for Christmas. Max gets writer's block on the last page and puts an illustration of [[King Arthur]]'s grave which reads \"Here Lies King Arthur, Once and Future King\", to symbolize his belief that he will see Freak again. Max then takes Freak's ornithopter and winds it up, making it fly. As the ornithopter flies off, a narration by Max is heard:\n\n{{cquote|And by the time we get here, which I guess should be the end, you're gonna know the story of Freak the Mighty, who slayed dragons, saved maidens and walked high above the world.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Maxwell \"Max\" Kane/The Mighty\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Kevin Dillon/Freak\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Gwen \"The Fair Gwen Of Air\" Dillon\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Susan \"Gram\" Pinneman\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Elton \"Grim\" Pinneman\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Kenneth \"Kenny\" David Kane aka \"Killer\" Kane\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Loretta Lee\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Iggy Lee\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Mrs. Addison\n* [[Joseph Perrino]] as Tony \"Blade\" Fowler \n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Doghouse Boy #1\n* Michael Colton as Doghouse Boy #2\n* Daniel Lee as Doghouse Boy #3\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews, currently holding a 75% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 40 critics; the consensus simply states: \"Spirited and sweet with an emphasis on the healing power of friendship, ''The Mighty'' is a modest charmer that comes by its whimsy honestly.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|mighty|The Mighty}}</ref>\n\n''The Mighty'' was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]] for Best Supporting Actress ([[Sharon Stone]]) and Best Original Song (\"The Mighty\").\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0119670|The Mighty}}\n* {{allrovi movie|158888|The Mighty}}\n* {{mojo title|mighty|The Mighty}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mighty|The Mighty}}\n\n{{Peter Chelsom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mighty, The}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cincinnati]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Chelsom]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Carmody]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Trevor Jones]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about disability]]"}]}}}}
