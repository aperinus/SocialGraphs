The film also stars [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Levon Helm]], and [[Ned Beatty]].<ref name=\"Shooter 2007\" /> It was produced by [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] through [[Di Bonaventura Pictures]], and released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States on March 23, 2007.  It grossed $95.7 million on a $61 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] [[Scout/Sniper|sniper]] Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger and his spotter Corporal Donnie Fenn are in [[Eritrea]] to cover the retreat of an allied convoy after a mission.  However, enemy militia vehicles and a helicopter gunship ambush Swagger and Fenn, and the Marines' CIA support team abandons them, resulting in Fenn's death. \n\nThree years later, a retired Swagger lives in isolation in the mountains of Wyoming.  At the office of a [[private military company]] in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]],[[Virginia]], retired US Army Colonel Isaac Johnson and his associates, Payne and Dobbler, review Swagger's file. Swagger is approached by Johnson, who requests him for his skills and expertise, in hopes of thwarting an attempt on the President's life that intelligence sources have uncovered.\n\nSwagger helps them determine where and how the attempt will likely be made, in Philadelphia. On the day, Swagger accompanies Johnson and his men to a room overlooking the site. However, the situation turns out to be a setup: the shot is fired according to Swagger's plan, killing the President\u2019s guest, Ethiopian Archbishop Desmond Mutumbo. Swagger is shot by a Philadelphia police officer on Johnson's payroll, and one of his rifles and ammunition are left at the scene to frame him for the assassination. Swagger narrowly escapes, incapacitating rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis and stealing his bureau vehicle.\n\nSwagger manages to stay alive long enough to track down Fenn's widow, Sarah, who treats his wounds. After recovering, Swagger goes after Johnson and his associates. Agent Memphis, who had been skeptical of Swagger's guilt from the beginning after doing a deep dive on Swagger's background and the circumstances surrounding the shooting, is abducted by Johnson\u2019s men and tortured for information. Swagger kills them, frees Memphis and asks for his help.\n\nThe duo drive to Tennessee where they meet with a firearms expert, Mr. Rate, who tells them that it is possible for a bullet to be fired from one rifle but made to look like it came from another, through a technique called [[Cast bullet#Paper-patched bullets|paper patching]], in this case a round Swagger fired from his rifle at a can of stew a week before the assassination. Dobbler informs Johnson of Swagger's annual correspondence with Sarah, arranging for her kidnapping by Payne to be used as leverage.\n\nRate advises that Bosnian sniper using the alias Michael Sandor is the only working sniper capable of the shot. Swagger and Memphis eliminate the contractors guarding Sandor's rural Virginia home. Sczerbiak informs Swagger that Johnson works for U.S. Senator Charles Meachum, who leads a conglomerate exploiting economic assets in developing countries. The Archbishop was assassinated as he was about to speak about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia by the organization, such as wiping out an entire village so an oil pipeline could be laid. Swagger discovers he unwittingly provided [[Overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] to the men who killed the villagers during the mission that killed Fenn. After revealing Sarah's abduction, Sandor commits suicide.\n\nSwagger arranges a meet with Johnson and Meachum in Montana, while also tipping off the FBI. The two arrive with Payne holding Sarah at gunpoint. Memphis acts as a decoy to draw fire from Johnson's snipers, allowing Swagger to eliminate them and free Sarah, who shoots and kills Payne. Swagger confronts Meachum, replaying the recording of Sandor's confession. However, after Meachum further alludes to how big the corruption is, Swagger burns the recording, realizing it will only get him killed.\n\nThe FBI arrive and take Swagger into custody. Later, he is allowed a private meeting with Attorney General Russert, Johnson, and personnel from the FBI, including Memphis. Swagger's rifle, left at the assassination, is brought in. He proves to them that the rifle will not fire because he installs incorrect [[firing pin]]s in his guns whenever he leaves home. Though the evidence proves Swagger's innocence, Russert is unable to charge Johnson for crimes perpetrated outside of American jurisdiction.\n\nRussert privately intimates to Swagger that extrajudicial means may be necessary to clean up the corruption. Sometime after the meeting, Johnson is visiting with Meachum in the latter's mountain cabin. Swagger kills everyone inside, destroys the cabin, then hikes several miles to Sarah, waiting with a vehicle.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Bob Lee Swagger]]\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Nick Memphis\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Colonel Isaac Johnson\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Sarah Fenn\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Jack Payne\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Alourdes Galindo\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Michael Sandor\n* [[Levon Helm]] as Mr. Rate\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Senator Charles F.

The author [[Stephen Hunter]] also tried to adapt the book but was put off by the experience and disconnected himself from the process.<ref name=\"latimes-fernandez\" />\nJonathan Lemkin read the book and some of the previous drafts and was able to avoid repeating some of the same mistakes. Lemkin updated the story away from the original post Vietnam setting, and restructured the story bringing the main event to the end of the first act, and to cut the multiple plot lines down to just the A story. His [[Screenwriting#Rewriting and script doctoring|page 1 rewrite]] of the screenplay attracted Wahlberg and Fuqua, and on his second draft, the film got the green light to go into production. Unusual for a screenplay with such a long development process and multiple rewrites, Lemkin retained sole credit after [[Writers Guild of America]] arbitration.<ref name=\"latimes-fernandez\">{{cite news |date=March 21, 2007 |last1=Fernandez |first1=Jay A. |title=A keen eye, and a dead-on aim |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/21/entertainment/et-scriptland21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927062622/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/21/entertainment/et-scriptland21 |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nMost of the film was shot on location in [[New Westminster]], [[Kamloops]], [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]], [[Ashcroft, British Columbia|Ashcroft]] and [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adventurekamloops.ca/home_showSection_ID_621.html |title=Stories and Legends about Kamloops, British Columbia |publisher=www.AdventureKamloops.ca |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164217/http://adventurekamloops.ca/home_showSection_ID_621.html |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |access-date=October 20, 2018}}</ref> For example, Swagger's escape was filmed in New Westminster along the [[Fraser River]], standing in for the [[Delaware River]]. The car chase that ends when it plunged into the river was filmed down 6th Street and off the Westminster Quay. The following scene of Swagger clinging to the side of a [[dredger]] was also filmed on the Fraser River near the [[Pattullo Bridge]].\n\nThe assassination scenes were filmed in [[Independence National Historical Park]] in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]]. The sniper location was created from using the exteriors of the church steeple at the junction of New Street and North 4th Street and combining them with an elevated view from another building to create a fictional vista of the park. The final scene was in [[Mammoth Lakes, California]], in the lakes basin.\n\nThe mountaintop confrontation was shot on the [[glacier]]s of [[Rainbow Mountain (British Columbia)|Rainbow Mountain]], near the resort town of [[Whistler, British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Shooter Movie Production Notes {{!}} 2007 Movie Releases |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2007/shooter.htm |website=Made in Atlantis |access-date=October 18, 2021 |date=August 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Weapons and tactics===\n''Shooter'' depicts a number of sniper tactics, thanks to the guidance of former US Marine scout sniper Patrick Garrity, who trained Mark Wahlberg for the film. Garrity taught Wahlberg to shoot both left- and right-handed (the actor is left-handed), as he had to switch shooting posture throughout the movie, due to Swagger's sustained injuries. He was also trained to adjust a weapon's scope, judge effects of wind on a shot, do rapid bolt manipulation, and develop special breathing skills. His training included extreme distance shooting (up to {{convert|1100|yd|km}}, and the use of camouflage [[ghillie suit]]s. Fuqua appointed Garrity as the film's military-technical advisor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/shooter/about4.php |title=Shooter (2007) - Wahlberg Goes To Sniper School: About Training As A Shooter |work=VisualHollywood.com |access-date=November 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930131546/http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/shooter/about4.php |archive-date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the special features of the DVD, Garrity is interviewed pointing out that the shot fired in the assassination would not have hit the archbishop straight on, as in the film. When a round is fired it will fall from {{convert|30|to|40|ft|m|sigfig=1}} depending on the distance of the shot. To compensate, the round is fired at an arc calibrated by how far the round is going to fall, the distance of the shot, temperature, humidity, and wind. In his interview, Garrity said \"At {{convert|2|yd|m}}, because of the [[hydrostatic shock]] that follows a large-caliber, high-velocity round such as the [[.408 Chey Tac]] (which is used in the shot), the target would literally be peeled apart and limbs would be flying {{convert|200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} away.\" The exit wound on the archbishop's head would have been too extreme to show in movie theaters. Instead, the movie depicts a much less graphic representation of the assassination.\n\nThroughout the film, Swagger uses an array of sniper rifles, including the USMC [[M40A3]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16981 |title=Patrick Garrity, Shooter Interview |access-date=July 17, 2009 |work=UGO.com |last=Rogers |first=Troy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022025306/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16981 |archive-date=October 22, 2008}}</ref> the [[CheyTac Intervention]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/shooter/4973 |title=Blu-ray review of 'Shooter' |date=July 31, 2007 |access-date=July 17, 2009 |work=DVDTown.com |last=Winkelspecht |first=Dean |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401185633/http://www.dvdtown.com/reviews/shooter/4973 |archive-date=April 1, 2009}}</ref> and the [[Barrett M82]].\n\n==Music==\n{{Anchor|Score}}\nThe score to the film was composed by [[Mark Mancina]], who recorded the music at the [[Todd-AO]] Scoring Stage in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]], using a 77-piece orchestra conducted by [[Don Harper]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=https://www.scoringsessions.com/2007/03/15/mark-mancina-scores-shooter |title=Mark Mancina scores 'Shooter' |work=ScoringSessions.com |date=March 15, 2007 |access-date=February 29, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scoringsessions.com/sessions/23379 |title=Shooter (2007) |website=ScoringSessions.com |access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> A score soundtrack was released by [[Lakeshore Records]] and co-published by [[Shoelace Music]]<ref>{{Citation|title=Mark Mancina - Shooter (Music From The Motion Picture)|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/10323341-Mark-Mancina-Shooter-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture|language=en|access-date=2022-02-17}}</ref> on March 27, 2007.
