The screenplay was written by [[Jim Kouf]], who won a 1988 [[Edgar Award]] for his work. Although the story is set in [[Seattle]], the film was shot in [[Vancouver]]. A sequel, ''[[Another Stakeout]]'', followed in 1993.\n\nThe film later inspired the 1989 [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]]-language movie ''[[Vandanam]]'' and 1991 [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]]-language movie ''[[Nirnayam (1991 film)|Nirnayam]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- A plot summary is usually 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nDetectives Chris Lecce and Bill Reimers are assigned to the night shift on a [[stakeout]] of Latina waitress Maria McGuire. Her former boyfriend, Richard \"Stick\" Montgomery, has escaped from prison following a staged brawl with his cellmate with help from his cousin, Caylor Reese, who escaped with him in a truck.\n\nThe FBI asks for cooperation from Lecce and Reimers in capturing Montgomery. They believe he may return to an old girlfriend, Maria McGuire, who lives in Seattle. Meanwhile Lecce is going through a divorce. He comes home and finds out that his wife moved out, taking the furniture and leaving him in despair.\n\nMontgomery telephones Maria but the line gets cut off so the call cannot be traced. He has a large amount of money he secretly hid in an armchair prior to his incarceration. Lecce and Reimers spy on Maria, hoping Montgomery will turn up at her door so they can arrest him. Lecce pretends to be a telephone lineman, to get close to Maria. He also helps her brother Ray to get a job to stay out of trouble.\n\nFate takes a turn as Lecce falls in love with Maria and the Seattle police suspect him as being one of Montgomery's allies. While Lecce is asleep in Maria's bed, Montgomery and Reese break into her house, with Montgomery shooting Lecce in the face. Lecce wakes up, however, to find out it was only a nightmare. Realizing he slept in, he must leave the house without being seen. At the police station, Reimers scolds him for sleeping with Maria, and reminds him he's a good cop who made one mistake.\n\nAfter killing a cashier in a gas station, Montgomery and Reese have a run-in with several officers waiting for them outside Seattle, causing a shootout and their car crashes into the river. Montgomery escapes from the vehicle before it sinks, but Reese is wounded and dies in the sunken car.\n\nLecce tells his secret to Maria, but she starts to get upset, only to run into Montgomery, who tells Chris and Maria that he stashed half-million dollars in a couch that he bought for her years prior. He was hoping that he and Maria would have a great life together in Canada, but Lecce ruined it.\n\nAfter capturing Reimers, Montgomery plans to murder both cops. The climax of the film takes place at a paper mill, where Lecce and Montgomery have a shootout, resulting in Montgomery being shot in the chest. Maria and Lecce start a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Detective Chris Lecce\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Detective Bill Reimers\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Richard \"Stick\" Montgomery\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Maria McGuire\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Detective Jack Pismo\n* [[Dan Lauria]] as Detective Phil Coldshank\n* [[Earl Billings]] as Captain Al Giles\n* [[Ian Tracey]] as Caylor Reese\n* [[Jackson Davies]] as FBI Agent Thomas Lusk\n* J.
