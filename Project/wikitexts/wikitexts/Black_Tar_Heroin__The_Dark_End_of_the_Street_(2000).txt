Filmed from 1995 to 1998 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California]], the documentary describes the lives of [[heroin]] addicts.\n\n==Overview==\nThe film follows a simple structure, and shows the drug-related degradation of five youths (Jake, Tracey, Jessica, Alice, Oreo) during the course of three years.  The film depicts their [[drug-related crime]]s and diseases, including [[prostitution]], [[male prostitution]], [[AIDS]], and lethal [[overdose]]s.\n\nIn a 2004 follow up interview with Tracey Helton, she reveals she is now a full-time drug counselor, while Jessica is still working as a prostitute despite having HIV. Alice McMunn has been sober since 02.20.01; she is a model and professional exotic dancer. Oreo's whereabouts are unknown; his girlfriend Jennifer went to treatment. After she relapsed, she later died from a drug induced asthma attack while on Shotwell St. in San Francisco. Her friend, Kari Guilinger, attempted to give her CPR with the help of a FoodsCo employee while waiting for paramedics to arrive, but were unable to save her life. She was pronounced dead upon arrival at Davies County Hospital. Jake overcame his heroin addiction and began methadone treatment. Shortly after stopping his methadone and the break-up with his first clean and sober girlfriend, Jake was found dead of a drug overdose in January 2002. Tracey's boyfriend, Ben, died of an overdose just one week after being released from jail on a burglary charge.\n\nIn a further update on YouTube, Tracey known as traceyh415, revealed she had earned a master's degree, married and become a mother to three kids; as of July 2015 update, she stated she was 16 years clean. She has written one book already and has a second one \"The Big Fix: Hope After Heroin\" on the way. Tracey works in the community she used to use drugs in, helping those who suffer from addiction.<ref name=\"reddit\">{{cite podcast\n| url=http://upvoted.libsyn.com/031-the-heroine-of-heroin\n| title=031: The Heroine of Heroin\n| website=Upvoted by Reddit\n| publisher=Reddit\n| host=alexis ohanian\n| date=2015-08-13\n| time=\n| access-date=2015-08-25\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219125612/http://upvoted.libsyn.com/031-the-heroine-of-heroin\n| archivedate=2016-02-19\n| url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nTracy Helton posted a comment on the 2004 update video on YouTube that reads as follows: \u201cOreo, Jessica, Alice, and myself are all clean.
