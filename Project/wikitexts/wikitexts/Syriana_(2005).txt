The [[Emirate]]'s [[foreign minister]], Prince Nasir, has granted [[natural gas]] drilling rights to a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and the U.S. government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to Kazakhstan's [[Tengiz Field]]. If Connex-Killen were a country, it would rank as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] have concerns. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption.\n\n===Emir storyline===\nBryan Woodman is an American energy analyst based in Geneva. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the Emir at his private estate in [[Marbella]], Spain, to offer his company's services. The Emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai, shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted.\n\nIn reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the Emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth $75 million. Woodman though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir wants to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms, in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government, which has been supported by American interests. His father, at the urging of the American government with the help of Whiting and his law firm, names the younger Meshal as his successor, causing Nasir to attempt a coup.\n\n===Assassination storyline===\nBob Barnes is a veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer trying to stop illegal arms trafficking in the [[Middle East]]. While on assignment in Tehran to kill two arms dealers, Barnes notices that one of two [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missiles]] intended to be used in a bombing was diverted to an Egyptian, while the other explodes and kills the two arms dealers. The dealers are later revealed to be Iranian Intelligence agents. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job. However, unaccustomed to the political discretion required, he quickly embarrasses the wrong people by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir, whom the CIA identifies as being the financier behind the Egyptian's acquisition of the missile. Prior to his reassignment, Barnes confides in his ex-CIA officer friend, Stan Goff, that he will return to [[Lebanon]]. Goff advises him to clear his presence with [[Hezbollah]] so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon, obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader, and hires a mercenary named Mussawi to help kidnap and kill Nasir. But Mussawi has become an Iranian agent and has Barnes abducted. Mussawi tortures Barnes and prepares to behead him, but the Hezbollah leader arrives and stops him.\n\nWhen the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast the agency's intention to kill Nasir, they set Barnes up as a scapegoat, portraying him as a rogue officer. Barnes's boss, Terry George, worries that Barnes might talk about the Nasir assassination plan and that killing Nasir with a drone would make it obvious as an American-backed assassination. He has Barnes's passports revoked, locks him out of his computer at work, and initiates an investigation of him. Barnes, however, learns from Goff that Whiting, working on behalf of a group of businessmen calling themselves The Committee to Liberate Iran, is responsible for Barnes's blackballing and the assassination, and threatens Whiting and his family unless he halts the investigation and releases Barnes's passports.\n\nBarnes returns to the Middle East and approaches Prince Nasir's convoy to warn him of the assassination plan. As he arrives, a guided bomb from a circling Predator drone strikes the automobile of Nasir and his family, killing them and Barnes instantly. Woodman, having earlier offered his seat in Nasir's car to a member of the prince's family, survives the drone strike and goes home to his wife and remaining son.\n\n===Wasim storyline===\nPakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan and his son Wasim board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery, only to discover that they have been laid off. Since the company had provided food and lodging, the workers face the threat of deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work but is refused because he doesn't speak good Arabic. Wasim and his friend join a madrasa to learn Arabic in order to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer, they meet a charismatic Islamic fundamentalist, the same man who received the missing Tehran missile, who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen tanker using the missile.\n\n===Merger storyline===\nBennett Holiday meets with Dean Whiting, who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in [[Kazakhstan]]. While investigating Connex-Killen's records, Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that leads back to a transaction between Texas oilman and Killen colleague Danny Dalton and Kazakh officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery, and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton that he will likely be charged with corruption in order to serve as a \"body\" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. [[U.S. Attorney]] Donald Farish III then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton, but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with the CEO of Killen Oil, Jimmy Pope, and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body in order to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm above him would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough, the DOJ would stop the investigation and allow the merger.\n\nHoliday is brought by his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt to meet with the Chairman & CEO of Connex Oil, Leland \"Lee\" Janus. Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body, thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to accept the \"Oil Industry Man of the Year\" award with a load taken off his shoulders.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kayvan Novak]] as Arash\n* [[George Clooney]] as Bob Barnes\n* [[Amr Waked]] as Mohammed Sheik Agiza\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Dean Whiting\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Bennett Holiday\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Jimmy Pope\n* [[Robert Foxworth]] as Tommy Barton\n* [[Nicky Henson]] as Sydney Hewitt\n* [[Nicholas Art]] as Riley Woodman\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Bryan Woodman\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Julie Woodman\n* [[Steven Hinkle]] as Max Woodman\n* [[Daisy Torm\u00e9]] as Rebecca\n* [[Peter Gerety]] as Leland Janus\n* [[Richard Lintern]] as Bryan's Boss\n* [[Jocelyn Quivrin]] as Vincent\n* [[Mazhar Munir]] as Wasim Khan\n* [[Shahid Ahmed]] as Saleem Ahmed Khan\n* [[Roger Yuan]] as Chinese Engineer\n* [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Division Chief\n* [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]] as Fred Franks\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Terry\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Robby Barnes\n* [[Nadim Sawalha]] as Emir Hamed Al-Subaai\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai\n* [[William Charles Mitchell]] as Bennett Holiday Sr.\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Danny Dalton\n* [[David Clennon]] as Donald\n* [[William Hurt]] as Stan\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Mussawi\n* [[Will McCormack]] as Willy\n* [[Michael Allinson]] as Sir David\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWhile working on ''Traffic'', Stephen Gaghan began to see parallels between drug addiction and America's dependency on foreign oil.<ref name=\"Grady\">{{cite news| last = Grady| first = Pam| title = ''Syriana'', Staccato Style| work = FilmStew| date = December 16, 2005| url = http://www.filmstew.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ContentID=12969| access-date = 2009-04-15 }}</ref> Another source of inspiration came from 9/11 and Gaghan's lack of knowledge about the Middle East.

In a December 2005 interview, Baer told [[NPR]] that the title is a [[metaphor]] for foreign intervention in the Middle East, referring to post-[[World War I]] [[think tank]] strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state (such as [[Iraq]], created from elements of the former [[Ottoman Empire]]) that ensured continued western access to crude oil.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-CIA Agent Robert Baer, Inspiration for 'Syriana' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5041385 |access-date=11 April 2019 |publisher=NPR |date=6 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe movie's website states that \"\u2018Syriana\u2019 is a real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syrianamovie.warnerbros.com/about.html|title=Syriana Blu-ray|work=www.WBShop.com}}</ref> Gaghan said he saw Syriana as \"a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs.\"<ref>[[Stephen Gaghan]]'s [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/11/14/DI2005111400923.html discussion] with [[Washington Post|''The Washington Post'']] in November 2005</ref>\nThe word ''Syriana'' derives from ''Syria'' + the Latin suffix ''-ana''; it means, roughly, \"in the manner of Syria.\"  Historically, [[Syria]] refers not to the state that since 1944 has borne the name, but to a [[region of Syria|more extensive land]] stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the middle Euphrates River and the western edge of the desert steppe, and from the Tauric system of mountains in the north to the edge of the Sinai desert in the south.  This land was part of the [[Fertile Crescent]], and has historically been a geopolitically crucial junction for trade routes from the east, from Asia Minor and the Aegean, and from Egypt, and has long been a focus of great power conflicts.  The word ''Syria'' does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew original of the Scriptures]], but appears in the [[Septuagint]] as the translation of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. Herodotus speaks of \"Syrians\" as identical with [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], but the term's geographical significance was not well defined in pre-Greek and Greek times. As an ethnic term, \"Syrian\" came to refer in Antiquity to [[Semitic people]]s living outside Mesopotamian and Arabian areas.

The website's consensus states, \"Ambitious, complicated, intellectual, and demanding of its audience, ''Syriana'' is both a gripping geopolitical thriller and wake-up call to the complacent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/syriana/|title=Syriana|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=9 December 2005}}</ref> The film has a score of 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 40 critics indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/syriana|title=Syriana|work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nAs a motion picture, the main criticism, even among reviewers who praised the film, was the confusion created by following numerous stories. Most critics stated that it was almost impossible to follow the plot, though some, notably [[Roger Ebert]], praised precisely that quality of the film and offered an interesting hidden story possibility (a covert deal between the U.S. and China involving oil being shipped through Kazakhstan and passed off as coming from a different source).<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| title = ''Syriana''| work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date = December 8, 2005| url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/syriana-2005| access-date = 2020-12-09 }}</ref> The audience confusion mimics the confusion of the characters, who are enmeshed in the events around them without a clear understanding of what precisely is going on.
