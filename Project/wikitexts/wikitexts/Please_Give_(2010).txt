It is the fourth film Keener and Holofcener have made together. The film also stars [[Amanda Peet]], [[Oliver Platt]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[Lois Smith]], Elizabeth Keener, [[Kevin Corrigan]], and [[Ann Morgan Guilbert|Ann Guilbert]]. This was also Guilbert's last film role before her death in 2016.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{More plot|date=November 2015}}\nKate (Keener) and Alex (Platt) are a couple living in a New York City apartment with their teenage daughter, Abby ([[Sarah Steele]]).  Kate and Alex own a furniture store specializing in used [[modern furniture]], which they buy at [[estate sale]]s. They have bought the apartment adjacent to theirs, but its occupant, the elderly and cranky Andra (Guilbert), will stay in it until she dies.  Andra has two granddaughters, the dutiful and generous Rebecca (Hall), a  [[Radiographer|Mammography Technologist]], and the cynical, sharp-tongued Mary (Peet), a [[cosmetologist]].\n\nKate is troubled by the profits she makes from furniture sellers who do not know the value of what they are selling; the contrast between homeless people in her neighborhood and her own comfortable life; and the fact that her family will only be able to expand their apartment when Andra dies. She tries to assuage her guilt through volunteer jobs (which leave her weeping) and donations to homeless individuals (which sometimes backfire).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Kate\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Alex\n* [[Ann Morgan Guilbert]] as Andra\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Mary\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Rebecca\n* Elizabeth Keener as Cathy\n* [[Sarah Steele]] as Abby\n\n==Release==\n''Please Give'' was screened out of competition at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]], and had a limited U.S. release on April 30, 2010.
