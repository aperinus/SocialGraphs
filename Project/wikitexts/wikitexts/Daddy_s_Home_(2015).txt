The film was released on December 25, 2015, by [[Paramount Pictures]] and grossed $242 million worldwide, becoming Ferrell's highest-grossing [[live-action film]].  It has a 31% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which criticizes the lack of funny ideas and not fully exploring the premise.<ref name=rt/> A sequel, ''[[Daddy's Home 2]]'', was released on November 10, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nMild-mannered radio executive Brad Whitaker tries hard to be a good stepfather to his wife Sara's two children, Megan and Dylan, and is seemingly sterile after an accident to his testicles some years ago. The kids are finally getting closer to him: Dylan confides in him about some older bullies at school and Megan asks him to take her to the father/daughter dance at her school.\n\nOne night, Dusty Mayron, Sara's ex and the kids' biological father, calls discovering Sara's married to Brad, and announces he will be visiting the next day. She hesitates to let him into their home, but Brad convinces her it is important for the kids to see their father and stepfather establish a respectful relationship.\n\nWhen Dusty arrives, he immediately intimidates Brad by his tough and muscular appearance and his charm with Megan and Dylan. He talks Brad into letting him stay, despite Sara warning about his true nature. Brad soon wises up when it becomes clear he intends to drive Brad out of his kids' lives and reconcile with Sara. After Dusty shows him up repeatedly - getting the kids a dog, finishing a treehouse Brad had been building with Dylan, he makes Brad seem racist after unwillingly firing handyman Griffin after a fiasco with Dusty's motorcycle.\n\nDusty tries to drive a wedge between Brad and Sara by taking them to a fertility doctor, hoping that Brad's inability to impregnate her will send her back into Dusty's arms. Still, the two men appear to reach an understanding after working together to teach Dylan how to defend himself. Additionally, the couple is overjoyed to learn that Brad's sperm count has increased significantly, giving them hope of having a child together.\n\nHowever, Brad is stunned when Dusty reveals that he still intends to drive him out of the family. Desperate, Brad spends tens of thousands of dollars on early Christmas gifts, including a pony and $18,000 tickets to an [[NBA]] match. At the game, Dusty once again shows him up by revealing himself to be friends with the coach of Dylan's favorite team, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and an enraged Brad begins drinking heavily.\n\nDuring half-time, Brad is chosen to try to shoot a basketball to win a prize. Drunk, he goes on a rant about Dusty before accidentally pelting a [[New Orleans Pelicans]] cheerleader and a disabled child in a wheelchair in the face with basketballs. Humiliated, Brad moves out of the house; however, when Dusty tries to comfort Sara, she rejects him, and forces him to step up as a dad to help his kids with their busy schedules.\n\nFour days later, Brad is living in his office at work, depressed. Dusty, meanwhile, is overwhelmed by the responsibilities of being a full-time father. When Dusty decides to call it quits and leave on the day of Megan's father-daughter dance, his friend Griff convinces Brad to fight for his family. Finding Dusty at a bar, he tries to get him to come back. Dusty admits that he cannot handle the hard parts about being a father, and admires Brad for putting up with everything. Brad says that all of the terrible parts about being a dad are worth it, because in the end he is doing it for his kids. This convinces Dusty to go to the dance, and they arrive together.\n\nThere, they discover that the classmate who was picking on Dylan at school is a girl named Serendipity. They almost fight her father when Dylan physically retaliates, doing what Brad and Dusty taught him to do earlier in the movie, when they were under the impression that the bully was male. However, Dusty finally decides to follow Brad's lead on being a father, and instead quells the fight by starting a dance-off. Brad and Sara reconcile, and Dusty decides to stay and be a good \"co-dad\" to his kids.\n\nOne-year later, the whole family is happy; Brad and Sara have a new baby boy named after Griffin, and Megan and Dylan have finally accepted Brad as their stepfather. Dusty now has a job as a Panda DJ, becomes wealthy through his work, has moved in across the street in a castle he built there, and he and Brad are now friends.\n\nDusty remarries to Karen, who has a daughter Adrianna, thus Dusty becomes a stepfather himself. Sara is immediately intimidated by her; she feels Karen's looks surpass hers and she is jealous of the latter's professions as a doctor and a novelist. In an ironic twist of fate, Dusty is now in exactly the same position that he put Brad in a year ago \u2013 visibly intimidated by his stepdaughter's more muscular father, Roger.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Brad Whitaker \n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Dusty Mayron \n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Sara Whitaker\n* [[Scarlett Estevez]] as Megan Mayron\n* [[Owen Vaccaro]] as Dylan Mayron\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Leo Holt\n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Griff\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Dr. Emilio Francisco\n* [[Bill Burr]] as Jerry\n* [[Jamie Denbo]] as Doris\n* [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] as Karen\n* [[Didi Costine]] as Adrianna\n* [[John Cena]] as Roger (cameo)\n* [[Mark L.
