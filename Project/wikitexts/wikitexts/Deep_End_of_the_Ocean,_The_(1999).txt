It is based on the [[The Deep End of the Ocean|1996 novel of the same name]] by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]], a bestseller that was the very first novel selected by [[Oprah Winfrey]] to be discussed on ''[[Oprah's Book Club]]'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/pastselections/20080701_orig_list/4 |title=Oprah Book Club books - 1996 to 1997 |publisher=oprah.com |access-date=2009-12-24}}</ref> The film tells the story of a family\u2019s reaction, when Ben, the youngest son is kidnapped and then found nine years later, living in the same town where his family had just moved. The film was released in theaters on March 12, 1999 by Columbia Pictures, and was a box office flop, grossing $28 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring her high school reunion in a crowded hotel lobby, Beth Cappadora's 3-year-old son Ben vanishes. Police are called to the scene as a frantic search begins but it is unsuccessful, and Beth experiences a [[nervous breakdown]]. Unable to cope with her devastation, she unintentionally neglects her other children, Vincent and Kerry.\n\nAfter nine years, the Cappadora family has seemingly accepted that Ben has gone forever, when a familiar-looking boy turns up at their new house, offering to mow their lawn. He introduces himself as Sam, but Beth becomes convinced that he is actually Ben, and begins an investigation.\n\nBeth discovers Ben was kidnapped at the reunion by Cecil Lockhart, a mentally unstable woman who was an old classmate of Beth's. She brought Ben up as her child, until she later takes her life.\n\nThe attempted reintegration of Sam/Ben back into the Cappadora family produces painful results for everyone, so Beth and her husband Pat eventually decide to return him to his adoptive father.\n\nOne night, Vincent leaves the house and Beth later wakes up to a phone call at 4:22 am to be told he is in jail. Beth and Pat discuss his erratic behavior with Candy Bliss, a detective in Ben's case who became a family friend, and Candy reassures Beth that Vincent loves her. They eventually reconcile their relationship, but while Vincent is in jail, Beth and Pat develop relationship problems after continuous arguments, and they start sleeping in separate beds.\n\nDays later, Sam turns up at the jail and reveals he has remembered something from before his abduction; he was playing hide and seek with Vincent and got stuck in a trunk, but Vincent found him, which made him feel safe.\n\nPat later bails Vincent out of jail and, one night, finds him playing basketball outside with Sam. Vincent, who has carried guilt for not watching Ben at the reunion, letting go of his hand and telling him to get lost, is forgiven by Sam/Ben, who says that he has decided to go back to living with his blood family.  But he first plays a game of basketball with his brother \u2014 the loser to carry Sam\u2019s remarkably heavy suitcase into the house.\n\nBeth and Pat, reconciled, watch from the living room window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Beth Cappadora\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Pat Cappadora\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Detective Candace \"Candy\" Bliss\n* [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] as Vincent Cappadora - Age 16\n**Cory Buck as Vincent Cappadora - Age 7\n* [[Ryan Merriman]] as Benjamin Cappadora/Sam Karras - Age 12\n**Michael McElroy as Benjamin Cappadora - Age 3\n* [[Alexa Vega]] as Kerry Cappadora - Age 9\n* [[Michael McGrady]] as Jimmy Daugherty\n* [[Brenda Strong]] as Ellen, Beth's high school classmate\n* [[Tony Musante]] as Grandpa Angelo Cappadora\n* [[Rose Gregorio]] as Grandma Rosie Cappadora\n* [[John Kapelos]] as George Karras, Cecilia's husband\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Laurie\n* [[John Roselius]] as Chief Bastokovich\n* [[Robert Cicchini]] as Uncle Joey\n\n==Production==\nAccording to a small behind-the-scenes booklet featured on the DVD release, the film began production on October 27, 1997 and was predominantly shot in [[Los Angeles]].

Despite being the original ending of the book, not to mention [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]'s preferred ending, the studio opted for the more conventional happy ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120646/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=The Deep End of the Ocean|work=IMDb}}</ref> Extensive rewrites and re-shoots caused the film to be delayed from its planned fall 1998 release to spring of 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120646/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=The Deep End of the Ocean|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released on March 12, 1999.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Deep End of the Ocean'' holds a rating of 44% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/deep_end_of_the_ocean/ |title=The Deep End of the Ocean Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=uk.rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2009-12-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726121239/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/deep_end_of_the_ocean/ |archive-date=2008-07-26 }}</ref> and a score of 45 on [[Metacritic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/deependoftheocean/ |title=Deep End of the Ocean, The - reviews at Metacritic.com |publisher=metacritic.com |access-date=2009-12-24}}</ref> indicating mixed reviews.\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] praised the director and lead actress but criticised the music: \"With a fine, impassioned performance from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as the story's raw-nerved heroine, the film moves beyond the detective-story aspects of its material to concentrate on what kind of shock waves batter a family after an event like this... [[Ulu Grosbard|Grosbard]] mercifully avoids melodrama. And he paces the film so simply and determinedly that its early scenes are like a string of picture postcards, each one depicting a new phase of the family's ordeal. Only when the film seeks tidy resolution for a tangled set of problems does this restraint seem overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation. But the only real false notes are musical ones, from a score by [[Elmer Bernstein]] that turns familiar and trite when the film does not.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/031299ocean-film-review.html |first=Janet |last=Maslin |title='The Deep End of the Ocean': A Child Is Gone, and Then He Is Not |work=nytimes.com |date=March 12, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Emanuel Levy]] praised all aspects of the film: \"[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Treat Williams]] give such magnetic performances that they elevate the film way above its middlebrow sensibility and proclivity for neat resolutions... In the first reel, Pfeiffer is brilliant as an anxious mother consumed with finding her lost son. Dominating scene after scene, she conveys anguish and guilt in an all-out performance that ranks with her best... Coming from the theater, [[Ulu Grosbard|Grosbard]] has always coaxed strong performances from his handpicked casts, but ''Deep End'''s technical sheen places this outing at the top of his oeuvre. [[Stephen Goldblatt]]'s clean lensing, [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s evocative score, Dan Davis' crafty production design, Susie DeSanto's authentic costumes and, particularly, John Bloom's fluent editing serve as models for efficient storytelling, representing mainstream cinema at its best.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=review&reviewid=VE1117491465&categoryid=31&cs=1 |first=Emanuel |last=Levy |title=The Deep End of the Ocean Review |publisher=variety.com |date=March 1, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Edward Guthmann commended Pfeiffer and Jackson but was ultimately unimpressed: \"[[Michelle Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]], who segued into mother roles in her past two films, ''[[One Fine Day (film)|One Fine Day]]'' and ''[[A Thousand Acres (film)|A Thousand Acres]]'', brings heart and soul to this domestic melodrama, but it's not enough. ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' has nothing but the noblest of intentions, and [[Ulu Grosbard|Grosbard]]'s direction is meticulous, sober and tasteful, but the movie is so deliberate, so enervated that you feel as if you're watching it through glass... In a difficult role that he doesn't quite pull off, [[Ryan Merriman]] plays Sam, the 12-year-old whose allegiance is split between two homes. As his damaged older brother, [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] brings such confidence, maturity and self-possession that he seems to belong in another movie. And [[Whoopi Goldberg]] - all-purpose, you-got-a-part-I'll-play-it Whoopi - shows up as a helpful detective named Candy Bliss.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/03/12/DD94416.DTL |first=Edward |last=Guthmann |title='Ocean' Swims in Somber Melodrama / Kidnapping story is just too virtuous |publisher=sfgate.com |date=March 12, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] held a similar view: \"''The Deep End of the Ocean'', from [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]]'s best-selling novel about parents who find their lost son nine years after his abduction, benefits from a customarily fine performance by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as the boy's mother. [[Treat Williams]] excels as the husband, as does [[Whoopi Goldberg]], a detective who helps the parents in their search. Director [[Ulu Grosbard]] (''[[Georgia (1995 film)|Georgia]]'') and screenwriter [[Stephen Schiff]] (''[[Lolita (1997 film)|Lolita]]'') commendably try to avoid the usual kidnapping clich\u00e9s in favor of family dynamics, but the film ultimately gives in to a case of TV-movie blahs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949245/review/5949246/the_deep_end_of_the_ocean |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203134112/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949245/review/5949246/the_deep_end_of_the_ocean |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 3, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Travers |title=The Deep End of the Ocean : Review : Rolling Stone |publisher=rollingstone.com |date=April 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Michael Sauter also found the lead performances superior to the film as a whole: \"The first half of this drama, with [[Michelle Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]] and [[Treat Williams|Williams]] as parents whose 3-year-old son vanishes, is almost unbearably wrenching... Far less effective, however, is the rest of the story, set nine years later, when the boy resurfaces... But if the film was less than satisfying as a big-screen event, it's still worth renting for Pfeiffer, who valiantly portrays the devastating complexities of grief and guilt.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,272765~1~~,00.html |first=Michael |last=Sauter |title=The Deep End of the Ocean / Movies / EW.com |publisher=ew.com |date=August 13, 1999}}</ref>\n\nTwo extremely negative reviews came from [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and [[Desson Howe]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Ebert wrote that \"[[Ulu Grosbard]]'s ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' is a painfully stolid movie that lumbers past emotional issues like a wrestler in a cafeteria line, putting a little of everything on his plate. It provides big roles for [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Treat Williams]], but doesn't provide them with the screenplay support they need; the result is that awkwardness when characters express emotions that the audience doesn't share.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990312/REVIEWS/903120304/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=The Deep End Of The Ocean :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=March 12, 1999}}</ref> Howe described the \"moments in ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' that will break your heart. After all, the movie \u2013 based on [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]]'s novel \u2013 is about losing a child. This is, essentially, emotional blackmail for anyone with a family. Two hundred monkeys fighting over one word processor could make you cry over material like that. Yet producer/star [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], director [[Ulu Grosbard]] and scriptwriter [[Stephen Schiff]] still mess things up. Apart from the previously mentioned occasions, and nice performances from [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] and [[Ryan Merriman]], the movie's a floating longboat that ought to be ignited and pushed out to sea, Viking style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/deependoftheoceanhowe.htm |first=Desson |last=Howe |title='The Deep End of the Ocean' (PG-13) |work=washingtonpost.com |date=March 12, 1999}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Elmer Bernstein]]'s original score to ''The Deep End of the Ocean'' was released in 1999 by [[Milan Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Releases|publisher=[[Milan Records]]|url=https://milanrecords.com/releases/}}</ref>\n\n'''Track listing'''<ref>{{cite web|website=elmerbernstein.com|title=Discography|url=http://elmerbernstein.com/credits/discography/#1990s}}</ref>\n\n#Main Title - 5:10 \n#Brothers - 2:33\n#Sam is Lost - 3:59\n#Home Again - 4:13\n#Photographs - 2:24\n#Cecil - 2:25\n#Giving Back - 3:05\n#Reunion - 3:06\n#End Credits - 3:08\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n[[Ryan Merriman]] won a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Performance in a Feature Film - Supporting Young Actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120646/awards |title=The Deep End of the Ocean - Awards |publisher=imdb.com |access-date=2009-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0120646|title=The Deep End of the Ocean}}\n*{{Amg movie|176653|The Deep End of the Ocean}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=deep_end_of_the_ocean|title=The Deep End of the Ocean}}\n*{{Metacritic film|title=The Deep End of the Ocean}}\n\n{{Ulu Grosbard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deep End Of The Ocean}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ulu Grosbard]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Mandalay Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about mother\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
