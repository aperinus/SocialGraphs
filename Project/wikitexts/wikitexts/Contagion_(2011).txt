Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Matt Damon]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jennifer Ehle]], [[Sanaa Lathan]], and [[Marion Cotillard]]. The plot concerns the spread of a highly contagious virus [[Transmission (medicine)|transmitted]] by [[respiratory droplet]]s and [[fomite]]s, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order as the virus turns into a worldwide [[pandemic]],<ref name=Rogers20200402>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html |title='Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic |date=April 2, 2020 |last=Rogers |first=Kristen |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=April 6, 2020 |archive-date=April 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404121034/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/movies/contagion-movie-versus-coronavirus-scn-wellness/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and the introduction of a [[vaccine]] to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the [[Hyperlink cinema|multi-narrative \"hyperlink cinema\" style]], popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.\n\nFollowing their collaboration on ''[[The Informant!]]'' (2009), [[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh]] and screenwriter [[Scott Z. Burns]] discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus. Burns consulted with representatives of the [[World Health Organization]] as well as medical experts such as [[W. Ian Lipkin]] and [[Larry Brilliant]]. Principal photography started in [[Hong Kong]] in September 2010, and continued in [[Chicago]], [[Atlanta]], [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Geneva]], and [[San Francisco Bay Area]] until February 2011.\n\n''Contagion'' premiered at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in [[Venice]], Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. Critics praised it for its narrative and the performances, as did scientists for its accuracy. The film received renewed popularity in 2020 due to the emergence of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400-700 words. Word count is 625 as of 20 May 2021. -->\nReturning from a [[Hong Kong]] business trip, Beth Emhoff has an affair with her ex-boyfriend during a [[Chicago]] layover and is feeling a little bit sick, to which she attributes to [[jet lag]]. Two days later, back home in suburban [[Minneapolis]], Beth's husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital when she suffers a seizure; she dies from an unknown illness. Returning home, Mitch finds that his 6-year-old stepson, Clark, has also died. Mitch is isolated but found to be naturally immune. After being released, he protectively keeps his teenage daughter, Jory, [[quarantine]]d at home.\n\nIn Atlanta, [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] representatives meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) over concerns that the disease may be a [[bioweapon]]. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis where she [[Contact tracing|traces everyone having had contact]] with Beth. She negotiates with reluctant local bureaucrats to commit resources for a public health response. Soon after, Mears becomes infected and dies. As the [[novel virus]] spreads, several cities are placed under quarantine, causing [[panic buying]], widespread [[looting]], and violence.\n\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a combination of genetic material from pig and [[bat-borne virus]]es. Scientists are unable to discover a [[cell culture]] to grow the newly identified MEV-1. Cheever determines the virus too [[virulent]] to be researched at multiple labs and restricts all work to one government site. Hextall orders [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] researcher Dr. Ian Sussman to destroy his samples. Believing he is close to finding a viable cell culture, Sussman violates the order and identifies a usable cell culture, from which Hextall develops a [[vaccine]]. Scientists determine the virus is spread by [[respiratory droplet]]s and [[fomite]]s, with an [[basic reproduction number|R<sub>0</sub>]] of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25\u201330% [[mortality rate]].\n\n[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theorist]] Alan Krumwiede blogs about the virus. He claims to have cured himself of the virus using a [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. People seeking forsythia violently overwhelm pharmacies. Krumwiede, having faked being infected to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and [[securities fraud]].\n\nHextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine, then visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdates. By this time, the pandemic's death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide.\n \nEarlier in Hong Kong, [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[epidemiologist]] Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through security videotapes of Beth's contacts in a [[Macau]] casino and identify her as the [[index case]]. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain a vaccine for his village, holding her for months. WHO officials provide the village with the earliest vaccines, and she is released. When she learns the vaccines were [[placebo]]s, she goes to warn the village. Mitch stages a home \"[[prom]]\" for Jory after her boyfriend Andrew receives the vaccine, as life begins to return to normal.\n \nIn a flashback to the [[Spillover infection|spillover event]], a [[bulldozer]] from Emhoff's company clears rainforest in [[China]], disturbing bats. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops an infected piece of banana that is then consumed by a pig. The pig is then slaughtered and is prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who, without washing his hands, transmits the virus to Beth via a handshake.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real-life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

Soderbergh later contacted Burns to cancel the project, as he thought that a film about Riefenstahl would struggle to attract an audience.<ref name=burnztrans/> Intrigued with the field of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], Burns suggested that they instead create a film that centered on a [[pandemic]] situation\u2014\"an interesting thriller version of a pandemic movie\". His main objective was to construct a medical thriller that \"really felt like what could happen\".<ref name=burnztrans/>\n\nBurns consulted with [[Larry Brilliant]], renowned for his work in eradicating [[smallpox]], to develop an accurate perception of a pandemic event.<ref name=burnztrans/> He had seen one of Brilliant's [[TED (conference)|TED]] presentations, which he was fascinated by, and realized that \"the point of view of people within that field isn't 'If this is going to happen', it's 'When is this going to happen?{{' \"}}<ref name=burnztrans/> Brilliant introduced Burns to epidemiologist [[W.

With the aid of these physicians, the producers were able to obtain additional perspectives from representatives of the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=burnztrans/> Burns also met with the author of ''The Coming Plague'', [[Laurie Garrett]]. Her 1995 book helped Burns consider a variety of potential plots for the film.

To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation.<ref name=burnztrans/> \"I saw them come to life\", Burns said, \"and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their kids at home?'
