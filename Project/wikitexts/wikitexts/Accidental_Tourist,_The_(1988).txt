The film stars [[William Hurt]] as Macon Leary, a middle-aged [[Travel literature|travel writer]] whose life and marriage have been shattered by the tragic death of his son. It also stars [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Geena Davis]].\n\n''The Accidental Tourist'' was theatrically released in the United States on December 23, 1988, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $32.6 million. It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with Geena Davis winning [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. It was also nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nMacon Leary ([[William Hurt]]) is a [[Baltimore]] writer of travel guides for reluctant business travelers, which detail how best to avoid unpleasantness and difficulty.\n\nHis marriage to his wife Sarah ([[Kathleen Turner]]) is disintegrating in the aftermath of the murder of their 12-year-old son, Ethan. Sarah eventually leaves Macon, moving out of their house and into an apartment. After he falls down the basement stairs and breaks his leg, Macon returns to his childhood home to stay with his eccentric siblings.\n\nMacon is pursued by Muriel Pritchet ([[Geena Davis]]), an animal hospital employee and dog trainer with a sickly son. Macon eventually hires Muriel to put his dog through much-needed [[obedience training]]. Although Muriel at first seems brash and unsophisticated, Macon eventually finds himself opening up to her and trusting her, and he moves into her apartment. When Sarah's apartment lease is up, she moves back into their old home and suggests to Macon that they start over. Macon leaves Muriel, and he and Sarah set up house once more.\n\nWhen Macon visits [[Paris]] for research, Muriel surprises him by showing up on the same flight and stays in the same Paris hotel, recommended by Macon in one of his travel guides.  She suggests that they enjoy themselves as if they are vacationing together. Macon insists he is there strictly for business, and although he shows concern for how Alexander is doing, keeps Muriel at arm's length.\n\nDuring Macon's last night in Paris, Muriel asks to go with him, and despite an early flight she tells him he doesn't have to reply just now. Waking up in the middle of the night Macon decides to call Muriel but his telephone malfunctions. Macon gets up and while trying to fix the cord, hurts his back and becomes bedridden. Muriel knocks on his door waking him up but before he can decide what to do Muriel assumes he has gone already and leaves. Mustering the strength to go to the front desk, Macon phones his publisher to inform him of his back pain. Sarah comes to Paris,  sent by Macon's sister Rose, to care and make day-trips for him in order to complete his travel guide. Sarah proposes that after finishing the day trips if he is feeling better they can go sightseeing,  reschedule the flight for a later date and make the trip a second honeymoon to which Macon agrees. However, Sarah tells him that she has run into Muriel when she arrived and as such continues to question Macon about his attraction to Muriel, angering Macon.\n\nThe next morning, Macon dresses while Sarah still sleeps, then wakes her to tell her that he is going back to Muriel. On his way to the airport, Macon spots Muriel hailing a taxi and tells the driver to stop. Thinking the driver stopped for her, Muriel bends to gather her luggage and catches sight of Macon in the taxi. She smiles, and Macon returns the smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[William Hurt]] as Macon Leary\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Sarah Leary\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Muriel Pritchett\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Julian Edge\n* [[Amy Wright]] as Rose Leary\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Porter Leary\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Charles Leary\n* [[Robert Hy Gorman]] as Alexander Pritchett\n* Bradley Mott as Mr. Loomis\n* Seth Granger as Ethan Leary\n* [[Jake Kasdan]] as Scott Canfield\n* [[Jonathan Kasdan]] as boy at doctor's office\n* [[Peggy Converse]] as Mrs. Barrett\n* [[Walter Sparrow]] as hot dog vendor\n* [[Paul Williamson]] as London hotel manager\n* Audrey Rapoport as girl on plane\n* Meg Kasdan as receptionist\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] praised the film, giving it four out of four stars.<ref>{{cite web | date =  January 6, 1989 | author = Roger Ebert | author-link = Roger Ebert | title =  The Accidental Tourist | url = https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-accidental-tourist-1989 | work = [[Chicago Sun Times]] }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 33 reviews with the consensus stating, \"Generous with its character's foibles and virtues, ''The Accidental Tourist'' is a thoughtful drama vested with insight into the complications of relationships\".<ref>{{cite web |title= The Accidental Tourist (1988) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/accidental_tourist |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 53 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= The Accidental Tourist |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-accidental-tourist |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, THE (1988) B |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180206073531/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= February 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
