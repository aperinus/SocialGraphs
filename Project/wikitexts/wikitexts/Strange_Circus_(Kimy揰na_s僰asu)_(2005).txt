Her mother Sayuri witnesses the rape. Gozo now rapes both of them as he pleases, while his family is undermined by [[incest]], [[suicide]], and [[murder]]. This narrative is contained within a frame story written by wheelchair-using novelist Taeko. Taeko is assisted by Yuji, a young man who secretly seeks to uncover the possible origins of this story within Taeko's past, and to learn the mysteries of a locked room in her apartment.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the titular Strange Circus, we see the start of a [[burlesque]] performance. The MC brings out a guillotine and offers the strange array of characters a chance to die on stage, before bringing a young girl on stage. The girl states that she has always been on the execution stand, if not for her, then for her mother.\n\nMitsuko is a twelve-year-old girl whose father is the sexually deviant principal of her school. After noticing that Mitsuko had seen her parents having sex, Gozo summons her to his office at school, has her climb into a cello case with a peephole, then has sex with her mother Sayuri without her knowing her daughter is watching. Shortly after, Gozo rapes Mitsuko, which is discovered by Sayuri. Afterward, Gozo has sex with Sayuri, with Mitsuko still watching in the cello case. Gozo then reveals to Sayuri that Mitsuko has been watching for a long time. He then coerces Sayuri into the cello case to watch him rape her daughter.\n\nMitsuko has issues separating her identity from her mother. Because she is forced to both have sex with Gozo and watch her mother having sex with him, she begins to disassociate and takes on the role of her mother. As a result of the infidelity, rape, and incest, Sayuri becomes abusive toward Mitsuko. During one violent encounter, Mitsuko knocks her down the stairs. Sayuri apologizes but ultimately dies from the fall. Alone with her incestuous father, Mitsuko takes on the identity of the 35-year-old Sayuri, going to school and having sex with her father as Sayuri would have. After another breakdown, Mitsuko attempts suicide by throwing herself off a ledge. She survives the fall and is reliant on a wheelchair. Gozo tells Mitsuko that she needs to keep their little secret.\n\nIt is then revealed that this tale is being written by a reclusive wheelchair-using writer, Taeko. She takes an interest in the new assistant, Y\u00fbji Tamiya, asking him to read the story, one of many exclusively about Mitsuko. She is protective over a red door in her studio, not allowing anyone to enter. She asks Y\u00fbji to take her on a walk and he takes her up to a hill in [[Aobadai]]. There, she dismisses him and wheels herself up a hill, only to stand, collapse it, and walk away with it in tow. When she returns home, she enters the red room and we find that it is completely filthy with a cello case at its center that she talks to. She adopts a disguise and goes out shopping, purposely driving away some girls gossiping about her while reading her books. Taeko's editor tells Y\u00fbji that Taeko is faking her paralysis, and asks him to spy on her so they can have a good scoop for their magazine. Y\u00fbji agrees.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitsuko is having trouble adjusting to life in a wheelchair. She is ignored by her classmates and Gozo neglects her in favor of having sex with various women he keeps around the house. In the present, inside Mitsuko's red room, she is sloppily eating spaghetti while writing her novel on top of the cello case. She forces food into the hole, before celebrating the completion of her novel.\n\nY\u00fbji is revealed to have a giant mural dedicated to Taeko. We see him at a body modification support group, where he reveals surgery he had to \"be a vase that compliments the flowers [that reflect his soul].\"\n\nMitsuko finds her mother's lost earring but one of Gozo's women takes it and swallows it to spite her, causing Mitsuko to have another breakdown. Due to this, Gozo ends up storing her in the cello case once again.\n\nTaeko celebrates finishing her novel by presenting it to Y\u00fbji, then taking a trip to the beach with him. While on the train ride, they spot someone with a cello case and she comments on it. Y\u00fbji reveals he was told that being raped was akin to being only a torso. He offers the suggestion to turn both Mitsuko and Gozo into torsos at the end of the novel. Taeko loves the idea.\n\nThe viewer is put into the point of view of Sayuri, bound and gagged inside the cello case that Taeko and Y\u00fbji spotted on the train earlier.\n\nTaeko wakes up in a hotel room with Y\u00fbji, unable to remember how she got there. When they go for a walk, Taeko spots a bathing suit and asks Y\u00fbji to buy it for her. While he's inside the shop, the man with the cello case from the train approaches her and she starts screaming. Y\u00fbji manages to get him to leave. Once again in the hotel room, Taeko asks Y\u00fbji to put the bathing suit on her, citing his infamous lack of libido as why she feels safe asking him to do this. Afterward, she is put to bed by Y\u00fbji and she dreams of the Strange Circus, with a nude, bloodied Sayuri laying in the center of the room.\n\nWhen she wakes up, she notices that she had a nosebleed. She finds Y\u00fbji asleep on the bed, and decides to get up and sneak into the bathroom to clean herself up. While she's doing that, Y\u00fbji wakes up and sneaks a page of her manuscript into her purse. He manages to get back into position, feigning sleep, right before she reenters the room. She climbs back into bed and wakes up Y\u00fbji, with both pretending to just wake up, and asks to be taken home.\n\nIn the red room, she \"serves dinner\" to the cello case. She receives a call from Y\u00fbji who tells her that a page of her manuscript is missing and he needs it tonight for the editor. She rushes out with the page, only for it to be revealed that Y\u00fbji has been waiting outside her studio. He enters the red room, finding the cello case, and addresses it with familiarity. Taeko, however, shows up in Aobadai, pulls out her wheelchair and makes her way to the hill. She receives a call from Y\u00fbji, who says he's with her \"pet\" and tells her to return to her childhood home. She returns to the red room to find the cello case empty.\n\nTaeko arrives at the house we saw Mitsuko grow up in, still toting her wheelchair with her in attempt to keep up the ruse. When Y\u00fbji appears, he dumps her out of the wheelchair, though she still acts like she is paralyzed. He challenges her memory and she deduces she was Mitsuko, despite never quite being sure. When he refers to her as \"Mother\" she can't quite understand what is going on. He helps her back into the wheelchair before taking her upstairs to Gozo's bedroom, where they find Gozo as nothing more than a bloody torso, though still very much alive, bound in chains. Y\u00fbji has set up a table for Taeko to write, but we realize that Taeko is not Mitsuko, but Sayuri, still alive.\n\nIn a recontextualization of the opening story, we learn that Sayuri accepted her treatment at the hands of Gozo by focusing on her transformation as desirable. Y\u00fbji reveals his body modification, intense scarification where his breasts used to be. It's then revealed that it was Mitsuko who was thrown down the stairs, not Sayuri. Mitsuko survived and was pulled out of her abusive household and put into foster care. She tried to return, only to find that Sayuri could not cope with how terrible of a person she was, and had escaped into the persona of Mitsuko, including going to school and having sex with Gozo, both dressed as and addressing herself as Mitsuko. Sayuri shoved Gozo down the stairs after coming face-to-face with his harem, leaving him broken. After she finished her first novel, she took the name Taeko and stole his wheelchair, storing him in the cello case he was so fond of using.\n\nAll this breaks modern day Taeko. Y\u00fbji appears to forgive Taeko, allowing her to become Sayuri again, only for Y\u00fbji to grab a chainsaw to turn her into a torso like Gozo.\n\nTaeko wakes up screaming in the hotel room with Y\u00fbji. Her screaming wakes up Y\u00fbji, but, when she asks for her wheelchair, he has no idea what she is talking about. She finally stands up in front of him, but he insists that she has never been paralyzed. When she questions that, she awakens on the bed next to Gozo, chained up, with Y\u00fbji standing over her with the chainsaw, laughing.\n\nWe end back at the Strange Circus. The MC presents Sayuri with her head in the guillotine. Everyone claps for her. The MC rips off their face to reveal it's Gozo leading the performance, and we see the various characters, including Taeko's editor, his brothers, teen Mitsuko, Gozo's lovers, and finally young Mitsuko and Y\u00fbji, who give her a standing ovation. Gozo wishes her well, and the guillotine drops.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Masumi Miyazaki]] as Sayuri / Taeko \n*[[Issei Ishida]] as Y\u00fbji Tamiya\n*[[Rie Kuwana]] as Young Mitsuko \n*[[Mai Takahashi]] as Young Mitsuko \n*[[Fujiko (actress)|Fujiko]]   \n*[[Madame Regine]]   \n*[[Tomorowo Taguchi]] as Taeko's Editor\n*[[Hiroshi Ohguchi]] as Gozo\n\n==Reception==\nRussell Edwards of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"shocks, provokes but ultimately bores with its tasteless indulgences\" and that it \"will be most at home at midnight fest sidebars, or anywhere else where a trash aesthetic is embraced.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/strange-circus-1200520843/|title = Strange Circus|date = 22 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0492784|Strange Circus}}\n\n{{Sion Sono}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:Japanese horror drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Transgender-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sion Sono]]\n[[Category:2000s horror drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about rape]]\n[[Category:2005 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2005 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
