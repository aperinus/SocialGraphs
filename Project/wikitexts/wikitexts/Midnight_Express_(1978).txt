The film stars [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]], [[Irene Miracle]], [[Bo Hopkins]], [[Paolo Bonacelli]], [[Paul L. Smith]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Norbert Weisser]], [[Peter Jeffrey]], and [[John Hurt]].\n\nHayes was a young American student sent to a [[Prisons in Turkey|Turkish prison]] for trying to smuggle [[hashish]] out of the country. The film's title is [[prison slang]] for his escape attempt.\n\nUpon release, ''Midnight Express'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Many praised Davis's performance as well as the cast, the writing, the direction, and the musical score by [[Giorgio Moroder]]. Hayes and others criticized the film for portraying the Turkish prison men as violent and villainous and for deviating too much from the source material.<ref name=\"Stone\" >{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Helena|title=Stone sorry for Midnight Express|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/16/turkey.film|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|access-date=14 January 2012|date=16 December 2004|archive-date=28 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828231617/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/dec/16/turkey.film|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Flinn|first=John|title=The real Billy Hayes regrets 'Midnight Express' cast all Turks in a bad light|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/The-real-Billy-Hayes-regrets-Midnight-Express-1134196.php|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|agency=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|access-date=14 January 2012|date=9 January 2004|archive-date=22 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022152413/http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/The-real-Billy-Hayes-regrets-Midnight-Express-1134196.php|url-status=live}}</ref> It was later nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and  [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Parker at the [[51st Academy Awards]] in 1979, and won [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for Stone and Moroder respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nOn vacation in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] in 1970, American college student [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]] straps {{cvt|2|kg}} of hashish bricks to his chest. As he and his girlfriend are about to board a plane back to the United States, Billy is detained by Turkish police, who are on high alert for terrorist attacks. Billy is strip-searched and arrested.\n\nA shadowy American \u2013 whom Billy nicknames \"Tex\" for his thick Texan accent \u2013 arrives and accompanies Billy to a police station and translates for him. Billy claims he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver and offers to help police locate him in exchange for being released. At a nearby market, Billy points out the cab driver to police, who arrest him, but they have no intention of releasing Billy. He attempts to escape, only to be recaptured at gunpoint by Tex.\n\nDuring his first night in [[Sultanahmet Jail]], a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. He is later rousted from his cell, brutally beaten and [[Prison rape|raped]] by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. A few days later, Billy awakens in [[Bayrampa\u015fa Prison|Sa\u011fmalc\u0131lar Prison]], surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who stole two candlesticks from a mosque), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swedish drug smuggler). Jimmy warns Billy that the prison is dangerous for foreigners and says no one can be trusted, not even young children.\n\nBilly meets with his father, a U.S. representative, and a Turkish lawyer to discuss his situation. During Billy's trial, the prosecutor makes a case against him for drug smuggling. The lead judge is sympathetic to Billy and gives him a four-year sentence for drug possession. Billy and his father are devastated, but their Turkish lawyer insists it is a good result because the prosecutor wanted a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]].\n\nJimmy wants Billy to join an escape attempt through the prison's subterranean tunnels. Billy, due to be released soon, declines. Jimmy goes alone and is caught, then brutally beaten. Fifty-three days before his release, Billy learns the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Turkish High Court]] in [[Ankara]] has overturned his sentence after an appeal by the prosecution. The prosecutor who originally wanted Billy convicted of smuggling rather than the lesser charge of possession finally had his way. Billy has been resentenced to serve 30 years.\n\nIn desperation, Billy accompanies Jimmy and Max to try to escape through the catacombs below the prison. They give up after running into endless dead-ends. A particularly sycophantic prisoner named Rifki, who routinely acts as an informant in exchange for favors, tips off the guards about the escape attempt. Billy's imprisonment becomes harsh and brutal: terrifying scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another, and Billy has a breakdown. He brutally beats Rifki, killing him. He is sent to the prison's ward for the insane, where he wanders about in a daze among the other disturbed and catatonic prisoners.\n\nIn 1975, Billy's girlfriend, Susan, visits him. Devastated by Billy's condition, she tells him he must get out or else die. She leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside to help Billy escape. Her visit strongly helps Billy regains his senses. He tries to bribe Hamidou to take him to the prison hospital, but instead Hamidou forces Billy to a room, then tries to rape him. They struggle until Hamidou is killed after being pushed into the wall, his head impaled upon a coat hook. Billy dons a guard's uniform and walks out the front door to freedom.\n\nThe epilogue shows that in October 1975, Billy crossed the border to Greece and arrived home three weeks later.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] as [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]]\n* [[Irene Miracle]] as Susan\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as CIA Agent \"Tex\"\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Rifki\n* [[Paul L.

However, background shots of Istanbul were taken by a small crew pretending to be making a cigarette commercial.\n\nA made-for-television documentary about the film, ''I'm Healthy, I'm Alive, and I'm Free'' (alternative title: ''The Making of Midnight Express''), was released on January 1, 1977. It is seven minutes long, and features commentary from the cast and crew on how they worked together during production, and the effort it took from beginning to completion. It also includes footage from the creation of the film, and Hayes's emotional first visit to the prison set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Midnight Express Making-Of: a Lesson in Filmmaking History |url=https://www.mentorless.com/2014/06/02/watch-midnight-express-making/ |website=6 February 2014 |date=2 June 2014 |publisher=mentorless.com |access-date=6 July 2018 |archive-date=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707011148/https://www.mentorless.com/2014/06/02/watch-midnight-express-making/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Differences from the book==\nVarious aspects of Billy Hayes's story were fictionalized or added for the movie:\n* In the movie, Hayes is in Turkey with his girlfriend when he is arrested; in real life, he was travelling alone.\n* Although Billy spent 17 days in the prison's psychiatric hospital in 1972 in the book, he never bites out anyone's tongue, which, in the film, leads to him being committed to the section for the criminally insane.\n* The book ends with Hayes being moved to [[\u0130mral\u0131 prison]], on an island from which he eventually escapes by stealing a dinghy, rowing {{convert|17|mi|km}} in a raging storm across the [[Sea of Marmara]], traveling by foot and by bus to Istanbul, and then crossing the border into Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manolith.com/2010/06/30/billy-hayes-and-the-real-midnight-express/ |title=Billy Hayes and the Real Midnight Express &#124; Manolith |access-date=2010-10-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703114615/http://www.manolith.com/2010/06/30/billy-hayes-and-the-real-midnight-express/ |archive-date=2010-07-03 }}</ref> In the film, that passage is replaced by a violent scene in which he unwittingly kills the head guard who is preparing to rape him. (In the book, Hamidou, the chief guard, was killed in 1973 by a recently paroled prisoner, who spotted him drinking tea at a caf\u00e9 outside the prison, and shot him eight times.) The attempted rape scene itself was fictionalized; Billy never claimed in the book to have suffered any sexual violence at the hands of either his Turkish guards, wardens, or fellow inmates, but engaged in consensual homosexual activity while he was in prison. The film depicts Hayes gently rejecting the advances of a fellow prisoner (Erich the Swede).\n* There is a fleeting reference to the popular restaurant [[Pudding Shop|The Pudding Shop]], in the bazaar. It is actually on Divan Yolu, the main avenue through historic Old Istanbul.\n\n==Release==\nThe film screened at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival]].
