An international co-production between the United States and Australia, the film was produced by [[Tom Rosenberg]], [[Gary Lucchesi]], Richard Wright, Andrew Mason and [[Sidney Kimmel]]. It stars [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Yvonne Strahovski]], [[Miranda Otto]] and [[Jai Courtney]]. The film tells the story of Adam, Frankenstein's monster, who embarks on a dangerous journey to stop evil demons and their ruthless leader from taking over the world.\n\nThe film was released on January 24, 2014, in the United States and on March 20, 2014 in Australia. The film received negative reception and grossed $76 million worldwide against a production budget of $65 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1795, Doctor [[Victor Frankenstein]] creates a [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] by putting together parts of corpses and reanimating them. Horrified by his creation, Frankenstein tries to destroy it, but the monster survives and murders his wife [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth]]. Frankenstein chases it to the Arctic, but he succumbs to the cold weather. When the monster returns home to bury Frankenstein, it is attacked by [[demon]]s, but is then rescued by two [[gargoyle]]s, Ophir and Keziah. They bring it to a cathedral, where the monster meets the gargoyle queen Leonore and her second-in-command Gideon. Leonore explains that they were created by the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] to battle demons on Earth and protect humanity. She names the creature \"Adam\" and invites him to join them, but he declines and chooses to depart. He is given baton-like weapons to protect himself, as more demons will come after him. The weapons allow him to \"descend\" demons (destroying their bodies and trapping their souls in [[Hell]]) as they have the symbol of the Gargoyle Order carved on them.\n\nFor the next two hundred years, Adam lives apart from society, killing any demon that pursues him and hiding from them. Deciding to rejoin society in the modern-day, Adam looks for and confronts a group of demons. During the fight, a police officer is accidentally killed. This causes Adam to be summoned by the gargoyles once more and they decide to imprison him as punishment. A demon Helek, who survived Adam's attack, reports to his leader, the demon prince [[Naberius]], that Adam is alive. Naberius has disguised himself as billionaire businessman Charles Wessex and employs [[scientist]]s Terra Wade and Carl Avery to conduct experiments to try to reanimate corpses. He sends a group of demons led by his most formidable warrior, Zuriel, to attack the gargoyles' cathedral and capture Adam so he can unlock the secret to resurrecting the dead.\n\nIn the attack, many demons are slain and 16 gargoyles, including Ophir and Keziah, are \"ascended\" (returned to and trapped in [[Heaven]]), but Zuriel sneaks in and captures Leonore and takes her to an abandoned theater. Adam interrogates a demon who tells him that they lured the gargoyles out in order to capture Leonore so they can force the gargoyles to trade Adam for her. Gideon is instructed to trade Adam to them, however, Adam escapes after the attack. Without Adam, Gideon instead offers to trade Frankenstein's journal for Leonore, which was found on Doctor [[Victor Frankenstein]]'s body on the night they found him. At the theater, Gideon gives Zuriel the journal and Leonore is spared. Adam follows Zuriel to the Wessex Institute, where he discovers thousands of corpses underground and learns that Naberius plans to recreate Frankenstein's experiment by reanimating the corpses and using them as hosts for the descended demons so he can rebuild his armies and destroy humanity. Adam retrieves the journal from Terra and escapes the demons. He later tracks down Terra and asks for her help. The two are then attacked by Zuriel, where Adam fights him and manages to descend him.\n\nAdam warns the remaining gargoyles of Naberius' plan, agreeing to give them the journal if they get him and Terra to safety. Leonore agrees and when Adam leaves, she secretly sends Gideon to kill him after he retrieves the journal. After a violent fight, Adam ascends Gideon and then decides to burn Frankenstein's journal and destroy its secrets before the gargoyles come after him. Luring them out of the cathedral, Adam leads them to the Wessex Institute, where they descend Naberius's right-hand man Dekar and then battle more demons. In the ensuing battle, Adam goes into the institute to rescue Terra, who had been kidnapped by Naberius and forced to begin the process of reanimating the corpses. Naberius overpowers Adam and tries to have one of the demon spirits possess him, but it doesn't work because Adam has developed a soul of his own. Adam carves the Gargoyle Order symbol on Naberius, descending him to Hell. The institute collapses and falls into an abyss, where all the demons and all the possessed corpses are destroyed and Naberius' plan is thwarted. Leonore rescues Adam and Terra from falling into the abyss as well and they return to the cathedral.\n\nLeonore forgives Adam for Gideon's death and Adam bids farewell to Terra. In the ending scene, Adam narrates that he will continue defending the world from demons as he declares himself \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Adam Frankenstein]], a superhuman creature created by Dr. Frankenstein  \n* [[Bill Nighy]] as [[Naberius]], a demon prince who poses as Charles Wessex, head of the scientific Wessex Institute\n* [[Yvonne Strahovski]] as Dr. Terra Wade, a world-renowned [[Electrophysiology|electrophysiologist]] employed by Naberius to research reanimation of dead matter\n* [[Miranda Otto]] as Queen Leonore, the gargoyle queen\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as Gideon, leader of the gargoyle army\n* [[Socratis Otto]] as Zuriel, Naberius' most formidable warrior\n* [[Kevin Grevioux]] as Dekar, a high-ranking demon who serves as the head of security at the Wessex Institute\n* Goran D. Kleut as Rekem, a demon serving under Naberius who tries to capture Adam\n* [[Steve Mouzakis]] as Helek, a demon serving under Naberius\n* [[Mahesh Jadu]] as Ophir, a gargoyle\n* [[Caitlin Stasey]] as Keziah, a gargoyle\n* [[Chris Pang]] as Levi, a gargoyle\n* [[Deniz Akdeniz]] as Barachel, a gargoyle\n* [[Nicholas Bell]] as Dr. Carl Avery, a scientist working with Dr. Wade\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Molokai, the demonic doctor overseeing the corpses\n* [[Aden Young]] as Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein]], a scientist and Adam's creator\n\n==Themes==\nOne key issue is whether Adam was a monster or a man. That was partly reflected in the choices different characters made throughout the movie to refer to Adam as either him or it. At one point, Dr. Wade delivered the key line, \"You're only a monster if you behave like one.\"\n\nThe director has said Adam earned a soul when he burned the journal, selflessly giving up his chance at a mate in order to save mankind. He said when he talked to audiences, they understood that Adam had earned a soul over the course of the movie, but different people had different ideas about what specific thing caused him to earn a soul.\n\nAt first Queen Leonore had hoped that Adam would gain a soul. But near the end of the movie, when he refused to help the gargoyles fight the demons, the director says Queen Leonore decided Adam would never gain a soul, and that's why she ordered Gideon to kill him. At that point, everyone was against him, which is similar to the sort of isolation from the original Frankenstein story.\n\nThe director said the archangels sent Adam to the gargoyles, in response to Queen Leonore asking them for help. He says that a lot in life, when you get what you need/hoped for, you don't recognize it.<ref name=commentary>The director's commentary on the DVD.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Kevin Grevioux]] of ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' sold the original screenplay to [[Lakeshore Entertainment]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=62914|title=''I, Frankenstein'' Lives at Lakeshore|date=February 1, 2010|website= ComingSoon.net|access-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/lakeshore-greenlights-i-frankenstein|title=Lakeshore Greenlights ''I, Frankenstein''|last1=Scrietta|first1=Peter|date=February 1, 2010|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blastr.com/2009/04/kevin-grevioux-reveals-th.php|title=Kevin Grevioux reveals the secrets of I, Frankenstein|date=April 15, 2009|website=[[Blastr]]|access-date=March 15, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712144900/http://blastr.com/2009/04/kevin-grevioux-reveals-th.php|archive-date=July 12, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is based on his Darkstorm Studios digital graphic novel of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35658/i-frankenstein-franchise-coming-at-you-from-lakeshore|title=''I, Frankenstein'' Franchise Coming At You From Lakeshore|date=February 2, 2010|website=Dread Central|access-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18921|title= Lakeshore Eyes New Franchise With ''I, Frankenstein''|last1=Miska|first1=Brad|date=February 2, 2010|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=March 15, 2014}}</ref> Lakeshore, an independent [[Los Angeles]] production company which also produced the ''Underworld'' films, brought [[Stuart Beattie]] on board to re-write and direct in early 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/stuart-beattie-write-direct-i-171932 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Jay A. | last=Fernandez | title=Stuart Beattie to Write and Direct 'I, Frankenstein' (Exclusive) | date=March 28, 2011|access-date=May 3, 2014}}</ref> In November 2011, it was confirmed that filming would take place in [[Melbourne]] and that Australia's Hopscotch Features would co-produce the film with Lakeshore.<ref name=hs111109/> The movie's visual effects budget was $6 million.<ref name=commentary/>\n\nIt was announced on October 7, 2011 that [[Aaron Eckhart]] would play the lead role.<ref name=variety111007/> Eckhart described his character thus: \"Frankenstein is an intelligent, evolved man, and that\u2019s how he is portrayed in this movie, for sure.\"<ref name=col111014/> In November 2011, [[Yvonne Strahovski]] was cast as the female lead, a scientist working to reanimate the dead, while [[Miranda Otto]] was cast as the queen of the gargoyles.<ref name=thrnov17/> [[Bill Nighy]] plays the film's villain, whom he described as a \"Nasty piece of work; one of the angels descended with [[Satan]].\"<ref name=dg120221/> Eckhart and Otto trained for three months with martial arts experts [[Ron Balicki]] and [[Diana Lee Inosanto]] in the Filipino martial art of [[Eskrima|Kali]] for their fight scenes.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 27, 2012,<ref name=fba120227/> based at [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]].<ref name=aap120227/> Filming occurred in [[Victoria, Australia]] over a period of ten weeks, with multiple scenes being filmed at [[Ormond College]].<ref name=aap120227/> The film created over 500 jobs for cast and crew.<ref name=aap120227/>\n\n==Release==\nThe North American release was originally set for February 22, 2013,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/54817/another-glimpse-aaron-eckhart-i-frankenstein |title=Another Glimpse at Aaron Eckhart in ''I, Frankenstein''| date=April 19, 2012| website=Dead Central|access-date=March 1, 2014}}</ref> and later moved to September 13, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=94916| title=''I, Frankenstein'' Moves to September, ''Snitch'' Takes Its February Spot| website=ComingSoon.net| date=September 19, 2012|access-date=March 1, 2014}}</ref> In April 2013 the release date was pushed back again,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://collider.com/i-frankenstein-release-date-austenland-release-date| title=Release Date Shuffle: ''I, Frankenstein'' Pushed to January 2014, ''Insidious 2'' Moved Up, ''Austenland'' Set for 8/16, ''Walk of Shame'' Opens 9/20/| last1=Chitwood| first1=Adam| date=April 2013| website=Collider.com| access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref> and saw its world premiere in [[Buenos Aires]] on January 20, 2014, after which it was released in 23 countries between January 22 and January 24.
