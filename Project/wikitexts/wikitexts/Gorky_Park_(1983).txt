The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]]. \n\nThe film stars [[William Hurt]] as [[Arkady Renko]], [[Lee Marvin]] as Jack Osborne, [[Joanna Pacula]] as Irina Asanova, [[Rikki Fulton]] as Major Pribluda, [[Brian Dennehy]] as William Kirwill, [[Ian McDiarmid]] as Professor Andreev, [[Michael Elphick]] as Pasha and [[Ian Bannen]] as Prosecutor Iamskoy. The plot follows Renko, a [[Moscow]] police investigator, on the trail of a gruesome triple murder that leads him into a web of government corruption.\n\nUpon release, ''Gorky Park'' was a [[box office]] disappointment, barely earning back its $15 million budget, but received positive reviews from critics. Pacu\u0142a was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture]] and Elphick for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. [[Dennis Potter]] won a 1984 [[Edgar Award]] for his [[screenplay]] for the film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Moscow]] ''[[militsiya]]'' officer [[Arkady Renko]] is called to the site of three dead bodies \u2013 two men and one woman \u2013 in a secluded clearing near the [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] ice rink. All have been shot in the chest and their faces and finger tips removed; the two men were also shot in the mouth. Renko becomes anxious when the [[KGB]] refuses to take over the investigation. Renko traces the woman's skates to a movie set worker, Irina Asanova, who claims that they were stolen. Based on the forensics, the pathologist identifies one young man as a foreigner, likely an American. Renko asks Professor Levi Andreev to reconstruct the faces of the woman and the American man.\n\nAt the [[dacha]] of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy, Renko makes the acquaintance of American [[sable]] importer Jack Osborne, who is accompanied by Asanova. Renko also crosses paths with William Kirwill, a [[New York City|New York]] detective who is investigating the disappearance of his brother James.\n\nRenko eventually identifies the victims: James Kirwill and two friends of Asanova. He discovers that they were constructing a [[chest (furniture)|chest]] for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts following several polite but tense conversations in social settings. When a KGB officer attempts to kill Asanova with an injected overdose, Renko saves her. Nursing her, they become involved romantically although she doesn't entirely trust him. Kirwill finally finds out about Osborne's chest. It was designed to smuggle out six live sables and break the Soviet monopoly, potentially earning Osborne millions. Osborne had promised Asanova's friends to smuggle them out of the Soviet Union; he tells Asanova her friend is in Manhattan.\n\nRenko confronts Asanova with Prof. Andreev's reconstructed head of her female friend, forcing her to accept they have been murdered. She confesses to the plot and flees. Renko and Kirwill go to retrieve the second reconstructed head, but a KGB agent emerges with it. They follow him to Iamskoy's dacha and watch as Osborne and Iamskoy supervise the head's destruction. To Kirwill's horror, it is his brother's head, but they overhear a deal between Osborne and Iamskoy. Renko confronts Iamskoy in a bath house and Iamskoy admits that he kept Renko on the case to force Osborne to pay a larger bribe to smuggle out the sables. He offers to cut Renko in, but Renko reveals that he has recorded their conversation. Iamskoy wrestles Renko for his gun, which goes off and kills Iamskoy.\n\nOsborne flees to Stockholm. The KGB allows Renko to travel to supervise an exchange. He is to receive the sables from Osborne and kill them and Osborne. Renko meets Osborne at his apartment and finds Asanova there. She confesses that she fled to Osborne, who has included her freedom in the deal, and promises Renko that his freedom can also be included. She reveals that Osborne is planning a double cross as he has 12 sables, not just six. Renko meets with Kirwill and they predict that, following the exchange, the KGB will kill Asanova, Renko and Osborne. Kirwill agrees to be at the exchange to help Renko and Asanova.\n\nThe next morning, Renko and three KGB agents meet Osborne at a farm. They come across Kirwill's body tied to a tree with his intestines hanging out. Osborne announces that he gutted Kirwill after Kirwill killed his dogs. Osborne produces six dead sables and asks the men to lower their weapons. Renko realizes that neither side will let the other live. When Osborne shoots a KGB agent, Renko grabs Asanova and runs for the woods. KGB Major Pribluda then kills the other KGB agent before Osborne kills Pribluda.\n\nOsborne tries to shoot Renko, who finds live sables in cages. Asanova emerges from the woods and Osborne threatens to kill her if Renko does not surrender. When Renko emerges to give up, Asanova shoots Osborne. Renko, too, shoots Osborne before Asanova kills Osborne. She asks Renko to go away with her, but Renko reveals he agreed to kill Osborne in return for her safety and freedom from the Soviet Union, and that they would both be killed if Renko did not return. Renko returns to his job in Moscow.\n\nRenko ends up freeing the sables, which run off into the woods as Asanova's voice repeats Renko's promise that they will meet again one day.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Arkady Renko]]  \n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Jack Osborne  \n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as William Kirwill  \n* [[Ian Bannen]] as Andrei Iamskoy  \n* [[Joanna Pacula]] as Irina Asanova  \n* [[Michael Elphick]] as Pasha Pavlovich\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Anton  \n* [[Rikki Fulton]] as Maj.

(\"Hawk\") Koch Jr. purchased the film rights to ''Gorky Park'' in 1981 for $250,000''.'' Production was delayed for several years because of scheduling conflicts with the director [[John Schlesinger]], who would eventually be replaced with Michael Apted. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Al Pacino]] were both considered for the role of Arkady Renko before Hurt's casting, while [[Cary Grant]] and [[Burt Lancaster]] were considered for the role of Jack Osborne and [[Roman Polanski]] was considered for the role of Prof. Andreev. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] condemned the film as [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] and denied the crew access to shoot in Moscow.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57981-GORKY-PARK?cxt=filmography|access-date=2021-12-03|publisher=American Film Institute }}</ref> ''Gorky Park'' was filmed in [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/1982/film/reviews/gorky-park-1200425530/ |title=Gorky Park |date=January 1, 1983 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> The [[Kaisaniemi Park|Kaisaniemi]] public park in the Helsinki centre was set as the Gorky amusement park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://elokuvauutiset.fi/site/dvd-arvostelut/ulkomaiset/1245-gorkin-puisto-1983 |title=Gorkin puisto (1983) |trans-title=Gorky Park |date=2008 |website=Elokuvauutiset |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319022850/http://elokuvauutiset.fi/site/dvd-arvostelut/ulkomaiset/1245-gorkin-puisto-1983 |archive-date=19 March 2017 |url-status=dead | language=Finnish }}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 78% based on reviews from 27 critics, with an average rating of 6.6/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gorky_park |title=Gorky Park (1983) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=August 31, 2021 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 60% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gorky Park |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gorky-park |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] called it \"a taut, clever thriller throughout, with Mr. Apted's direction establishing its intensity immediately and sustaining it well.
