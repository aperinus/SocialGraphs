Directed by [[Doug Liman]], the film stars [[Hayden Christensen]] as a young man capable of [[Teleportation|teleporting]], as he is chased by a secret society intent on killing him. [[Jamie Bell]], [[Rachel Bilson]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Michael Rooker]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] also star.\n\nThe script went through a rewrite prior to filming, and the roles for the main characters were changed during production. ''Jumper'' was filmed in 20 cities and 14 countries from 2007 to 2008. The film was released on February 14, 2008. The film grossed $225 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics, mostly because of the many changes to Gould's novel, rushed plot, and anticlimactic ending.\n\n== Plot ==\nDavid Rice lives lavishly on stolen money acquired from using his superability to \"[[teleportation|jump]],\" particularly into and out of bank vaults. David discovered his power when he was a teenager after nearly drowning in a lake; he then later left home to escape the abuse inflicted by his alcoholic father. After eight years he becomes hunted by the Paladins, a [[secret society]] of [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatics]] who are sworn to trace and kill \"Jumpers\" for their alleged [[omnipresence]] which they find [[blasphemous]]. Roland Cox, current leader of the Paladins, learns of David's identity from Mark, who bullied David in high school, after a bar fight results in David jumping them into a bank vault. David and his high school crush Millie go to [[Rome]], keeping his ability a secret. When they visit the [[Colosseum]], David meets Griffin, another Jumper before the two are confronted by two Paladins whom Griffin casually kills. David is detained by [[Italian police]] and questioned about the deaths, but escapes with the help of David's mother, Mary, who left him when he was five. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth. David declines and fearing for her safety, puts her on a plane home.\n\nDavid runs into Griffin again, and follows him to his hideout in an Egyptian tomb, by jumping through the \"[[Wormhole|jump scar]]\" left behind after a jump. Griffin reveals that he has been trailing and killing Paladins for years and plans to kill Cox to avenge his parents. Griffin tells David that the Paladins will target his loved ones to draw him out. David teleports home and finds his father lying bleeding. He jumps his father to a hospital and returns to Griffin to ask for help. Realizing Cox is personally hunting David, Griffin agrees.\n\nThey go to pick Millie up at the airport, but she is no longer there. Griffin returns to his hideout to get weapons. David breaks into Millie's apartment, angering her. Seeing Cox arriving, David decides to reveal the truth to her. He teleports her to Griffin's hideout. Using a machine that keeps David's jump scar open, the Paladins, including Cox, invade the hideout. David and Griffin subdue most of them. David sees his mother's photo on the wall and realizes she is also a Paladin. Cox is chased back through the jump scar, but he manages to snatch Millie with him. He sets up a trap in Millie's apartment, expecting David to come back for her.\n\nObsessed with killing Cox, Griffin plans to bomb the apartment, but David objects, wanting to save Millie. They fight and David traps Griffin with power lines in [[Chechnya]]. Ignoring Griffin's warning, David jumps to Millie's apartment and is quickly trapped by Cox's cables. The cables \"link\" him to the apartment, making him unable to jump away alone. Mustering his strength, David teleports the apartment and everyone inside to a river, drowning all the Paladins present, except Cox. Once free of the cables, David teleports Millie to safety and dumps Cox in a cave in [[Horseshoe Bend (Arizona)|Horseshoe Bend]]. He strands Cox there as a sign of mercy, telling him \"I could have dropped you with the sharks.\"\n\nDavid visits his long-lost mother Mary and discovers his younger half-sister Sophie. Mary tells David that when he was five, he made his very first jump. She is a Paladin and had to either kill David or leave - she chose the latter because she loves him. She subsequently gives him a head start to leave, and they both hug before he departs. After leaving her house, David meets up with Millie, and he jumps himself and her to a much warmer location.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:BilsonChristensenNov06.jpg|thumb|right|Rachel Bilson and Hayden Christensen filming in Rome in November 2006]]\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] as David Rice, a young man who discovers the genetic spatial ability to \"[[Teleportation|jump]]\" over short and long distances enshrouded by thin, black smoke.

The novel, released on August 21, 2007, focuses on the character Griffin which was created by screenwriter David S. Goyer specifically for the film. Because Griffin had not appeared in the two prior novels, Gould developed ''Jumper: Griffin's Story'' as a backstory of the character's early childhood before the film. When writing the novel, Gould had to work closely with a producer of the film to ensure that the story did not conflict with the film's premise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reed Jr. |first=Ollie |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2008/feb/22/albuquerque-author-steven-goulds-book-jumper-makes/ |title=Albuquerque author Steven Gould's book 'Jumper' makes successful leap to big screen |date=February 22, 2008 |work=[[The Albuquerque Tribune]] |access-date=April 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129064253/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2008/feb/22/albuquerque-author-steven-goulds-book-jumper-makes/ |archive-date=January 29, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n[[Oni Press]] released a [[graphic novel]], ''Jumper: Jumpscars'', that portrays several backstories related to the film.<ref name=\"CBR\">{{cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12154 |title=Preview: \"Jumper: Jumpscars\" \u2013 Prequel to Upcoming Film |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 13, 2007 |access-date=May 5, 2009}}</ref> The novel was released on February 13, 2008, one day before the film's wide release. A publisher for Oni Press commented on the tie-in to the film, stating: \"The world that was being built around these characters was so well-realized and the mythology so interesting that other stories about this conflict would be plentiful and add to what the filmmakers were building.\"<ref name=\"CBR\"/> The novel was written by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]] and [[Christina Weir]] and illustrated by Brian Hurtt.\n\nIn November 2016, the re-illustrated covers of the ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant]]'' novel series by [[Derek Landy]], done by Tom Percival to commend the series' 10th anniversary, had its characters modelled off of real-life celebrity figures, with \"the last teleporter\" Fletcher Renn on the cover of ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant: The Faceless Ones|The Faceless Ones]]'' visually based on promotional stills of [[Hayden Christensen]] as David Rice from ''Jumper''.\n\n==Potential sequel==\nAuthor [[Steven Gould]]'s second novel in the Jumper series, ''[[Reflex (novel)|Reflex]]'', was published in 2004 (by 2014, two more Gould novels in the series have been published).\n\nPrior to the film's 2008 release, [[Hayden Christensen]] reflected on the possibility of one or more [[sequel]]s: \"This has definitely been set up in a way that will allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow.\"<ref name=\"EmpireJump\"/> Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: \"The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies.\"<ref name=\"DVDSpecFeat\"/>\n\nIn response to the film's box office performance, director [[Doug Liman]] has spoken of his ideas for a sequel. Among them are that Jumpers can reach other planets and travel in time, as well as their capacity for espionage. He has also stated that Rachel Bilson's character would learn how to jump (hinted by David falling unconscious before the jump from the river to the library), just as in Gould's sequel, ''Reflex''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Frosty |url=https://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/6955/tcid/1/pg/1 |title=Director Doug Liman \u2013 Exclusive Interview \u2013 Jumper |publisher=GamersHell |date=February 13, 2008 |access-date=May 5, 2009}}</ref> However, {{as of|2021|lc=y}}, no further updates were given for a sequel.\n\n==Television series==\n{{See also|Impulse (TV series)}}\nA spin-off television series from the film, titled ''[[Impulse (TV series)|Impulse]]'', was released on [[YouTube Premium]] on June 6, 2018.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\">{{cite web |last=Nemetz |first=Dave |title=Impulse Trailer: Teen Girl Taps Into Strange Powers In YouTube's Thriller |url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/10/impulse-trailer-youtube-supernatural-drama-doug-liman-watch/ |website=TVLine |access-date=May 10, 2018 |date=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.foxmovies.com/movies/jumper}}\n* {{IMDb title|0489099|Jumper}}\n* {{allrovi movie|354680|Jumper}}\n* {{mojo title|jumper|Jumper}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|jumper|Jumper}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Jumper}}\n\n{{Jumper}}\n{{Doug Liman}}\n{{Simon Kinberg}}\n{{David S.
