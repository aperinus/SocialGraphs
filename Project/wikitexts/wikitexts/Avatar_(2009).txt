To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". [[paraplegia|Paraplegic]] [[United States Marine|Marine]] [[Jake Sully]] is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi [[Neytiri]]. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake the company will restore his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant [[Pandoran biosphere#Hometrees|Hometree]], under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer which is threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's [[biological neural network]], Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing many including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of [[Pandoran biosphere#Great Leonopteryx|Toruk]], a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to Na'vi deity [[mother goddess|Eywa]] via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when [[Pandoran biosphere|Pandoran wildlife]] unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an [[Fictional universe of Avatar#Amplified Mobility Platform|AMP suit]], escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora.

He stated that ''Avatar''{{'s}} \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[The Abyss]]'', ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.

These include two of his \"favorite\" films, ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from [[George H. Smith (fiction author)|George Henry Smith]]'s short story \"[[Nebula Award Stories Two|In the Imagicon]]\" and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[The City and the Stars]]''. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the [[cyberpunk]] novels ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and ''[[Islands in the Net]]'' by [[Bruce Sterling]]. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanislaw Lem]]. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'', ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'', ''[[The Emerald Forest]]'', ''[[Medicine Man (film)|Medicine Man]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest|FernGully]]''.
