The story follows the misadventures of [[The Tramp|Chaplin's Tramp]] as he falls in love with a blind girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) and develops a turbulent friendship with an alcoholic millionaire ([[Harry Myers]]).\n\nAlthough [[sound film]]s were on the rise when Chaplin started developing the script in 1928, he decided to continue working with silent productions. Filming started in December 1928 and ended in September 1930. ''City Lights'' marked the first time Chaplin composed the [[film score]] to one of his productions and it was written in six weeks with [[Arthur Johnston (composer)|Arthur Johnston]]. The main theme, used as a [[leitmotif]] for the blind flower girl, is the song \"[[La Violetera]]\" (\"Who'll Buy my Violets\") from Spanish composer [[Jos\u00e9 Padilla (composer)|Jos\u00e9 Padilla]]. Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla for not crediting him.\n\n''City Lights'' was immediately successful upon release on January 30, 1931, with positive reviews and worldwide rentals of more than $4 million. Today, many critics consider it not only the highest accomplishment of Chaplin's career, but one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance believes \"''City Lights'' is not only Charles Chaplin's masterpiece; it is an act of defiance\" as it premiered four years into the era of sound films which began with the premiere of [[The Jazz Singer|''The Jazz Singer'' (1927)]].<ref>{{cite web |title=City Lights |url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/city_lights.pdf |last=Vance |first=Jeffrey |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref> In 1991, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''City Lights'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news| title=U.S. Film Registry Adds 25 'Significant' Movies| url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html| last=Kehr| first=Dave| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| language=en-US| date=September 26, 1991| access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web| title=Complete National Film Registry Listing| url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/| website=Library of Congress| access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref> In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it 11th on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|best American films ever made]].

After droning speeches, the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick, he manages to escape the assembly's wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a near-fatal encounter with a sidewalk elevator.\n\nThe Tramp encounters the beautiful flower girl on a street corner and in the course of buying a flower realizes she is blind; he is instantly smitten. The girl mistakes the Tramp for a wealthy man when the door of a chauffeured automobile slams shut as he departs.\n\nThat evening the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes the Tramp{{snd}}his new best friend{{snd}}back to his mansion for champagne, then (after another abortive suicide attempt) out for a night on the town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street-corner. He gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire's car.\n\nAfter the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother ([[Florence Lee (born 1864)|Florence Lee]]) about her kind and wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionaire{{snd}}now sober{{snd}}does not remember him and throws him out. Later that day, the millionaire is once again intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear.\n\nFinding that the girl is not at her usual street-corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: \"She has a fever and needs careful attention.\" Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a [[street sweeper]].\n\nOn his lunch break, he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctor's blindness cure. \"Wonderful, then I'll be able to see you\", says the girl{{snd}}and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines. He also finds an eviction notice the girl's grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent.\n\nThe Tramp returns to work to find himself fired{{snd}}he has been late once too often. A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will \"go easy\" on each other and split the prize money. But the boxer flees on learning he is about to be arrested and is replaced by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp's creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach.\n\nThe Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Burglars knock the millionaire out and take the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given to him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time; in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.\n\nMonths later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girl's customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girl{{snd}}her sight restored{{snd}}now runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant young man enters the shop she wonders for a moment whether \"he\" has returned.\n\nThe Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop's window through which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee, \"I've made a conquest!\" Via pantomime through the glass she offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.\n\nSuddenly embarrassed, the Tramp begins to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, then abruptly stops and her smile turns to a look of puzzlement as she recognizes the touch of his hand. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then gasps, \"You?\" The Tramp nods and asks, \"You can see now?\" The girl replies, \"Yes, I can see now\", and presses his hand to her heart with a tearful smile. Relieved and elated, the Tramp smiles back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Virginia Cherrill]] as a blind girl\n* [[Florence Lee (born 1864)|Florence Lee]] as her grandmother\n* [[Harry Myers]] as an eccentric millionaire\n* [[Al Ernest Garcia]] as his butler (credited as Allan Garcia)\n* [[Hank Mann]] as a prizefighter\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as [[The Tramp|A Tramp]]\n'''Uncredited Cast'''\n* [[Robert Parrish]] as newsboy\n* [[Henry Bergman]] as Mayor and blind girl's downstairs neighbor\n* [[Eddie Baker]] as boxing match referee\n* [[Albert Austin]] as street sweeper/burglar\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as extra in nightclub scene (cut from film)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[File:City Lights promo still.jpg |thumb|upright=1.2|The Tramp meets the Blind Flower Girl and falls in love.]]\nChaplin's feature ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]'', released in 1928, was his last film before the motion picture industry embraced sound recording and brought the silent movie era to a close. As his own producer and distributor (part owner of [[United Artists]]), Chaplin could still conceive ''City Lights'' as a silent film. Technically the film was a crossover, as its soundtrack had synchronized music and sound effects but no spoken dialogue. The dialogue was presented on [[intertitle]]s.{{Sfn|Kamin|2008|p=136}} Chaplin was first contacted by inventor [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] in 1918 about making a sound film, but he never ended up meeting with Lauste.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=387}} Chaplin was dismissive about \"talkies\" and told a reporter that he would \"give the talkies three years, that's all.\"{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=389}} He was also concerned about how to adjust the Little Tramp to sound films.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=389}}\n\nIn early 1928, Chaplin began writing the script with [[Harry Carr]]. The plot gradually grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after the success of ''The Circus'', where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=389}} This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=391}} A highly detailed description of the scene was written, as Chaplin considered it to be the center of the entire film.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=393}}\n\nFor a subplot, Chaplin first considered a character even lower on the social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short ''[[The Idle Class]]''.{{sfn|Milton|2011|p=200}} The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is the Tramp's friend when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.{{sfn|Chaplin|1964|p=325}}\n\nChaplin officially began pre-production of the film in May 1928 and hired Australian art director [[Henry Clive]] to design the sets that summer. Chaplin eventually cast Clive in the role of the millionaire. Although the film was originally set in Paris, the art direction is inspired by a mix of several cities. [[Robert E. Sherwood|Robert Sherwood]] said that \"it is a weird city, with confusing resemblances to London, Los Angeles, Naples, Paris, Tangiers and Council Bluffs. It is no city on earth and it is all cities.\"{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=295}}\n\nOn August 28, 1928, Chaplin's mother [[Hannah Chaplin]] died at the age of 63. Chaplin was distraught for several weeks and pre-production did not resume until mid fall of 1928.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|pp=296\u2013297}} Psychologist [[Stephen M. Weissman|Stephen Weissman]] has hypothesized that ''City Lights'' is highly autobiographical, with the blind girl representing Chaplin's mother, while the drunken millionaire represents Chaplin's father.{{sfn|Weissman|2008|p=71\u201374}} Weissman also compared many of the film's sets with locations from Chaplin's real childhood, such as the statue in the opening scene resembling St. Mark's Church on Kennington Park Road{{sfn|Weissman|2008|p=64}} and Chaplin referring to the waterfront set as the Thames Embankment.{{sfn|Weissman|2008|p=65}}\n\nChaplin had interviewed several actresses to play the blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a [[Santa Monica]] beach, he found a casual acquaintance, [[Virginia Cherrill]]. Cherrill waved and asked if she would ever get the chance to work with him.<ref name=\"Independent\">{{cite news |last=Vallance |first=Tom |date=November 20, 1996 |title=Obituary: Virginia Cherrill |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-virginia-cherrill-5591220.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=October 20, 2018}}</ref> After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin eventually invited her to do a screen test.{{sfn|Chaplin|1964|p=326}} She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness,{{sfn|Weissman|2008|p=67}} and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=398}}\n\n===Principal photography===\nFilming for ''City Lights'' officially began on December 27, 1928, after Chaplin and Carr had worked on the script for almost an entire year.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=398}} On the set, Chaplin was noted for doing many more \"[[take]]s\" than other directors at the time.<ref name=\"chaplin\">{{cite web| title=Filming City Lights| url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/4-City-Lights| website=CharlieChaplin.com| author=Robinson, David| year=2004| access-date=May 12, 2011| url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122062524/http://charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/4-City-Lights| archive-date=November 22, 2010}}</ref> Production began with the first scene at the flower stand where the Little Tramp first meets the Blind Flower Girl. The scene took weeks to shoot, and Chaplin first began to have second thoughts about casting Cherrill. Years later, Cherrill said, \"I never liked Charlie and he never liked me.\"{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=399}} In his autobiography, Chaplin took responsibility for his on-set tensions with Cherrill, blaming the stress of making the film for the conflict. \"I had worked myself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection\", he remembered.<ref>{{cite web |last=Watson |first=Bruce |date=December 7, 2018 |title=The Little Tramp and his Masterpiece |url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/12/7/the-little-tramp-and-his-masterpiece |website=The Attic |access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=399}} Filming the scene continued until February 1929 and again for ten days in early April before Chaplin put the scene aside to be filmed later.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=400}} He then shot the opening scene of the Little Tramp waking up in a newly unveiled public statue. This scene involved up to 380 extras and was especially stressful for Chaplin to shoot.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=400}} During this part of shooting, construction was being done at Chaplin Studios because the city of Los Angeles had decided to widen La Brea Avenue and Chaplin was forced to move several buildings away from the road.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=401}}<ref name=\"Martin Turnbull\">{{cite web |last1=Turnbull |first1=Martin |date=May 16, 2018 |title=Moving the Charlie Chaplin Studios 15 feet while widening La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles, 1929 |url=https://martinturnbull.com/2018/05/16/moving-the-charlie-chaplin-studios-15-feet-while-widening-la-brea-avenue-los-angeles-1929-2/ |website=MartinTurnbull.com |access-date=September 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nChaplin then shot the sequence where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=401}} During filming, [[Henry Clive]] suddenly decided that he did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by [[Harry Myers]], who Chaplin had known while under contract at [[Keystone Studios]]. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929, with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=402}} Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a grate. The scene included a young [[Charles Lederer]]; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|pp=402\u2013403}} He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=403}}\n\nIn November, Chaplin began working with Cherrill again in some of the Flower Girl's less dramatic scenes. While waiting for her scenes for several months, Cherrill had become bored and openly complained to Chaplin. During the filming of one scene, Cherrill asked Chaplin if she could leave early so that she could go to a hair appointment.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=404}} Chaplin fired Virginia Cherrill and replaced her with [[Georgia Hale]], Chaplin's co-star in ''[[The Gold Rush]]''.<ref name=\"chaplin\"/> Although Chaplin liked her screen test, even he realized he had shot far too much already to reshoot all of the flower girl's scenes.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=405}} Chaplin also briefly considered sixteen-year-old actress [[Marian Marsh|Violet Krauth]], but he was talked out of this idea by his collaborators.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=406}} Chaplin finally re-hired Cherrill to finish ''City Lights''.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=405}} She demanded and got a raise to $75 per week.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=406}} Approximately seven minutes of test footage of Hale survives and is included on the DVD release; excerpts were first seen in the documentary ''[[Unknown Chaplin]]'' along with an unused opening sequence.<ref name=\"chaplin\"/>\n\nChaplin then cast [[Florence Lee (born 1864)|Florence Lee]] as the Blind Girl's grandmother and shot scenes with Cherrill and Lee for five weeks.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=406}} In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, the scene was completed in six days and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill's performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film for a year and was only a little more than half way finished.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=407}} From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire's house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for [[Fred Karno]], as the burglars.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=408}} In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=408}} Chaplin hired Keystone actor [[Hank Mann]] to play the Tramp's opponent. The scene required 100 extras; Chaplin took four days to rehearse, and then six to shoot it, between June 23 and 30.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=409}} Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin's performance in the scene was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book| last=Maland| first=Charles J.| title=City Lights| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzn8DwAAQBAJ&q=mann| pages=52\u201354| publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing| date=July 25, 2019| isbn=978-1-8387-1509-0| access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn July and August, Chaplin finished up six weeks of smaller scenes, including the two scenes of the Tramp being harassed by newsboys, one of whom was played by a young [[Robert Parrish]].{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=409}}\n\nIn September 1930, Chaplin finished the shooting of the iconic final scene which took six days.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=409}} Chaplin said that he was happy with Cherrill's performance in the scene, and that she had eventually understood the role. When talking about his directing style on set, Chaplin stated that \"everything I do is a dance. I think in terms of dance. I think more so in ''City Lights''.\"{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=401}}\n\nFrom October to December 1930, Chaplin edited the film and created the title cards.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=410}} When he completed the film, silent films had become generally unpopular. But ''City Lights'' was one of the great financial and artistic successes of Chaplin's career, and it was his personal favorite of his films.<ref name=\"Demain\">{{cite web |last=Demain |first=Bill |title=Charlie Chaplin's City Lights |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/30080/masterpieces-charlie-chaplins-city-lights |website=[[Mental Floss]] |access-date=January 5, 2019 |date=February 24, 2012}}</ref> Especially fond of the final scene, he said, \"[I]n ''City Lights'' just the last scene&nbsp;... I'm not acting&nbsp;... Almost apologetic, standing outside myself and looking&nbsp;... It's a beautiful scene, beautiful, and because it isn't over-acted.\"<ref name=\"chaplin\"/>\n\nThe amount of film used for the picture was uncharacteristic for the time and was a sign of the long production process. Chaplin shot 314,256 feet of film, and the completed film ran 8,093 feet. This made a shooting ratio of approximately 38.8 feet of film for each foot of film that made it in the final version.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Music===\n''City Lights'' marked the first time Chaplin composed the [[film score]] to one of his productions.{{sfn|Robinson|1985|p=411}} While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound, by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit.
