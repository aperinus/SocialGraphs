Its plot follows a former champion boxer who begins to develop a rivalry with a younger boxer on the rise, whom he is training.\n\nOne of Huston's later films, it is based on the boxing novel ''[[Fat City (novel)|Fat City]]'' (1969) by [[Leonard Gardner]], who also wrote the screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Tully, a boxer past his prime, goes to a gym in [[Stockton, California]] to get back into shape and spars with Ernie Munger, an 18-year-old he meets there. Seeing potential in the youngster, Tully suggests that Munger look up his former manager and trainer Ruben. Tully later tells combative barfly Oma and her easygoing boyfriend Earl how impressed he is with the kid. Newly inspired, Tully decides to get back into boxing himself.\n\nTully's life has been a mess since his wife left him. He drinks too much, cannot hold a job, and picks fruit and vegetables with migrant workers to make ends meet. He still blames Ruben for mishandling his last fight.\n\nTully tries moving in with Oma after Earl is sent to prison for a few months, but their relationship is rocky.\n\nMunger loses his first fight, his nose broken, and he is knocked out in his next bout as well. He gets pressured into marriage by Faye because a baby's on the way, so he picks fruit in the fields for a few dollars.\n\nFor his first bout back, Tully is matched against a tough Mexican boxer named Lucero, who is of an advanced age and in considerable pain. They knock each other down before Tully is declared the winner. His celebration is brief when Tully discovers that he will be paid only $100, which causes him to end his business relationship with Ruben. He then returns to Oma's apartment and finds Earl there. Earl, still paying the rent, assures him that the alcoholic Oma wants nothing more to do with Tully.\n\nMunger is returning home from a fight one night when he sees Tully drunk in the street. Munger tries to ignore him, but when Tully asks to have a drink, he reluctantly agrees to coffee. The two men sit and drink, and Tully looks around at all the people immediately around him, all of whom now seem at an impassable distance. Munger says he needs to leave, but Tully asks him to stay to talk a while. Munger agrees, and the two men sit drinking their coffee together in silence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Billy Tully\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Ernie Munger\n* [[Susan Tyrrell]] as Oma Lee Greer \n* [[Candy Clark]] as Faye\n* [[Nicholas Colasanto]] as Ruben\n* [[Art Aragon]] as Babe\n* [[Curtis Cokes]] as Earl (Cokes was a real-life world welterweight champion, but he did not play a boxer.)\n* Sixto Rodriguez as Lucero\n* Alfred Avila as Lucero's coach\n* Billy Walker as Wes\n* Wayne Mahan as Buford\n* Ruben Navarro as Fuentes\n}}\n\n==Production==\nLike the novel, the film was set in Stockton, California and shot mostly on location there. All of the original [[skid row]] depicted in the novel was demolished (West End Redevelopment) from 1965 to 1969. Most of the skid row scenes were filmed in the outer fringe of the original skid row, which was torn down a year after ''Fat City'' was filmed in order to make way for the construction of the Crosstown Freeway, aka Ort Lofthus Freeway.\n\nThe drama is featured in the documentary ''[[Visions of Light|Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography]]'' (1992) for [[Conrad L. Hall]]'s use of lighting.<ref>''[[Visions of Light]]'' web site.</ref>\n\nThe melancholic \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\" is sung by [[Kris Kristofferson]] at the beginning and end of the movie.\n\n==Meaning of title==\nIn a 1969 interview with [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], Leonard Gardner explained the meaning of the title of his novel.\n<blockquote>\"Lots of people have asked me about the title of my book. It's part of Negro slang. When you say you want to go to Fat City, it means you want the good life. I got the idea for the title after seeing a photograph of a tenement in an exhibit in San Francisco. 'Fat City' was scrawled in chalk on a wall. The title is ironic: Fat City is a crazy goal no one is ever going to reach.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Durham|first=Michael|title=A short talk with a first novelist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0wEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|journal=LIFE Magazine|date=29 August 1969|volume=67|issue=9|pages=10|access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref> </blockquote> Fat City is also an old nickname for Stockton, California, where the novel and film are set. The nickname preceded Gardner's novel.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in the [[United States]] on July 26, 1972.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |title=Huston Takes New Look at Life in 'Fat City' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/27/archives/huston-takes-new-look-at-life-in-fat-city.html |access-date=29 November 2021 |work=New York Times |date=27 July 1972}}</ref> It was screened at film festivals including the [[Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Genier |first1=Cynthia |title=U.S. Directors Are Stars Of Cannes Film Festival |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/05/archives/us-directors-are-stars-of-cannes-film-festival.html |access-date=29 November 2021 |work=New York Times |date=5 May 1972}}</ref> and the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nAfter a string of box office flops, John Huston rebounded with this film, which opened to tremendous praise and good business, and he was soon in demand for more work.\n[[Vincent Canby]], film critic for ''The New York Times'', liked the film and Huston's direction. He wrote, \"This is grim material but ''Fat City'' is too full of life to be as truly dire as it sounds. Ernie and Tully, along with Oma (Susan Tyrrell), the sherry-drinking barfly Tully shacks up with for a while, the small-time fight managers, the other boxers and assorted countermen, upholsterers, and lettuce pickers whom the film encounters en route, are presented with such stunning and sometimes comic accuracy that ''Fat City'' transcends its own apparent gloom.\"<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?v_id=16875 Canby, Vincent]. ''The New York Times'', film review, July 27, 1972.</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] made the case for it as one of Huston's best films. He also appreciated the performances. Ebert wrote, \"[Huston] treats [the story] with a level, unsentimental honesty and makes it into one of his best films...[and] the movie's edges are filled with small, perfect character performances.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720101/REVIEWS/201010308/1023 Ebert, Roger].

Keach was the top vote-getter for Best Actor. At the time, the NYCC was second in prestige only to the Academy Awards and was a major influence on subsequent Oscar nominations. A vocal faction of the NYFCC, dismayed by the rather low percentage of votes that would have given Keach the award, successfully demanded a rule change so that the winner would have to obtain a majority. In subsequent balloting, Keach failed to win a majority of the vote, and he lost ground to the performance of [[Marlon Brando]] in ''The Godfather''. However, Brando could not gain a majority either. As a compromise candidate, [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' eventually was awarded Best Actor.\n\nCoincidentally, director John Huston had initially wanted Brando to play the role of Tully. When Brando informed Huston repeatedly that he needed some more time to think about it, Huston finally came to the conclusion that the star wasn't really interested and looked for another actor until he finally cast the then relatively unknown Keach.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1972]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0068575}}\n* {{Allmovie title|16875}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|fat_city}}\n* {{YouTube|sVXhoiS0BPA|''Fat City'' film trailer}}\n* [http://www.noiroftheweek.com/2007/11/john-huston-part-3-fat-city-1972.html ''Fat City''] at Noir of the Week by noir historian William Hare\n\n{{John Huston}}\n\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American boxing films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Huston]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:1972 drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
