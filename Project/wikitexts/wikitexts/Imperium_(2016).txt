The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Nestor Carbonell]], and [[Sam Trammell]]. The film was released on August 19, 2016 in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]] by [[Lionsgate Premiere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/29/daniel-radcliffe-imperium|title=Imperium: Daniel Radcliffe is an undercover FBI agent in exclusive poster|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Clark|last=Collis|date=June 28, 2016|access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNate Foster is a young FBI Special Agent working to uncover highly classified terrorist plots. After some illegally imported [[caesium-137]] is stolen, Nate is recruited by Angela Zamparo, a fellow FBI Special Agent, who suspects the involvement of [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups.\n\nThrough Zamparo's connections, Foster is introduced to a small group of Neo-Nazis led by Vince Sargent, a local leader who is familiar with their prime suspect, [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[talk radio]] host Dallas Wolf. Wolf, a figurehead in the movement for his incendiary rhetoric, assembles a gathering of the largest and most influential groups in the northeast. With Sargent's introductions, Foster becomes ingratiated in the movement and meets Andrew Blackwell, the leader of a premier white supremacist militia, as well as gaining Wolf's attention by convincing him he can fund an expansion of his radio show. Foster also becomes fast friends with Gerry Conway, a white collar engineer and family man, also a white supremacist.\n\nAfter earning Blackwell's trust by saving him during an attack on a white power rally by [[Antifa (United States)|anti-fascists]], Foster is brought to a crude military complex operated by Andrew's militia. There, Blackwell reveals that he has blueprints for the municipal water network of [[Washington, D.C.]] and is plotting an attack.\n\nThe FBI begins to suspect that Wolf and Blackwell are working together after Foster meets Wolf at his home and discovers that his house sets off Foster's [[Geiger counter]]. Foster attempts to integrate himself into a possible plot by offering Wolf a substantial financial investment.\n\nInstead, Wolf becomes hostile and reports Foster to the FBI. It is revealed that he is merely an entertainer and does not believe in the cause, and that he has undergone radiation therapy for prostate cancer, which was registered by the Geiger counter. Blackwell is meanwhile also dismissed as a possible threat, as he appears to use the D.C. water network plans as a way to lure in potential recruits with promise of participating in an impending terror attack. With no further leads, the case is ordered to be closed by Foster's and Zamparo's superior. Angered at wasting his efforts, Foster prepares to have his cover identity leave the city.\n\nFoster meets Conway to make his final farewells. Sensing his genuine feelings of uselessness, Conway confides in Foster his membership in a domestic terrorist cell. It is revealed that Conway and his allies are in possession of the caesium and are plotting to detonate a [[dirty bomb]]. With Conway's introduction, Foster joins the group as supplier of the explosive ([[TATP]]). Though his cover is nearly blown several times by the paranoid terrorists, Foster manages to locate the caesium in Conway's home, leading the FBI to stop and arrest the terrorists before they are able to carry out the plot. Satisfied that he has made a difference, Foster makes one last visit to Johnny, a teenager and former member of Sargent's gang who no longer believes in the cause.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Nate Foster\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Angela Zamparo\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as Dallas Wolf\n* [[Sam Trammell]] as Gerry Conway\n* [[Nestor Carbonell]] as Tom Hernandez\n* Roger Yawson as Usman\n* [[Devin Druid]] as Johnny\n* [[Pawel Szajda]] as Vince Sargent\n* [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] as Andrew Blackwell\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Morgan\n* [[Seth Numrich]] as Roy\n* [[Rodney Roldan]] as Hispanic Man \n* Maboud Ebrahimzadeh as Abdul\n* Shawn Singletary as Tim, the wine shop owner\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nRagussis based his story on the experiences of FBI agent [[Michael German]], who spent a year undercover with white supremacists.
