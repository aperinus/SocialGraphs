The film co-stars [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Leslie Hope]] and [[Keith David]]. The film was released in the United States on August 24, 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nCarl Taylor and James St. James, a pair of [[Waste collector|garbage collectors]] who dream of owning a surf shop, are known for being troublemakers during work by tossing garbage cans in the street and making noise that disturbs residents. A local [[Police officer|bike cop]], Mike, hassles them frequently, but Carl and James are used to his bullying and shrug it off. After completing their shift, they are put on probation for their disruptive antics and told they are to be accompanied by an observer on their next shift: their supervisor's brother-in-law, Louis.\n\nAfter work, the pair use a [[telescope]] to spy on Susan Wilkins, a woman living across the street, and watch as she is mistreated by a man. Once she leaves the room, Carl, in a form of payback, shoots the man in the rear with a [[air gun|pellet gun]]. As James and Carl hide and laugh, two men enter Susan's apartment, [[strangling|strangle]] the man and drag him away. After stuffing his body into a barrel, they put the barrel in their car, but it falls out and is found the next day by Carl, James and Louis on their garbage route. Carl and James panic when they realize that not only is the dead man the same person Carl shot in Susan's apartment, but that he is also Jack Berger, a city councilman who was running for mayor. Louis, a semi-crazed no-nonsense [[Vietnam War]] vet, calms the two down by explaining that Jack died of strangulation, not being shot.\n\nLouis, demanding that the cops not get involved, takes control of the situation by having them stash the body at Carl's place. When Carl sees Susan come home, he decides to meet her and goes over to her apartment building. They hit it off and spontaneously go for a night drive. Meanwhile, Louis makes their problems worse when he kidnaps a [[pizza delivery]] man who sees James with the body. James tries to call the police, but Louis unplugs the phone and drags James, the pizza guy, and the body into a car to follow Carl and Susan.\n\nWhile in pursuit of Carl and Susan, they are pulled over by Mike and his partner Jeff. Louis, using the pellet gun and the pizza guy as a hostage, forces Mike and Jeff to drop their guns before handcuffing them together in a compromising position at a playground. Meanwhile, Carl and Susan are discovered and kidnapped by Biff and Mario, the [[Contract killing|hitmen]] who had killed Jack. The two are brought before Maxwell Potterdam III, a corrupt businessperson who has been dumping toxic waste illegally. Jack had been covering for him but, when he tried to back out, Maxwell had him killed. Carl and Susan are then stuffed into cans and set to be disposed of in a lake Potterdam is using as an illegal dump site. Carl's barrel falls off the truck and he is freed; he and James manage to grab onto the truck carrying Susan while Louis, the pizza guy, and Jack's body follow in a rent-a-cop car.\n\nCarl frees Susan and the group neutralizes Potterdam's squad of goons, terrorize him with their pranks \u2014and Jack's body\u2014 and then throw him in the toxic water.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Carl Taylor\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as James St. James\n* [[Keith David]] as Louis Fedders\n* [[Leslie Hope]] as Susan Wilkins\n* [[Dean Cameron]] as Pizza Delivery Man\n* [[John Getz]] as Maxwell Potterdam III\n* [[Hawk Wolinski]] as Biff\n* [[John Lavachielli]] as Mario\n* [[Geoffrey Blake (actor)|Geoffrey Blake]] as Frost\n* [[Cameron Dye]] as Luzinski\n* [[John Putch]] as Officer Mike\n* [[Tommy Hinkley]] as Officer Jeff\n* [[Darrell Larson]] as Jack Berger\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as Walt Richardson\n* [[Kari Whitman]] as Judy\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Captain Leo Dalton\n* [[Jim Trenton|Jim \"Poorman\" Trenton]] as Narrator\n* Brad Wyman as Rent-a-Cop\n* Matt Robinson as Rent-a-Cop\n* Bob Brown as Henchman #1\n* Erik Stabenau as Henchman #2\n* Bobby Burns as Henchman #3\n* Eddie Braun as Henchman #4\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe original screenplay was tentatively titled ''Clear Intent'' and was written in the mid-1980s. Estevez came up with the idea while he was filming the 1985 movie ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]''.\n\n\"I was living in a studio apartment in Santa Monica at the time, and I was up late one night sitting at the kitchen table working out some story ideas on my computer. All of a sudden, this trash truck came roaring down the alley under my window. It was 5 a.m. and it just struck me -- no one had ever done a movie about trashmen before.\"<ref name=\"orange\">{{cite news|author=Barry Koltnow|date=Aug 1, 1990|title=A break from the pack while many of his peers struggle with negative publicity, emilio estevez forges ahead with 'Young guns II' and his second outing as a director|work=Orange County Register|id={{ProQuest|272479838}}}}</ref>\n\nIt was slated to star another [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Packer]] alongside Estevez, such as [[Judd Nelson]].<ref name=\"New York\">{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=David |authorlink=David Blum |date=1985-06-10 |title=Hollywood's Brat Pack |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |pages=45}}</ref>\n\nAt one stage, John Hughes was going to be producer or director, according to Estevez.<ref>{{cite news|title=Emilio estevez, seriously|author=Paula Span|date=Jun 26, 1985|work=The Washington Post|id={{ProQuest|138607207}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Blau, R.|date=Oct 31, 1985|title=Tempo|work=Chicago Tribune|id={{ProQuest|176407418}}}}</ref> \"When I was reading it, I thought it was so good, so close to my bone, that I had written it\", said Hughes. \"Emilio wants to direct it, and I'm sure he will be able to.

He said he had no intention of using his brother in the movie, but Sheen said he wanted in after reading the script. \"He felt he needed a comedy at this point of his career\", Estevez said.<ref name=\"orange\" />\n\nEstevez eventually raised funds from Epic Pictures, which provided the $9 million for the film.<ref name=\"bob\">{{cite news|author=Bob Thomas, A.
