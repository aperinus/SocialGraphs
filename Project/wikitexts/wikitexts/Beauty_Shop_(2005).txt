The film serves as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'' film franchise, and stars [[Queen Latifah]] as Gina, a character first introduced in the 2004 film ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''. This film also stars [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]].\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States by [[MGM Distribution|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on March 30, 2005, ''Beauty Shop'' received generally mixed reviews from critics. The film has grossed $37.2 million worldwide against a $25 million production budget.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nGina Norris is a [[widow]]ed hairstylist who has moved from Chicago to Atlanta so her daughter Vanessa can attend a private music school. She has made a name for herself as a stylist, but after her self-centered and domineering boss, Jorge, criticizes her decisions, she quits and sets up her own shop, purchasing a run-down salon with the help of a loan officer.\n\nUpon buying the salon, she runs into instant barriers: loudmouthed young stylists, older clients who are fixed in their habits, an energetic young boy named Willie who constantly flirts with women (including Vanessa) while filming for his next music video, people wary of her ability as a hairdresser, and the constant trouble her rebellious sister-in-law, Darnelle, finds herself in.\n\nGina issues an ultimatum with Darnelle to clean up her act and start paying her back or she will be evicted. In a short time, the previous owner's clients become her own and many of her former customers find their way from Jorge's to her salon. When electrical issues arise, she finds that the upstairs renter, Joe, is a handsome electrician from Africa who eventually bonds with Vanessa due to his skills on the piano. Because Jorge is jealous that his shop is losing clients to Gina's, he pays a health inspector named Crawford to find various ways to shut down Gina's business.\n\nOver time, neighborhood regulars frequent the shop and the varied stylists become close to Gina, as does Joe. One of her former clients from Jorge's uses her connections to set up a meeting with [[CoverGirl]] for Gina's homemade miracle conditioner, affectionately called \"hair crack\". During a dance at a night club, James and Lynn start a romance.\n\nTragedy strikes when the shop is trashed and vandalized the night before Vanessa's big piano recital. When Gina next enters the shop, she finds not only that her staff has cleaned up the majority of the mess and brought items from home so the shop could operate, but Darnelle has also decided to grow up and enter [[beauty school]].\n\nWhile filming for his next topic, Willie tapes a meeting between Jorge and Inspector Crawford and learns that they were responsible for trying to ruin Gina. Shortly after, a disheveled woman enters the shop and begs for someone to fix her hair for a wedding she has in a few hours. Soon after, Willie shows Gina the videotape of the meeting he filmed of Jorge and Inspector Crawford. Later that night, Gina goes to Jorge's salon to not only tell him about the tape, but that she knows he is not Jorge from Austria, but George Christie from Nebraska. Gina also makes it clear to Jorge that no matter what he'll do to try and bring her down, he will never break her. As she leaves, Jorge insults her, but James (Gina's only male employee) and a few of his friends arrive and give Jorge an extreme haircut as payback for what he did to her in trying to close her shop.\n\nLater, as the shop listens to their favorite radio talk-show host DJ Hollerin' Helen, they discover she was the desperate customer on the way to the wedding as she gives the shop (and Gina's \"hair crack\" conditioner) a shout-out on the radio.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Queen Latifah]] as Gina Norris\n*[[Djimon Hounsou]] as Joe \n*[[Alicia Silverstone]] as Lynn\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Ms. Josephine\n*[[Sherri Shepherd]] as Ida\n*[[Golden Brooks]] as Chanel\n*[[Bryce Wilson]] as James\n*[[Kevin Bacon]] as Jorge Christophe\n*[[Keshia Knight Pulliam]] as Darnelle\n*[[Andie MacDowell]] as Terri\n*[[Mena Suvari]] as Joanne Marcus\n*[[Paige Hurd]] as Vanessa Norris\n*Laura Hayes as Paulette\n*[[Lil' JJ]] as Willie\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Byron\n*[[Adele Givens]] as Hollerin' Helen\n*[[Sheryl Underwood]] as Catfish Rita\n*Jim Holmes as Inspector Crawford\n*[[LisaRaye McCoy]] as Rochelle\n*[[Kimora Lee Simmons]] as Denise\n*[[Della Reese]] as Mrs. Towner\n*Joyful Drake as Mercedes\n*Tawny Dahl as Porsche\n*[[Andrew Levitas]] as Stacy\n*[[Octavia Spencer]] as Ida\n*[[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] as Glen\n*[[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Corky\n*[[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Chelsea\n*Ki Toy Johnson as Debbie\n*[[Nancy Lenehan]] as Mrs. Struggs\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 38%, based on reviews from 119 critics, with an average score of 5.35/10.
