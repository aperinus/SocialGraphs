The film received mixed reviews and was a [[box-office bomb|commercial failure]] upon its initial release, but has enjoyed later success as a [[cult film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nWyatt Frame, an executive with the pop music [[record label]] MegaRecords, is confronted on a private jet by successful [[boy band]] DuJour over a strange backing track they have discovered on their recent single. Wyatt and the plane's pilot parachute out of the jet, leaving it to crash with the band still on board, ensuring their deaths.\n\nLanding outside of the town of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]], Wyatt begins searching for a replacement band for DuJour, eventually discovering struggling local rock band The Pussycats: lead vocalist and guitarist Josie McCoy, drummer Melody Valentine, and bassist Valerie Brown. The group accepts Wyatt's immediate offer of a major record deal despite its seeming implausibility, and they are flown to [[New York City]] with their manager Alexander, his sister Alexandra, and Josie's friend Alan M. Wyatt renames the band \"Josie and the Pussycats\" without their permission.  Meanwhile, MegaRecords CEO Fiona, in a meeting with world government representatives, details how the [[United States government]] has conspired with the music industry to hide [[subliminal message]]s in pop music to brainwash teenagers into buying consumer products. Musicians who discover the hidden messages in their music are made to disappear via staged plane crashes, drug overdoses and similar disasters.\n\nThe band's first single is released and, due to subliminal messaging, instantly becomes successful. Valerie begins to resent the attention the label gives Josie, while Melody's uncanny behavioral perception makes her suspicious of Fiona. Fiona orders Wyatt to kill the pair before they uncover the conspiracy; they are sent to a fake appearance on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' where two fake [[Carson Daly]]s attempt to kill them, though the band survives due to their incompetence.  Wyatt gives Josie a copy of the group's latest single, which contains a subliminal message track designed to brainwash her into desiring a solo career. After arguing with her bandmates, Josie realizes that the single caused the fight. Her suspicions are confirmed when she uses a [[Mixing console|mixing board]] to make the subliminal track audible. However, Fiona catches her unawares.\n\nMegaRecords have organized a giant [[pay-per-view]] concert that will be [[Streaming media|streamed online]], wherein they plan to unleash a major subliminal message via themed cat ears headsets that viewers must buy to hear the audio. Fiona and Wyatt plan for Josie to perform solo, but when the band insists on performing together, the pair threaten to kill Melody and Valerie in a staged car explosion if they do not comply. However, the badly injured members of DuJour arrive and thwart the pair's plan, having survived the plane crash by landing the plane in the middle of a [[Metallica]] concert, where they were assaulted by fans.\n\nJosie, Valerie and Melody fight Fiona, Wyatt and their security guards. During the tussle, Fiona accidentally destroys the machine used to generate the messages, revealing the new subliminal message to be one that would make Fiona universally popular. Fiona reveals that her [[lisp]] made her a social outcast in high school, while Wyatt reveals that his appearance is a disguise\u2014he went to the same high school as Fiona, but was a persecuted and unpopular [[albino]]; the two immediately bond. The government agents colluding with Fiona arrive, but with the conspiracy exposed, they arrest the pair as scapegoats to cover up their involvement in the scheme. They abandon the idea of spreading subliminal messages via music, deciding that movies are more effective.\n\nJosie, Valerie, and Melody perform the concert together. Alan M arrives and confesses his love for Josie, who returns his feelings. The concert audience removes their headsets at Josie's suggestion and, able to judge the band on its own merits for the first time, roar their approval.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Josie McCoy, the Pussycats' main [[songwriter]], lead singer and guitarist\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Melody Valentine, the Pussycats' absent-minded blonde drummer and backup singer\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Valerie Brown, the Pussycats' strong-willed and perceptive bassist and backup singer\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Alan M.
