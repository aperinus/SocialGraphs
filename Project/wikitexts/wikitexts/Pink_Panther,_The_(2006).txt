It is also the first ''Pink Panther'' film to be released since ''[[Son of the Pink Panther]]'' released in 1993. In this film, [[Inspector Jacques Clouseau]] is assigned to solve the murder of a famous football coach and the theft of the famous Pink Panther diamond. The film was directed by [[Shawn Levy]], stars [[Steve Martin]] as Clouseau and also co-stars [[Kevin Kline]], [[Jean Reno]], [[Emily Mortimer]], and [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]].\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews but was a commercial success, earning $164{{nbsp}}million worldwide. ''The Pink Panther'' was released theatrically on February 10, 2006, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 13, 2006. A [[The Pink Panther 2|sequel]] was released on February 6, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a football match between [[France national football team|France]] and [[China national football team|China]], France coach Yves Gluant arrives wearing the priceless Pink Panther diamond ring and embraces his girlfriend, pop star Xania. After France wins in [[Golden goal|sudden death]], Gluant is killed by a poison dart, with the Pink Panther nowhere to be found.\n\nEager to win the ''[[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]'', Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus promotes clumsy policeman and [[village idiot]] [[Inspector Clouseau|Jacques Clouseau]] to the rank of inspector and assigns him to the case. While Clouseau draws the media's attention, Dreyfus assembles a secret team to actually crack the case and assigns Gendarme Gilbert Ponton to keep an eye on Clouseau. Clouseau befriends Ponton and falls in love with secretary Nicole Durant.\n\nAlthough Clouseau makes poorly little progress in the case, he still discovers that many people hated Gluant and even wanted to kill him. Bizu, a France player who blamed Gluant for \"stealing away\" Xania, is the prime murder suspect until he is shot in the head in the team's locker room. While gathering information at a casino, Clouseau meets [[MI6]] agent Nigel Boswell, who foils a robbery while wearing Clouseau's trench coat; Clouseau mistakenly receives credit and is nominated for the ''L\u00e9gion d'honneur''.\n\nAfter following Xania to [[New York City]], Ponton insists she is a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, but Clouseau believes she is innocent, though her actions cause him to believe she knows more than she's letting on. The poison that killed Gluant is found to have been derived from Chinese herbs, leading Dreyfus to conclude that the killer is a Chinese envoy named Dr. Pang, whom Gluant had several dealings with. Dreyfus has Clouseau's bag swapped for one full of weapons at the airport, and Clouseau is arrested (primarily due to his inability to say \"hamburger\" correctly, having attempted to smuggle some onto the flight back) and vilified by the press on his return to France. Dreyfus demotes Clouseau and plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the Presidential Ball, where Xania will perform.\n\nClouseau sees an article online about his arrest and deduces that Gluant and Bizu were killed by the same person. Realizing that Xania will be the killer's next target, Clouseau, Ponton and Nicole hurry to the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] and sneak into the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus errantly arrests Dr. Pang, Clouseau and Ponton save Xania's life by capturing her would-be assassin: Yuri, the France team's trainer. Jealous and feeling overlooked for the team's success, Yuri used his mandated knowledge of Chinese herbs to kill Gluant by jabbing the poison dart into his neck during their celebration. He later killed Bizu, who long suspected that Yuri might try to kill Gluant and attempted to blackmail him, by using his Russian army training to target the player's [[occipital lobe]], and then targeted Xania for ignoring him and dating Gluant.\n\nClouseau reveals that the Pink Panther was not stolen but instead sewn into the lining of Xania's purse; the photograph of Clouseau's arrest showed an X-ray of the purse at airport security. Xania confesses that Gluant gave her the diamond as an engagement ring just before the France-China match, but after his murder, she was worried that the public would assume she was responsible if she came forward with the ring. Clouseau concludes that Xania is the ring's rightful owner, and Yuri is taken into custody.\n\nClouseau wins the ''L\u00e9gion d'honneur''. Leaving the ceremony, Dreyfus' suit gets caught in Clouseau's car door, causing Dreyfus to be dragged down the street as an oblivious Clouseau drives away. While visiting Dreyfus in the hospital, Clouseau accidentally releases the brake on Dreyfus' bed, which rolls through the hospital and throws the irate chief inspector into the [[Seine River|Seine]] as he screams Clouseau's name.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Steve Martin]] as Inspector [[Inspector Clouseau|Jacques Clouseau]], a bumbling police officer from a small village in France, assigned to bring Yves Gluant's murderer to justice and recover the Pink Panther diamond\n*[[Kevin Kline]] as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus, the head of the French police who is obsessed with winning the [[Legion of Honour|Medal of Honour]], and means to use Clouseau and the Pink Panther case to win it\n*[[Jean Reno]] as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton, a capable police officer who is assigned to report to Dreyfus on Clouseau's actions\n*[[Emily Mortimer]] as Nicole Durant, a secretary and romance interest of Clouseau\n*[[Henry Czerny]] as Yuri, a Russian trainer for the [[France national football team]]\n*[[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Cherie, an American employee of the France national football team\n*[[Roger Rees]] as Raymond Laroque, a wealthy casino owner and friend of Yves Gluant\n*[[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]] as Xania, a famous pop star and girlfriend of Gluant\n*[[William Abadie]] as Bizu, a player on the France national football team\n*[[Scott Adkins]] as Jacquard, another player on the Franca national football team\n*Philip Goodwin as Deputy Chief Renard\n*[[Henri Garcin]] as President\n*[[Jean Dell]] as Justice Minister Clochard\n*[[Anna Katarina]] as Agent Corbeille\n*[[Jason Statham]] as Yves Gluant (uncredited), the head coach of the France national football team, whose murder and vanishing of his Pink Panther diamond serve as the main conflicts of the plot\n*[[Clive Owen]] as Nigel Boswell / Agent 006 (uncredited), an [[MI6]] secret agent who briefly helps Clouseau\n*[[Boris McGiver]] as Vainqueur (uncredited), the current head coach of the France national football team who takes over after the murder of Gluant\n\n==Production==\n[[Chris Tucker]] and [[Mike Myers]] were considered for the role of Inspector Jacques Clouseau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/07/the-lost-roles-of-chris-tucker.html|title = The Lost Roles of Chris Tucker|date = 28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-mike-myers.html|title=The Lost Roles of Mike Myers|date=16 June 2011}}</ref> A collaboration between Steve Martin and producer [[Robert Simonds]], who had worked together on ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', ''The Pink Panther'' had a [[production budget]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]80{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"boxoffice\"/> Filming began on May 10, 2004.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-music-entertainment/2004/columbia-music-video-set-to-release-new-beyonce-dvdcd-live-at-wembley.html |title=Columbia Music Video Set to Release New Beyonce DVD/CD: Live at Wembley |publisher=[[Columbia Records]] |date=April 23, 2004 |access-date=December 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally supposed to seek an August 5, 2005 release date, but was then pushed back to February 10, 2006, after Sony expressed dissatisfaction with the film's raunchy tone.
