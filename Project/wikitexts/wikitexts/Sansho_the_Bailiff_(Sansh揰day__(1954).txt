His wife, Tamaki, and children, Zushi\u014d and Anju, are sent to live with her brother. Just before they are separated, Zushi\u014d's father tells him, \"Without mercy, man is like a beast. Even if you are hard on yourself, be merciful to others.\" He urges his son to remember his words and gives him a statuette of [[Kannon]], the Goddess of Mercy.\n\nYears later, the wife and children journey to his exiled land but are tricked on the journey by a treacherous priestess. The mother is sold into prostitution in [[Sado, Niigata|Sado]] and the children are sold by slave traders to a manorial estate in which slaves are brutalized and branded when they try to escape. The estate, protected under the [[Udaijin|Minister of the Right]], is administered by the eponymous Sansh\u014d. Sansh\u014d's son Tar\u014d, the second-in-charge, is a much more humane master and convinces the children to survive before they can escape to find their mother.\n\nThe children grow to young adulthood at the slave camp. Anju still believes in the teachings of her father but Zushi\u014d has repressed his humanity, becoming one of the brutal overseers, believing that this is the only way to survive. At work, Anju hears a song from a new slave girl from Sado which mentions her and her brother in the lyrics, leading her to believe their mother is still alive. She tries to convince Zushi\u014d to escape but he refuses, citing the difficulty and their lack of money.\n\nZushi\u014d is ordered to take Namiji, an older woman who is acutely ill, out of the slave camp to die in the wilderness. Anju accompanies them and while they break branches to provide covering for the dying woman, they recall a similar act from their earlier childhood. Zushi\u014d changes his mind and asks Anju to escape with him to find their mother. Anju asks him to take Namiji with him, convincing her brother she will stay behind to distract the guards. Zushi\u014d promises to return for Anju. However, after Zushi\u014d's escape, Anju commits suicide by walking into a lake, drowning herself so that she will not be tortured and forced to reveal her brother's whereabouts.\n\nAfter Zushi\u014d escapes, he finds Tar\u014d at an Imperial temple. Zushi\u014d asks him to care for Namiji so that he can go to [[Kyoto]] to appeal to the Chief Advisor regarding the appalling slave conditions. Although initially refusing to see him, the Chief Advisor realizes who Zushi\u014d is after seeing his statuette of [[Kannon]]. He then tells Zushi\u014d that his exiled father died the year before and offers him the post of the governor of Tango, the province where Sansh\u014d's manor is situated.\n\nAs Governor of Tango, Zushi\u014d issues an edict forbidding slavery on both public and private grounds. No one believes he can do this since governors have no power over private grounds. Although Sansh\u014d offers initial resistance, Zushi\u014d orders him and his men arrested, freeing the slaves. When he looks for Anju among Sansh\u014d's slaves, he learns that his sister sacrificed herself for his freedom. The manor is burned down by the ex-slaves while Sansh\u014d and his family are exiled. Zushi\u014d resigns immediately afterwards, stating that he has done what he intended to do.\n\nZushi\u014d goes to Sado for his aged mother, whom he believes is still a courtesan. After hearing a man state that she died in a [[tsunami]], he goes to the beach she is supposed to have died on. He finds a decrepit old woman sitting on the beach singing the same song he heard years before. Realizing she is his mother, he reveals his identity to her, but Tamaki, who has gone blind, assumes he is a trickster until he gives her the statuette of Kannon, which she recognizes by touch. Zushi\u014d tells her that both Anju and their father have died and apologizes for not coming for her in the pomp of his governor's post. Instead he followed his father's proverb, choosing mercy toward others by freeing Sansh\u014d's slaves. He tells his mother he has been true to his father's teachings, which she acknowledges poignantly.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Actor\n!Role\n|-\n|[[Kinuyo Tanaka]]\n|Tamaki\n|-\n|[[Ky\u014dko Kagawa]]\n|Anju\n|-\n|[[Eitar\u014d Shind\u014d]]\n|Sansh\u014d\n|-\n|[[Yoshiaki Hanayagi]]\n|Zushi\u014d\n|-\n|[[Ichir\u014d Sugai]]\n|Minister of Justice Ni\u014d\n|-\n|[[Ken Mitsuda]]\n|[[Fujiwara no Morozane]]\n|-\n|[[Masahiko Tsugawa]]\n|Zushi\u014d as a Boy\n|-\n|[[Masao Shimizu]]\n|Taira no Masauji\n|-\n|[[Chieko Naniwa]]\n|Ubatake\n|-\n|[[Kikue Mori]]\n|Priestess\n|-\n|[[Akitake K\u014dno]]\n|Tar\u014d\n|-\n|[[Ry\u014dsuke Kagawa]]\n|Donmy\u014d Ritsushi\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Globalize|section|date=June 2021}}\n''Sansho'' won the [[Silver Lion]] for best direction in the [[15th Venice International Film Festival]], which once again brought Mizoguchi to the attention of Western critics and film-makers, after ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' (International Award, 1952) and ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (Silver Lion, 1953).\n\nIn the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls, ''Sansho the Bailiff'' came in at 59th in the critics' poll, with 25 critics having voted for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b50a0d5/sightandsoundpoll2012 |title=Votes for Sansho Dayu (1954) |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> The Sight & Sound is regarded as one of the most important of the \"greatest ever film\" polls.\n\n''[[The New Yorker]]'' film critic [[Anthony Lane]] wrote in his September 2006 profile on Mizoguchi, \"I have seen ''Sansho'' only once, a decade ago, emerging from the cinema a broken man but calm in my conviction that I had never seen anything better; I have not dared watch it again, reluctant to ruin the spell, but also because the human heart was not designed to weather such an ordeal.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=September 11, 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911crci_cinema|title=Supermen: \"Hollywoodland\" and the films of Kenji Mizoguchi|last=Lane|first=Anthony|author-link=Anthony Lane}}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[RogerEbert.com]], Jim Emerson extolled the movie: \"I don't believe there's ever been a greater motion picture in any language.

A private workshop of the play was undertaken in fall 1993 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  It was directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]] with sets and costumes by [[Eiko Ishioka]], lighting by [[Jennifer Tipton]], sound by Hans Peter Kuhn, choreography by Suzushi Hanayagi, and a large all-Asian cast, including [[Bai Ling]].  A smaller-scale workshop was mounted by Geisler-Roberdeau under Malick's own direction in Los Angeles in spring 1994.  Plans to produce the play on Broadway were postponed indefinitely.\n\n==Anime film==\nA separate animated film, ''Anju and Zushiomaru'', was produced in 1961 by Toei, directed by Taiji Yabushita and Yuugo Serikawa.
