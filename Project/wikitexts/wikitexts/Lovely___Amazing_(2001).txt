Jane, longing to look younger and thinner, opts for [[liposuction]], with near tragic results. When Michelle's artistic talents fail to produce any income for her family, much to the dismay of her husband Bill, she takes a job as a one-hour photo developer and finds herself falling for the attention of her teenaged co-worker Jordan. Aspiring actress Elizabeth, who bestows upon stray dogs the affection she finds difficult to offer her boyfriend Paul, questions her appeal when she's rejected for a role based on her looks, and she seeks reassurance from film heartthrob Kevin McCabe. Overweight Annie tries to fit in better with her white adopted family by having her [[Hair straightening|hair straightened]] by black [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Sister]] volunteer Lorraine, who Jane hopes will put the young girl in touch with her heritage.\n\n==\u0421ast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Brenda Blethyn]] as Jane Marks\n*[[Catherine Keener]] as Michelle Marks\n*[[Emily Mortimer]] as Elizabeth Marks\n*[[Raven Goodwin]] as Annie Marks\n*[[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Jordan\n*[[Michael Nouri]] as Dr. Crane\n*[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Lorraine\n*[[Dermot Mulroney]] as Kevin McCabe\n*[[James LeGros]] as Paul\n*[[Clark Gregg]] as Bill\n*[[Spencer Garrett]] as Willy\n*[[Dreya Weber]] as Donna\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film debuted at the 2001 [[Telluride Film Festival]].

Ms. Holofcener's sharp, witty dialogue shows an ear acutely tuned to the edgy, competitive nuances of contemporary banter, and the movie expertly evokes the rivalry percolating just below the surface of the Markses' relationships. But once family members have weathered their personal crises, little seems to have changed.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Holden |first=Stephen |date=June 28, 2002 |title=FILM REVIEW; Outward Appearances Fuel Inner Neuroses |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/28/movies/film-review-outward-appearances-fuel-inner-neuroses.html |accessdate=October 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"Here is a movie that knows its women, listens to them, doesn't give them a pass, allows them to be real: It's a rebuke to the shallow ''[[Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (film)|Ya-Ya Sisterhood]]''.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 19, 2002 |title=Lovely & Amazing |work=RogerEbert.com |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lovely-and-amazing-2002 |accessdate=October 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Todd McCarthy said, \"Engaging, intermittently insightful but too glib to wring full value out of its subject matter, this brightly performed study of an extended family of females has enough going for it to quickly graduate from the fest circuit to a respectable career in specialized release . . .
