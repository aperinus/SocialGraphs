The film explores the \"intersection of race, justice, and [[mass incarceration]] in the United States;\"<ref name=\"dargis\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/movies/13th-review-ava-duvernay.html Manohla Dargis, \"Review: '13TH,' the Journey From Shackles to Prison Bars\"], ''The New York Times'', September 29, 2016. Retrieved February 20, 2017</ref> it is titled after the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1865, which abolished slavery throughout the United States and ended [[involuntary servitude]] except as a [[Penal labor in the United States|punishment for conviction of a crime]].\n\nDuVernay contends that slavery has been perpetuated since the end of the [[American Civil War]] through criminalizing behavior and enabling police to arrest poor [[freedmen]] and force them to work for the state under [[convict leasing]]; suppression of [[African Americans]] by [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], [[lynching]]s, and [[Jim Crow]]; politicians declaring a [[war on drugs]] that weighs more heavily on minority communities and, by the late 20th century, mass incarceration affecting communities of color, especially [[American Descendants of Slavery|American descendants of slavery]], in the United States. She examines the [[prison-industrial complex]] and the emerging detention-industrial complex, discussing how much money is being made by corporations from such incarcerations.\n\n''13th'' garnered acclaim from a number of film critics. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU-QT8ewQYM \"O.J.: Made in America\" wins Best Documentary Feature-Oscars on YouTube]</ref>\nand won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special]] at the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oscar Nominations |url=http://oscar.go.com/nominees |website=The Oscars |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |access-date=January 24, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110203809/http://oscar.go.com/nominees |archive-date=January 10, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIt experienced a surge in [[viewership]] by 4,665 percent in June 2020 during the [[George Floyd protests]].<ref name=\"newsweek\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film begins with an audio clip of President [[Barack Obama]] stating that the US had 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of the world's prisoners. This film features several activists, academics, political figures from both major US political parties, and public figures, such as [[Angela Davis]], [[Bryan Stevenson]], [[Michelle Alexander]], [[Jelani Cobb]], [[Van Jones]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Cory Booker]], [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], and others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/26/the-13th-trailer-ava-duvernay-netflix-prison-race|title=The 13th: inside Ava DuVernay's Netflix prison documentary on racial inequality|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|date=September 26, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=February 16, 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIt explores the economic history of slavery and post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] racist legislation and practices that replaced it. DuVernay contends as \"systems of racial control\" and forced labor from the years after the abolition of [[slavery]] to the present. Southern states criminalized minor offenses, arresting [[freedmen]] and forcing them to work when they could not pay fines; institutionalizing this approach as [[convict leasing]] (which created an incentive to criminalize more behavior). She contends they [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most black people]] across the South at the turn of the 20th century, excluding them from the political system (including juries), at the same time that [[lynching]] of black people by white mobs reached a peak. In addition, [[Jim Crow]] legislation was passed by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], to legalize [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and suppress minorities, forcing them into second-class status. Following the passage of [[Civil Rights Act|civil rights legislation]] in the 1960s that restored [[civil rights]], the film notes [[Southern strategy|the Republican Party's appeal to southern white conservatives]], including the claim to be the party to fight the war on crime and war on drugs, which began to include mandatory, lengthy sentencing. A new wave of minority suppression  began, reaching African Americans and others in the northern, mid-western and western cities where many had migrated in earlier decades. After their presidential candidates lost to Republicans, Democratic politicians such as [[Bill Clinton]] joined the war on drugs.\n\nAs a result, from the early 1970s to the present, the rate of incarceration and the number of people in prisons has climbed dramatically in the United States, while at the same time [[Crime in the United States|the rate of crime in the United States has continued to decline since the late 20th century]]. As late as the 2016 presidential election, the eventual winner [[Donald Trump]] worked to generate fear of crime, claiming high rates in New York City, for instance, which was not true according to the documentary. The documentary states that crime was lower overall than it had been in decades, but that Republican candidates raised it to generate fear. [[Private prison]] contractors entered the market to satisfy demand as arrests and sentences increased, forming an independent group with its own economic incentives to criminalize minor activities and lengthen sentences in order to keep prisons full. Politicians and businessmen in rural areas encouraged construction of prisons to supply local jobs, and they also have had incentives to keep prisons full.\n\nThe federal [[Bureau of Prisons]] announced in 2016 its intention to stop contracting with private providers for prison services. According to the film, the over-incarceration of adults has severely damaged generations of black and minority families and their children.\n\nThe film explores the role of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]], backed by corporations, that has provided Republican state and federal legislators with draft legislation to support the prison-industrial complex. It contends that only after some of the relationships were revealed did corporations like [[Walmart]] and others receive criticism and drop out of the organization.\n\nThe film explores the demonization of minority poor through these decades to serve political ends, contributing to fears of minorities by whites and to problems of police brutality against minority communities. In the 21st century, the regularity of fatal police shootings of unarmed minorities in apparently minor confrontations has been demonstrated by videos taken by bystanders and by the increasing use of cameras in police cars or worn by officers; DuVernay ends the film with graphic videos of fatal shootings of black people by police, what [[Manohla Dargis]] describes as, after the previous discussion, having the effect of \"a piercing, keening cry.\"<ref name=\"dargis\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by [[Ava DuVernay]], who wrote and directed [[Selma (film)|''Selma'']] (2014), and [[Spencer Averick]]. Averick also edited the film. Produced and filmed in secrecy, ''13th'' was revealed only after it was announced as the opening film for the [[2016 New York Film Festival]], the first documentary ever to open the festival.<ref name=\"lockett\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Gordon|title=2016 New York Film Festival to Open With Ava DuVernay Documentary 'The 13th'|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/new-york-film-festival-2016-opening-night-1201817239/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on October 7, 2016, on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"lockett\">{{cite web|last1=Lockett|first1=Dee|title=Ava DuVernay's The 13th Will Be the First Documentary to Ever Open the New York Film Festival|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/ava-duvernay-documentary-the-13th-to-open-nyff.html|date=July 19, 2016|publisher=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref> A companion piece ''13th: A Conversation with [[Oprah Winfrey]] & [[Ava DuVernay]]'' was released on January 26, 2017, in the United States and on January 31, 2017, worldwide on the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/ava-duvernay-oprah-winfrey-discuss-13th-netflix-special-clip-1201773438/|title=13TH: A Conversation with Oprah Winfrey & Ava DuVernay Clip|website=IndieWire|last=Calvario|first=Liz|access-date=April 24, 2017}}</ref> On April 17, 2020, Netflix released the film for free on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-17|title=13TH {{!}} FULL FEATURE {{!}} Netflix|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8|access-date=2020-06-15|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of 8.77/10.

She said, summarizing the film, \"The United States did not just criminalize a select group of black people.
