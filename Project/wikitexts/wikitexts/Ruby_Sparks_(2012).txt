It stars [[Paul Dano]] as an anxious novelist whose [[fictional character]], Ruby Sparks, played by Kazan, comes to life, and his struggles to reconcile his idealized vision of her with her increasing independence.<ref name=\"NYTimes 7-24\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/movies/ruby-sparks-starring-zoe-kazan-and-paul-dano.html|work=The New York Times|title=She's Everything He Wants, and Therein Lies the Problem 'Ruby Sparks,' Written by and Starring Zoe Kazan|author=Stephen Holden|date=July 24, 2012}}</ref> The score was composed by [[Nick Urata]] of the band [[DeVotchKa]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nCalvin Weir-Fields is a novelist who found incredible success at an early age but is struggling to recreate the success of his first book, as well as to forge relationships. His therapist tasks him to write a page about someone who likes his dog, Scotty. After a dream in which he meets a strange young woman, Calvin is inspired to write about her, admitting to Dr. Rosenthal that he is falling in love with this character and telling him all about \"Ruby Sparks\".\n\nCalvin's brother Harry and sister-in-law Susie come to visit, and Susie finds women's clothing around the house. Harry reads some of Calvin's new writing and criticizes it, saying that his version of a woman is overly idealized and unrealistic. Calvin writes a passage about Ruby falling in love with him, before falling asleep at his typewriter. The next day, he is stunned to find Ruby in his kitchen, a living person. He calls Harry, who does not believe him and advises him to meet with someone to take his mind off things. Ruby is confused by Calvin's behavior and insists on coming along, but he leaves her to shop while he meets with Mabel, a fan of his book who gave him her number. Ruby finds them and believes Calvin is cheating on her; the ensuing confrontation proves she is not a figment of his imagination.\n\nCalvin introduces Ruby to Harry, who is incredulous and suggests alternate explanations, but Calvin proves that his writing directly affects Ruby. He asks Harry not to tell anyone of Ruby's origins, insisting that since he wrote her into existence, he truly knows her, and asserts he will never write about her again.\n\nMonths later, Calvin reluctantly takes Ruby to meet his free-spirited mother Gertrude and her boyfriend Mort. While the outgoing Ruby enjoys herself, the introverted Calvin grows jealous of her time with other people, and her happiness fades with his increased gloominess.\n\nReturning home, their relationship becomes tense and a depressed Ruby explains to Calvin how lonely she is, suggesting they spend less time together. Fearful of Ruby's desertion, Calvin writes that Ruby is miserable without him. Ruby returns, now incredibly clingy. Tiring of this, Calvin writes that Ruby becomes constantly happy but he is morose, knowing her happiness is artificial.\n\nAfter talking with Harry, Calvin tries to write Ruby back to her original self, but his wording leaves her confused. They fight once more, and he attempts to cheer her up by taking her to a party hosted by author Langdon Tharp. Calvin leaves Ruby and talks with others about his unfinished manuscript. He runs into his ex-girlfriend Lila, who accuses him of being uninterested in anyone outside of himself. Langdon finds Ruby alone and flirts with her, convincing her to strip to her underwear and join him in the pool. Furious and humiliated, Calvin drives Ruby home.\n\nThey fight, and Ruby tells Calvin that he cannot stop her from doing what she wants. As she prepares to leave, Calvin reveals that she is a product of his imagination and that he can make her do anything he writes. Their growing argument leads to a crazed Calvin forcing Ruby to perform increasingly frenzied and humiliating acts. Ruby collapses and when Calvin tries to approach her\u2014feeling confused, lost, and having no control of her own self\u2014she locks herself in his room.\n\nDistraught and ashamed, Calvin writes a final page stating that as soon as Ruby leaves the house, she is no longer his creation, no longer subject to his will, and is free. He leaves the manuscript outside her door with a note telling her to read the last page and that he loves her. The next morning, Calvin finds the note and Ruby gone.\n\nTime passes, and Harry suggests Calvin write a new book about his experiences with Ruby. The novel, ''The Girlfriend'', is a success. Walking Scotty in the park, Calvin sees a woman who appears to be Ruby but has no recollection of him, reading his book. She says that Calvin also seems familiar, which he deflects by showing her his author's photo on the book. She jokes that they ought to start over, urging him, \"Don't tell me how it ends,\" to which he replies, \"I promise.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Calvin Weir-Fields, a young novelist who struggles with writer's block having not written a full book since his first publication at 19.\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Ruby Tiffany Sparks, a woman who initially is a dream and inspires Calvin to write about her until she eventually manifests herself fully in his life. \n* [[Chris Messina]] as Harry Weir-Fields, Calvin's older brother whom he confides in about the true nature of Ruby.\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Gertrude, Calvin's mother.\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Mort, the carefree boyfriend of Calvin's mother.

Kazan was initially inspired by a discarded mannequin and the myth of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], quickly writing twenty pages, before putting the script aside for six months. She returned to the writing when she was clear on the central concept of comparing the idea of love to the actuality of it.<ref name=\"filmlinc\">{{cite web|author=Film Society of Lincoln Center |url=http://www.filmlinc.com/blog/entry/video-qa-with-filmmakers-and-stars-of-ruby-sparks |title=VIDEO: Q&A with Filmmakers and Stars of \"Ruby Sparks\" &#124; Filmlinc.com &#124; Film Society of Lincoln Center |publisher=Filmlinc.com |date=December 7, 2012 |access-date=2013-01-06}}</ref> \nDuring the writing, Kazan thought of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', wanting to present a slanted version of our own reality. From early in the development, she wrote the lead character Calvin with her boyfriend Paul Dano in mind. On the feminist aspects of the story, Kazan explains she wanted to explore the idea of \"being gazed at but never seen\", where a woman is not properly understood but in a way that wasn't unkind or alienating for men.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tara Brady |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2012/1012/1224325172946.html |title=Reality?
