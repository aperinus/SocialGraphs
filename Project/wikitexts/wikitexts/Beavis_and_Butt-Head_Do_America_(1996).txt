The film follows [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]], two teen delinquents who travel the US and unknowingly become fugitives.\n\nPrevious offers by MTV to adapt ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' to film were rejected by Judge, before he eventually agreed to the film in 1994. As production began, the series' staff halted production while Judge wrote the screenplay with [[Joe Stillman]]. [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzell]] composed the film's score.\n\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] on December 15, 1996, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film later aired on [[MTV]] in 1999. It also aired on [[VH1]] in 2003. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $63.1 million in the United States and becoming the largest December box office opening of all time until it was surpassed the following year by ''[[Scream 2]]''. A sequel, ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe]]'', was released in 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] discover that their television is missing, and set out to find it. After several failed attempts to get a television, they come across a motel which offers one in every room. They meet Muddy Grimes, who mistakes them for hired hitmen and offers them $10,000 to \"do\" his wife Dallas in [[Las Vegas]]. Thinking he  wants them to have sex with her, Butt-Head convinces Beavis that they can \"score\" and buy a new television.\n\nMuddy drives the boys to the airport. In Las Vegas, Beavis and Butt-Head arrive at their hotel room, but Dallas catches them eavesdropping and holds them at gunpoint. The boys refuse Dallas' offer of $20,000 to \"do\" Muddy and argue over who will \"do\" Dallas first. Realizing that Beavis and Butt-Head have misunderstood their instructions, she plants the X-5 unit, a stolen [[biological weapon]], in Beavis' shorts. She tells them to meet her for sex at the [[U.S. Capitol]], but actually plans to kill them and recover the unit.\n\nBeavis and Butt-Head board a tour bus. After they accidentally sabotage [[Hoover Dam]], Agent Flemming of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (ATF) becomes convinced that the duo are criminal masterminds and places them on the [[FBI's Most Wanted List|FBI's most-wanted list]]. At [[Yellowstone National Park]], Beavis and Butt-Head accidentally board the wrong bus, joining a busload of nuns who are repulsed by the boys and abandon them in [[Petrified Forest National Park]]. After walking through the desert, the boys meet two former [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] roadies, oblivious that they are their biological fathers.\n\nMuddy returns to the motel and meets the real hitmen. He angrily swears to track down and kill Beavis and Butt-Head. The hitmen, who stole Beavis and Butt-Head's television, abandon it in front of the motel. Beavis and Butt-Head awaken to find the drifters gone and continue walking until they become dehydrated and weak. Beavis, suffering dehydration, takes a bite out of a [[peyote]] cactus, causing him to hallucinate.\n\nMuddy finds Beavis and Butt-Head. After learning that Dallas intends to meet them, he puts them in his trunk and drives on. In [[Virginia]], they jump out onto the interstate and cause a 400-car [[multiple vehicle collision|pileup]]. They walk past the scene and board their original tour bus, stopping at the Capitol before reaching the [[White House]]. Muddy confronts Dallas in a parking garage before she can meet Beavis and Butt-Head. She seduces him and they have sex in his car.\n\nThe ATF is dispatched to the White House because Beavis and Butt-Head are there on the same day as a peace conference. Beavis consumes caffeine and sugar and transforms into [[Cornholio]], his hyperactive alter ego. Wandering into the [[Oval Office]], he picks up the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|red phone]], causing a military alert. Butt-Head attempts to seduce [[Chelsea Clinton]] but is thrown out of her bedroom window. He is detained and cavity-searched by ATF officers.\n\nBeavis goes to their neighbor Tom Anderson's [[travel trailer]], where Anderson catches him masturbating and throws him out. The ATF, thinking Beavis has the bioweapon, are about to open fire when Anderson throws out Beavis' pants. The bioweapon flies into Butt-Head's hand and he gives it to Flemming. Anderson and his wife are accused of trying to frame Beavis and Butt-Head, and are arrested along with Dallas and Muddy. Flemming proclaims Beavis and Butt-Head heroes, and they meet President [[Bill Clinton]], who makes them honorary ATF agents. Beavis and Butt-Head return to Highland upset that they did not have sex or receive money, but they find their television at the motel and walk into the sunset.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|[[File:Demi Moore 2010 Time 100 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|none|Demi Moore voices Dallas Grimes]]\n|[[File:Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|Bruce Willis voices Muddy Grimes]]\n|[[File:Mike Judge by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|Mike Judge, the voice of Beavis and Butt-head for TV, returned to work on the film]]\n|}\n<!-- main cast only -->\n* [[Mike Judge]] as [[Beavis]], [[Butt-Head]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Tom Anderson|Tom Anderson]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Mr. Van Driessen|Mr. Van Driessen]], and [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Highland High faculty and staff|Principal McVicker]]\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Muddy Grimes\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Dallas Grimes\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Martha the Old Woman\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Agent Flemming\n\nOther voice actors include: Jacqueline Barba, [[Pamela Blair]], [[Eric Bogosian]], Kristofor Brown, Tony Darling, [[John Doman]], Francis DuMaurier, Jim Flaherty, [[Tim Guinee]], [[Toby Huss]], [[Sam Johnson]], [[Richard Linklater]], Rosemary McNamara, Harsh Nayyar, [[Karen Phillips]], Dale Reeves, Mike Ruschak, and Gail Thomas\n\n[[Greg Kinnear]] had an uncredited role as ATF Agent Bork;<ref name=\"cinemablend\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Beavis-Butthead-Do-America-Special-Collector-Edition-1817.html|title = Beavis and Butthead do America: Special Collector's Edition|date = May 27, 2016}}</ref> [[David Letterman]] (credited as Earl Hofert) had a role as a [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] [[roadie]].<ref name=\"ifc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ifc.com/2016/01/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-beavis-and-butt-head |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114202223/http://www.ifc.com/2016/01/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-beavis-and-butt-head |archive-date=January 14, 2016 |title=15 Things You Might Not Know About Beavis and Butt-Head {{!}} IFC}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nDevelopment for the film began in 1993 as part of a production deal with [[MTV]], [[David Geffen]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Geffen so believed in the potential of the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' TV series that he suggested creating a movie and record album based on the program. They originally conceived it as a live action movie, with ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' regulars [[David Spade]] and [[Adam Sandler]] in mind to play the title characters. After MTV's parent company [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] purchased [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1994, the studio became a partner in the film, replacing Warner's interest in the project and dropping the live action concept under pressure from ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' creator [[Mike Judge]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Geffen Camp Heh-Hehs All the Way to the Bank |date=January 17, 1997 |work=The Los Angeles Times |first=Claudia |last=Ellen |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-01-17-fi-19392-story.html}}</ref> Judge has stated production of the animated film was very [[ad hoc]] and had some difficulties with progressing due to most of the staff's television background. The animation of the film was provided by [[Rough Draft Studios]]'s facilities in [[South Korea]]. The hallucination sequence's design and animation was based on the works of [[Rob Zombie]]. The sequence's director was [[Chris Prynoski]]. <!-- This information is taken from the 2006 DVD release's end credits. -->\n\n=== Deleted scene ===\nWhen the film premiered on MTV on August 7, 1999, an additional [[deleted scene]] followed the airing: while visiting the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], Beavis attempts to [[Defecation|use the restroom]], but cannot because of the lack of toilet paper in the stall. Coincidentally, Butt-head is angry because the urinals lack the automatic flushing mechanisms that had amazed him at [[Yellowstone National Park]]. After the rest of their tour group finishes looking at the encased [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass with the U.S. flag pole, and steals it to use as \"T.P. for his bunghole.\" While Archive guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up, and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing [[John Hancock]]'s signature, stuck to his shoe. The scene does not appear on the DVD, although it is mentioned on the disc's commentary track. In the track, Judge noted that the scene did not [[test screening|test]] well.\n\nA deleted scene showing [[Chelsea Clinton]] packing up to leave the White House was also shot as an alternative to the scene in the film depicting Butt-Head meeting Chelsea in her bedroom, in the event that [[Bill Clinton]] should lose his [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 reelection bid]] to [[Bob Dole]]; however, by the spring of 1996 Judge chose to keep the original scene, feeling that it was looking as if Clinton was going to win his reelection bid{{tsp}}{{mdash}}{{tsp}}which he ultimately did that November.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' opened Number 1 in North America on December 20, 1996, and earned $63.1 million at the US box office after opening at #1 with $20.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/1996W51/ |title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 20-22, 1996 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |access-date=January 15, 2012}}</ref> It had a $12 million production budget.<ref name=\"Budget\">{{cite news|title= Beavis and Butt-head Make Creator and Paramount Proud|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 24, 1996|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-12-24-ca-12081-story.html|access-date=November 8, 2010 |first=Elaine |last=Dutka}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film holds {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average of {{RT data|average}}.

Metropolitan Orchestra, which were released on a separate album.\n\n\"Two Cool Guys\", written and performed by [[Soul music|soul]]/[[funk]] musician Isaac Hayes, is a semi-parody of Hayes' [[Academy Award]]-winning \"[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]\". It incorporates the theme from the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' television series as a rhythm guitar line, and series creator Mike Judge, who wrote the theme, is given a co-writing credit with Hayes in the soundtrack liner notes. The opening credit sequence which the song features is a take-off on popular 1970s cop movies and TV shows with Beavis and Butt-Head as hip ace sleuth Lothario detectives.\n\nThe version of Ozzy Osbourne's \"Walk on Water\" is not the same version included in the film. The film used an earlier demo version, while the soundtrack itself contains a later, revised version. The original demo, which appears in the film, can be found on Osbourne's ''Prince of Darkness'' box set.  Ozzy and co-writer [[Jim Vallance]] both prefer the demo version heard in the film.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walk On Water |url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/songs-folder-may-27/pg-song-osbourne-ozzy-walk.html |website=JimVallance.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414024542/http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/songs-folder-may-27/pg-song-osbourne-ozzy-walk.html |archive-date=2015-04-14}}</ref> \"Walk on Water\" was released as a single and peaked at number 28 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Billboard'' singles chart history-Ozzy Osbourne |url=http://%7b%7bbillboardurlbyname%7cartist=ozzy/ |access-date=February 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220005053/http://%7b%7bbillboardurlbyname%7cartist=ozzy/ |archive-date=February 20, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe use of AC/DC's \"Gone Shootin'\" is particularly fitting for the series, as Judge himself would eventually admit the guitar solo that serves as the show's theme was in fact the solo from the AC/DC song played backwards.\n\nThe soundtrack was re-released in 2016 on a special edition LP picture disc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beavis And Butt-Head Do America -
