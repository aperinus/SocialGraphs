The film stars [[Richard Pryor]] and [[John Candy]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[Herschel Weingrod]] and [[Timothy Harris (writer)|Timothy Harris]] was based on the 1902 [[Brewster's Millions|novel of the same name]] by [[George Barr McCutcheon]]. It is the seventh film based on the story.\n\n==Plot==\nMonty Brewster is a [[Minor League Baseball]] pitcher with the [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] Bulls. He and his best friend, Spike Nolan, the Bulls' catcher, are arrested after a post-game bar fight. A man offers to post their bail if they will come to [[New York City]] with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville & Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn, whom he has never met, has left him his entire $300 million fortune but only if he can complete a challenge with several conditions.\n\nBrewster can choose to receive $1 million upfront or attempt to inherit the whole estate by spending $30 million in 30 days. In the former case, the law firm becomes the executor of the estate, collecting a fee for performing this service and dividing the remainder among several charities. In the latter case, Brewster may not own any assets that are not already his at the end of the 30 days. He must get value for the services of anyone he hires, he may not give it away (except for 5% in gambling losses and 5% to charity) nor may he willfully damage anything bought with the money. Finally, he must keep it secret. If he fails to meet all terms, he forfeits any remaining balance and inherits nothing. Brewster decides to take the $30 million challenge, and Angela Drake, a [[paralegal]] from the law firm, is assigned to accompany him and keep track of his spending.\n\n[[File:Inverted Jenny.png|thumb|left|A copy of the famous [[Inverted Jenny]] appears in one of the film's gags.]]\nBrewster, who has never earned more than $11,000 a year, rents an expensive hotel suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]], hires personal staff on exorbitant salaries and places bad gambling bets. However, Spike makes good investments, earning Brewster money. Realizing that he is making no headway, Brewster decides to run for [[mayor of New York City]] and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for \"[[none of the above]].\"  The two major candidates threaten to sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, but they settle out of court for several million dollars. Brewster then hires the [[New York Yankees]] for a three-inning exhibition against the Bulls, with himself as the pitcher. He is forced to end his protest campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a [[write-in candidate]]; the job carries an annual salary of $60,000, which is considered an asset under the terms of the will. Blowing his last $38,000 on a party after the game, Brewster becomes fed up with money and is heartbroken that Spike, Angela and others around him do not understand his actions.\n\nOn the final day, he finds that the sycophantic treatment he received from his entourage is gone. Shunned by everyone he knows, Brewster makes his way to the law office. Having withdrawn from the election, he learns that the city voted \"None of the Above,\" forcing another election in which none of the previous candidates are running.\n\nWarren Cox, a junior lawyer from the law firm and Angela's fianc\u00e9, has been bribed by the firm to ensure that Brewster fails to spend the entire $30 million. Moments before time expires, Cox hands Brewster some money previously thought to have been spent and informs him he is not broke. Shortly before Brewster signs, Angela learns of the plot and reveals it to him. Brewster punches Cox, who threatens to sue and declines Brewster's offer of the money as compensation. Realizing that he will need a lawyer, Brewster pays the money to Angela as a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]]. With the transaction completed and all of the money now gone, Brewster fulfills the terms of the will and inherits the entire $300 million.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Montgomery Brewster\n* [[John Candy]] as Spike Nolan\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Angela Drake\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Warren Cox\n* [[David White (actor)|David White]] as George Granville\n* Jerome Dempsey as Norris Baxter\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Charlie Pegler\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Edward Roundfield\n* [[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Eugene Provost\n* [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Marilyn\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Uncle Rupert Horn\n* [[Grand L.

He had never made a comedy before, but had made the successful ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' which featured comic scenes and a comic lead, [[Eddie Murphy]].

I like westerns because everything is very clear in them. 'I like movies in which the story line is simple and straightforward and the characters are confronted with issues of life and death. But Hollywood has decided that people don't like westerns anymore, so I have to make these other movies and pretend they're not westerns... My idea of a good movie is to take very clearly defined characters and put them in the highest possible jeopardy and then see what happens,\" Hill said.<ref name=\"rick\">{{cite news|title=No Matter What the Film Setting, This Director Still Makes Westerns|last=Lyman|first= Rick|newspaper= Philadelphia Inquirer|date=June 3, 1984|page= I.2}}</ref>\n\nHill said Richard Pryor \u201cdidn't believe that he was funny unless he took drugs, and he believed that if he took drugs he would die. Also, he had money problems, of course, so he had to work and take jobs and make lots of money. So it was difficult, but I liked Richard very much.\u201d<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/walter-hill-masterclass-2016-lumiere-festival-10-highlights-1201886023/|date=October 11, 2016|title=Walter Hill: 'Don't Feel Sorry for Film Directors'|first1=John|last1=Hopwell|first2=Jamie|last2=Lang|newspaper=Variety}}</ref>\n\nThe Hackensack Bulls' baseball park was a set from the TV series ''[[Bay City Blues]]'', formerly located at the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|LADWP]] [[Valley Generating Station]] in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Jeff Meyers | title=BYE-BYE BLUEBIRD : End at Hand for Sun Valley Film Set and Home to Amateur Baseball Teams | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-25/sports/sp-6230_1_mission-college-dwp-valley-generating-station | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 25, 1989 | access-date=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] visited the set during filming as part of her US tour.<ref>FILM CLIPS: OZ CALLS ALL THE SHOTS IN MUPPET FILM FILM CLIPS: 'MANHATIAN' COMES TO L.A.\nLondon, Michael.

She went on to praise the film's supporting cast, including John Candy, but said that the \"flat\" screenplay forces Candy to repeat himself.<ref>{{cite web | author=Janet Maslin | title=FILM: PRYOR IN REMAKE OF 'BREWSTER'S MILLIONS' | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE3D9133BF931A15756C0A963948260 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 22, 1985 | access-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref> The film holds a rating of 35% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 23 reviews.\n\nWalter Hill later called the movie \"an aberration in the career line\" being his only flat out comedy.<ref>Action man with an eye for character\nDwyer, Michael.
