Prone to randomly wandering away from home, he perpetually carries around a [[lunchbox]] while frequently repeating the word \"[[California]]\".\n\nJennifer's death caused Jimmy's family to split: he lives with his mother Christine and stepfather Mr. Bateman while his older half-brothers Nick and Corey live with their father Sam. Exasperated by Jimmy's behavior, Christine and Mr. Bateman decide to commit Jimmy to an institution. Unwilling to allow it, Corey sneaks Jimmy out and they start traveling on foot for [[Los Angeles]]. Nick and Sam resolve to bring the boys back while competing with Mr. Putnam, a greedy bounty hunter hired by Mr. Bateman and Christine to find Jimmy.\n\nAt a bus station, Jimmy and Corey meet Haley Brooks, a teenager on her way home to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. When they discover that Jimmy is innately talented at playing [[video game]]s, Haley informs Corey of \"Video Armageddon\", a gaming tournament being held in [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], with a grand prize of $50,000. Corey sees the tournament as an opportunity to avert Jimmy's institutionalization by showcasing his talent, and Haley agrees to help take Jimmy there in return for a share of the winnings.\n\nThe trio hitchhike cross-country, using Jimmy\u2019s skills to win bets on games. They eventually meet popular but snobbish gamer Lucas Barton, who demonstrates his ability to play ''[[Rad Racer]]'' with a [[Power Glove]] and informs Haley he will also be competing. Corey and Haley learn that Jimmy's lunchbox contains photos and mementos of Jennifer.\n\nThe trio arrive in Reno, gaining more money with help from Haley\u2019s [[trucker]] friend Spankey whom Haley coaches to success at a casino\u2019s [[craps]] table. Jimmy then begins training on arcade machines with help from the [[Nintendo Power Line]]. The children escape from Putnam to Haley's trailer where she reveals she wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a proper house. Putnam finds Haley's trailer and captures Jimmy, but Haley summons several truckers who barricade Putnam on the road and rescue Jimmy.\n\nAfter Spankey drives the children to the tournament, Jimmy enters and becomes a finalist after playing ''[[Ninja Gaiden (NES video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]''. In between rounds, Putnam unsuccessfully reattempts to apprehend the children. Jimmy, Lucas, and a third finalist compete in the tournament's final round \u2013 they have 10 minutes to score as many points as possible in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', a brand-new game not yet released in the United States. Cheered on by his family, Haley, and even Putnam, Jimmy wins at the last second, becoming the tournament champion and earning the cash prize.\n\nAs the entire family heads home, accompanied by Haley, Jimmy suddenly becomes restless upon spotting the [[Cabazon Dinosaurs]], causing them to stop the car. They follow him inside, and Corey finds Jimmy looking at his photos of the family, one of which was taken at the [[tourist trap]]. They realize that Jimmy only sought closure where Jennifer was happy. Jimmy leaves his lunchbox at the site and the family resumes the car trip, happily riding off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fred Savage]] as Corey\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Nick\n* [[Jenny Lewis]] as Haley\n* Luke Edwards as Jimmy\n* [[Will Seltzer]] as Putnam\n* [[Sam McMurray]] as Bateman\n* [[Frank McRae]] as Spankey\n* [[Wendy Phillips]] as Christine\n* Jackey Vinson as Lucas\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as Sam\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Tobey Maguire]] has his first film role, an uncredited part as Lucas's Goon at ''Video Armageddon''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mackie |first=Drew |date=December 18, 2014 |title=25 Years Later, Revel in the Nostalgia of The Wizard |url=https://people.com/celebrity/the-wizard-25th-anniversary/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url-status=live|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830154352/https://people.com/celebrity/the-wizard-25th-anniversary/}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nDuring 1988, a shortage of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chips and the preparation of a version of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' for the west delayed several of Nintendo's game releases in North America.

The deleted material was finally released in 2020 on the collector's edition [[Blu-ray]] of the film. Most of the deleted footage comes from the original cut of the opening act which explores Corey's home life in more detail, including deliberately antagonizing his older brother, his mother's emotional issues surrounding Jimmy and her divide from her former family. Nick's alcoholism is also explored in more detail as well as additional clips from the road trip scenes. Trucker Spanky gets more screen time in the deleted scenes also, explaining his role in more detail, and there are more clips from the final Video Game Armageddon contest.\n\n==Music==\n* [[BoDeans]] \u2013 \"You Don't Get Much\"\n* [[Patsy Cline]] \u2013 \"[[Leavin' on Your Mind]]\"\n* [[BoDeans]] \u2013 \"Red River\"\n* [[New Kids on the Block]] \u2013 \"[[You Got It (The Right Stuff)]]\"\n* [[Real Life (band)|Real Life]] \u2013 \"[[Send Me an Angel (Real Life song)|Send Me an Angel '89]]\"\n* [[New Kids on the Block]] \u2013 \"[[Hangin' Tough (song)|Hangin' Tough]]\"\n* [[Martha & The Vandellas]] \u2013 \"[[Nowhere to Run (Martha and the Vandellas song)|Nowhere to Run]]\"\n* [[Paul Carrack]] \u2013 \"I Live by the Groove\"\n* [[Bobby Brown]] \u2013 \"[[Don't Be Cruel (Bobby Brown song)|Don't Be Cruel]]\"\n* [[Paul Anka]] \u2013 \"[[My Way (song)|My Way]]\"\n* [[Sally Dworsky]] \u2013 \"I Found My Way\"\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Wizard'' debuted at No. 5,<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-19/entertainment/ca-454_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}</ref> earning $2,142,525 in the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1989&wknd=50&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 15-17, 1989 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=December 18, 1989 | accessdate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> At the end of its run, the film had grossed $14,278,900.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wizard.htm | title=The Wizard (1989) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> Based on an estimated $6 million budget, the film was a moderate box office success, after which it became a [[cult film]].<ref name=budget>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098663/business | title=The Wizard (1989) - Box office / business | work=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=February 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received negative reviews from critics.
