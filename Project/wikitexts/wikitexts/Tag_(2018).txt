The film was released June 15, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $78 million worldwide, against a production budget of $28 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nHogan \"Hoagie\" Malloy, Bob Callahan, Randy \"Chilli\" Cilliano, Kevin Sable and Jerry Pierce have been playing tag since 1983 during the month of May, with Jerry being the only member of the group who has not been tagged. Hoagie recruits Bob, Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, telling them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter doing a piece on Bob, joins them and decides to write an article on the friends. They are also accompanied by Hoagie's wife Anna.\n\nOnce in their hometown, they locate Jerry and make an attempt to tag him, but are quickly overwhelmed by Jerry's skill. Jerry introduces his fiancee Susan. While the others express disappointment over not being invited to the wedding despite their close relationship (Jerry knew he would almost certainly be tagged or at least targeted during the ceremonies), they agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this, the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry, but come up short, with one of the attempts leaving Hoagie, Chilli, and Kevin in painful traps, set by Jerry. During the rehearsal dinner, Susan reveals to the guys that she is pregnant.\n\nDefeated, the group try to build a new plan. After finding out Jerry attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings, the group decide to strike his next meeting, which is on his wedding day. In preparation, they lock every exit and dress up as members of AA. They make their move and almost tag Jerry, but once he finds himself trapped in the church, Jerry retreats to the communion wine storage. He stays there for hours as the guys besiege the room, until Susan comes by, with the wedding just a few hours away. Susan berates Jerry for risking their wedding for a childish game but suddenly appears to have a miscarriage. Jerry comes out to help. Chilli is convinced that it is a ruse, but the situation seems authentic, and Jerry himself also tells them he is not playing around and the two leave.\n\nThe guys receive texts that the wedding is postponed due to the potential miscarriage. However, a suspicious Anna sees that the bridesmaids all made similar Instagram posts. With one of the bridesmaids having a crush on Bob, and also having a private profile, Anna creates a fake profile for Bob in order to bait the bridesmaid for the truth. Once they get access, they see a post from the bridesmaid of Susan in her dress, showing that the wedding is still on schedule. Incensed by the trick, the gang decide to crash the wedding. Upon their arrival, Susan confirms the hoax, including the pregnancy. Angry at Jerry for lying, Hoagie decides to tag Jerry at the end of the ceremony after he and Susan kiss. Hoagie charges at Jerry and ends up tackling the pastor to the ground. Hoagie then loses consciousness, which Jerry thinks is a ruse, but Anna confirms that Hoagie's condition is serious and calls for an ambulance.\n\nEveryone meets up at the hospital where Hoagie tells them the truth: he had lied about Jerry quitting after the season because he wanted to reunite with his friends after he recently discovered a tumor on his liver; he was concerned that he might not be alive for the following year and was heartbroken at possibly dying without seeing Jerry finally get tagged. Jerry chooses to swallow his pride and allows Hoagie to tag him. The group starts the game again, running around the hospital as they did as children, and change their rules so Anna and Rebecca can play as well.\n\nBefore the credits roll, a photograph is displayed, showing the real group of ten men that inspired the film, who continue to play to this day.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Hogan \"Hoagie\" Malloy\n** [[Jaren Lewison]] as Teen Hogan\n** Braxton Bjerken as Young Hogan\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Randy \"Chilli\" Cilliano\n** Kevin Moody as Teen Randy\n** [[Tyler Crumley]] as Young Randy\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Bob Callahan\n** Elijah Marcano as Teen Bob \n** Braxton Alexander as Young Bob \n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Kevin Sable\n** Xavion Shelton as Teen Kevin\n** Legend Williams as Young Kevin\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Jerry Pierce\n** Maxwell Ross as Teen Jerry \n** Brayden Benson as Young Jerry\n* [[Annabelle Wallis]] as Rebecca Crosby, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Anna Malloy, Hogan's wife\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Cheryl Deakins\n** Kella Raines as Teen Cheryl \n** Th'Yana Star as Young Cheryl\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Susan Rollins, Jerry's fianc\u00e9e\n* Steve Berg as Louis\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Linda, Hogan's mother\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Mr. Cilliano, Randy\u2019s father\n* [[Thomas Middleditch]] as Dave\n* [[Lil Rel Howery]] as Reggie\n* [[Sebastian Maniscalco]] as Pastor\n* [[Carrie Brownstein]] as Therapist (uncredited)<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/movies/tag-review-jon-hamm-hannibal-buress.html |title=Review: 'Tag,' You're It.
