The supporting cast includes [[Patsy Ruth Miller]], [[Norman Kerry]], [[Nigel de Brulier]], and [[Brandon Hurst]]. The film was [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s \"Super Jewel\" of 1923 and was their most successful [[silent film]], grossing $3.5 million.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The film premiered on September 2, 1923 at the Astor Theatre in New York, New York, then went into release on September 6.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Perley Poore Sheehan and Edward T. Lowe Jr., based on [[Victor Hugo]]'s [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|1831 novel]], and is notable for the grand sets that recall 15th century Paris as well as for Chaney's performance and make-up as the tortured hunchback bellringer [[Quasimodo]]. This was the seventh film adaptation of the novel. The film elevated Chaney, who was already a well-known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood, and also helped set a standard for many later [[horror film]]s, including Chaney's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' in 1925.

[[Quasimodo]] is a deaf, half-blind, [[Kyphosis|hunchbacked]] bell-ringer of the famous [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]] in Paris. His master is a man named [[Jehan Frollo|Jehan]], the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon [[Claude Frollo|Dom Claude]]. One night, Jehan prevails upon Quasimodo to kidnap the fair [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]], a dancing [[Romani people|Roma]] girl (and the adopted daughter of [[Clopin]], the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld).\n\nThe dashing [[Captain Phoebus]] rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees (later in the film, Quasimodo hates Jehan for abandoning him and is no longer loyal to him). At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square before Esmeralda and Dom Claude come to his aid.\n\n[[File:Hunchback -Notre Dame 1923.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Dom Claude restrains Quasimodo from violence.]]\nTo their dismay, Jehan and Clopin learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by [[King Louis XI]]. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt.\n\nClopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet [[Pierre Gringoire]] to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Phoebus arrives and is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Dom Claude grant her [[Sanctuary#Legal sanctuary|sanctuary]].\n\nLater that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks and torrents of molten lead. Meanwhile, the healed Phoebus is alerted by Gringoire and leads his men against the rabble. Clopin is killed in the battle.\n\nWhen Quasimodo finds Jehan attacking Esmeralda, he throws his former master off the ramparts of Notre Dame, but not before Jehan fatally stabs him three times in the back. Phoebus finds and embraces Esmeralda. Witnessing this, Quasimodo rings his own death toll, and Gringoire and Dom Claude enter the bell tower just in time to see him die. The last image is of the great bell swinging silently above Quasimodo's corpse.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Lon Chaney]] as [[Quasimodo]]<ref name=film>{{cite AV media | title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame  | publisher=Universal | date=1923 | medium=35 mm reel}}</ref>\n* [[Patsy Ruth Miller]] as [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Norman Kerry]] as [[Phoebus de Chateaupers]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Kate Lester]] as Madame de Gondelaurier<ref name=film />\n* [[Winifred Bryson]] as Fleur de Lys<ref name=film />\n* [[Nigel De Brulier]] as [[Claude Frollo|Don Claudio]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Brandon Hurst]] as [[Jehan Frollo|Jehan]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Ernest Torrence]] as [[Clopin]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Tully Marshall]] as [[King Louis XI]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Harry von Meter]] as Monsieur Neufchatel<ref name=film />\n* [[Raymond Hatton]] as [[Pierre Gringoire|Gringoire]]<ref name=film />\n* [[Nick De Ruiz]] as Monsieur le Torteru<ref name=film />\n* [[Eulalie Jensen]] as Marie<ref name=film />\n* [[Roy Laidlaw (actor)|Roy Laidlaw]] as Charmolue<ref name=film />\n* [[Ray Myers]] as Charmolue's assistant<ref name=film />\n* William Parke as Josephus<ref name=film />\n* [[Gladys Brockwell]] as Sister Gudule<ref name=film />\n* [[John Cossar]] as Judge of the Court<ref name=film />\n* [[Edwin Wallock]] as King's Chamberlain<ref name=film />\n* [[Louise LaPlanche]] as a young Gypsy girl (extra)\n* Elmo Lincoln\n* Joe Bonomo (stunt double)\n* Harvey Perry (stunt double)\n* Cesare Gravina<ref name=annarbor>{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Carolin|title=Former Hollywood actress Louise LaPlanche of Ann Arbor dies at 93 |url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/former-hollywood-actress-ann-arbor-resident-louise-laplanche-dead-at-93/#.UGrk8q7pfsc |work=[[AnnArbor.com]] |date=September 8, 2012 |access-date=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Hunchback set 1922.jpg|thumb|right|Worsley observing the erection of the first set in December 1922.]]\nLong before the film was produced or shot, Lon Chaney was the industry favorite to play the role of Quasimodo. ''[[Film Daily]]'' stated it was essentially common knowledge that Chaney wanted to play the role of Quasimodo and even claimed that Chaney considered organizing a company to make the film abroad.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily2122newy#page/n352/mode/1up/search/hunchback | title=\"U\" making \"Notre Dame\" | journal=The Film Daily | date=July 1922 | volume=21 | issue=42 | pages=1}}</ref> It is known that Chaney had acquired the rights to produce the film in 1921 and had been actively engaged in negotiating the production with Universal.

Bolstered by Chaney's recent box office successes, Laemmle agreed.<ref name=soister />\n\n''Universal Weekly'', the house publication of Universal, formally announced the production of ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' in August 1922.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/universal1516univ#page/n543/mode/1up/ | title=Forthcoming Screen Productions Keep Universal City Studios Busy | journal=Universal Weekly |date=September 1922  | volume=16 | issue=2 | pages=12}}</ref> <!-- Following Universal's announcement of the production, --> The next issue stated that the Universal Scenario Department was working on the continuity and that preliminary plans for the sets were being drafted.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/universal1516univ#page/n602/mode/1up/ | title=Universal to Film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" Hugo's Great Novel | journal=Universal Weekly |date=September 1922  | volume=16 | issue=3 | pages=27}}</ref> In September 1922, ''Universal Weekly'' announced Lon Chaney's intention for it to have him act in his final \"cripple role\", following the successes of both ''[[The Miracle Man (1919 film)|The Miracle Man]]'' and ''[[The Penalty (1920 film)|The Penalty]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/universal1516univ#page/n645/mode/1up | title=Chaney to Play 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' for Universal | journal=Universal Weekly |date=September 1922  | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=27}}</ref> Chaney's ownership of the film rights allowed him contractual latitude for far more artistic approval and control of this production than he had had in previous ones; for this, he would thus serve as an uncredited, ''de facto'' producer; Thalberg was undoubtedly complicit in such an arrangement, with it serving to prevent Carl Laemmle from cutting costs on the \"artistic\" production.<ref name=soister />\n\nIt is not known for certain, but Lon Chaney is believed to have even been influential in the selection of the director; although [[Wallace Worsley]], the final choice for director, had previously worked successfully with Chaney on four previous films (''The Penalty'', ''[[The Ace of Hearts (1921 film)|The Ace of Hearts]]'', ''[[Voices of the City]]'', and ''[[A Blind Bargain]]''; the last of which also featured Chaney as a hunchback) at [[Goldwyn Pictures|Goldwyn]], Michael Blake, a Lon Chaney scholar, states that Chaney's first choice for director was [[Erich von Stroheim]], at that time Universal's prized \"name\" director after the successes of ''[[Blind Husbands]]'' and ''[[Foolish Wives]]''. However, Stroheim was fired by Thalberg from Universal before production on ''Hunchback'' commenced\u2014ironically, due to Thalberg's fears that Stroheim would incur cost overruns on his own separate production, ''[[Merry-Go-Round (1923 film)|Merry-Go-Round]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Wakeman|1y=1987|1p=1073|2a1=Lennig|2y=2000|2p=188}}\n\n''Universal Weekly'' thus announced Wallace Worsley, pending approval from his then-home studio [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], as the likely director of ''Hunchback'' in late November.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/universal1516univ#page/n903/mode/1up/| title=Universal Moviegrams| journal=Universal Weekly |date=September 1922  | volume=16 | issue=15 | pages=18}}</ref> Worsley's status as director, on loan from Paramount, was confirmed in the following issue, though such confirmation ran alongside an advertisement that stated [[Tod Browning]] would direct.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://archive.org/stream/universal1516univ#page/n903/mode/1up/| title=\"U\" Moviegrams| journal=Universal Weekly |date=September 1922  | volume=16 | issue=16 | pages=11}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Advertisements that Tod Browning would direct, even after the announcement of Worsley's role was not singular.

His extraordinary make-up as a veritable living gargoyle reaches the limit of grotesquery (and at moments seems to go a shade beyond it) but his sprawling movements and frantic gestures are brilliantly conceived, and his final dance of frenzy at the defeat of Clopin's rabble is a scene of delirious passion which has seldom been equalled on the screen.\" ---Bioscope\n\n\"In spite of the liberties taken with the Victor Hugo novel, this picture is a superb and remarkably impressive spectacle....with the addition of some of the most stupendous and interesting settings ever shown.

It's murderous, hideous and repulsive. Hugo's tale is immortal; Laemmle's picture is fragile as a film house commodity...[The film] is misery all of the time, nothing but misery, tiresome, loathsome misery that doesn't make you feel any the better for it.
