The film gained a considerable amount of notoriety in film festivals around the world for its four-hour runtime and themes including love, family, lust, religion and the crime of [[upskirt]] photography. The first version was originally six hours long, but was trimmed at the request of the producers.\n\nFollowing its release, it won many awards and received acclaim from critics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ff20090206r1.html|title= Telling a lengthy tale of lust and religion|first= Mark|last= Schilling|date= February 6, 2009|work= [[The Japan Times]]|accessdate= December 21, 2010}}</ref> At the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], it won the Caligari Film Award and the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Prize]].<ref name=IMDb/>\n\n==Plot==\nY\u016b Honda is a young teenager [[Christianity in Japan#Catholicism|Catholic]] attempting to live his life faithfully. His father, Tetsu, has become a devout Catholic [[priest]] following the death of Y\u016b's mother and operates his own church. Tetsu asks Y\u016b to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] his sins, but Y\u016b believes he is a good person who has little to confess. To appease his father, he makes up sins but his father sees right through him so Y\u016b becomes obsessed with committing real sins. Y\u016b befriends other boys and is taught to steal, fight, and take [[Upskirt|stealth photographs up women's skirts]]. Y\u016b promptly becomes a skilled \"panty shot\" photographer. Though perceived as a [[Perversion|pervert]], he is never aroused by these photographs.\n\nAfter Y\u016b loses a bet with his friends, he agrees to go into the city dressed as a woman and kiss a girl he likes. When they go into the city, Y\u016b and his friends come across Y\u014dko, his \"[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]\" who is surrounded by a group of thugs. Still dressed as a woman, he helps Y\u014dko, a skilled fighter herself, beat up the gang. Afterwards he kisses Y\u014dko and runs away. Y\u016b falls in love with her \u2013 the first time he's been in love with a girl - but Y\u014dko falls for his disguise and develops feelings for his [[alter ego]] Sasori, or \"Miss Scorpion\".\n\nMeanwhile, Y\u016b is being followed by Aya Koike, a member of the [[cult]] \"Zero Church\", who has become infatuated with him after she catches him taking a picture of her panties. Aya, who turned violent after being [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] to the point of insanity, plans to bring Y\u016b's entire family into the Zero Church and masquerades as Sasori to gain Y\u014dko's favor.\n\nAya manipulates those around Y\u016b and Y\u014dko and Y\u016b's family become caught up in the Zero Church. Y\u016b desperately tries to free Y\u014dko from the cult by kidnapping her but fails to persuade her to leave as she does not trust him to be Miss Scorpion and is convinced he is a pervert. Armed with a sword, Y\u016b breaks into the Zero Church's building and again tries to escape with Y\u014dko. Aya, who is present along with Y\u016b's family, fights back, but commits [[suicide]] by driving the sword through her stomach when she realizes Y\u016b's love for Y\u014dko.\n\nY\u016b is taken to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]], where he has forgotten all of his past and convinced himself that he is really Sasori. Y\u014dko comes to visit, claiming that she now realises that she loves him as he was the one always trying to save her. Y\u016b cannot remember who she is, so security escort the hysterical Y\u014dko out of the building. Moments later, Y\u016b remembers her and escapes from the hospital, running after the car driving Y\u014dko away. Y\u016b catches up, smashes open the car window, and joins hands with Y\u014dko.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takahiro Nishijima]] as Y\u016b Honda\n* [[Hikari Mitsushima]] as Y\u014dko Ozawa\n* [[Sakura Ando]] as Aya Koike\n* [[Makiko Watanabe]] as Kaori Fujiwara\n* [[Atsuro Watabe]] as Tetsu Honda\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Love Exposure'' holds an approval rating of 91% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 7.74/10.
