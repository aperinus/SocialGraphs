Screenwriter [[Alvin Sargent]] adapted the script from the 1971 novel ''[[Addie Pray]]'' by [[Joe David Brown]]. The film, shot in [[black-and-white]], is set in [[Kansas]] and [[Missouri]] during the [[Great Depression]]. It stars the real-life father and daughter pairing of [[Ryan O'Neal|Ryan]] and [[Tatum O'Neal]] as protagonists Moze and Addie.\n\nTatum O'Neal received widespread praise from critics for her performance as Addie, earning her the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], making her the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees|youngest competitive winner]] in the history of the [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Gorham, Kansas]], circa 1936, itinerant [[Confidence tricks|con man]] Moses Pray meets nine-year-old Addie Loggins at her mother's graveside service, where the neighbors suspect he is Addie's father. He denies this, but agrees to deliver the orphaned Addie to her aunt's home in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]].\n\nAt a local grain mill, Moses convinces the brother of the man who accidentally killed Addie's mother to give him $200 for the newly orphaned Addie. Addie overhears this conversation and, after Moses spends nearly half the money fixing his old [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A]] convertible and buying her a train ticket, she demands the money as rightfully hers, whereupon Moses agrees to let Addie travel with him until he has raised back the full $200 to give to her. Thereafter Moses visits recently widowed women, pretending to have previously sold expensive, personalized Bibles to their deceased husbands, and the widows pay him for the Bibles inscribed with their names. Addie joins the scam, pretending she is his daughter, and exhibits a talent for confidence tricks, such as selling Bibles and the [[List of confidence tricks#Change raising|quick change scam]]. As time passes, Moses and Addie become a formidable team.\n\nOne night, Addie and \"Moze\" (as Addie addresses him) stop at a local carnival, where Moze becomes enthralled with an \"exotic dancer\" named Miss Trixie Delight and leaves Addie at a photo booth to have her photograph taken alone (of herself sitting on a crescent moon, to suggest the film's title). Much to Addie's chagrin, Moze invites \"Miss Trixie\"&mdash;and her downtrodden African American teenage maid, Imogene&mdash;to join Addie and him. Addie soon becomes friends with Imogene and becomes jealous of Trixie. When Addie subsequently discovers that Moze has spent their money on a brand-new [[Ford Model 48|Model 68]] convertible to impress Miss Trixie, she and Imogene devise a plan. They convince a clerk at the hotel where the group is staying to visit Trixie. Addie then sends Moze up to Trixie's room, where he discovers the clerk and Trixie having sex. Moze promptly leaves Miss Trixie and Imogene behind, while Addie leaves Imogene enough money to pay for her own passage home.\n\nWhile staying at another hotel in a rural area, Moze uncovers a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]'s store full of [[whiskey]], steals some of it, and sells it back to the bootlegger. Unfortunately the bootlegger's twin brother is the local sheriff,  and he quickly arrests Addie and Moze. Addie hides their money in her hat, steals back the key to their car, and the pair escape. To elude pursuit, they trade their new car for a decrepit [[Ford Model T|Model T]] farm truck after Moze beats a [[hillbilly]], Leroy, in a [[Catch wrestling|\"rasslin' match\"]].  Moze and Addie make it across the state line to Missouri, where Moze sets up another swindle, only to be caught again by the sheriff and his deputies; outside of their jurisdiction and unable to make an arrest, they beat Moze and rob him of his and Addie's savings. Humiliated and defeated, Moze drops Addie at the house of her aunt in St. Joseph, but a disappointed Addie rejoins him on the road. When he refuses her company, she reminds him that he still owes her $200 and points out that his truck has just rolled away without him. They catch the truck and leave together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Moses \"Moze\" Pray\n* [[Tatum O'Neal]] as Addie Loggins\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Trixie Delight\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Deputy Hardin/Jess Hardin\n* [[Burton Gilliam]] as Floyd\n* P.J.

(1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' and was looking for another project when his ex-wife and frequent collaborator [[Polly Platt]] recommended filming Joe David Brown's script for the novel ''Addie Pray.'' Bogdanovich, a fan of period films, and having two young daughters of his own, found himself drawn to the story, and selected it as his next film.<ref name=paper/>\n\n===Casting===\nAt the suggestion of Polly Platt, Bogdanovich approached eight-year-old [[Tatum O'Neal]] to audition for the role although she had no acting experience. Bogdanovich had worked with Tatum's father [[Ryan O'Neal]] on ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', and decided to cast them  as the leads.<ref name=paper/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nVarious changes were made in adapting the book to film. Addie's age was reduced from twelve to nine to accommodate young Tatum, several events from the book were combined for pacing issues, and the last third of the novel, when Moses and Addie graduate to the big leagues as con artists after going into partnership with a fake millionaire, was dropped. The location was also changed from the rural south of the novel\u2013primarily [[Alabama]]\u2014to midwestern [[Kansas]] and [[Missouri]].<ref name=paper/>\n\n===Filming locations===\nThe film was shot in the small towns of [[Hays, Kansas]]; [[McCracken, Kansas]]; [[Wilson, Kansas]]; and [[St. Joseph, Missouri]].  Various shooting locations include the Midland Hotel at [[Wilson, Kansas]]; the railway depot at [[Gorham, Kansas]]; storefronts and buildings on Main Street in [[White Cloud, Kansas]]; [[Hays, Kansas]]; sites on both sides of the [[Missouri River]]; [[Rulo Bridge]]; and St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\n===Props===\nThe car Moses is driving when he agrees to take Addie home is a 1930 Ford Model A convertible; the car Moses buys to impress Miss Trixie is a [[Ford Model 48|1936 Ford]] V8 De Luxe convertible.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.imcdb.org/movie_70510-Paper-Moon.html| title=Paper Moon, 1973| website=[[Internet Movie Cars Database]]| access-date=November 19, 2019| archive-date=January 16, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116040418/http://imcdb.org/movie_70510-Paper-Moon.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The whiskey being sold by the bootlegger shown toward the end of the film is Three Feathers blended whiskey, a label introduced by Oldtyme Distilling Corp. in 1882 and still produced up to the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935789,00.html| title=LIQUOR: The Schenley Reserves| date=September 29, 1952| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| access-date=November 19, 2019| language=en-US| issn=0040-781X}}</ref>  The bottle of [[soda pop]] Addie drinks is from Nehi Soda, by a company founded as Chero-Cola in 1910, in 1925 renamed [[Nehi|Nehi Corporation]], which became [[RC Cola|Royal Crown Company]] and later Dr Pepper/Seven Up, then Dr Pepper Snapple Group.\n\n===Title===\nPeter Bogdanovich also decided to change the name of the film from ''Addie Pray''. While selecting music for the film, he  heard the song \"[[It's Only a Paper Moon]]\" by [[Billy Rose]], [[Yip Harburg]], and [[Harold Arlen]]. Seeking advice from his close friend and mentor [[Orson Welles]], Bogdanovich listed ''Paper Moon'' as a possible alternative. Welles responded: \"That title is so good, you shouldn't even make the picture, you should just release the title!\"<ref name=paper /> Bogdanovich added the scene in which Addie has her picture taken in a paper moon solely so the studio would allow him to use the title.<ref>[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_632_-_peter_bogdanovich ''WTF Podcast'' Episode 632], August 27, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Cinematography and editing===\nDirector of photography [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (cinematographer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs]] used a red filter on the camera on Orson Welles's advice.
