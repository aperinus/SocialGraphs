S. Anderson]], and starring [[Sanaa Lathan]], [[Raoul Bova]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Ewen Bremner]], [[Colin Salmon]], and [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]. It is the first film installment of the [[Alien vs. Predator|''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise]], adapting a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] bringing together the [[eponym]]ous creatures of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' series, a concept which originated in a [[Aliens vs. Predator (comics)|1989 comic book]] written by [[Randy Stradley]] and [[Chris Warner (comics)|Chris Warner]]. Anderson wrote the story, with the creators of the ''Alien'' franchise, [[Dan O'Bannon]] and [[Ronald Shusett]] receiving additional story credit due to the incorporation of elements from the ''Alien'' series, and Anderson and [[Shane Salerno]] adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by [[Aztec mythology]], the comic book series, and the writings of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. In the film, scientists are caught in the crossfire of an ancient battle between Aliens and Predators as they attempt to escape a bygone pyramid.\n\n''Alien vs. Predator'' was theatrically released on 12 August 2004. It received generally negative reviews and grossed $177.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60\u201370 million. A direct sequel, ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'', was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 2004, a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship arrives on Earth and uses a heating device to melt a hole in Antarctic ice. Meanwhile, a satellite detects the heat bloom beneath [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet\u00f8ya]], an island about {{convert|1000|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of [[Antarctica]]. Wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland discovers through [[thermal imaging]] that there is a pyramid buried {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on}} beneath the ice. He assembles a team of experts to investigate, including archaeologists, linguists, mercenaries, and a mountaineering guide named Lex Woods. Terminally ill, Weyland desires to claim the discovery in his name.\n\nWhen the team arrives at the abandoned [[Whaling|whaling station]], they find a newly made tunnel running directly beneath the ice toward the pyramid. The team descends the tunnel and begins to explore the pyramid, soon finding evidence of an ancient civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons that all have ruptured rib cages.\n\nMeanwhile, three Predators \u2060\u2014 Scar, Celtic, and Chopper \u2060\u2014 arrive and kill the remaining team members on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and is trapped within it. The [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]] Queen awakens from [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several [[facehuggers]] attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Xenomorphs. The humans take possession of the Predator's blasters, and conflict erupts between the Predators, Xenomorphs, and humans. Celtic and Chopper are killed by a Xenomorph, and Weyland buys Lex and Sebastian De Rosa enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and a Xenomorph before unmasking and marking himself with the acidic blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attacks Scar.\n\nThrough translation of the pyramid's [[hieroglyph]]s, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. They taught the early human civilization how to build pyramids and were worshipped as gods. Every 100 years, they visit Earth to take part in a [[rite of passage]] by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Xenomorphs, creating the \"ultimate prey\" for the Predators to hunt. As a fail-safe, if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a [[self-destruct]] device to eliminate the Xenomorphs. They deduce that the Predators lured them into the pyramid to use as a sacrifice.\n\nLex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed so that the Xenomorphs do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by a Xenomorph, and Lex returns the blaster to Scar. They are attacked by a Xenomorph, and Lex manages to kill it. Impressed, Scar uses parts of a dead Xenomorph to fashion weapons for Lex, and the two form an alliance. Lex finds Sebastian, who has become the host of a Xenomorph. She [[mercy kill]]s him, but the Xenomorph Queen is freed from her restraints and, along with the other Xenomorphs, begins pursuing Lex and Scar. Scar detaches and uses a bomb in his wrist module to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Xenomorphs and eggs. Lex and Scar reach the surface, and Scar uses acidic Xenomorph blood to mark Lex with the Xenomorph hunter symbol. However, the Xenomorph Queen reappears and attacks. They defeat the Queen by pushing her over a cliff, pulling her to the ocean floor. Scar is fatally wounded.\n\nA Predator spaceship appears, and its crew retrieves its fallen comrade. An elder Predator presents Lex with a spear as a gift as the spaceship departs. Lex walks over to a [[snowcat]] and leaves the area. On the Predator spaceship, Scar's body lies at rest when a [[Predalien]] chestburster erupts from his chest.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Alien vs. Predator characters}}\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Alexa \"Lex\" Woods, an experienced guide who spent several seasons exploring Arctic and Antarctic environments.

Henriksen plays billionaire and self-taught-engineer Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the ''Alien'' films after him; \"when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created with the face of the creator.

[[Production designer]] Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and [[hieroglyphs]] were influenced by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Cambodia]]n, and [[Aztec]] civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of [[claustrophobia]] similar to the original ''Alien'' film.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' A New World Vision|work=[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]|url=http://www.spike.com/video/2644628/collection/232/event/22474 |access-date=13 June 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080128202159/http://www.spike.com/video/2644628/collection/232/event/22474 |archive-date = 28 January 2008}}</ref> According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.<ref name=\"AVP Commentary\"/>\n\nThird scale [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of [[artificial snow]] were used (roughly 15\u201320 tons).<ref name=\"AVP special features\"/> A 4.5-meter miniature of an [[icebreaker]] with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: \"With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real.

The puppet required six people to operate it.|alt=]]\nSpecial effects company [[Amalgamated Dynamics]] Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the film, having previously worked on ''Alien 3'' and ''Alien Resurrection''. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and [[John Bruno (special effects artist)|John Bruno]] were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots.<ref name=\"Local shoots shrinking\"/> ADI founders Alec Gillis, [[Tom Woodruff Jr.]] and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the ''Predator'' films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.<ref name=\"AVP special features\"/>\n\nThe basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create [[fiberglass]] copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims \"is what the Predator is all about\".<ref name=\"AVP special features\"/> A [[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic]] Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a \"slimline and skeletal\" appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.<ref name=\"AVP special features\"/>\n\nThe crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are \"there in the frame\".<ref name=\"AVP special features\"/> Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate,<ref name=\"AVP Commentary\"/> and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry.<ref name=\"Alien vs. Predator PN\"/><ref>{{cite video|title=Alien vs. Predator|first1=Alec | last1=Gillis | first2=Tom | last2=Woodruff | first3=John | last3=Bruno|date=2004|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised ''Alien'' director [[Ridley Scott]]'s and ''Predator'' director [[John McTiernan]]'s abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with ''Alien vs. Predator''. \"Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there until the end of the movie, it's fucking relentless\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salisbury|first=Mark|title=The ''AVP'' referee|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=#235|page=44}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Alien vs. Predator (soundtrack)}}\nAustrian composer [[Harald Kloser]] was hired to create the [[Film score|film's score]].
