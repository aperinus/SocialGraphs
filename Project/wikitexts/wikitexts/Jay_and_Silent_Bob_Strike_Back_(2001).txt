It focuses on the [[Jay and Silent Bob|two eponymous characters]], played respectively by [[Jason Mewes]] and Smith. The film features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Joey Lauren Adams]] and [[Shannen Doherty]] among many others.

The pair visit Holden McNeil (''[[Chasing Amy]]''), co-writer of ''Bluntman and Chronic'', and demand royalties from the film, but Holden explains he sold his share of the rights to co-creator Banky Edwards.

The organization is a front; Brent is a [[Scapegoat|patsy]], who will free animals from a laboratory as a diversion while the girls rob a diamond depository. Jay throws Brent out of the van to get closer to Justice, to whom he is attracted. Justice is fond of the pair, but reluctantly accepts them as new patsies.\n\nWhile the girls steal the diamonds, Jay and Silent Bob free the animals, stealing an [[orangutan]] named Suzanne. They escape as the police arrive and the van explodes, believing the girls have perished.\n\nFederal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (whose name is taken from [[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|''Land of the Lost'' characters]] {{ref|b}}) arrives; oblivious to the diamond heist, he claims jurisdiction due to the escaped animals, all of which have been recovered but the orangutan. The officers find footage of a video Sissy recorded of Jay claiming to be \"the [[Clitoris|clit]] commander\", with accompanying literature that \"Clit\" is an acronym for ''Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers''. Willenholly declares the crime an act of [[terrorism]] and calls for backup to hunt \"the two most dangerous men on the planet.\"\n\nHiding inside a diner, the pair dress Suzanne as their child. Willenholly, facing the political repercussions of \"arresting a [[gay]] couple\", lets them leave but quickly resumes pursuit. The fugitives jump into a sewer system, and Willenholly is tricked into jumping off a dam.\n\nSuzanne is abducted by a Hollywood animal acting agency, and Jay and Silent Bob arrive in Hollywood and find themselves in the background of an ''[[E! News]]'' newscast about their online threat against Miramax. Watching the news, Justice takes the diamonds to Hollywood to fix things, with Willenholly close behind.\n\nChased by studio security guard Gordon and reclaiming Suzanne from the set of [[Scream (film series)|''Scream 4'']], Jay and Silent Bob end up in the dressing room of [[Jason Biggs]] and [[James Van Der Beek]], the actors playing Bluntman and Chronic. Suzanne beats up the actors, and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles. Meeting the film's [[Racism|racist]] director Chaka Luther King, who mistakes them for stunt doubles, Jay and Silent Bob are forced to fight [[Mark Hamill]], playing the supervillain Cocknocker (a combination of Hamill's roles as [[The Joker]], [[The Trickster]], and [[Luke Skywalker]]) in a [[Star Wars]]-esque battle. Willenholly arrives to capture the pair, but Justice protects them, admitting the CLIT organization was only a diversion. The other thieves arrive and a climactic final battle ensues. Jay and Silent Bob get their royalties from Banky after Silent Bob informs him he violated their original likeness rights contract by not getting their permission before selling the film rights to Miramax, and could face serious legal troubles, and Justice turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and freeing Jay and Silent Bob.\n\nJay and Silent Bob spend their royalty money locating everyone who expressed negative opinions on the internet about the movie and their characters, including children and clergy, and travel to assault them. The scene cuts to the audience leaving the theater, having just watched the Bluntman and Chronic movie, to poor reception. Jay and Silent Bob, with Justice and Willenholly, go across the street to enjoy the after party, featuring a performance from [[Morris Day]] and [[The Time (band)|The Time]].\n\nAfter the credits, God closes the [[View Askewniverse]] book.{{ref|a}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jason Mewes]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Jay]]/Chronic\n* [[Kevin Smith]] as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]]/Bluntman\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as himself/Holden McNeil/[[Good Will Hunting|Chuckie Sullivan]]\n* [[Jeff Anderson]] as Randal Graves\n* [[Brian O'Halloran]] as Dante Hicks\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Justice\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Sissy\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Chrissy\n* [[Jennifer Schwalbach]] as Missy\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Brodie Bruce/Banky Edwards\n* [[Matt Damon]] as himself/[[Good Will Hunting|Will Hunting]]\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as Sheriff\n* [[George Carlin]] as Hitchhiker\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Nun\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Brent\n* [[Jon Stewart]] as Reg Hartner\n* [[Jules Asner]] as herself\n* [[Steve Kmetko]] as himself\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Pumpkin Escobar\n* [[Gus Van Sant]] as himself\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Chaka Luther King\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Chaka's production assistant\n* [[Wes Craven]] as himself\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as herself\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as Cocknocker/voice of [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Marc Blucas]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] lookalike\n* [[Matthew James (actor)|Matthew James]] as [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] lookalike\n* Jane Silvia as [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] lookalike\n* [[Carmen Llywelyn]] as [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] lookalike\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Gordon, the Miramax security guard\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as himself\n* [[James Van Der Beek]] as himself\n* [[Morris Day]] as himself\n* [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]] as Steve-Dave\n* [[Walter Flanagan]] as Walter\n* [[Renee Humphrey]] as Tricia Jones\n* [[Joey Lauren Adams]] as Alyssa Jones\n* [[Dwight Ewell]] as Hooper LaMont/Hooper X\n* [[Scott William Winters]] as himself/Clark\n* [[William B.

Filming began on January 14, 2001, and ended on April 19, 2001. Filming took in place in New Jersey, and mostly in California.\n\nOn his podcast ''[[Jay & Silent Bob Get Old]]'', [[Kevin Smith]] explained at length about how much of a \"headache\" the film was to make, mostly owing to [[Jason Mewes]]'s drug and alcohol abuse turning him into a \"ticking time bomb\", which threatened to shut the project down at any moment. During pre-production, Mewes would have constant mood swings due to heroin withdrawal, to the point that Smith actually threw him out of his car on their way to the set one day. Mewes would compensate for his lack of drugs by drinking heavily after every day of shooting and nearly got into a fist fight with [[Scott Mosier]] when he had to come back one night for a re-shoot while drunk. When the shoot wrapped, Smith told Mewes point-blank to get sober or he would never speak to him again.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' grossed $30.1 million in the United States and Canada and $3.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $33.8 million, against a production budget of $22 million.<ref name=mojo/>\n\nThe film grossed $11 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind two other comedy sequels, ''[[American Pie 2]]'' ($12.5 million) and ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'' ($11.6 million).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2001&wknd=34&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office: August 24-26, 2001 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'' received mixed reviews from critics.
