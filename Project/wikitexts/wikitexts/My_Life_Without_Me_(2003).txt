Her life changes dramatically when, during a medical checkup following a collapse, she is diagnosed with metastatic [[ovarian cancer]] and told that she has only two months to live.\n\nDeciding not to tell anyone of her condition and using the cover of [[anemia]], Ann makes a list of things to do before she dies.<ref name=sony1>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316153420/http://sonyclassics.com/mylifewithoutme|archive-date=2016-03-16|url=http://sonyclassics.com/mylifewithoutme|title=My Life Without Me|website=sonyclassics.com|url-status=dead|access-date=2016-08-14}}</ref> She decides to change her hair, record birthday messages for the girls for every year until they're 18, and tries to set up her husband with another woman.\n\nFeeling a longing to experience a life that was never available to her, she seeks out a man to experience how it feels to be in a sexual relationship with someone other than her husband. Her experiment ends up taking an emotional toll when she meets with a man named Lee, who ends up madly in love with her and is left heartbroken when Ann breaks it off with him. He meets with her one last time and says that he will do anything to make her happy, taking care of her daughters and even finding her husband a new job. She ends their relationship and never tells him that she is dying.\n\nAt the end of the film, Ann records a message to her husband, telling him that she loves him, and another one to Lee, telling him the same. She then leaves all tapes that she has recorded with her doctor, asking him to deliver them after her death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Ann\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Don, Ann's Husband\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Lee, The Man With Whom Ann Has An Affair.\n* [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] as Ann's Mother\n* [[Jessica Amlee]] as Penny, Ann's Daughter\n* Kenya Jo Kennedy as Patsy, Ann's Daughter\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Laurie, Ann's Friend\n* [[Leonor Watling]] as Ann, The Neighbor\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as The Hairdresser\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Dr. Thompson\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Ann's Father\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released on September 26, 2003 and ran for 12 weeks.
