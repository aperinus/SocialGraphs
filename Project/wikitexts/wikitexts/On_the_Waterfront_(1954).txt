It stars [[Marlon Brando]] and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Pat Henning]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The musical score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was inspired by \"Crime on the Waterfront\" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November\u2013December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|51286}}</ref> The film focuses on union violence and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success. It received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and won eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]]; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.\n\nIn 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was one of the first 25 films to be deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/91732574/|title=On the waterfront|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |website=Library of Congress|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTerry Malloy is a former prize fighter coerced by corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly into luring fellow dockworker Joey Doyle onto a rooftop. Joey is pushed off the roof, and Terry is visibly upset because he believed that the union thugs were merely going to talk with Joey about his rumored plan to testify against Friendly to the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]]. The other dockworkers remain silent, in fear for their lives. Terry reconnects with Joey's sister Edie, who shames the local priest Father Barry into calling the dockworkers to a meeting. Barry tries to persuade them to stand together, but Friendly has sent Terry to report on what is said. Terry is mocked by the other dockworkers before the meeting is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape while Timothy \"Kayo\" Dugan is persuaded by Father Barry to testify. Friendly reveals to Terry that Dugan testified behind closed doors, and the next day Dugan is killed by a load of whiskey barrels set loose by Friendly's men.\n\nFather Barry makes an impassioned speech reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them, saying that every murder is a [[Calvary|crucifixion]]. Terry is still unwilling to testify, even after he is [[subpoena]]ed, while the other dockworkers also refuse to testify. Terry's guilt and regret grow along with his feelings for Edie as he sees her relentless pursuit of justice. He confesses his role in Joey's death to Father Barry who persuades him to confess to Edie. Horrified, Edie runs away. A crime commission investigator reminds Terry of his last great fight, which he threw for a bet after Johnny Friendly \"bought a piece\" of him. Friendly's men witness Terry's conversation with the investigator and Friendly tells Charley, Terry's brother, to persuade Terry to keep quiet by offering him a cushy job. Terry resists and Charley pulls a gun, which Terry gently waves away. Terry expresses regret about throwing his best fight, and blames Charley for having set up the fix, ruining his career. Charley gives Terry the gun and tells him to run. Terry goes to Edie's apartment, where she refuses to let him in. He breaks in and insists she loves him and they kiss, before Terry's name is called through the open window. The men down on the street shout that his brother is waiting and Terry runs out to help him, with Edie following.\n\nAfter nearly being run down by a truck, Edie and Terry find Charley's body hung on a hook in the alley. Terry goes to a bar to shoot Friendly but Father Barry distracts him while he is waiting and the other union men run out to warn Friendly. Barry persuades Terry to fight Friendly by testifying in court. Terry gives damning testimony to the commission, and Friendly is cut off from his powerful friends while facing [[indictment]]. Friendly bars Terry from any union jobs. Refusing to leave the city with Edie, Terry appears at the dock for the daily ritual where workers are chosen from the assembled longshoremen. Everyone is called to work except Terry, who taunts Friendly outside the nearby shack, shouting that he is proud of testifying. Friendly goads Terry into attacking and is getting beaten until he calls for help from his thugs, who stop just shy of killing Terry. The longshoremen refuse to work unless Terry is allowed to work as well, and Joey's father pushes Friendly into the river when he tries to bully the men. Father Barry tells a badly injured Terry that he lost the battle but has a chance to win the war if he can walk into the warehouse. Father Barry and Edie get him on his feet and Terry stumbles up the gangway to stand before the warehouse, where the boss nods to Terry and tells them to get to work. The men follow Terry inside, ignoring Friendly as he lashes out with empty threats and his fists. The door closes behind them, leaving Friendly out in the cold.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Terry Malloy\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Father Pete Barry \n* [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Michael J.

One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally titled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie \"pro-American\". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | access-date=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archive-date=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nCobb's character of Johnny Friendly was partly modeled on [[Johnny Dio]], a real-life mobster known for involvement in labor racketeering.<ref>Russell, Thaddeus ''Out of the Jungle: Jimmy Hoffa and the Remaking of the American Working Class.'' Rev. ed. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|1-59213-027-5}}</ref> \n\n===Casting===\nAccording to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had \"a handshake deal\"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a \"more Brando-like\" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade producer [[Sam Spiegel]] that \"an actor like Marlon Brando\" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterward, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had been signed for this role.\n\n===Filming locations===\n''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.<ref name=movielove>{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.<ref>'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)</ref> In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A.

RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's \"Studio Heritage Collection\", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette \"Contender: Mastering the Method\", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]].\n\nThe 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: \"In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer.\"\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe film script was adapted to stage by Schulberg. It opened on Broadway in November 1984. It included technical innovations for the time, including lasers, filmlike scenic dissolves and sounds that enveloped the audience.
