The film stars [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ryan Guzman]], and [[Ian Nelson (actor, born 1995)|Ian Nelson]], with [[John Corbett]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]] playing supporting roles. The film follows a 19-year-old man who, after having a [[one-night stand]] with his high school teacher, develops a dangerous obsession with her.\n\nBarbara Curry, a former criminal lawyer, wrote the screenplay for the film inspired from her life's experiences. [[Blumhouse Productions]]\u00a0financed and produced the film, which was filmed for 23 days in Los Angeles and other locations in [[California]] at the end of 2013.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 23, 2015, by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''The Boy Next Door''\u00a0received generally negative reviews from film critics, who felt that it promised \"campy thrills\" but did not deliver, however the film grossed $53.4 million against a $4 million budget making it a box office success. It was released on\u00a0[[Blu-ray]]\u00a0and DVD on April 28, 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\nClaire Peterson separates from her husband Garrett, after he was caught cheating with his secretary. Her colleague and best friend Vicky Lansing urges Claire to divorce. 19-year-old Noah Sandborn moves in next door to help his uncle, who uses a wheelchair. They learn that Noah is now an orphan following a fatal car accident in his family the previous year. Noah befriends Kevin, Claire's teenage son, and begins attending his school, where Claire teaches Classics. Noah is drawn to Claire by their mutual love for [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. With Kevin and Garrett away on a fishing trip, Noah catches Claire watching him change clothes through her window.\n\nClaire goes on a miserable double date with Vicky, her boyfriend Ethan, and his ill-mannered friend Benny. With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. When Claire is about to leave, Noah stops her and kisses her passionately, and Claire eventually gives in and has passionate sex with Noah. The following morning, Claire wakes up and tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage.\n\nThe school year begins, with Noah joining Claire's class after hacking into her computer, making it appear as if she had requested this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at gym class and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevin's [[Epinephrine autoinjector|EpiPen]]. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about it. After Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett together at home after going on a date, he has flashbacks of him and Claire having sex, as he escalates his obsession with her.\n\nAfter an incident where Noah&nbsp;\u2014 in defense of Kevin&nbsp;\u2014 slams a bully's head into a locker repeatedly, Vicky, who is vice principal at the school, discovers that Noah was kicked out of his previous school for disorderly conduct, and expels him after Noah insults her. Kevin prepares himself for his date with Allie at the fall fling, where Claire goes to investigate a leak in the boys' bathroom, where she sees the words \"I fucked Claire Peterson\" written on the wall before Noah emerges. He attempts to rape her, but she fends him off and demands that he stay away from her and Kevin, but Noah is unwilling to do so, under the delusional belief that Claire is willing to be with him. That same night, however, Noah has sex with Allie as Claire watches from her bedroom window.\n\nThe following day, Noah leaves a printer running in Claire's classroom, with pictures of them sleeping together scattered everywhere. Later, when Garrett's car brakes fail to work, he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident. That evening, Claire finds Noah with Garrett and Kevin in her drawing room. Noah attempts to blackmail Claire, telling her that he has a video of them having sex, which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him. She refuses, and has Vicky lure Noah away from his house so she can break in and delete their sex tape. While there, she finds nude pictures of herself all over the walls and on his laptop; she also finds instructions on how to tamper with the brakes of Garrett's car and Noah's parents' car. With the help of Ethan's detective friend, she learns the truth about the car accident in Noah's family. Noah binds and gags Vicky with duct tape and uses a recording of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky dead.\n\nA horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he clarifies that his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her and he retaliated by cutting the brakes of his father's car, killing him and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, outlining his deluded notion that killing them will help him and Claire to start a new life together, and soon pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. In the ensuing struggle, Claire finally destroys Noah's delusional love for her by stabbing his eye with Kevin's EpiPen. An enraged Noah attempts to kill all three, but Claire eventually pulls a lever that drops an engine on Noah, ultimately killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett out of the burning barn house as police and paramedics arrive.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Claire Peterson\n* [[Ryan Guzman]] as Noah Sandborn\n* [[Ian Nelson (actor, born 1995)|Ian Nelson]] as Kevin Peterson\n* [[John Corbett]] as Garrett Peterson\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Vicky Lansing\n* [[Lexi Atkins]] as Allie Callahan\n* [[Hill Harper]] as Principal Edward Warren\n* [[Travis Schuldt]] as Ethan\n* Brian Mahoney as Cooper\n* [[Adam Hicks]] as Jason Zimmer\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] as Detective Johnny Chou\n* [[Bailey Chase]] as Benny\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception and writing ===\nScreenwriter Barbara Curry, who was a criminal lawyer for ten years, revealed that she created the script's original concept after running past a house which she described as her \"dream house\". A \"bad boy\" her son went to school with resided in the house across the street, which gave her a \"really interesting\" concept about a neighborhood boy creating conflict and \"driving a wedge between a family\". This served as her inspiration for the screenplay.<ref name=\"Cosmopolitan\">{{cite web|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Madina|title=\"The Boy Next Door\" Screenwriter on Her Underage Sex Thriller Starring J.Lo|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/news/a35438/boy-next-door-screenwriter-barbara-curry-interview/|website=Cosmopolitan|publisher=Hearst Communications|access-date=January 21, 2015|date=January 20, 2015|archive-date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121093700/http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/news/a35438/boy-next-door-screenwriter-barbara-curry-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCurry stated that the \"first few drafts of [the movie] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial of trying to get her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became something else\".<ref name=\"Cosmopolitan\" /> In the original script, Claire was \"happily married\", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that she could be a \"more sympathetic character\".<ref name=\"Cosmopolitan\" /> Curry was influenced by the real-life story of [[Mary Kay Letourneau]], a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges.<ref name=\"Cosmopolitan\" /> Director [[Rob Cohen]] revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was \"not healthy\" and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist.
