It stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in a [[dual role]] as the title character and the [[villain]], [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Aramis]], [[John Malkovich]] as [[Athos (character)|Athos]], [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Porthos]], and [[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan|D'Artagnan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-man-in-the-iron-mask-v160668|work=Allmovie|title=The Man in the Iron Mask|access-date=November 10, 2012|author=Olthuis, Andrew}}</ref> Some characters are from [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''[[D'Artagnan Romances]]'' and some plot elements are very loosely adapted from his 1847-1850 novel ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]''.\n\nThe film centers on the aging four musketeers, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. It explores the mystery of the [[Man in the Iron Mask]], with a plot closer to the flamboyant 1929 version starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]], ''[[The Iron Mask (1929 film)|The Iron Mask]]'', and the ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|1939 version]]'' directed by [[James Whale]], than to the original Dumas book. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success, grossing $183 million worldwide against a budget of $35 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Kingdom of France faces bankruptcy from [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]'s wars against the Dutch, causing French citizens to starve. As the country moves toward revolution, King Louis prepares for war. At this point, the four musketeers have gone their separate ways; [[Aramis]] is now a priest, [[Porthos]] is a womanizing drunkard, and [[Athos (character)|Athos]] has retired to his farm. Only [[Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan|D'Artagnan]] has remained loyal to the musketeers and is now the captain.\n\nAthos' only son, Raoul, aspires to join the musketeers. At a palace festival, Louis sets his eyes on Christine Bellefort, Raoul's fianc\u00e9e. He immediately plots to send Raoul to the battlefront, where he is killed soon after. Aware that Louis orchestrated his son's death, Athos renounces his allegiance to the king. After an assassination attempt on Louis by the [[Jesuits|Jesuit order]] is foiled by D'Artagnan, Louis instructs Aramis to hunt down and kill their leader. In response, Aramis summons Porthos, Athos, and D'Artagnan for a secret meeting in which he reveals he is the Jesuit's secret leader and has a plan to depose Louis. Athos and Porthos agree to join him, but D'Artagnan refuses. Athos brands him a traitor and threatens him with death should they ever meet again. Meanwhile, Louis seduces Christine, who later begins to suspect his part in Raoul's death.\n\nThe musketeers infiltrate the [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]] prison and free a prisoner wearing an iron mask. The prisoner is taken to the countryside, where Aramis reveals he is Philippe, King Louis' brother. Their mother, [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]], gave birth to identical twins. [[Louis XIII]], to avoid dynastic warfare between his sons, sent Philippe to live in the countryside and grow up without knowing his true identity. When Louis XIII died, he revealed Philippe's existence to Anne and Louis XIV. Anne wanted to restore Philippe's birthright. Instead, Louis was too superstitious to have his brother killed and, to preserve his power, imprisoned him in the iron mask to conceal his identity, an act that Aramis executed. Aramis wishes to redeem himself and save France by replacing Louis with the more benevolent Philippe. The musketeers tutor Philippe in courtly life and how to behave like Louis. Meanwhile, Athos develops paternal feelings for Philippe.\n\nAt a masquerade ball, the musketeers lure Louis to his quarters and subdue him. They dress Philippe in Louis's clothes and return him to the festivities while taking Louis to a waiting boat in the dungeons. D'Artagnan, however, sees through the ruse after Christine publicly accuses Philippe of Louis's role in Raoul's death. He forcibly escorts Philippe to the dungeons. Musketeer soldiers intervene before Athos, Porthos, and Aramis can escape with Louis. The king is rescued as the three musketeers get away, but Philippe is captured. Though Louis is prepared to kill Philippe, D'Artagnan, upon learning Philippe's true identity, begs that he be spared. Louis instead orders Philippe back to the [[Bastille]] and into the iron mask. Soon after, a grieving Christine commits suicide.\n\nD'Artagnan contacts the musketeers to help rescue Philippe from the Bastille. Louis, suspecting an attempt, ambushes them at the prison. Louis offers D'Artagnan clemency in exchange for surrender. D'Artagnan refuses, privately telling his comrades that he is Louis and Philippe's father from an affair with the Queen, and that was the reason for his loyalty to Louis. As they charge one final time at Louis and his men, they are fired upon; their bravery compels the soldiers to close their eyes before firing, and all miss. Louis attempts to stab Philippe but fatally wounds D'Artagnan. Philippe nearly strangles Louis to death, but D'Artagnan's dying words halt him. D'Artagnan's top lieutenant, Andre, angered by his mentor's death, swears his men to secrecy and sides with Philippe. They switch the twins again, and Philippe orders Louis locked away. He then names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis as his closest advisors.\n\nAt a small graveside service for D'Artagnan, Philippe tells Athos that he has come to love him like a father, which Athos reciprocates. The narrator tells that Philippe later issued Louis a royal pardon and confined him to the countryside to live in seclusion, while he became one of France's greatest kings.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Man in the Iron Mask|Philippe Bourbon]]/[[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as [[Aramis]] and [[Narrator]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Athos (character)|Athos]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Porthos]]\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|D'Artagnan]] \n* [[Anne Parillaud]] as [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne of Austria]]\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Christine Bellefort\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Raoul, son of Athos\n* [[Edward Atterton]] as Lieutenant Andre, D'Artagnan's second in command\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Pierre, Advisor to King Louis XIV\n* [[David Lowe (actor)|David Lowe]] as Advisor to King Louis XIV\n\n==Production==\nIn this version, the \"man in the iron mask\" is introduced as [[Man in the Iron Mask|prisoner number 64389000]] based on the number related to his namesake found at the Bastille.{{citation needed | date=February 2022}} The Ch\u00e2teau de [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] acts as the primary residence of the king as Versailles was still early in its construction and years away from Louis establishing residence there.{{citation needed | date=February 2022}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $17 million on its opening weekend in second place behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', another film starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].
