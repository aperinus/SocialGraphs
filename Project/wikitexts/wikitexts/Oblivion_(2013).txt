A technician is on a mission against remaining scavenger extraterrestrials, but after he rescues a woman from a spaceship crash, he learns that the scavengers are the people who survived the alien threat.

The film grossed $286 million worldwide on a production budget of $120 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n\nJack Harper and Victoria Olsen are among the few people left on Earth in 2077. Sixty years earlier, a race of scavenger aliens destroyed [[the Moon]] and invaded Earth; humans won the war but made Earth uninhabitable. With Olsen as his communications officer, Harper fixes [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]] that hunt the remaining scavengers and guard hydroelectric platforms that convert seawater into [[fusion energy]]. The team reports to Sally, the mission commander aboard the \"[[tetrahedron|Tet]]\", a space station. They will depart for [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] to rejoin the rest of humanity within two weeks. Though Harper and Olsen's memories have been wiped, Harper has frequent dreams and visions of pre-war life in the company of an unknown woman.\n\nHarper narrowly escapes a scavenger trap while searching for a disabled drone in the New York Public Library's ruins. After a hydroelectric platform is destroyed, he discovers that scavengers are radioing coordinates from the Empire State Building's antenna. Harper disables the transmitter and visits his secret lakeside cabin filled with mementos of Earth's past. An unidentified object falls into the transmitted coordinates. Harper investigates the crash site and finds five humans in hibernation chambers, including the woman in his dreams. Harper protects the woman from drones and carries her to his base. He and Olsen revive her and learn she is Julia Rusakova, an astronaut who has been in deep sleep aboard the spaceship Odyssey since before the war in 2017.\n\nHarper and Rusakova return to the crash site and retrieve the Odyssey's [[flight recorder]], but they are captured by scavengers and taken to the [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]]. The leader, Malcolm Beech, reveals that the scavengers are the human survivors and have been hiding from drones. Beech frees Harper and Rusakova to discover the truth in a desert known as the radiation zone. Rusakova reveals that she is Jack's wife; this revelation reminds him of his marriage proposal at the Empire State Building.\n\nOlsen sends an aircraft for Harper and Rusakova but is heartbroken to see them together. She reports the situation to Sally, who sends a drone that kills Olsen before Rusakova can destroy it. Harper and Rusakova flee in the jet and destroy the drones chasing them, but they crash in the desert. A clone of Harper arrives to fix disabled drones. Harper incapacitates him, but Rusakova is shot during their fight. Harper returns to the clone's base for medical supplies, where he encounters a clone of Olsen. He takes Rusakova to his cabin, where she recovers.\n\nThey return Raven Rock, and Beech tells him that the Tet is an alien [[artificial intelligence]]. Determined to extract Earth's natural resources, the Tet destroyed the Moon and invaded Earth with an army of clones and drones. The escape to Titan is fictional. Harper reprograms a captured drone to sabotage the Tet with a nuclear bomb, but other drones attack the base. Beech is injured, and the captured drone is damaged beyond repair. Harper and Rusakova volunteer to deliver a bomb manually. En route, Harper listens to the Odyssey's flight recorder and learns that he is a clone of the NASA mission commander sent to explore Titan. Olsen was his co-pilot, Rusakova was the newest crew member, and Sally was the Earth mission director. After the mission was interrupted by the appearance of the Tet, Harper separated the control cabin to save the others. He and Olsen were captured and cloned, had their memories wiped, and were brainwashed into believing they were a couple.\n\nHarper enters the Tet and finds thousands of clones in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. The Tet's projection of Sally confronts Harper. Harper pretends to offer Rusakova to Sally, but Beech emerges instead. Harper and Beech detonate the bomb, destroying the Tet and themselves. Rusakova wakes up in the cabin in her hibernation pod. Three years later, Rusakova raises a daughter at the lakeside cabin. They meet with surviving resistance members and are joined by a clone of Harper, who has recovered the original Harper's memories.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Jack Harper, Tech 49: A technician who works to repair drones on Earth and questions his mission. Originally, he was the American commander of a mission en route to Titan who was captured by the Tet and cloned to fight humanity. Cruise also plays Jack Harper, Tech 52, a clone who initially remains loyal to the Tet.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Malcolm Beech: An American veteran soldier and leader of a large community of scavengers, the human survivors of the alien Tet's attacks.\n* [[Olga Kurylenko]] as Julia Rusakova Harper: Jack's wife and a Russian crew member on the ''Odyssey'', who was sent back towards Earth by her husband to protect her from the initial contact with the Tet.\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as Victoria \"Vika\" Olsen: Jack's communications partner and housemate. Originally, she was the British co-pilot of Jack's mission to Titan who was captured and cloned to assist in the Tet's war on humanity. Riseborough also plays a clone of Vika who Jack misleads to obtain medical supplies.\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Sergeant Sykes: The main military commander of Beech's community of scavengers who is skeptical of Jack at first.\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as the Tet and Sally: An alien artificial intelligence seeking to acquire Earth's natural resources and wipe out humanity.

[[Daniel Simon]], who previously worked with Kosinski as the lead vehicle designer on ''Tron: Legacy'', was tasked with creating the Bubble Ship from this basis, incorporating elements evocative of an advanced fighter jet with the Bell 47 to create a light, functional vehicle that was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, much as he observed with the ships in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name=\"HeroComplex\"/>\n\n\"When Kubrick made ''2001'', rather than going to the hotshot concept designers of the day, he hired [[NASA]] engineers\", said Simon. \"I believe in [[form follows function]]. I'm not a fan of excessive decoration, of putting fins on something because it looks cool\". Rather than employ digital models, Wild Factory, a Camarillo concept car company, built the Bubble Ship as a {{convert|25|foot|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|4000|-|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, mostly aluminum prop. Elements of the cockpit, such as the placement of the joystick and pedals, were customized for Cruise, who is a qualified pilot, and who had some input into the design. The craft was also made to be easy to disassemble and assemble, to facilitate transport to Iceland shooting locations, where it would be mounted on a [[gimbal]] for shots of it flying. The unmanned aerial drones that were featured prominently in the plot were created to appear to be in the same design family as the Bubble Ship.<ref name=\"HeroComplex\">Keegan, Rebecca. \"'Oblivion' Cruise-Mobile\".
