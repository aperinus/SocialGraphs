The screenplay, written by [[Sara Parriott]] and [[Josann McGibbon]], is about a reporter (Gere) that is assigned to write a story about a woman (Roberts) who has left a string of fianc\u00e9s at the altar.\n\nIt is the second film to co-star Gere and Roberts, following ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990). It received generally negative reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $309 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nMaggie Carpenter is a spirited and attractive young woman who has had a number of unsuccessful relationships. Maggie, nervous about being married, has left a trail of fianc\u00e9s waiting for her at the altar on their wedding day. All of these were caught on tape, earning Maggie [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] fame and the dubious nickname \"The Runaway Bride.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in [[New York City|New York]], columnist Homer Eisenhower \"Ike\" Graham writes an article about her that contains several factual errors, supplied to him by a man he meets in a bar who Ike later learns was one of Maggie's former fianc\u00e9s. Ike is fired for not verifying his source, but is invited to write an in-depth article about Maggie in a bid to restore his reputation. He travels to Hale, [[Maryland]], where he finds Maggie living with her family and on her fourth attempt to become married. The fourth groom-to-be, Bob Kelly, is a local high school football coach who uses sports analogies to help Maggie with her concerns. He constantly makes references to Maggie \"focusing\" on the goal-line in reference to their pending nuptials. As Ike starts going around town to meet her friends, family, and former fianc\u00e9s, Maggie becomes frustrated. Maggie offers Ike the opportunity to spend time with her, to see that she is not a bad person, that she and Bob really will work out. Ike and Maggie become closer the more time they spend together.\n\nAs he researches Maggie's history, Ike realizes that Maggie adopts the interests of her fianc\u00e9s. This is signified most prominently by her choice of eggs, which change with each fianc\u00e9. At a pre-wedding celebration for her and Bob, Ike defends Maggie from the public mockery she starts receiving from her family and guests, and Maggie runs outside due to the embarrassment. Ike then confronts Maggie outside about his realization regarding her relationships.\n\nDuring the wedding rehearsal, Bob tries to quell Maggie's wedding anxieties by walking her down the aisle. Bob asks Ike to stand in for him at the altar, playing the groom. After Bob gets her to the altar, Ike and Maggie share a passionate kiss and admit to each other their feelings. Bob is chagrined, becomes jealous and punches Ike in the face before he storms out of the church. In the aftermath, Ike proposes that he and Maggie get married since the wedding is already arranged. At the wedding, Ike takes Bob's advice and maintains eye contact with Maggie to reassure her as she walks down the aisle. However, a camera flash breaks her concentration and Maggie suddenly gets cold feet and flees. Ike pursues her but she hitches a ride away on a [[FedEx]] truck.\n\nIke returns to New York and Maggie tries to discover herself, trying different types of eggs, and putting her lighting designs up for sale in New York stores. She shows up unexpectedly at Ike's apartment one night where he finds her making friends with his cat, Italics. Maggie then explains that she had been running because every other guy she was engaged to was only engaged to the idea she had created for them rather than the real her, but with Ike she ran because, even though he truly understood her, she did not understand herself. She \"turns in\" her running shoes just before proposing to Ike. Ike hides his eyes, but she persists. The two are married in a private ceremony outside, on a hill, avoiding the big ceremonies that Maggie notes she never actually liked. In the end, they are shown riding away on horseback while everyone in Hale and New York (clued in via [[Mobile phone|cell phone]] by Ike and Maggie's family) celebrates the fact that Maggie finally got married.\n\nA post credit scene shows Maggie and Ike playing in the snow signifying that the relationship is going strong after the wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Margaret \"Maggie\" Carpenter, a woman who has run away from three weddings but is hoping not to do so on her fourth wedding attempt.\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Homer Eisenhower \"Ike\" Graham, a New York City news reporter who writes an article about Maggie and later falls in love with her.\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Peggy Flemming, Maggie's best friend and co-worker at beauty salon.
