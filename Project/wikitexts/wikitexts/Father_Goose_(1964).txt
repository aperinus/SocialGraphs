The title derives from \"[[Mother Goose]],\" the [[code name]] assigned to Grant's character. Based on a story ''A Place of Dragons'' by Sanford Barnett,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-04-16-mn-1299-story.html|title=OBITUARIES : Sanford Barnett, 79; Writer Won Oscar|date=16 April 1988|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=1 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eriktarloff.com/my-fathers-oscar/|title=My Father's Oscar|date=19 June 2016|accessdate=1 July 2021}}</ref> The film won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It introduced the song \"Pass Me By\" by [[Cy Coleman]] and [[Carolyn Leigh]], later recorded by [[Peggy Lee]], [[Frank Sinatra]] and others.\n\nThis was the penultimate film of Cary Grant's long career.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the [[Royal Australian Navy]] evacuates [[Salamaua]] in February 1942<ref>Established by the mention of the [[Battle of Singapore#Fall of Singapore|surrender of Singapore]]</ref> ahead of a [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|Japanese invasion]], [[Commander#Royal Australian Navy|Commander]] Frank Houghton coerces an old friend, American [[beachcombing|beachcomber]] Walter Eckland, into becoming a [[Coastwatchers|coast watcher]] for the Allies. Houghton escorts Eckland to deserted Matalava Island to watch for Japanese airplanes. To ensure Eckland stays put, Houghton sees to it that his own ship \"accidentally\" knocks a hole in Eckland's [[launch (boat)|launch]] while departing, so his only boat is a utility [[dinghy]]. To motivate Eckland, Houghton has his crew hide bottles of whisky around the island, rewarding each aircraft sighting (once it is confirmed) with directions to one of the bottles.\n\nEventually, Houghton offers Eckland a replacement (actually another coast watcher in need of rescue), but Eckland has to retrieve him from nearby Bundy Island by dinghy. He instead finds eight civilians stranded there who escaped from [[Rabaul]]: Frenchwoman Catherine Freneau and seven young schoolgirls (four British, two French and an Australian) under her care. She informs him that the man he came for was killed in an air raid. Eckland reluctantly takes the party back to Matalava with him, but there is no safe way to evacuate them.\n\nThe fastidious Freneau clashes repeatedly with the slovenly, uncouth Eckland; they call each other \"Miss [[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes|Goody Two Shoes]]\" and \"a rude, foul-mouthed, drunken, filthy beast,\" respectively. In the end, though, he adjusts to her and the girls, with Eckland getting one of the traumatised girls to speak again. Freneau learns that Eckland had been a history teacher before he became fed up and chose life in the South Pacific. Afterwards, Eckland cares for Freneau after they mistakenly believe she has been bitten by a deadly snake. With nothing else to do, he gives her whiskey; she gets drunk and speaks freely.\n\nNow in love, the couple arrange to be married by a [[military chaplain]] over the radio, but [[strafing]] by a Japanese airplane interrupts the ceremony.\n\nSince they have been detected, Houghton sends an [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|American submarine]], USS ''Sailfin'', to pick them up, but an enemy patrol boat shows up first. Leaving Freneau and the schoolgirls in his dinghy, Eckland takes his now-repaired launch out to lure the Japanese vessel beyond the surrounding reef so the submarine can torpedo it. The Japanese sink the launch, but the submarine sinks the patrol boat. An uninjured Eckland, his wife, and the girls are picked up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Walter Christopher Eckland\n* [[Leslie Caron]] as Catherine Louise Marie Ernestine Freneau\n* [[Trevor Howard]] as Commander Frank Houghton\n* [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Goode]] as Lieutenant Stebbings\n* [[Peter Forster (actor)|Peter Forster]] as the chaplain\n* [[Simon Scott (actor)|Simon Scott]] as submarine captain\n* [[Ken Swofford]] as submarine helmsman\n\nThe children:\n* Sharyl Locke as Jenny\n* Pip Sparke as Anne\n* Verina Greenlaw as Christine\n* Stephanie Berrington as Elizabeth Anderson\n* Jennifer Berrington as Harriet \"Harry\" MacGregor\n* Laurelle Felsette as Angelique\n* Nicole Felsette as Dominique\n\n==Production==\n''Father Goose'' was filmed on location in [[Jamaica]].\n\nWhen Grant was asked by a Universal Pictures executive to read the short story, he liked it well enough to pass it along to Peter Stone, who told him he wanted to write the screenplay.<ref name=Saga>{{cite news |title=Hollywood 'Father Goose' Saga |author=Murray Schumach |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 17, 1964 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/17/hollywood-father-goose-saga.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008135032/https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/17/archives/hollywood-father-goose-saga-cary-grant-finds-role-of-derelict-is.html|archive-date=October 8, 2018|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Grant then arranged for him to be signed to ''Father Goose''; Stone's contract called for a picture a year for five years.<ref name=Saga/>\n\nDirector Ralph Nelson stated he tried to avoid professional child actors; with one exception, he succeeded.<ref name=Saga/>\n\nThe Japanese patrol vessel at the end of the film was portrayed by a former U.S. Coast Guard wood hull 83-foot WPB patrol boat.\n\n==Reception==\n''Father Goose'' grossed $12,500,000 at the domestic box office,<ref name=\"numbers\"/> earning $6 million in US [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]].<ref>\"Big Rental Pictures of 1965\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 5 January 1966 p 6</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out Film Guide]]'' panned the film, complaining, \"It's a shame that Grant ... should have logged this sentimental claptrap as his penultimate film\" and \"Grant frequently looks as if he really didn't want to be there, wading lost in a sludge of turgid drama and pallid comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66491/father_goose.html |title=Father Goose (1964) |publisher=Time Out Film Guide |access-date=March 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606083253/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/66491/father_goose.html |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref> [[Film4]] agreed, stating \"the story all too slowly descends into sentimental sludge.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1964/father-goose |title=Father Goose |publisher=Film4 |access-date=March 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn its contemporary review, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found more to like: \"Cary Grant comes up with an about-face change of character....
