It is based on the novel by [[Lew McCreary]], and directed by [[Hampton Fancher]], who also wrote the [[screenplay]]. The film centers on a serial killer whom Fancher describes as \"a cross between ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Norman Bates]], [[Herman Melville|Melville]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Billy Budd]] and ''[[Being There]]'''s Chauncey Gardner\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nVann Siegert is a wandering serial killer who poisons his victims; he explains that he feels he is helping them and that they die without pain. After killing a heroin addict named Casper he met at a bar, he makes her death look like an overdose and moves to a new town. The next day, he arrives at the home of Doug and Jane Durwin and rents out the room of their missing daughter. Doug recommends he look for work at the post office, as they are hiring seasonal help for [[Christmas]].\n\nDoug takes Vann to a high school football game, where he meets Gene, a star athlete, and his family. A few days later, Vann offers the boy a ride and murders him, burying his body on a beach. While he is digging the grave, Vann has an imaginary conversation with two detectives, Blair and Graves, who ask taunting questions about his methods. Later, Vann helps the town search for the missing athlete and even attends his [[Funeral|memorial service]]. He reveals that killing Gene broke two of his personal rules: don't kill anyone you know, and don't kill anyone from your town. Vann's ties to the community grow as he is given more responsibility at the post office.\n\nOne of Vann's co-workers, Ferrin, sheepishly pursues him. Doug drives her to the beach, where the pair exchange an awkward hug directly over the spot where Vann buried Gene. On Christmas Day, Vann goes to a diner and chooses another victim. She invites him to her home, where he sees that she is a painter. Something about her work disturbs him and he flees. Vann returns to the diner and slips poison into the water of a man eating alone. An autopsy reveals that the death was the result of a rare poison derived from tree bark fungus found in the Pacific Northwest. The poison is then linked to Casper's death, and to Gene's when his body is found. Vann knows that the police will eventually tie the murders to him. While looking in the mirror, he pulls hairs off his jacket and puts them in an envelope on which he writes 'FERRiN'.\n\nJane is found dead from a blow to the back of the head. The police suspect Doug, but Vann is worried that the increased scrutiny from another murder will lead the police to him. During a date with Ferrin, he tries to initiate sex by assaulting her. She is terrified, and Vann leaves. The next day, the police arrest Doug for Jane's murder. Vann packs his things. Before he leaves town, he puts his postal uniform and the envelope marked \"FERRiN\", containing the sample of his hair, in a mailbox. The film ends as he drives on the highway, saying that he wants to lead a more regular life once he gets to wherever he is going. He is pursued by a cop who had earlier approached him on the beach. After taking a good look with her spotlight, she smiles at him and takes the right fork in the road, while Vann takes the left.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as  Vann Siegert\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as  Detective Blair\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as  Detective Graves\n* Alex Warren as  State Trooper\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as  Jane Durwin\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as  Doug Durwin\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as  Ferrin\n* [[Meg Foster]] as  Irene\n* [[John Vargas]] as Priest\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Gene\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Paul\n* [[Sheryl Crow]] as  Casper\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Bartender (first scene)\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 58% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=The Minus Man |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/minus_man |access-date=October 5, 2022 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The site\u2019s critics consensus states: \"While its subdued thrills and lack of answers may prove frustrating, ''The Minus Man'' delivers a chillingly measured performance from Owen Wilson.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] called the film \"a [[psychological thriller]] of uncommon power maybe because it's so quiet and devious\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=September 24, 1999 |title=The Minus Man |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-minus-man-1999 |access-date=October 5, 2022 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] wrote \"it is above all such an unsettling experience you find yourself still taking it all in well after the lights have gone up\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Thomas (film critic) |date=September 10, 1999 |title=Movie Review : 'Minus Man' Offers an Unsettling Look at an Affable Killer |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-sep-10-ca-8422-story.html |access-date=October 5, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn praising the film, [[Andrew Sarris]] writing for the ''[[New York Observer]]'' said: \"A surging undercurrent of black comedy drives us out to sea without ever breaking to the surface with glib psychological or sociological explanations.

In addition to the tagline \"Don't see it alone. Unless you like talking to yourself\", one trailer for the film showed a couple discussing the film as they leave the theater. Their conversation takes them from place to place all over the city, until the man (played by [[Eddie Ifft]]) marvels at how beautiful the sunrise is. The woman (played by [[Marin Hinkle]]) realizes she is late for work and rushes to her job as a lifeguard, where two people are floating dead in the pool. The ad ends with the tagline \"Careful, you can talk about it for hours\". They partnered with local coffee houses and bars to provide opportunities for these supposed hour-long conversations.\n\nThe main trailer featured the tagline: \"When he's around nothing adds up\" and touted the film as the product of \"the producers of ''[[Sling Blade]]''\" and \"the writer of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[The Mighty Quinn (film)|The Mighty Quinn]]''\".\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0151582|title=The Minus Man}}\n* {{Amg movie|176040|The Minus Man}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|minus_man|The Minus Man}}\n* [http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/m/minusman.htm ''The Minus Man'' page at aboutfilm.com]\n* {{YouTube|0MG6cZvL0NQ|''The Minus Man'' \"Discussion\" Trailer }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060329081124/http://www.newenglandfilm.com/news/archives/99august/mcceary.htm Interview with author Lew McCreary]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minus Man, The}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Artisan Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1999 independent films]]\n[[Category:American road movies]]\n[[Category:1990s road movies]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Marco Beltrami]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:1999 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
