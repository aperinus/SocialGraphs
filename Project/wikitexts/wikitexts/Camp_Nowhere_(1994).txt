He hates going to [[summer camp]] and will do anything to get out of it. Talking to his friends, he realizes that they are all facing the same sentence of going to a boring summer camp. Together, they hatch a plan to create their own summer camp with no parents, no [[School counselor|counselor]]s, and no rules. Word gets out and other kids soon want to join the made-up summer camp. Mud decides to [[blackmail]] former drama teacher Dennis Van Welker into helping; he had bought an [[AMC Gremlin]] and failed to make most of the payments and is being pursued by soon-to-retire collector T.R. Polk, and agrees to help them in return for $1,000 and after they threaten to turn him in if he doesn't help.\n\nWith Dennis' help, the kids trick all the parents into sending them to the camp, and then rent an old campground (that used to be a hippie [[Intentional community|commune]] back in the 1960s and '70s) with a cabin on a lake. Some parents believe it is a computer camp, while others believe it is a [[fat camp]], [[military camp]], or an acting camp. The kids use the money their parents had paid for camp to buy toys and food. After a little while, they get bored and wonder if they should just return home. Mud goes to Dennis for help, and with a [[bribe]], he soon finds ways to keep things interesting and help them continue to have fun.\n\nEventually, the parents want to come visit their kids despite being told that there are no parents' days. Mud makes a plan to trick them and, along with his friends, they keep the camp concealed. In a matter of hours, they fix it up and set up different scenarios representing the different camps (fat camp, computer camp, military camp, etc.) Their plan works and the parents don't suspect a thing. T.R. Polk then meets a [[state trooper]] who was also seeking Dennis, and they find their way into the camp and catch him. The [[police]] are called and Mud finds Dennis running away from the authorities. Mud is confronted by the police and protects Dennis from them, but soon after Dennis turns himself in. Mud confesses and explains that the whole thing was his idea, and uses the rest of the money to settle Dennis' debt with T.R. Polk, who'll retire with a perfect record. The other kids in a show of solidarity also claim responsibility and therefore all the parents refuse to press charges. Dennis gets off the hook and the kids leave for home, having had the greatest summer of their lives. Mostly Mudd is punished by his parents because of this scheme.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] as Morris \"Mud\" Himmel\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Dennis Van Welker\n* [[Andrew Keegan]] as Zack Dell\n* [[Marnette Patterson]] as Trish Prescott\n* [[Melody Kay]] as Gaby Nowicki\n* [[Wendy Makkena]] as Dr. Celeste Dunbar\n* [[Thomas F.
