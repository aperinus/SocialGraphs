Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan''''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] / [[Russian language|Russian]]: '''''\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442''''') (also stylized as '''''BOR\u0414T,''''' or simply '''''Borat''''') is a 2006 [[mockumentary]] [[black comedy film]]  directed by [[Larry Charles]] and starring [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. Baron Cohen plays the leading role of [[Borat Sagdiyev]], a fictional [[Kazakhs]]tani journalist who travels through the [[United States]] to make a documentary which features real-life interactions with Americans. Much of the film features unscripted vignettes of Borat interviewing and interacting with real-life Americans who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of American customs.<ref name=\"Salon\" /> It is the second of four films built around Baron Cohen's characters from ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' (2000\u20132004): the first, ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]'', was released in 2002, and featured a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by Borat; the third, ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'', was released in 2009; and the sequel to ''Borat'', ''[[Borat Subsequent Moviefilm]]'', was released in 2020.\n\n''Borat'' was released on 2 November 2006, in both the United Kingdom and United States, by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film was very well received, both critically and commercially; made for $18 million, it earned $262 million worldwide. Baron Cohen won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], while the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. ''Borat'' was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] and for [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]] in the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|same category]]. Controversy surrounded the film prior to its release, and after the film's release, some participants spoke against, and even sued, its creators. It was denounced by the government of Kazakhstan and was banned in almost all Arab countries.\n\nIn September 2020, a sequel, titled ''[[Borat Subsequent Moviefilm]]'', was officially confirmed to have been secretly filmed, completed, and screened, a few weeks after Baron Cohen was spotted driving a pick-up truck in character as Borat around [[Los Angeles]]. The sequel was released on 23 October 2020, by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAt the behest of the [[Ministry of Communications and Information (Kazakhstan)|Kazakh Ministry of Information]], reporter Borat Sagdiyev leaves [[Kazakhstan]] for the \"[[United States|US and A]]\", the \"Greatest Country in the World\", to make a documentary about American society and culture. He leaves behind his wife, Oksana; his companions are his producer, [[Azamat Bagatov]], and a pet hen.\n\nIn [[New York City]], Borat sees an episode of ''[[Baywatch]]'' on TV and immediately falls in love with [[Pamela Anderson]]'s character, [[C. J. Parker]].  While interviewing and mocking a panel of [[feminist]]s, he learns of the actress' name and her residence in [[California]]. Borat is then informed by telegram that Oksana has been killed by a bear. Delighted, he resolves to travel to California and make Anderson his new wife. Azamat insists that they drive because of his [[fear of flying]] which stems from the [[September 11 attacks]], which he believes was \"[[9/11 conspiracy theories#Israel|the work of the Jews]]\". Borat takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated ice-cream truck for the journey.\n\nDuring the trip, Borat acquires a ''Baywatch'' booklet and continues gathering footage for his documentary. He meets [[gay pride parade]] participants, politicians [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Bob Barr]], and [[African Americans|African-American]] youths. Borat is also interviewed on a local television station and proceeds to disrupt the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] remarks, but then sings a fictional [[Meni\u014b Qazaqstanym|Kazakhstani national anthem]] to the tune of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", receiving a strong negative reaction.\n\nIn Atlanta, Borat finds a hotel but is kicked out when he offends the front desk worker. Staying at a [[bed-and-breakfast]], Borat and Azamat are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. The two escape after throwing money at two [[Woodlouse|woodlice]], believing they are their hosts transformed. Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself, but is turned away because he is not an American citizen, so he buys a bear instead.\n\nAn etiquette coach suggests Borat attend a private dinner at an eating club in the [[Southern United States|South]]. During the dinner, he offends the other guests when he lets Luenell, an African-American prostitute, into the house and as a result, they are both kicked out. Borat befriends Luenell, who invites him into a relationship with her, but he tells her that he is in love with someone else.  Borat then visits an antique shop, in which he clumsily breaks various [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] heritage items.\n\nAt a hotel, Borat sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for traveling to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a nude brawl which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and then into a packed convention ballroom.\n\nAzamat abandons Borat, taking his passport, all of their money, and the bear. Borat's truck runs out of fuel, and he begins to hitchhike to California.  He is soon picked up by drunken [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] brothers from the [[University of South Carolina]]. On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the ''Pam and Tommy'' [[sex tape]] which reveals that she is not a virgin. Despondent, Borat burns the ''Baywatch'' booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan.\n\nBorat attends a [[United Pentecostal Church|United Pentecostal]] camp meeting, at which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Chip Pickering]] and [[Supreme Court of Mississippi|Mississippi Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[James W. Smith, Jr.]] are present. He undergoes a [[religious conversion]] and forgives Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to Los Angeles and soon finds Azamat dressed as [[Oliver Hardy]]. The two reconcile and Azamat tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson. Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]]. After showing Anderson his \"traditional marriage sack\", Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to abduct her, until security guards intervene.\n\nBorat visits Luenell and they return to Kazakhstan together. They bring several American customs and traditions back to his village, including the apparent conversion of the people to Christianity (the Kazakh version of which includes [[crucifixion]] and torturing of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as [[iPod]]s, laptop computers and a high-definition television.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Borat in Cologne.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sacha Baron Cohen]] in character as Borat, at the [[Cologne]] premiere of the film]]\n* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Borat Sagdiyev]] ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] / [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0421\u0430\u0433\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432), a fictional [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] journalist, distinguished by exaggeratedly strong [[antisemitism]], [[sexism]], and [[antiziganism]], which is depicted as apparently the norm in his homeland. Borat was originally created as a character for ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' and appeared in every episode of the show, along with a cameo in the [[Ali G Indahouse|film spin-off]].\n* [[Ken Davitian]] as [[Azamat Bagatov]] ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] / [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0410\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0411\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432), the producer of Borat's documentary. Azamat was a new character created for the film.\n* [[Luenell]] as Luenell the prostitute; first seen when Borat calls her to come to the Southern dinner. She later returns with Borat to Kazakhstan and the two wed.\n* [[Pamela Anderson]] as herself; she plays a central role in the film as the reason for the journalist's cross country journey. She also appears in person at the end of the film, in a botched abduction attempt by Borat for cultural \"marriage\".<ref name=\"postpam\" />\n* When Borat seeks advice from an etiquette coach, he goes on to show nude photos of Huey Lewis Sagdiyev, his allegedly teenaged son.<ref name=\"mRErY\" /> These photos actually show [[gay]] [[porn star]] [[Stonie]],<ref name=\"kMgtE\" /><ref name=\"uiKp0\" /><ref name=\"9xQ9Q\" /><ref name=\"eo4pA\" /> who was chosen because producers were seeking \"someone who would look 13 or 14 but was actually of legal age and would do frontal nudity\".<ref name=\"3zlXn\" />\n* Politicians [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Bob Barr]] appear in the film as two of Borat's interviewees.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Lane, Anthony|date=November 6, 2006|title=In Your Face|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/11/06/in-your-face-4|access-date=August 10, 2018|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|archive-date=26 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201226212300/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/11/06/in-your-face-4|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Pam Anderson 2009.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|Actress and model [[Pamela Anderson]] was one of the few actors in the film and was privy to its in-jokes.]]\nExcept for Borat, Azamat, Luenell, and Pamela Anderson, none of the characters are portrayed by actors.<ref name=\"Salon\" /><ref name=\"postpam\" /><ref name=\"UJJTr\" /> Most scenes in the film were unscripted.<ref name=\"Salon\" /> In most cases, the film's participants were given no warning on what they would be taking part in except for being asked to sign release forms agreeing not to take legal action against the film's producers.<ref name=\"canttouchme\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] was already underway in January 2005, when Baron Cohen caused a near riot in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"Rodeo\" /> An interview with Baron Cohen by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' indicated that more than 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film.<ref name=\"162cB\" />\n\n===Location===\nThe Kazakhstan depicted in the film has little or no relationship with the actual country, and the producers explicitly deny attempting to \"convey the actual beliefs, practices or behaviour of anyone associated with Kazakhstan\" in the [[all persons fictitious disclaimer|\"all persons fictitious\" disclaimer]]. The scenes showing Borat's home village were filmed in the [[Romania]]n village of [[Glod, D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a|Glod]], which is primarily Roma.<ref name=\"killborat\" /> The name of Borat's neighbour, Nursultan Tulyakbay, is a cross between the names of Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] and opposition politician [[Zharmakhan Tuyakbay]].\n\n===Language===\nNo [[Kazakh language]] is heard in the film. Borat's neighbours in Kazakhstan were portrayed by [[Romani people]], who were unaware of the film's subject until after it premiered. [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] (Borat) commonly speaks [[Hebrew]] (due to his mother being Israeli and being fluent in the language) throughout the film, mixing with phrases of Polish. Romanian was spoken at the beginning of the film in the Romani town. The [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic alphabet]] used in the film is the [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] form, not the [[Kazakh alphabet|Kazakh one]], although most of the words written in it (especially the geographical names) are either misspelled or make no sense at all. The English words are typed on an English keyboard with a Russian language setting. The lettering on the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] in the beginning of the film is merely the result of Roman characters on a reversed image, while promotional materials spell \"BOR\u0414T\" with a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[De (Cyrillic)|letter for D]] substituted for the \"A\" in [[Faux Cyrillic]] style typically used to give a \"Russian\" appearance. While Baron Cohen speaks Hebrew in the film, [[Ken Davitian]] (Azamat) speaks [[Armenian language|Armenian]].<ref name=\"theygetit\" />\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe [[DVD]] included several [[deleted scene]]s from the film, including Borat being questioned by police at a traffic stop, visiting an animal shelter to adopt a dog that could protect him from Jews, getting a massage at a hotel, and visiting an American doctor. There is also a montage of scenes cut from the film, including Borat taking a job at [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] and taking part in an [[American Civil War]] [[American Civil War reenactment|reenactment]]. The deleted scenes menu also includes an intentionally tedious supermarket sequence with an unusually patient supermarket owner (Borat repeatedly asks about each product in the cheese section of the store and the owner responds the same way: \"That's cheese\"), an actual local TV news report about Borat's rodeo singing, and a final \"happy ending\" scene about Borat appearing in a Kazakh show entitled \"''Sexydrownwatch''\", a ''[[Baywatch]]'' clone that also starred Azamat, Luenell and [[Alexandra Paul]]. A scene in which Borat \"started pretending he was being arrested\" was also filmed, but was removed under the threat of legal action by prison officials when they learned that the \"documentary\" was a satire.<ref name=\"tWEh1\" /> In an interview, one of the film's writers, [[Dan Mazer]], confirmed that there was a scene filmed but cut in which Borat observed the shooting of actual pornography with actress Brooke Banner. Mazer stated that the scene was deleted so as not to compete with the naked hotel fight, but hinted it might be included in future DVD releases.<ref name=\"Mazer\" /> In a 2016 interview on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', Cohen elaborated on the deleted scene in which he was featured in the pornographic film.<ref name=\"dUEIi\" />\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Borat ComicCon 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con, promoting the film]]\n\n===Previews===\n''Borat'' was previewed at the 2006 [[Comic-Con International]] in [[San Diego, California]], on 21 July 2006.<ref name=\"Comiccon\" /> Its first screening to a paying audience was during the 2006 [[Traverse City Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Traverse\" /> where it won the Excellence in Filmmaking Award.<ref name=\"Traverseresults\" />\n\nThe film's official debut was in [[Toronto]] on 7 September 2006, at the [[Ryerson University]] Theatre during the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Baron Cohen arrived in character as Borat in a cart pulled by women dressed as peasants. Twenty minutes into the showing, however, the projector broke. Baron Cohen performed an impromptu act to keep the audience amused, but ultimately all attempts to fix the equipment failed.<ref name=\"b2OTI\" /><ref name=\"Scotsman\" /> The film was successfully screened the following night, with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in attendance.<ref name=\"USTODAYToronto\" />\n\nIn [[Israel]], a proposed poster depicting Borat in a [[sling bikini]] was rejected by the film's advertising firm in favour of one showing him in his usual suit.<ref name=\"56es2\" /> The film helped popularize the term \"[[Sling swimsuit|mankini]]\".\n\n===Scaled-back U.S. release===\nThe film opened at No. 1 in the box office, maintaining first place for two weeks straight. The film earned more in the second week ($28,269,900) than in the first ($26,455,463), due to an expansion onto 2,566 screens.<ref name=\"vps0j\" />\n\n===Theatrical release===\n''Borat'' had its public release on 1 November 2006 in Belgium. By 3 November 2006, it had opened in the United States and Canada, as well as in 14 European countries. Upon its release, it was a massive hit, taking in US$26.4 million in its opening weekend, the highest ever in the United States and Canada for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas<ref name=\"numberone\" /> until ''[[Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'' in 2008.<ref name=\"hannah\" /> However, its opening day (approximately $9.2 million)<ref name=\"boratday\" /> was larger than that of the ''Hannah Montana'' concert (approximately $8.6 million),<ref name=\"hannahday\" /> leaving ''Borat'' with the record of the highest opening day gross for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas. On its second weekend, ''Borat'' surpassed its opening with a total of US$29 million.<ref name=\"secondweek\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Borat'' received widespread critical acclaim. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 91% based on reviews from 222 critics, with an average rating of 8.02/10. The website's consensus for the film reads, \"Part satire, part shockumentary, ''Borat'' gets high-fives almost all-around for being offensive in the funniest possible way. Jagshemash!\"<ref name=\"wOYoJ\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 89 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref name=\"GV7il\" /> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.<ref name=\"3aNI5\" />\n\n[[Ty Burr]] spoke positively about the film in his review for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', calling it \"silliness at its most trenchant\" and declaring it the funniest film of the year.<ref name=\"Fg4A7\" /> [[Michael Medved]] gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \"simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that you'll want to describe to your friends and then laugh all over again when you do.\"<ref name=\"wmSsj\" /> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: \"You won't know what outrageous fun is until you see Borat. High-five!\"<ref name=\"Travers\" /> In an article about the changing face of comedy, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said that it \"may be the funniest film in a decade\".<ref name=\"T0UUs\" />\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' included the film in its list of ten 'Best Films of the Noughties' (2000\u201309).<ref name=\"Best films of the noughties\" />\n\nOne negative review came from American critic [[Joe Queenan (author)|Joe Queenan]], who went as far as to call Baron Cohen an \"odious twit\".<ref name=\"Twit\" /> In an article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] offered a counter-argument to suggestions of anti-Americanism in the film. Hitchens suggested instead that the film demonstrated amazing tolerance by the film's unknowing subjects, especially citing the reactions of the guests in the Southern dinner scene to Borat's behaviour.<ref name=\"qubAx\" />\n\nBy posting scenes from the film on [[YouTube]], ''Borat'' was also exposed by viral communication. This triggered discussions on different national identities (Kazakh, American, Polish, Romanian, Jewish, British) that Baron Cohen had used in creating the Borat character.<ref name=\"d6u2I\" />\n\n===Box office===\nAmerican audiences embraced the film, which played to sold-out crowds at many showings on its opening, despite having been shown on only 837 screens. ''Borat'' debuted at No. 1 on its opening weekend, with a total gross of $26.4 million,<ref name=\"numberone\" /> beating its competitors ''[[Flushed Away]]'' and ''[[The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause]]''. The cinema average for the film's opening weekend was an estimated $31,511, topping ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'', yet behind ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref name=\"baTm3\" /> It retained the top spot in its second weekend after expanding to 2,566 theatres, extending the box office total to $67.8 million.<ref name=\"secondweek\" />\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ''Borat'' opened at No. 1, with an opening weekend gross of \u00a36,242,344 ($11,935,986),<ref name=\"bwqUD\" /> the 43rd best opening week earnings in the UK as of March 2007.<ref name=\"LlnRU\" /> Since its release, ''Borat'' has grossed over $260 million worldwide.<ref name=\"N6v84\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is applauded as a comedic genius.\" Although Arthur has said she was fired from the newscast, she told the [[Associated Press]] that she resigned from the station.<ref name=\"y8bhY\" /> She said that she checked a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.<ref name=\"9BW8y\" />\n\nIn news coverage that aired in January 2005 of the filming of the rodeo scene, Bobby Rowe, producer of the [[Salem, Virginia]] rodeo depicted in the film, stated that he felt he had been the victim of a hoax. He said that \"months\" prior to the appearance, he had been approached by someone from \"One America, a California-based film company that was reportedly doing a documentary on a Russian immigrant\"; he agreed to permit the \"immigrant\" to sing the U.S. national anthem after listening to a tape.<ref name=\"Rodeo\" /> After the film's release, Rowe said, \"Some people come up and say, 'Hey, you made the big time'; I've made the big time, but not in the way I want it.\"<ref name=\"LmIsM\" />\n\nCindy Streit, Borat's etiquette consultant, subsequently hired high-profile attorney [[Gloria Allred]], who demanded that the [[California Attorney General]] investigate fraud allegedly committed by Baron Cohen and the film's producers.<ref name=\"sd92G\" />\n\nThe ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' Arts & Entertainment site quotes the Behars (a Jewish couple at whose guest house Borat and Azamat stay) as calling the film \"outstanding\", referring to Baron Cohen as \"very lovely and very polite\" and a \"genius\".<ref name=\"Salon\" /> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' also interviewed the couple, saying they considered the film more anti-Muslim than anti-Semitic and had feared that Baron Cohen and his ensemble might be filming pornography in the house.<ref name=\"xFKef\" />\n\nThe feminists from [[Veteran Feminists of America]] (VFA) felt that they had been duped, having \"sensed something odd was going on\" before and during the interview with Borat. ''[[The Guardian]]'' later reported at least one of the women felt that the film was worth going to see at the cinema.<ref name=\"jjXzT\" />\n\nThe ''[[New York Post]]'' had reported in November 2006 that [[Pamela Anderson]] filed for divorce from her husband [[Kid Rock]] after he reacted unfavourably to the film during a screening. ''The Post''{{'}}s article specifically claimed he had said of her role in the film, \"You're nothing but a whore! You're a slut! How could you do that movie?\"<ref name=\"R7MGk\" /> In an interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Anderson confirmed that Rock was upset by her appearance in the film, but did not confirm that this was the cause of the separation.<ref name=\"bhhOs\" />\n\n===Legal action by participants===\nThe villagers of [[Glod, D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a|Glod]], Romania, took legal action against the producers of ''Borat'', complaining that they were lied to about the nature of the filming and they were portrayed as [[incest]]uous and ignorant. Some said they were paid only three [[Romanian leu|lei]] (about $1.28 in 2004) each, while others stated they were paid between $70 and $100 each, which did not cover their expenses.<ref name=\"killborat\" /> The residents asked for $38 million in damages.<ref name=\"kill\" /> One lawsuit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge [[Loretta Preska]] in a hearing in early December 2006 on the ground that the allegations in the complaint were too vague. Despite this, the litigants planned to refile.<ref name=\"NP9nJ\" /> In April 2008, the case was dismissed again, citing insufficient evidence.<ref name=\"Bmuah\" />\n\nTwo of the [[University of South Carolina]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity brothers]] who appeared in the film, Justin Seay and Christopher Rotunda, sued the producers, claiming [[Slander and libel|defamation]].<ref name=\"BBC-sueBorat\" /><ref name=\"esuit\" /><ref name=\"smokinggun-Bamboozled\" /> The suit by Seay and Rotunda was dismissed in February 2007.<ref name=\"esuit\" /> The students had also sought an injunction to prevent the DVD release of the film, which was denied.<ref name=\"BBC-sueBorat\" /><ref name=\"esuit\" /><ref name=\"smokinggun-Bamboozled\" /><ref name=\"a75Gh\" />\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed by a South Carolina resident who said he was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. The lawsuit also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.<ref name=\"XbzMd\" />\n\nThe [[North Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Romani people in North Macedonia|Romani]] singer [[Esma Red\u017eepova]] sued the film's producers, seeking \u20ac800,000 because the film used her song \"Chaje \u0160ukarije\" without her permission.<ref name=\"IvPkk\" /><ref name=\"sob5f\" />  But since Red\u017eepova\u2019s production house had failed to inform her that they had granted permission to use the song, she instead received a \u20ac26,000 compensation from it.<ref name=\"pXZus\" />\n\nFelix Cedeno, a 31-year-old American, sued [[20th Century Fox]] for $2.25 million, after he was filmed as part of a scene where a live chicken fell out of Borat's suitcase on the subway. Cedeno later dropped the suit and received nothing.<ref name=\"FQKO5\" /><ref name=\"Past Deadline 2008\" />\n\nBaltimore resident Michael Psenicska sought more than $100,000 in damages from Baron Cohen, 20th Century Fox, and other parties. Psenicska\u2014a high school mathematics teacher who also owns a driving school\u2014was reportedly paid $500 in cash to give Baron Cohen's bogus Kazakh journalist a driving lesson. In his action\u2014filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan\u2014the driving instructor said that he had been told the film was a \"documentary about the integration of foreign people into the American way of life\", and that if he had known the film's true nature, he would have never participated. Psenicska said he was entitled to damages because the defendants used images of him to advertise the film.<ref name=\"ZXPt1\" /> The case was dismissed on 9 September 2008.<ref name=\"RdZlo\" />\n\nJeffrey Lemerond, who was shown running and yelling, \"Get away\" as Borat attempted to hug strangers on a New York street, filed a legal case claiming his image was used in the film illegally, and that he suffered \"public ridicule, degradation and humiliation\" as a result. The case was dismissed.<ref name=\"FkTHe\" />\n\nBaron Cohen reacted to these suits by commenting: \"Some of the letters I get are quite unusual, like the one where the lawyer informed me I'm about to be sued for $100,000 and at the end says, 'P.S. Loved the movie. Can you sign a poster for my son Jeremy?'\"<ref name=\"kill\" />\n\n===Reception in Kazakhstan===\nThe government of Kazakhstan at first denounced ''Borat''. In 2005, following Borat's appearance at the [[MTV Movie Awards]], the country's Foreign Ministry threatened to sue Sacha Baron Cohen, and Borat's [[.kz|Kazakh-based]] website, www.borat.kz, was taken down.<ref name=\"u1N7B\" /><ref name=\"iICKi\" /> Kazakhstan also launched a multi-million dollar \"Heart of Eurasia\" campaign to counter the Borat effect; Baron Cohen replied by denouncing the campaign at an in-character press conference in front of the [[White House]] as the propaganda of the \"evil nitwits\" of [[Uzbekistan]].<ref name=\"5xEdv\" /><ref name=\"Aox9q\" /> Uzbekistan is, throughout the film, referred to by Borat as his nation's second leading problem, with the first being the Jews. In November 2006, Kazakh TV personality Jantemir Baimukhamedov travelled to London with the stated aim of presenting Baron Cohen with horse meat and horse urine, which were claimed by Borat to be the national food and drink of Kazakhstan, although he was unable to organise a meeting with him.<ref name=\"beeb\" />\n\nIn 2006, Gemini Films, the [[Central Asia]]n distributor of 20th Century Fox, complied with a Kazakh government request to not release the film.<ref name=\"Russiaban\" /> That year, Kazakh ambassador to the United Kingdom [[Erlan Idrissov]], after viewing the film, called parts of the film funny and wrote that the film had \"placed Kazakhstan on the map\".<ref name=\"gardner20061109\" /> By 2012, Kazakh Foreign Minister [[Yerzhan Kazykhanov]] attributed a great rise in tourism to his country\u2014with visas issued rising ten times\u2014to the film, saying \"I am grateful to 'Borat' for helping attract tourists to Kazakhstan.\"<ref name=\"bbc20120424\" />\n\nAccording to Yerlan Askarbekov, a Kazakh public relations professional who worked with both the [[British Council]] and the Kazakh government who wrote a piece for the [[BBC]] website in 2016, ten years after the film's release, many of his colleagues in the Kazakh media saw the character of Borat as a valuable PR opportunity. According to him some of the Kazakhs who were most upset by the film were students studying in the US and the UK, who understood the film's satirical intent but felt that their non-Kazakh peers were taking the film at face value as an accurate portrayal of the country. He suggested that interest in the character inside the country faded once Kazakhs grasped that the film was designed to \"get an outsider's view of the US and reveal the prejudices of the Americans who Borat interacts with... functioning as a sort of 21st Century [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]\".<ref name=\"beeb\" />\n\nThe Kazakh tabloid ''Karavan'' declared ''Borat'' to be the best film of the year, having had a reviewer see the film at a screening in [[Vienna]]. The paper said that it was \"certainly not an anti-Kazakh, anti-Romanian or anti-Semitic\" film, but rather \"cruelly anti-American ... amazingly funny and sad at the same time.\"<ref name=\"lBDjS\" /> Another favorable word came from Kazakh novelist Sapabek Asip-uly, who suggested Baron Cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the Kazakh Club of Art Patrons. In a letter published by the newspaper ''[[Vremya]]'', Asip-uly wrote, \"[Borat] has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in Kazakhstan\u2014something our authorities could not do during the years of independence. If state officials completely lack a sense of humor, their country becomes a laughing stock.\"<ref name=\"1nB1t\" /> [[Amazon.com|Amazon UK]] has also reported significant numbers of orders of ''Borat'' on DVD from Kazakhstan.<ref name=\"ZMizQ\" />\n\n=== Accidental use of its parody national anthem ===\nIn March 2012, the parody national anthem from the [[Borat (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]], which acclaims Kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports and having the second-cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the Emir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix. The gold medalist, [[Mariya Dmitriyenko]], stood on the dais while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was restaged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the Internet.<ref name=\"WY2rW\" /><ref name=\"HoJFk\" />\n\n===Accusations of ethnic defamation===\nThe [[European Center for Antiziganism Research]], which works against negative attitudes toward [[Romani people]], filed a complaint<ref name=\"Roma antiracism complaint\" /> with [[Germany|German]] prosecutors on 18 October 2006, based on Borat's references to Gypsies in his film. The complaint accuses him of defamation and inciting violence against an ethnic group.<ref name=\"GagD8\" /> As a consequence, 20th Century Fox declared that it would remove all parts referring to Romani people from trailers shown on German television as well as on the film's website.<ref name=\"LdwmD\" />\n\nBefore the release of the film, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) released a statement expressing concern over Borat's characteristic [[anti-Semitism]].<ref name=\"a1RLE\" /> Both Baron Cohen (who is Jewish) and the ADL have stated that the film uses Borat to expose prejudices felt or tolerated by others,<ref name=\"z6xVc\" /> but the ADL expressed concern that some audiences might remain oblivious to this aspect of the film's humor, while \"some may even find it reinforcing their bigotry\".<ref name=\"sU9IM\" />\n\n===Censorship in the Arab world===\nThe film was banned in the entire Arab world except for [[Lebanon]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (which released the film heavily censored).<ref name=\"Guardian-01Dec06\" /><ref name=\"ali2006\" /> Yousuf Abdul Hamid, a film censor for [[Dubai]] in the United Arab Emirates, called the film \"vile, gross and extremely ridiculous\". The censor said that he and his colleagues had walked out on their screening before it had finished, and that only half an hour of the film would be left once all the offensive scenes were removed.<ref name=\"ali2006\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Borat (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack for ''Borat'' was released on the [[iTunes Store]] on 24 October 2006, and in shops on 31 October 2006. The album included music from the film, five tracks entitled \"Dialoguing excerpt from moviefilm\", as well as the controversial anti-Semitic song \"[[In My Country There Is Problem]]\" from ''Da Ali G Show''.<ref name=\"faHm0\" />\n\nThe [[folk music]] included in the soundtrack has no connection to the authentic [[music of Kazakhstan]]. The album features songs by [[Roma music|Romani]] and Balkan artists (mostly [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Goran Bregovic]]) and includes music by [[Erran Baron Cohen]], founding member of ZOHAR Sound System and brother of ''Borat'' star Sacha Baron Cohen, as well as songs sung by Sacha Baron Cohen himself in character as Borat.\n\n==Home media==\nThe [[DVD region code|Region 2 DVD]] was released 5 March 2007, with the [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] release the following day.<ref name=\"RuYuQ\" /><ref name=\"TEoWu\" /> Special features include [[deleted scenes]], faux advertisements for the soundtrack album, and a complete [[Russian language]] translation audio track using a professional dubbing cast, along with the English, [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language]] tracks common on Region 1. There is also a choice of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but this is merely a joke; choosing the Hebrew language option results in a warning screen reading \"You have been trapped, Jew!\" which warns the viewer not to change his shape and to keep his claws where they can be seen, again playing on the anti-Semitism supposedly prevalent in Borat's version of Kazakhstan. It also includes footage of Borat's publicity tour for the film, with Baron Cohen in character as Borat on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The bonus features conclude with a news segment from [[WSLS-TV|a Virginia TV station]] about Borat's night at the rodeo, complete with an interview with rodeo owner Bobby Rowe.\n\nAs a play on the [[copyright infringement]] common in the former [[Soviet Union]], the packaging of the Region 1 (United States/Canada), 2 (Europe/Japan/South Africa/Middle East), and 4 (Latin America/Oceania) editions mimics a foreign [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] DVD. The slipcover is in English but the case itself has all-Cyrillic text (a majority of which is in legitimate Russian, not faux Cyrillic) and is made to look poorly photocopied. The disc itself is made to look like a \"Demorez\" [[DVD-R]] with the slogan \"Is life? No. Demorez.\", a parody on \"Is it live, or is it [[Memorex]]?\" ad campaign, and the word \"BO\u042fAT\" appearing to be crudely written in marker with the \"R\" [[Ya (Cyrillic)|written backwards]].<ref name=\"dvd\" /> The [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] version is similar to the DVD, even being labelled a \"UMD-R\" (which do not exist). Even the [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] in-cover advertising is written in broken English that appears poorly printed, indicating that there are \"More movie discs available from US&A\" and \"Also legal to own in Kazakhstan\".\n\nThere are further jokes within the DVD itself. The menus are styled as a worn, static-laden film on an erratically functioning projector, with more Cyrillic writing accompanied by translations in broken English. The DVD is described as a \"prerecorded moviedisc for purpose domestic viewing of moviefilm\", and the viewer is warned that \"selling piratings of this moviedisc will result in punishment by [[crushing (execution)|crushing]]\". The DVD's collection of [[trailer (film)|trailers]] promises that the depicted films are \"coming Kazakhstan in 2028\". By April 2007, the DVD had sold over 3.5 million copies, totaling more than $55 million in sales.<ref name=\"mVvbJ\" /> ''Borat'' was released on [[Blu-ray]] in the US on 9 November 2009 as a region-free disc.<ref name=\"9K5Nx\" />\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Borat Subsequent Moviefilm}}\nIn 2009, the film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was released. Co-written, co-produced by, and starring Baron Cohen, the film was based on another of his characters: [[Br\u00fcno (character)|Br\u00fcno]], a gay [[Austria]]n fashion reporter. [[Universal Studios]] is reported to have produced the film with a budget of $42 million.<ref name=\"Hs7GT\" />\n\n[[Rupert Murdoch]] announced in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had signed on to do another Borat film with Fox.<ref name=\"c0neM\" /> However, this was contradicted by an interview in which Baron Cohen himself stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too recognizable to prevent detection as he did in the original film and on ''Da Ali G Show''.<ref name=\"HEJSW\" /> A spokesman for Fox later said that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.<ref name=\"Aoc8w\" />\n\nBaron Cohen subsequently announced that he was \"killing off\" the characters of Borat and Ali G because they were now so famous he could no longer trick people. Even though he decided to retire the characters, on 26 February 2014, he brought them back for the [[FXX]] series ''[[Da Ali G Show#Ali G: Rezurection|Ali G: Rezurection]]'', a collection of the sketches from all 18 episodes of ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'', including new footage of Baron Cohen in-character as Ali G, who is portrayed as the presenter of the show.<ref name=\"kill\" />\n\nBaron Cohen revived the character of Borat in December 2015 on the late night talk show ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' to premiere the new trailer for his movie ''[[Grimsby (film)|Grimsby]]''.<ref name=\"Y91Pc\" />\n\nIn September 2020, a direct sequel, titled ''[[Borat Subsequent Moviefilm]]'', was officially confirmed to have been secretly filmed, completed and screened during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] a few weeks after Baron Cohen was spotted driving a pick-up truck in character as Borat around [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"RNE2y\" /><ref name=\"Pevx3\" /> That same month, [[Amazon Studios]] acquired distribution rights to the film and released it on 23 October 2020.<ref name=\"IxQkR\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|United States|Film|United Kingdom|Comedy|2000s}}\n* ''[[Molvan\u00eea]]''\n* [[List of Dilbert characters#Elbonians|Elbonia]]\n* [[Lower Slobbovia]]\n* [[Anti-Americanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Mojo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=borat.htm |title=Borat!
