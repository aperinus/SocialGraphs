The film features the characters from the ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' books written by [[A. A. Milne]] and [[E. H. Shepard]], and is the third theatrically released ''Winnie the Pooh'' feature.  In this film, [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] is ashamed of being small and clumsy and wanders off into the [[Hundred Acre Wood]], leading all of his friends to form a search party to find him.\n''Piglet's Big Movie'' was produced by the Japanese office of [[Disneytoon Studios]] and the animation production was by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Disney Animation Japan|Walt Disney Animation Japan, Inc.]] with additional animation provided by Gullwing Co., Ltd., additional background by Studio Fuga and digital ink and paint by T2 Studio.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Eeyore]], [[Rabbit (Winnie the Pooh)|Rabbit]], [[Tigger]] and [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] are trying to get bees to move into a new hive so they can get the honey. [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] arrives and is told that he is too small to help, but he manages to trap the bees in the new hive after the plan goes awry due to the bees not falling for their trick. The others take the credit and Piglet leaves dejectedly, his heroism being unnoticed. When the bees break free, Pooh, Rabbit, Tigger, and Eeyore escape to Piglet's house. Noticing Piglet's absence, they decide to find him using Piglet's scrapbook as a guide. The five tell the stories of the pictures therein, leading to several flashbacks that make up the majority of the film.\n\nThe first story is of [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]] and Roo's arrival in the Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit are afraid of the newcomers, and Rabbit plans to use Piglet as a decoy to ransom Roo to force Kanga to leave. Kanga sees through the plan and plays along, pretending that Piglet is Roo, Piglet sees how nice she is while Roo and Rabbit get along well. Kanga and Roo are allowed to stay. Back at the present, Roo joins the group in their search for Piglet.\n\nThe second story is of the expedition to find the North Pole. Roo falls in the river and Piglet uses a long stick to flip him into the air. His heroism is overlooked when he gives the stick to Pooh to try to catch Roo, who is actually caught by Kanga, and [[Christopher Robin]] credits Pooh with finding the North Pole. Back in the present, the friends felt guilt and regret for not crediting Piglet for his part in the rescue.\n\nThe third story concerns building [[The House at Pooh Corner]]. Piglet has the idea to build Eeyore a house in a place that they call Pooh Corner, and is joined by Pooh and Tigger to build it. Piglet struggles to keep up as Tigger and Pooh try to build the house using some neatly stacked sticks. Their attempts fall apart. Tigger and Pooh leave Piglet behind and go to tell Eeyore the bad news, but Eeyore says he already built himself a house of sticks, revealing that the sticks Pooh and Tigger used had been his house. Piglet arrives and leads them back to Eeyore's newly completed house. Once again, Piglet's contribution is overlooked as the wind is given the credit for moving Eeyore's house.\n\nBack in the present, an argument between Rabbit and Tigger ends with the scrapbook falling into a river. Without their guide, the friends return to Piglet's house and, after making drawings of Piglet's heroism to celebrate his bravery, they again resolve to find Piglet. They come across some scrapbook pages which have floated downstream, and find the book's bindings suspended on a hollow log looming over a waterfall. Trying to retrieve it, Pooh falls into a hole in the log. The others cannot reach to rescue him. Piglet arrives and helps but the log breaks in half. Eeyore, Rabbit, Roo and Tigger escape as the top half of the log falls down the waterfall, and grieve over the apparent loss of Piglet and Pooh. However, Piglet and Pooh had escaped into the bottom half of the log, and reunite with their friends. The friends apologies to Piglet for the loss of his scrapbook and their disregard of his good deeds, but he claims that its not that important.\n\nPiglet's friends take him back to his house to show him their new drawings celebrating his befriending of Kanga and Roo, rescuing Roo with the North Pole, and building Eeyore's house at Pooh Corner. Pooh takes Piglet to Eeyore's house to show him he changed the sign to \"Pooh and Piglet Corner\". When everyone else arrives, Pooh says \"it's the least [they] could do for a very small Piglet who has done such very big things.\" Piglet casts a very large shadow behind them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Fiedler]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)#Disney adaptations|Piglet]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]] / [[Tigger#Disney adaptations|Tigger]]\n* [[Andre Stojka]] as [[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Owl|Owl]]\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as [[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Kanga|Kanga]]\n* [[Nikita Hopkins]] as [[Roo]]\n* [[Peter Cullen]] as [[Eeyore#Disney adaptions|Eeyore]]\n* [[Ken Sansom]] as [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)#Disney adaptions|Rabbit]]\n* Tom Wheatley as [[Christopher Robin#Disney adaptions|Christopher Robin]]\n\n==Production==\n''Piglet's Big Movie'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]], [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Disney Animation Japan|Walt Disney Animation (Japan)]], Gullwing Co., Ltd, Studio Fuga, and T2 Studio.\n\n==Music==\n\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Piglet's Big Movie (Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Carly Simon]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 18, 2003\n| recorded   = 2002\u20132003\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 43:02\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records]]\n| producer   = Matt Walker, [[Carly Simon]], [[Rob Mathes]], Michael Kosarin\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/piglets-big-movie-mw0000021946| title=AllMusic review| access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref>\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]] wrote seven new songs for the film, and performed six of them (\"If I Wasn't So Small\", \"Mother's Intuition\", \"Sing Ho for the Life of a Bear\", \"With a Few Good Friends\", \"The More I Look Inside\", and \"Comforting to Know\"), as well as recording her own version of the Sherman brothers' \"Winnie the Pooh\" theme song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carlysimon.com/music/soundtracks/Piglet.shtml |title=Carly Simon Official Website \u2013 Piglet's Big Movie |access-date=April 1, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114085349/http://www.carlysimon.com/music/soundtracks/Piglet.shtml |archive-date=January 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n\"The More It Snows\" features [[Jim Cummings]] and [[John Fiedler]], as Pooh and Piglet.
