The film focuses on an aging \"[[Don Juan]]\" who embarks on a cross-country journey to track down four of his former lovers after receiving an anonymous letter stating that he has a son. The film stars [[Bill Murray]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Julie Delpy]], [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]], [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]], and [[Alexis Dziena]].\n\nThe film was nominated for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 2005 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and won the ''[[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]]''. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $47.3 million worldwide on a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDon Johnston, a former ''[[Don Juan]]'' who made a small fortune in the computer industry, wants to live in quiet retirement. He is content to lounge around watching old movies and listening to classical or [[easy listening]] music. His current girlfriend, Sherry, is ending their relationship and moving out of his house when a letter in a pink envelope arrives.\n\nLater Don reads the letter; it purports to be from an unnamed former girlfriend, informing him that he has a son who is nearly nineteen years old, and who may be looking for him. Initially, Don does not intend to do anything about it, but his busybody neighbor Winston, who is a mystery novel enthusiast, urges Don to investigate. Winston researches the current locations of the five women most likely to have written the letter and gives Don the information along with maps and flight reservations, and persuades him to visit them.\n\nUltimately Don meets with four women (the fifth one had died before the events of the film), each encounter worse than the last and each woman damaged in some way:\n* Laura works as a closet and drawer organizer and is the widow of a race car driver. She is very warm and receptive to Don's visit, but has a very forward teenage daughter, Lolita, who parades nude in front of him before her mother arrives. Both mom and daughter are oblivious to the implications of the name \"[[Lolita]]\". That night, Laura sleeps with Don.\n* Dora is a [[realtor]]. Once a \"[[flower child]]\" of the 1960s, she has reversed to the opposite extreme and is now living a suburban conservative middle class existence married to Ron. The encounter, while friendly on the surface belies a great deal of tension with Ron coming across as threatening, and Dora as pained and nervous.\n* Carmen Markowski works as an \"animal communicator\". Don recalls how she was formerly so passionate about becoming a lawyer. She is cold to Don and seems to have a close relationship with her secretary, who is very protective of her and unimpressed by Don's sudden visit.\n* Penny lives in a rural area amongst bikers. She appears to still harbour a great deal of resentment against Don, and when he asks if she has a son, she becomes furious. Two of the men appear after the commotion and punch Don out. The next morning, Don finds himself in his car, in the middle of a field, with a nasty cut near his left eye.\n\nLater, Don stops at a florist to buy flowers from a young woman named Sun Green who treats his cut.  Don leaves the flowers at the grave of the fifth woman, Michelle Pepe.\n\nFinally, Don returns home where he finds a pink letter from Sherry, admitting she still likes him. He discusses the trip and second letter with Winston, who theorizes that Sherry might have written the original letter as a hoax. He then goes home to compare the two letters.\n\nDon then meets a young man in the street who he suspects may be his son. He buys him a meal, but when he remarks that the young man believes that Don is his father, the young man becomes agitated and flees. Don attempts to chase the man but gives up, standing in the middle of a crossroads. Don watches a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] drive past from which a young man (Bill Murray's son, Homer Murray) in the passenger seat makes eye contact with Don, while the same music Don has listened to on his trip plays from the passing car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Don Johnston\n* [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] as Winston\n* [[Heather Simms]] as Mona\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Laura Miller\n* [[Alexis Dziena]] as Lolita Miller\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Dora Anderson\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Ron Anderson\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Dr. Carmen Markowski\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Penny\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as Sherry\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Carmen's assistant\n* [[Pell James]] as Sun Green\n* [[Meredith Patterson]] as Flight attendant\n* [[Ryan Donowho]] as Young man on bus\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as The Kid\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe ending of the story was left deliberately unresolved.<ref name=CinemaCom>{{cite web |title=Broken Flowers: The Writer/Director: Q & A with Jim Jarmusch |url=http://cinema.com/articles/3539/broken-flowers-the-writerdirector-q-a-with-jim-jarmusch.phtml |website=Cinema.com |publisher=Cinema.com |access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref> Director Jim Jarmusch had each of the four female leads write their own pink paper letter \"in character\" to plant in each one's mind the possibility that she was the mother of Don's supposed son.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Bill Murray's subtle and understated style complements director Jim Jarmusch's minimalist storytelling in this quirky, but deadpan comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/broken_flowers/ |title=Broken Flowers (2005) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 15, 2010}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film had an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 39 reviews from film critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/broken-flowers|title=Broken Flowers|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=June 4, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ken Tucker]], \"''Broken Flowers'' relies on Bill Murray's persona, but it also turns that persona back on him. Instead of maintaining the satirical distance that made it easy to laugh at heartland eccentrics in, say, Alexander Payne's ''[[About Schmidt]]'', Jarmusch's film avoids caricature, and Murray's poker face melts. Don feels a bittersweet regret at becoming exactly the sort of granite-faced wise guy Bill Murray has made his rep at enshrining. Murray is at a point in his career when his self-effacement has achieved high comic art, and he collaborates with Jarmusch at a point in his career when he's trying to be something more than hipster-serene. Both succeed, by committing to the notion that a yearning to be reborn within a hopeless, brittle soul is worthy of drama\u2014as well as a deeper, gentler humor.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= https://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/12373/ | title= Ex Marks the Spot|first=Ken |last=Tucker| author-link= Ken Tucker | date= 15 August 2005 | work= [[New York (magazine)|New York]]|access-date=2015-09-22}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Bradshaw]] called it \"Jarmusch's most enjoyable, accessible work for some time, perhaps his most emotionally generous film - like [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]], he has made a bold venture into the mainstream with a movie that creates a gentle cloud of happiness.
