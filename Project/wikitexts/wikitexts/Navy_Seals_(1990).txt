The ship reports that they have been attacked, are on fire and adrift. A deployed Navy [[SH-3]] helicopter attempts to rescue the crew, but is downed by a gunboat and the aircrew is captured.\n\nMeanwhile, [[United States Navy SEALs]] Dale Hawkins ([[Charlie Sheen]]), James Curran ([[Michael Biehn]]), William \"Billy\" Graham ([[Dennis Haysbert]]), James Leary ([[Rick Rossovich]]), Homer Rexer ([[Cyril O'Reilly]]), Floyd \"God\" Dane ([[Bill Paxton]]), and Ramos (Paul Sanchez) are recovering from a [[bachelor party]]. Graham is to be married, but the wedding is canceled at the last minute when the whole team is [[Pager|paged]] to rescue the captured aircrew.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the leader of the terrorists that shot at the Navy helicopter, Ben Shaheed ([[Nicholas Kadi]]), orders the killing of the hostages. One crewmember is killed on the spot and another is beaten up, but the SEAL team arrives just in time to prevent any further kills. Reacting to a suspicious noise, Hawkins breaks silence when he encounters Shaheed in an adjoining room, inadvertently alerting the terrorists.\n\nShaheed claims to be an Egyptian sailor also being held by the terrorists, and is left by the SEALs. As the SEALs evacuate the hostages from the area, Hawkins and Graham stumble across a warehouse containing [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]]. Hawkins attempts to return to the warehouse to destroy the missiles, only to be ordered by Curran to proceed with extraction.\n\nOn board an aircraft carrier later that night, the individual team members are debriefed by Naval Intelligence. Curran's decision to leave the Stinger missiles behind is questioned, but Curran retorts that his primary mission was to rescue the aircrew and that Naval Intelligence did not do their job properly. Meanwhile, Hawkins is highly agitated by the mission and has trouble dealing with the emotional upheaval the mission provided. Curran tries to calm him down but is rebuffed by Hawkins.\n\nAt [[the Pentagon]], Shaheed is seen in a video interview. The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] identify Shaheed and his organization, ''Al Shuhadah''. They also identify the interviewer as Claire Varrens ([[Joanne Whalley-Kilmer]]), a journalist and author who is half Lebanese. Her questioning of Shaheed yields an admission that he and his group participated in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983]]. Shaheed admits the complicity freely, saying they only sought revenge for the bombing of their homes by Navy ships and warplanes.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs are briefed on the recent mission and Curran requests permission to destroy the Stingers, but Navy Intelligence has learned they have already been relocated. The SEALs are ordered on R&R and enjoy a game of golf.  Curran, brooding over the previous mission, reads a book authored by Varrens. During the golf outing, Graham convinces his fianc\u00e9e ([[S. Epatha Merkerson]]) to try to finish the wedding, regardless of the hazards of Graham's job.\n\nThe team receives their orders for the next mission. Naval Intelligence has heard that the Stinger missiles are on board a merchant ship, the ''Latanya'', off the coast of Syria. The SEALs deploy from a submerged submarine, the USS ''Nyack'', and successfully board the ship, neutralizing two disguised gunmen, only to find out from an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] team that the missiles are not on board after all.\n\nFrustrated by the recent unreliable intelligence, Curran solicits Varrens's cooperation. Curran takes Claire on a tour of a SEAL training facility and attempts to woo her over an elegant dinner. Claire is initially wary but opens up to Curran after learning that a Stinger has been used to shoot down a peace delegation in Lebanon. Claire provides pictures of men she has encountered who may possibly provide information that may lead the SEALs to the location of the missiles.\n\nWhile trying to identify possible contacts, Claire tells Curran and Hawkins that one of her contacts is missing, most likely having been kidnapped by the Israelis. Inspired by this, and an outburst by Hawkins, Curran presents the idea of kidnapping a potential informant to his superiors who subsequently recommend the proposal at a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting. A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] executive at the meeting identifies one of the targets as a known CIA informant who could be co-opted if taken into custody. On that basis, the SEALs are authorized to bring him in.\n\nThe SEALs infiltrate the area by performing a [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO]] jump and swimming to shore. Curran leads several of the team inside a house to secure the informant while Hawkins, Ramos, and Graham remain outside. When Ramos is pinned down by patrolling militia, Hawkins disobeys Curran's order to stay quiet and instigates a firefight. Although Hawkins finally succeeds in killing the militiamen, Graham is killed during the firefight.\n\nCurran informs Graham's fianc\u00e9e of his death, and a funeral with [[full military honors]] is held. After the wake, the men drown their sorrows at a local bar. Hawkins gives a toast to Graham for being the best friend a guy could have. Curran scolds Hawkins for his carelessness that caused Graham's death. Later, Claire arrives at Curran's houseboat to find a still grieving Curran, leading to a night of intimacy. Curran quietly leaves the next morning with Claire in bed.\n\nDisguised as Lebanese militiamen, the SEALs are deployed by Helicopter to [[Beirut]], coming ashore at its seafront on [[Zodiac (boat)|Zodiac rubber inflatable boat]]s, this time to meet a local resistance fighter from the [[Lebanese Resistance Regiments|AMAL militia]] who will guide them to the building containing the Stingers. Although Dane is killed while attempting to set up a sniping [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] position, the SEALs locate the Stingers in an old school building in a heavily-bombed area of the city. Curran leads Leary and Rexer inside the building to destroy the missiles while Hawkins and Ramos maintain overwatch outside. Hawkins shoots a local gunman questioning him, alerting the terrorists.\n\nLeaving the building, Curran gets shot in the abdomen and thigh. Curran is pinned down near the building door and orders Hawkins to destroy the building regardless of Curran's being in the blast radius. Hawkins disobeys the order and rescues Curran while the other SEALs provide [[suppressing fire]] before the building is finally destroyed.\n\nThe SEALs commandeer a civilian [[Mercedes-Benz W123|Mercedes-Benz W123 car]] and attempt to exfiltrate from the city while evading pursuit by an enemy [[BTR-152]] [[Armoured Personnel Carrier]] (APC) armed with a twin [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal machine gun]] mount. The car is eventually hit by machine gunfire and Rexer killed by a stray bullet to the head. Leary, using a recovered Stinger missile launcher, manages to destroy the APC, and the four remaining SEALs escape to the beach.\n\nShaheed steals a boat from a pier-side fisherman and follows the SEALs across the water. He spots Curran's body floating in the sea. As he attempts to pull the body from the water he is attacked by the SEALs and, in an underwater fight, Hawkins kills Shaheed. The other SEALs take out the remaining topside terrorists and destroy the small boat. With the mission finally accomplished, the designated exfiltration submarine surfaces, recovering the SEALs.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:8.23.12MichaelBiehnByLuigiNovi12.jpg|thumb|Star [[Michael Biehn]] signing a copy of the DVD cover during an August 23, 2012 appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Lieutenant Junior Grade Dale Hawkins, the second in command of the Navy SEAL team.<ref>{{cite news|title= Charlie Sheen Takes Plunge Into Secrecy For 'Navy Seals' Role|publisher= [[The Morning Call|Morning Call]]|url= http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-20/features/2761371_1_navy-seals-chuck-pfarrer-seal-instructor|access-date=2010-12-28}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as Lieutenant James Curran, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* [[Joanne Whalley|Joanne Whalley-Kilmer]] as Claire Varrens\n* [[Rick Rossovich]] as HM3(SEAL) James Leary: Corpsman\n* [[Cyril O'Reilly]] as HT1(SEAL)  Homer Rexer: Explosives\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as MM2(SEAL) Floyd \"God\" Dane: Sniper\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as OSC(SEAL/SW) William \"Billy\" Graham: Team Chief\n* Paul Sanchez as RM3 Ramos: Communications and Arabic interpreter\n* [[Nicholas Kadi]] as Ben Shaheed\n* Ronald G.

Pfarrer, an active duty navy SEAL who wrote screenplays in his spare time, had just sold \"The Crook Factory,\" a script about [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s life. Feigen encouraged him to write a script based on his experiences. After retiring from the SEALs, Pfarrer wrote the script, which Feigen shopped to [[Orion Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], and [[United Artists]], hoping to create a bidding war. Orion ultimately purchased the script, with Feigen acting as producer.\n\nFeigen wanted [[Ridley Scott]] to direct, but negotiations fell through. Producers met with [[Roger Donaldson]], but he didn\u2019t like the script, [[Richard Marquand]] was then hired, but his death in 1987 stopped pre-production until Lewis Teague was brought in as a replacement.\n\nSeveral screenwriters were brought on to do rewrites. [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] wrote a new draft with Pfarrer, taking influence from the 1961 film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'', and the 1982 film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. [[Kevin Jarre]] was approached to do a rewrite, but initially declined due to the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|1988 Writer's Strike]]. Once the strike ended in August 1988, Jarre turned in his draft, which was considered stronger, but the producers had concerns about the script, mainly a line of dialogue that was deemed sexist, and lacking in character depth. [[Angelo Pizzo]] was then brought on to flesh out and develop the main characters. Rewrites continued well into production, with uncredited script doctors and even actors Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn reportedly rewriting scenes<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2XrDwAAQBAJ&q=Navy+SEALs|title=Not One of the Boys: Living Life as a Feminist|last=Feigen|first=Brenda|date=2020-07-15|publisher=[[Random House|Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780593319062|language=en|access-date=2020-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-05-28-ca-1317-story.html?_amp=true|title=Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn enlist in...|date=1989-05-28|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2020-09-22}}</ref> Ultimately, only Pfarrer and Goldman received credit on the final film.\n\nThe actors underwent a two-week training course in Northern Virginia, taking part in field maneuvers and weapons training. Eight former Navy SEALs were hired as technical advisors to train the actors and occasionally perform stunts.\n\nPrincipal Photography began in the fall of 1989 in [[Virginia Beach]] and near [[Naval Station Norfolk]], in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. In November 1989, filming moved to Southern [[Spain]], utilizing the Mediterranean ports of [[Tarifa]], [[C\u00e1diz]], and [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]. The [[Spanish Navy]] provided submarines, battleships and helicopters, whereas the [[Spanish Army]] provided tanks, APCs and background actors. Chosen because of its [[Moorish Revival architecture]], Cartagena's old inner city stood in for [[Beirut, Lebanon]]. Teague used up to seven camera crews filming simultaneously in several action scenes.\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''Navy SEALs'' was released in theaters on July 20, 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-20-9003010363-story,amp.html |title=GUNS 'N 'SEALS' |date=1990-07-20 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2020-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1990-07-20-9007190570-story,amp.html |title=NAVY SEALS' IS AN ACTION PICTURE IN FIGHTING SHAPE |date=1990-07-20 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=2020-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe movie was not a box office success, debuting at No. 4 and grossing $6.5 million the first week, eventually grossing $25 million domestically, just barely above its reported budget of $21 million.<ref>{{cite news|title= Ghost Materializes as No. 1 at the Box Office|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1990-07-23 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-23/entertainment/ca-650_1_box-office|access-date=2010-12-28 |first=Pat H.|last=Broeske}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Charlie Sheen's Rebirthday Family Gathering Starts 'Hot Shots!'
