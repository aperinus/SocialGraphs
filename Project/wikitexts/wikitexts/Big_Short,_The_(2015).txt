The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] in addition to nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Bale), and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|2007 housing market crash]].\n\n===Scion Capital===\n\nIn 2005, eccentric [[hedge fund]] manager [[Michael Burry]] discovers that the United States [[real estate economics|housing market]], based on high-risk [[Subprime lending|subprime loans]], is [[Economic bubble|extremely unstable]]. Anticipating the market's collapse in the second quarter of 2007, as interest rates would rise from [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s, he proposes to create a [[credit default swap]] market, allowing him to bet against, or [[Short (finance)|short]], market-based [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]], for profit.\n\nHis long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks but requires paying substantial monthly [[Insurance|premiums]]. This sparks his main client, Lawrence Fields, to accuse him of \"wasting\" [[Capital asset|capital]] while many clients demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors, and Fields sues Burry. Eventually, [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|the market collapses]] and his fund's value increases by 489% with an overall profit (even allowing for the massive premiums) of over $2.69 billion, with Fields receiving $489 million alone.\n\n===FrontPoint Partners===\n\nJared Vennett (based on [[Greg Lippmann]]),<ref name=\"CarellCast\" /> the executive in charge of global asset-backed securities trading at [[Deutsche Bank]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/lippmann-deutsche-trader-steps-down |title=Lippmann, Deutsche Trader, Steps Down, NYTimes Dealbook 21 April 2010 |date=April 21, 2010 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-date=June 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624035829/https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/lippmann-deutsche-trader-steps-down/ |url-status=live }}</ref> is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap. Using his [[quantitative analyst|quant]] to verify that Burry is most likely correct, he decides to enter the market, earning a fee from selling the swaps to firms who will profit when the underlying bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts [[FrontPoint Partners]] hedge fund manager Mark Baum (based on [[Steve Eisman]]), who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) rated at [[Bond credit rating#Credit rating tiers|AAA ratings]] will guarantee their eventual collapse.\n\nConducting a field investigation in South Florida, the FrontPoint team discovers that [[mortgage broker]]s are profiting by selling their mortgage deals to [[Wall Street]] banks, who pay higher margins for the riskier mortgages, creating the bubble. This knowledge prompts the FrontPoint team to buy swaps from Vennett.\n\nIn early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and [[Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies]] from an acquaintance at [[Standard & Poor's]]. Vennett invites the team to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas, where Baum learns from a CDO manager that the market for insuring mortgage bonds, including \"[[synthetic CDO]]s\" which are bets in favor of the faulty mortgage bonds, is significantly larger than the market for the mortgage loans themselves, leading a horrified Baum to realize the entire world economy is set to collapse.\n\nAs the subprime bonds continue to fall, Baum learns that [[Morgan Stanley]], whose umbrella FrontPoint operates under, had also [[proprietary trading|taken short positions against mortgage derivatives]]. However, in order to offset the risk and the monthly premiums, it had bought higher-rated mortgage derivatives. Now that these are also collapsing in value, Morgan Stanley is facing severe liquidity problems. Despite pressure from his staff to sell their position before Morgan Stanley collapses, Baum refuses to sell until the economy is on the verge of collapsing, making over $1 billion in their swaps. Even so, Baum laments that the banks, as well as the government, will not admit what caused the economy to collapse, but will instead blame \"immigrants and poor people\".\n\n===Brownfield Capital===\nYoung investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley run a small firm called Brownfield Capital (based on the firm [[Cornwall Capital]]). They accidentally discover a marketing presentation by Vennett on a coffee table in the lobby of a large investment bank (the characters address the audience stating that in reality they had heard about Vennett's plan through word of mouth from friends and family), convincing them to invest in swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Below the capital threshold for an [[ISDA Master Agreement]] required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of Ben Rickert, a retired securities trader who was based in [[Singapore]]. When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the American Securitization Forum, where they learn that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity. They successfully make even more profit than Burry and Baum by shorting the higher-rated AA mortgage securities, as they were considered highly stable and carried a much higher payout ratio.\n\nLater, as default numbers rise, the value of the CDOs and mortgage bonds does not change, and they realize the banks and the ratings agencies are maintaining the value of their CDOs in order to sell and short them before the inevitable crash. Horrified, they try to tip off the press about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud, but a writer from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' exposes his own personal conflict of interest and will not listen in order to not endanger his relationships at the Wall Street investment banks. As the market starts collapsing, Ben, on vacation in England, sells their swaps. Ultimately, they turn their $30 million investment into $80 million, but their faith in the system is broken when Ben tells them of the severe consequences for the general public.\n\n===Epilogue===\n\nJared Vennett receives a bonus of $47 million for all of his swap sales. Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continue to operate their fund. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after unsuccessfully trying to sue the ratings agencies, with Charlie moving to [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] to start a family, and Jamie still running the fund. Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement. Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS [[audit]]s, now only investing in water securities.\n\nThe personnel of the banks responsible for the crisis escape any consequences for their actions, with the single exception of [[Kareem Serageldin|one trader]]. It is noted that as of 2015, banks are selling CDOs again under a new label: \"[[Bespoke portfolio (CDO)|Bespoke Tranche Opportunity]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction         = horizontal\n| align             = right\n| image1            = Christian Bale 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1              = \n| caption1          = \n| image2            = Steve Carell November 2014.jpg\n| alt2              = \n| caption2          = \n| image3            = Ryan Gosling (36034827222) (cropped).jpg\n| alt3              = \n| caption3          = \n| image4            = Brad Pitt 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| alt4              = \n| caption4          = \n| footer            = [[Christian Bale]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Brad Pitt]] portray the film\u2019s four central characters.\n| total_width       = 460\n}}\n\n*[[Christian Bale]] as [[Michael Burry]]: one of the first people to discover the American housing market bubble.

Somewhere between there was what I was shooting for. Once I got the tone down, then I went through the plot. The market's movements provided you with an underlying plot. You make your short deal, then the bank is trying to squeeze you out, and then it all breaks loose.
