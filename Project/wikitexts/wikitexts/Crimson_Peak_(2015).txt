The film stars [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Charlie Hunnam]], and [[Jim Beaver]]. The story, set in [[Edwardian era]] [[England]], follows an aspiring author who travels to a remote Gothic mansion in the English hills with her new husband and his sister. There, she must decipher the mystery behind the ghostly visions that haunt her new home.\n\nIn 2006, a [[spec script]] written by Del Toro and Robbins was sold to [[Universal Pictures]], with Del Toro set to direct. Development was delayed due to scheduling conflicts. The film was described as a \"ghost story and gothic romance\" heavily inspired by other horror films, such as ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'', ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on February 10, 2014, with additional filming in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and ended on May 16 that year. The film was produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and Del Toro's production company, [[Guillermo del Toro|Double Dare You Productions]].\n\n''Crimson Peak'' premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 25, 2015, and was released in the United States on October 16, 2015 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the production values, performances and direction, but criticized the plot and characters. Despite this, it performed [[box-office bomb|poorly at the box office]], grossing $74 million worldwide against its $55 million budget. The film received three nominations at the [[21st Empire Awards]], including [[Empire Award for Best Horror|Best Horror]]. It received nine nominations at the [[42nd Saturn Awards]], winning three, including [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Chastain and Best Production Design for [[Thomas E. Sanders]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1887 [[Buffalo, New York]], [[List of American heiresses|American heiress]] Edith Cushing, daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing, is visited by her mother's ghost who warns, \"Beware of Crimson Peak.\"\n\nIn 1901, Edith is now a budding author, and meets English [[baronet]] Sir Thomas Sharpe and his sister, Lucille. Thomas seeks investors for his invention, a digging machine to revive his family's clay mines, but Mr. Cushing rejects his proposal. Thomas and Edith become romantically attached, leading her father to hire a private detective who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpe siblings. Mr. Cushing bribes them to leave America, forcing Thomas to \"break Edith's heart\" by disparaging her and her novel.\n\nThomas returns Edith's manuscript with a letter explaining his actions, and they reconcile. Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, raising the suspicions of Edith's childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael. Thomas marries Edith \u2014 giving her a ring taken from Lucille \u2014 and they arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated [[Cumberland]] mansion, which is sinking into the [[red clay]] mine below. Lucille plies Edith with tea made from \"firethorn berries\", and Thomas persuades her to put her father's fortune toward his machine. He mentions that the estate is referred to as \"Crimson Peak\" due to the warm red clay seeping through the winter snow.\n\nEdith grows weak and begins coughing up blood, plagued by nightmares and visited by gruesome ghosts around Allerdale. One of the spirits tricks her into opening a closet, where she discovers [[Phonograph cylinder|wax phonograph cylinders]], and chases her into the cellars, where she finds a locked trunk engraved with the name \"Enola\". Thomas takes Edith to the local post office, where she receives a letter addressed to E. Sharpe. Snowed in for the night, they finally make love, which Lucille is infuriated to learn.\n\nEdith steals a key from Lucille bearing the inscription \"Enola\" and unlocks the trunk to find a gramophone and secret documents. The wax cylinders and documents reveal that Thomas previously married three other wealthy women \u2014 including Enola Sciotti, the letter\u2019s intended recipient \u2014 and that Lucille has been poisoning Edith with tea as part of the siblings' \"marriage and murder\" scheme to finance Thomas' inventions. Edith confronts her husband and sister-in-law, catching them in an incestuous embrace, and Lucille pushes her from a balcony.\n\nAlan has learned what Mr. Cushing uncovered about the Sharpes: Thomas's multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith, arriving just after she has been pushed. Tending to her injuries, Alan prepares to leave with Edith, but Lucille stabs him and demands that Thomas finish the job. Instead, Thomas fakes Alan\u2019s death with a non-fatal wound and hides him in the cellar.\n\nLucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate, and confesses to having murdered Thomas\u2019 previous wives and having borne a child with Thomas that soon died \u2014 these are the ghosts who have appeared to Edith. Lucille admits to murdering Edith's father, as well as her own mother when she discovered Lucille and Thomas' sexual relationship. Edith stabs Lucille with her pen and flees, but is confronted by Thomas, who has truly fallen in love with her. He burns the deed and begs his sister to join him and Edith in a new life together, but an enraged Lucille stabs him to death. She pursues Edith with the cleaver she used to kill her mother, but is halted by Thomas' ghost, allowing Edith to kill her with a shovel. Edith silently bids Thomas farewell before he vanishes.\n\nEdith and Alan are rescued by the villagers, and Lucille becomes the ghost of Allerdale Hall, playing her piano for eternity. The end credits imply that Edith has written a novel based on her experiences, titled ''Crimson Peak''.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as Edith Cushing\n** Sofia Wells as young Edith\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Lucille Sharpe\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Thomas Sharpe\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Dr. Alan McMichael\n* [[Jim Beaver]] as Carter Cushing\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Holly\n* [[Leslie Hope]] as Mrs. McMichael, Alan's mother\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as Ogilvie\n* [[Emily Coutts]] as Eunice\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the ghosts of Edith's mother and Lady Sharpe\n* [[Javier Botet]] as the ghosts of Enola Sciotti, Margaret McDermott, and Pamela Upton\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=225px|quote=But basically what it is, is a really, really, almost classical gothic romance ghost story, but then it has two or three scenes that are really, really disturbing in a very, very modern way.

It was sold quietly to Donna Langley at Universal. Del Toro planned to direct the film, but postponed the project to make ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', and then again to work on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' films. Langley suggested that del Toro produce the film for another director, but he could not find one he deemed suitable. While directing ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', del Toro developed a good working relationship with [[Legendary Entertainment]]'s [[Thomas Tull]] and Jon Jashni, who asked what he wanted to do next. Del Toro sent them his screenplays for a film adaptation of ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', a Western adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', and ''Crimson Peak''. The producers deemed the last of these \"the best project for us, just the right size\". Universal allowed del Toro to move the project to Legendary, with the caveat that they could put up money for a stake in the film.<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2012/12/guillermo-del-toro-to-helm-crimson-peak-as-next-feature-with-legendary-pictures/|title=Guillermo Del Toro To Helm 'Crimson Peak' As Next Feature, With Legendary Pictures|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 3, 2012|access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDel Toro called the film a \"ghost story and gothic romance\".

The director intended to make a large-scale horror film in the tradition of those he grew up watching, such as ''[[The Omen]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.
