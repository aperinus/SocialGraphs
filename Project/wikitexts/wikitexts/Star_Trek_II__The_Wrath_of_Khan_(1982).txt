It is the second film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]] following ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979), and is a [[sequel]] to the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original series]] episode \"[[Space Seed]]\" (1967). The plot features Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) and the crew of the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] facing off against the genetically engineered tyrant [[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]). When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on Kirk, the crew of the ''Enterprise'' must stop him from acquiring a powerful [[terraforming]] device named Genesis. The film is the beginning of a three-film [[story arc]] that continues with the film ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' (1984) and concludes with the film ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' (1986).\n\nAfter the lackluster critical response to the first film, series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was forced out of the sequel's production. Executive producer [[Harve Bennett]] wrote the film's original outline, which [[Jack B. Sowards]] developed into a full script. Meyer completed its final script in twelve days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the [[Swashbuckler#Swashbuckler, a fiction and film genre|swashbuckling]] atmosphere of the original series, a theme reinforced by [[James Horner]]'s musical score. Leonard Nimoy had not intended to have a role in the sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production team used various [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]] techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniature models from past projects and reusing sets, effects footage, and costumes from the first film.  The film was the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely with [[computer animation|computer graphics]].\n\n''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' was released in North America on June 4, 1982, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It was a box office success, earning {{US$|97{{spaces}}million}} worldwide and setting a world record for its first-day box office gross. Critical reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan's character, Meyer's direction, improved performances, the film's pacing, and the character interactions as strong elements. Negative reactions focused on weak special effects and some of the acting. ''The Wrath of Khan'' is considered by many to be the best film in the ''Star Trek'' series, and is often credited with renewing substantial interest in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2285, Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] oversees a simulator session of Captain [[Spock]]'s trainees. In the simulation, Lieutenant [[Saavik]] commands the [[starship]] {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|6}} on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'', but is attacked by [[Klingon]] cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a [[No-win situation|no-win scenario]] designed to test the character of [[Starfleet]] officers. Later, Dr. McCoy visits Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits due to his age, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command instead of growing old behind a desk.\n\n{{anchor|Genesis Device}}Meanwhile, the starship ''Reliant'' is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize dead matter into [[terraforming|habitable worlds]]. ''Reliant'''s Captain [[List of Star Trek characters (T\u2013Z)#T|Clark Terrell]] and first officer Commander [[Pavel Chekov]] [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beam down]] to evaluate a planet they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI; once there, they are captured by the genetically engineered tyrant [[Khan Noonien Singh]] explaining that they are on Ceti Alpha V. Fifteen years prior, Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen to Ceti Alpha V after they [[Space Seed|attempted to take over his ship]]. The neighboring planet exploded, devastating the surface of Ceti Alpha V. Khan implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous eel larvae (which killed several of his followers, including his wife) that render them susceptible to mind control, and uses them to capture ''Reliant''. Learning of the Genesis Device, Khan attacks space station ''Regula I'' where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. [[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#M|Carol Marcus]], and their son, [[List of Star Trek characters (G\u2013M)#M|David]].\n\nKirk assumes command of ''Enterprise'' after the ship, deployed on a training cruise, receives a distress call from ''Regula I''. En route, ''Enterprise'' is ambushed and crippled by ''Reliant''. Khan offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis; Kirk instead stalls for time and, taking advantage of Khan's unfamiliarity with starship controls, remotely lowers ''Reliant''{{'}}s [[Shields (Star Trek)|shields]], enabling a counter-attack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while ''Enterprise'' limps to ''Regula I''. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with the slaughtered members of Marcus' team. They soon find Carol and David hiding Genesis deep inside the nearby planetoid. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself, while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body. Khan transports Genesis aboard the ''Reliant'', intending to maroon Kirk on the lifeless planetoid, but is tricked by Kirk and Spock's coded arrangements for a rendezvous. Kirk directs ''Enterprise'' into the nearby Mutara Nebula; conditions inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making ''Enterprise'' and ''Reliant'' evenly matched. Spock notes that Khan's tactics indicate inexperience in three-dimensional combat, which Kirk exploits to disable ''Reliant''.\n\nMortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, quoting Captain Ahab from the novel [[Moby Dick]] as he dies. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time without the ship's inoperable [[warp drive]]. Spock goes to restore warp power in the engine room, which is flooded with radiation. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, Spock incapacitates him with a [[Vulcan nerve pinch]] and performs a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Mind melds|mind meld]], telling him to \"remember\". Spock repairs the warp drive, and ''Enterprise'' jumps to warp, escaping the explosion, which forms a new planet. Before dying of [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]], Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice himself to save the ''Enterprise'' was a logical one. Kirk and the ship's crew host a [[space burial]] for Spock, whose photon torpedo casket lands on the new Genesis planet.<ref name=\"st-plot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/MOV/002/synopsis/82.html|title='Wrath of Khan' Plot summary|website= StarTrek.com |publisher=Viacom|access-date=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314120301/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/MOV/002/synopsis/82.html|archive-date=March 14, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"roth\">{{cite journal | title=Death and Rebirth in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan | author=Roth, Lane | journal=Extrapolation |date=June 1987 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=159\u201366| doi=10.3828/extr.1987.28.2.159 }}</ref><ref name=\"Adaptation\">{{cite book | title=Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text | publisher=Routledge |author1=Cartmell, Deborah |author2=Whelehan, Imelda | author-link=Routledge | year=1999 | location=New York | pages=179\u2013181 | isbn=0-415-16738-8}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s cast includes all the major characters from the original television series, as well as new actors and characters.\n* [[William Shatner]] as [[James T.

The cadet, played by [[Ike Eisenmann]], had many of his lines cut from the original theatrical release, including a scene where it is explained he is Scott's relative. These scenes were reintroduced when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired ''The Wrath of Khan'' on television in 1985, and in the director's edition, making Scott's grief at the crewman's death more understandable.<ref name=\"okuda\">{{cite AV media|people=Okuda, Michael|date=August 6, 2002|title=Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Directors Edition: Commentary|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|medium=DVD; Disc 1/2}}</ref>\n* [[George Takei]] as [[Hikaru Sulu]], the helm officer of the ''Enterprise''.

During filming, Kelley noted that Chekov never met Khan in \"Space Seed\" (Koenig had not yet joined the cast), and thus Khan's recognizing Chekov on Ceti Alpha did not make sense. [[Star Trek canon|Non-canon]] ''Star Trek'' books have attempted to rationalize this discrepancy; in the film's novelization by [[Vonda N. McIntyre]], Chekov is \"an ensign assigned to the night watch\" during \"Space Seed\" and met Khan in an off-screen scene.<ref name=\"jenkins\"/>{{rp|104}} The novel ''[[To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' fixes the error by having Chekov escort Khan to the surface of Ceti Alpha after the events of the television episode. The real cause of the error was a simple oversight by the filmmakers. Meyer defended the mistake by noting that [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] made similar oversights in his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.<ref name=\"meyer\"/> Although they did not appear in the episode together, the ''Star Trek'' timeline indicates that Chekov was a member of the crew at that time.<ref>\"[[Catspaw (Star Trek)|Catspaw]]\", with Chekov, has an earlier [[stardate]] than \"Space Seed\". {{Cite web |url=https://www.grunge.com/32811/false-facts-star-trek-always-thought-true/ |title=False facts about Star Trek you always thought were true |last=Steele |first=Brian |website=Grunge |date=February 20, 2017 |language=en-US |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-date=December 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225041047/https://www.grunge.com/32811/false-facts-star-trek-always-thought-true/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Chekov's screaming while being infested by the Ceti eel caused Koenig to jokingly dub the film ''Star Trek II: Chekov Screams Again'', in reference to a similar screaming scene in ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n* [[Nichelle Nichols]] as [[Uhura]], the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s communications officer.

Meyer had seen Winfield's work in films such as ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'' and thought highly of him; there was no reason for casting him as the ''Reliant''{{'}}s captain other than Meyer's desire to direct him. Meyer thought in retrospect that the Ceti eel scenes might have been corny, but felt that Winfield's performance helped add gravity.<ref name=\"meyer\"/>\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as [[Saavik]], Spock's protege and a Starfleet commander-in-training aboard the ''Enterprise''. Serving on board as the navigator in Chekov's absence, she has a strong habit of questioning Kirk's eccentric heroic methods, preferring a more by-the-book approach. Constantly quoting rules and regulations to Kirk, she is actually vindicated during the battle with Khan, and her manner provides Spock with the idea for how to talk in code to Kirk down at the science lab. When Kirk and McCoy intend to beam down to the science lab, she insists on going with them on the pretext of protecting Kirk. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, \"'Are you going to let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah', and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'\"<ref name=\"meyer\"/> The character's emotional outbursts can be partly explained by the fact that Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-[[Romulan (Star Trek)|Romulan]] heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day.<ref name=\"meyer\"/>\n* [[Judson Scott]] as [[Joachim (Star Trek)|Joachim]], Khan's chief henchman.

After the name change was made, Lucasfilm changed their title from ''Revenge of the Jedi'' to ''[[Return of the Jedi]].'' An even earlier working title for the Trek film was ''The Undiscovered Country'', a title which would eventually be used for the [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|sixth film]] of the franchise.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Staff |title=Khan's 'Vengeance' turns to 'Wrath' |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-060 |magazine=[[Starlog]] |date=July 1982 |page=10 |access-date=November 9, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nMeyer attempted to change the look of ''Star Trek'' to match the nautical atmosphere he envisioned while staying within budget.<ref name=\"cast\"/> The ''Enterprise'', for example, was given a [[ship's bell]], [[boatswain's call]],<ref name=\"robinson\" /> and more blinking lights and signage.<ref name=\"reeves-stevens\"/> Meyer had a \"No Smoking\" sign added to the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s bridge, which he recalled \"Everyone had a fit over [...] I said, 'Why, have they stopped smoking in the future? They've been smoking for four hundred years, you think it's going to stop in the next two?'\"<ref name=\"reeves-stevens\"/> The sign appeared in the first shot of the film, but was removed for all others appearing in the final cut.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nTo save money on set design, production designer Joseph Jennings used existing elements from ''The Motion Picture'' that had been left standing after filming was completed.<ref name=\"robinson\" /> Sixty-five percent of the film was shot on the same set; the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] of the ''Reliant'' and the \"bridge simulator\" from the opening scene were [[Set redress|redresses]] of the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s bridge.<ref name=\"cast\"/> The Klingon bridge from ''The Motion Picture'' was redressed as the Regula I transporter room and the ''Enterprise'''s torpedo bay.<ref name=\"reeves-stevens\"/> The filmmakers stretched ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s budget by reusing models and footage from the first film, including footage of ''Enterprise'' in spacedock.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> The original ship miniatures were used where possible, or modified to stand in as new constructions. The orbital office complex from ''The Motion Picture'' was inverted and retouched to become the Regula I space station.<ref name=\"robinson\" /> Elements of the cancelled ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' television show, such as bulkheads, railings, and sets, were cannibalized and reused.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> A major concern for the designers was that ''Reliant'' should be easily distinguishable from ''Enterprise''. The ship's design was flipped after Bennett accidentally opened and approved the preliminary ''Reliant'' designs upside-down.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n[[File:Starfleet uniform as introduced in The Wrath of Khan (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Uniform example from ''The Wrath of Khan'' on display at [[Star Trek: The Experience]]]]\nDesigner [[Robert Fletcher (costume designer)|Robert Fletcher]] was brought in to redesign existing costumes and create new ones. Fletcher decided on a scheme of \"corrupt colors\", using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color. \"They're not colors you see today, so in a subtle way [they] indicate another time.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> Meyer did not like the [[Starfleet uniforms]] from either the television series or ''The Motion Picture'' and wanted them changed,<ref name=\"dillard-96\"/> but could not be discarded entirely because of the budget. Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well: blue-gray, gold, and dark red. Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background. The resulting naval-inspired designs would be used in ''Star Trek'' films until ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'' (1996). The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars, but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called ''[[Trapunto quilting|trapunto]]''. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> By the time of ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s production, the machines and needles needed to produce ''trapunto'' were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department.<ref name=\"robinson\" /> The crew was so worried about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department's workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\nFor Khan and his followers, Fletcher created a strong contrast with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms; his idea was that the exiles' costumes were made out of whatever they could find.<ref name=\"cast\"/> Fletcher said, \"My intention with Khan was to express the fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship.\"<ref name=\"cast\"/> Khan's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n's physique. Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists, and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> ''The Wrath of Khan'' was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit rather than its theatrical division.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> Bennett, a respected television veteran, made ''The Wrath of Khan'' on a budget of $12&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"nytimes_1986-11-02\"/> The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by the first two weeks of footage.<ref name=\"reeves-stevens\"/> Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at [[Starfleet Academy]], a [[forced perspective]] was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the turbolift doors were closed.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\nThe ''Enterprise'' was refurbished for its space shots, with its shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail added to the frame.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> Compared to the newly built ''Reliant'', the ''Enterprise'' was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> The ''Reliant'', meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The spaceship miniatures were photographed against a blue screen, which in post production allowed them to be composited with background scenery which had itself been photographed independently of the foreground miniatures. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the [[Dykstraflex]], was used for shots of the ''Enterprise'' and other ships.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\nThe barren desert surface of Ceti Alpha V was simulated on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 feet off the ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A [[cyclorama]] was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\nSpock's death was shot over three days, during which no visitors were allowed on set.<ref name=\"meyer\"/> Spock's death was to be irrevocable, but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he asked if he could add a way for Spock to return in a later film. The mind meld sequence was initially filmed without Kelley's prior knowledge of what was going on.<ref name=rioux />{{rp|248}} Shatner disagreed with having a clear glass separation between Spock and Kirk during the death scene; he instead wanted a translucent divider allowing viewers to see only Spock's silhouette, but his objection was overruled. During Spock's funeral sequence Meyer wanted the camera to track the torpedo that served as Spock's coffin as it was placed in a long trough and slid into the launcher. The camera crew thought the entire set would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the shot, but Sallin suggested putting a dolly into the trough and controlling it from above with an offset arm.<ref name=\"cast\"/> Scott's rendition of \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" on the bagpipes was [[James Doohan]]'s idea.<ref name=\"uhura-251\">{{cite book | title=Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories | publisher=GP Putnam's Sons | author=Nichols, Nichelle | year=1994 | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/beyonduhurastart00nich/page/251 251] | isbn=0-399-13993-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/beyonduhurastart00nich/page/251 }}</ref>{{rp|251}}\n\nSpock's death in the film was widely reported during production. \"[[Trekkie]]s\" wrote letters to protest, one paid for [[trade press]] advertisements urging Paramount to change the plot, and Nimoy even received death threats.<ref name=\"anderson19820704\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WV5GAAAAIBAJ&pg=3893,491641 | agency=Copley News Service | title=Trekkies wrath worse than Khan's | work=Newburgh Evening News | date=July 4, 1982 | access-date=May 3, 2011 | author=Anderson, Nancy | pages=14E | archive-date=March 13, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220313122722/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WV5GAAAAIBAJ&pg=3893%2C491641 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"ap19820603\">{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kG8RAAAAIBAJ&pg=2635,627083 | title=Spock dies &mdash; but wait!

Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their [[refresh rate]] did not result in banding on film.<ref name=\"okuda\"/> Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in [[70 mm film|65mm]] or [[VistaVision]] formats to compensate.

The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film's effects from spiraling out of control and driving up costs, as had occurred with ''The Motion Picture''.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> Each special and optical effect, and the duration of the sequences, was listed.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> By the end of six weeks, the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later.<ref name=\"veilleux\" />{{rp|1032}} [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) produced many of the effects, and created the new models; the ''Reliant'' was the first non-''Constitution''-class Federation starship seen in the series. Originally, the ''Reliant'' was conceived as a ''Constitution''-class starship identical to the ''Enterprise'', but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between two alike ships.<ref name=\"robinson\" /> As the script called for the ''Reliant'' and ''Enterprise'' to inflict significant damage on each other, ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models.<ref name=\"robinson\" /> Rather than move the models on a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] during shooting, the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement.<ref name=\"cast\"/> Damage to the ''Enterprise'' was cosmetic, and simulated with pieces of aluminum that were colored or peeled off. Phaser damage was created using [[stop motion]]. The script called for large-scale damage to the ''Reliant'', so larger versions of the ship's model were created to be blown up.<ref name=\"robinson\" />\n\n[[File:S02-battle in the mutara nebula.png|thumb|right|The ''Enterprise'' (left) maneuvers away from the severely damaged ''Reliant'' in the Mutara nebula. The sparks coming off the ''Reliant''{{'s}} nacelle were hand animated, frame by frame.]]\nThe battle in the nebula was a difficult sequence to accomplish without the aid of computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water.<ref name=\"ralston-1052\" /> All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using [[color gel|colored gels]]. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department.<ref name=\"ralston-1052\" /> The ships were combined with the nebula background plates via bluescreen mattes to complete the shot.<ref name=\"cast\"/> The destruction of the ''Reliant''{{'}}s engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.<ref name=\"cast\"/>\n\nThe scene in which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by vaporizing him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the background plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor [[John Vargas]], the recipient of the phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.<ref name=\"veilleux\" />{{rp|1034}}\n\nThe Ceti eel shots used several models, overseen by visual effects supervisor [[Ken Ralston]], who had just finished creature design for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. He tied a string to the eels to inch the models across the actors' faces before they entered the ear canal.<ref name=\"cast\"/> The scene of a more mature eel leaving Chekov's ear was simulated by threading a microfilament through the floor of the set up to Koenig's ear. The scene was filmed with three variations, which Ralston described as \"a dry shot, one with some blood, and the ''[[Fangoria]]'' shot, with a lot of gore.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> Footage of a giant model of Koenig's ear was discarded from the theatrical release due to the visceral reaction it elicited in test audiences.<ref name=\"okuda\"/>\n\nAdditional optical effects were provided by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the ''Enterprise'' reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect.

Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''Star Trek'' television theme. \"The fanfare draws you in immediately \u2014 you know you're going to get a good movie,\" Horner said.<ref name=\"bond\" />{{rp|9}}\n\nIn comparison to the flowing main theme, Khan's [[leitmotif]] was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> The seven-note brass theme was [[echoplex]]ed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until ''Reliant''{{'}}s attack on the ''Enterprise''. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from ''Wolfen'', in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.<ref name=eagle />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\nTo Horner, the \"stuff underneath\" the main story was what needed to be addressed by the score; in ''The Wrath of Khan'', this was the relationship between Kirk and Spock. The main theme serves as Kirk's theme, with a mellower section following that is the theme for the Starship ''Enterprise''.<ref name=\"bond\" />{{rp|8}} Horner also wrote a motif for Spock, to emphasize the character's depth: \"By putting a theme over Spock, it warms him and he becomes three-dimensional rather than a collection of schticks.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\"/> The difference in the short, [[French horn]]-based cues for the villain and longer melodies for the heroes helped to differentiate characters and ships during the battle sequences.<ref name=\"bond\" />{{rp|9}}\n\nThe soundtrack was Horner's first major film score,<ref name=\"post-music\"/> and was written in four and a half weeks.
