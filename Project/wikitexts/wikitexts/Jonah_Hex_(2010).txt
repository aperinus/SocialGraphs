Pictures]]. It was a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]], having grossed only $11&nbsp;million against a budget of $47&nbsp;million. It received generally negative reviews and has a 12% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jonah Hex]] is a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier who refuses an order from his commanding officer [[Quentin Turnbull]] to burn down a hospital.  Hex is forced to kill his best friend Jeb, Turnbull's son, who draws a pistol on Hex.  Turnbull later tracks Hex down at home and takes revenge for Jeb's death by killing Hex's family and branding Hex's face.  Hex is found near-death and healed by the [[Crow people]]; the experience leaves him with the ability to speak to the dead.  Turnbull fakes his death in a hotel fire and Hex, unable to seek revenge, becomes a [[bounty hunter]].\n\nIn 1876, a gang of men led by Turnbull hijack a train carrying components of an experimental weapon invented by [[Eli Whitney]].  [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] realizes that Turnbull is planning to rebuild the weapon and use it attack the U.S. on [[Independence Day (United States)|the Fourth of July]].  Grant instructs Army Lieutenant Grass to find Hex and hire him to track down and stop Turnbull.  Grass' men find Hex in a brothel with a prostitute named Lilah and inform him that Turnbull is still alive.\n\nHex travels to meet Grass at his encampment and uses his ability to interrogate a dead soldier.  The soldier tells Hex to find former Confederate General Slocum, who now runs an illegal fighting pavilion in [[South Carolina]].  Hex confronts Slocum, who refuses to reveal Turnbull's location and sarcastically suggests he ask his dead friend Jeb.  Hex throws Slocum to his death and burns the pavilion down.  He decides to travel to [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] and dig up Jeb's body to ask him for help.  Jeb and Hex briefly fight before Jeb accepts Hex's apology for killing him.  He grudgingly reveals that his father is at Fort Resurrection.  Jeb also warns Hex to avoid death because many in the afterlife have plans for him.\n\nHex confronts Turnbull at the fort and kills several men before he is shot point blank in the chest.  Hex escapes by horse and travels back to find the Crow people.  Turnbull orders a man named Burke, who helped kill Hex's family, to track down something Hex loves and bring it to him.  While Hex is being healed again, Burke finds and kidnaps Lilah.  Turnbull assembles the weapon and conducts a test on a small town in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], completely destroying it.\n\nHex sends a message to Lt. Grass with Turnbull's location and requests backup.  Hex travels to Independence Harbor and infiltrates Turnbull's [[ironclad warship]].  He kills Burke, using his abilities to bring him back from the dead and incinerate him.  Turnbull holds Lilah at gunpoint and forces Hex to surrender. Hex and Lilah escape their holding cell as Lt. Grass arrives and attempts to arrest Turnbull.  Grass and his crew are destroyed by the weapon and Turnbull begins his attack on Washington, D.C.\n\nHex attacks Turnbull, as they fight Hex jams the weapon with a hatchet before locking Turnbull's neck in the machine.  Hex and Lilah escape the boat as the weapon backfires and explodes, killing Turnbull and all of his men.  The next day, President Grant gives Hex a large reward and a full pardon before offering him a job as Sheriff of the entire United States. Hex declines, but assures the president they can find him if they need him; he leaves the city with Lilah. The film ends with Hex visiting Jeb's grave to apologize for his father's death before riding off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Jonah Hex]]: A disfigured [[bounty hunter]] who is the film's [[antihero]] protagonist.<ref name=\"malkovich\" /> Brolin initially hated the script, but changed his mind after growing to like its [[tongue-in-cheek]] tone.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seijas|first=Casey|title=Josh Brolin Declares 'Jonah Hex' Script 'Awful\u2026I Love It,' As Directors Leave Project|work=[[MTV]] Splash Page|date=November 20, 2008|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/11/20/josh-brolin-declares-jonah-hex-script-awfuli-love-it-as-directors-leave-project/|access-date=April 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Quentin Turnbull]]: The main [[antagonist]] who murdered Jonah Hex's family and disfigured the former.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34890/jonah-hex-hexed-with-reshoots |title=Jonah Hex Hexed with Reshoots |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |access-date=January 31, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Megan Fox]] as [[Tallulah Black|Lilah Black]]: A gun-wielding prostitute and Jonah's love interest whose real name is Tallulah Black just like in the comics, but goes by Lilah for short and doesn't have scars on her body or a missing left eye unlike her comics counterpart.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Kit | first=Borys | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iee48bd23f07a5c212caf86dbc16e17a4 | title=Megan Fox lines up two film projects | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=March 3, 2009 | access-date=April 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Burke: A [[bowler hat]]-wearing, tattooed and psychopathic [[Irishman]] who is Turnbull's right-hand man.

Selections were added to scenes in the film by composer [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] (''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]''), and others were adapted for the London Orchestra for exceptionally epic moments. Sanders explained: \"We wrote variations on themes for each character, different variables for a bunch of riffs: faster, slower, heavier, lighter.
