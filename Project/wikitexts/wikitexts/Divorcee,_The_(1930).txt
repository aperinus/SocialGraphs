Jerry's decision to marry Ted crushes Paul. He gets drunk and drives, causing an accident that leaves Dorothy's face disfigured. Out of guilt, Paul marries Dorothy. Ted and Jerry have been married for three years when, on the evening of their third anniversary, she discovers that he has had a brief affair with another woman. Ted tells Jerry it did not \"mean a thing\". Upset, and with Ted away on a business trip, Jerry spends the night with his best friend, Don. Upon Ted's return, she tells him that she \"balanced our accounts\", withholding Don's name.\n\nTed is hypocritically outraged, and they argue, which ends with Ted leaving her and the couple filing for a divorce. While Jerry turns to partying to forget her sorrows, Ted becomes an alcoholic. Paul and Jerry run into each other, and she discovers that he still loves her and is willing to leave Dorothy, with whom he is in a loveless, resentful marriage, to be with her. They two spend weeks together and plan for a future together.\n\nDorothy comes to speak with Jerry at her home but Paul is coincidentally meeting Jerry for dinner and the three meet for an awkward exchange. Despite good arguments from Paul, Dorothy\u2019s desperation to not lose him forces Jerry to reevaluate her decision to leave with Paul. Ultimately, Jerry admits that she regrets giving up on her first marriage. She decides to see if her husband will reconcile, disappointing Paul bitterly a second time.\n\nWeeks later, on her third attempt to locate Ted in Paris, Jerry finally finds him at a New Year's Eve party. After a polite exchange,Ted expresses his regret at how he reacted before the divorce. Jerry tells Ted her true feelings, and the two kiss at midnight to begin the new year, and presumably their new lives, together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Norma Shearer]] as Jerry Martin\n* [[Chester Morris]] as Ted Martin\n* [[Conrad Nagel]] as Paul\n* [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] as Don\n* [[Judith Wood|Helen Johnson]] as Dorothy\n* [[Florence Eldridge]] as Helen Baldwin\n* [[Helene Millard]] as Mary\n* [[Robert Elliott (actor)|Robert Elliott]] as Bill Baldwin\n* [[Mary Doran]] as Janice Meredith\n* [[Tyler Brooke]] as Hank\n* [[Zelda Sears]] as Hannah\n* [[George Irving (American actor)|George Irving]] as Dr. Bernard\n* [[Charles R.
