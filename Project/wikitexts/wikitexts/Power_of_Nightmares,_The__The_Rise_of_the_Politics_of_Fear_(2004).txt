It mainly consists of archive footage, with Curtis narrating. The series was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/cc3b6876ce754703b8db7fe6731a4943|title=The Power of Nightmares: 1/3: Baby It's Cold Outside |date=14 October 2004|work=[[BBC Genome]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> It has subsequently been aired in multiple countries and shown at various film festivals, including the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film compares the rise of the [[Neoconservatism|neoconservative]] movement in the United States and the [[Islamist terrorism|radical]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical [[Islamism]] as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of [[al-Qaeda]], is a myth, or [[noble lie]], perpetrated by leaders of many countries\u2014and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.\u2014in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of [[utopia]]n ideas.\n\n''The Power of Nightmares'' was praised by film critics in Britain and the United States. Its message and content have also been the subject of various critiques and criticisms from [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[progressivism|progressives]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Part 1. \"Baby It's Cold Outside\" ===\nThe first part of the series explains the origins of [[Islamism]] and [[neoconservatism]]. It shows [[Egypt]]ian civil servant [[Sayyid Qutb]], depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in [[Western world|western society]] through [[individualism]]. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by [[westernization|westernisation]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and becomes convinced that in order to save his own society, it must be completely restructured along the lines of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] while still using western [[technology]]. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite \"vanguard\" to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is [[Death penalty|executed]] in 1966, but he influences [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the future mentor of [[Osama bin Laden]], to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the [[1979 Iranian revolution]], Zawahiri and his allies [[Assassination|assassinate]] Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by [[jahiliyyah]] and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime and replace it with a 'pure' Islamist state.\n\nAt the same time in the [[United States]], a group of disillusioned liberals, including [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], look to the political thinking of [[Leo Strauss]] after the perceived failure of [[Lyndon Johnson|President Johnson's]] \"[[Great Society]]\". They conclude that an emphasis on individual liberty was the undoing of Johnson's plans. They envisioned restructuring America by uniting the American people against a common evil, and set about creating a mythical enemy. These factions, the neoconservatives, came to power during the 1980s under the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, with their allies [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. They alleged that the Soviet Union was not following the terms of a disarmament treaty between the two countries, and together with the outcomes of \"[[Team B]]\", they built a case using dubious evidence and methods to prove it to Ronald Reagan.\n\n=== Part 2. \"The Phantom Victory\" ===\nIn the second part, Islamist factions, rapidly falling under the more radical influence of Zawahiri and his rich [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] acolyte [[Osama bin Laden]], join the neoconservative-influenced Reagan administration to combat the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union's invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]]. When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the [[Eastern Bloc]] [[Revolutions of 1989|begins to collapse]] in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's demise]]. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and [[Algeria]]. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way to hang on to power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.\n\nIn America, neoconservative aspirations to use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of [[George H. W. Bush]] to the [[President of the United States|presidency]], followed by the election in 1992 of [[Bill Clinton]] which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of [[Afghanistan]] and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.\n\n=== Part 3. \"The Shadows in the Cave\" ===\n[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|200px|The neoconservatives use the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]], with al-Fadl's description of al-Qaeda, to launch the [[War on Terror]].]]\nThe final part addresses the actual rise of [[al-Qaeda]]. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri had little or no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for [[jihad]]. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, [[Jamal al-Fadl]], and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called \"al-Qaeda\". With the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], neoconservatives in the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administration of [[George W. Bush]] use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch of the [[War on Terror]].\n\nAfter the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|American invasion of Afghanistan]] fails to uproot the alleged terrorist organisation, the Bush administration focuses inwards, searching unsuccessfully for terrorist [[sleeper cell]]s in America. In 2003, they extend the War on Terror to a war on general perceived evils with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. The ideas and tactics also spread to the United Kingdom, where [[Tony Blair]] uses the threat of terrorism to give him a new [[moral authority]]. The repercussions of the neoconservative strategy are also explored, with an investigation of indefinitely-detained terrorist suspects in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], many allegedly taken on the word of the anti-[[Taliban]] [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] without actual investigation on the part of the United States military, and other forms of \"[[Preemptive war|preemption]]\" against non-existent and unlikely threats made simply on the grounds that the parties involved had the potential to become a threat. Curtis specifically attempts to allay fears of a [[dirty bomb]] attack, and concludes by reassuring viewers that politicians will eventually have to concede that some threats are exaggerated and others have no foundation in reality. He says, \"In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.\"\n\n==Contributors==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[John Calvert (scholar)|John Calvert]], historian of Islamism\n* Prof. [[Harvey Mansfield]], Straussian philosopher, [[Harvard University]]\n* Prof. [[Stanley Rosen]], pupil of [[Leo Strauss]], 1949\n* [[Azzam Tamimi|Dr Azzam Tamimi]], Institute of Islamic Political Thought\n* General Fouad Allam, interrogator, Interior Ministry 1958\u201387\n* Roxanne Euben, political scientist\n* [[Irving Kristol]], American journalist\n* [[William Kristol]], Chief of Staff to the Vice President 1988\u201392\n* Prof. [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]], political philosopher\n* [[Henry Kissinger]] (interviewed 1975)\n* [[Melvin Goodman]], Head of Office, Soviet Affairs, CIA 1976\u201387\n* Prof. [[Richard Pipes]], adviser to President Reagan 1980\u201383\n* [[Anne Hessing Cahn|Dr Anne Cahn]], [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] 1977\u201380\n* Omar Azzam, cousin of [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], Egyptian al-Qaeda leader\n* [[Kamal Habib|Dr Kamal Habib]], founder member of Islamic Jihad\n* [[Gilles Kepel]], historian of Islamist Movement\n* [[Paul Weyrich]], religious activist; member of Republican Party\n* [[Michael Ledeen]], Special Adviser to the US Secretary of State 1981\u201382\n* [[John P.

[[Jason Burke]], author of ''[[Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror]]'', comments in ''The Shadows in the Cave'' on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives [[William Kristol|William]] and [[Irving Kristol]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[Richard Perle]] and [[Michael Ledeen]] are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's [[Azzam Tamimi]], political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist [[Abdullah Anas]].\n\nThe film's soundtrack includes at least two pieces of music from the films of [[John Carpenter]], who Curtis credited as inspiration for his soundtrack arrangement techniques,<ref name=\"GC\"/> as well as tracks from [[Brian Eno]]'s ''[[Another Green World]]''.
