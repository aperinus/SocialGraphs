When Drake returns to retrieve her keys, she is attacked by the school's football coach, Joe Willis. Drama teacher Mrs. Olson emotionlessly stabs Drake with scissors as she flees the school.\n\nThe following morning, the students arrive, including Casey Connor, the dedicated but perpetually harassed photographer for the school newspaper. Casey is the unappreciated assistant to spiteful Delilah Profitt, the paper's editor-in-chief and head cheerleader. Delilah's mistreated boyfriend Stan Rosado is contemplating quitting the football team to pursue academics. Zeke Tyler is an intelligent yet rebellious student repeating his senior year. Zeke sells, among other illegal items, a powdery [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-like drug he manufactures and distributes. He is confronted by teacher Elizabeth Burke, who expresses concern for him over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student Marybeth Louise Hutchinson befriends self-styled outcast Stokely Mitchell, who has deliberately spread rumors that she is a lesbian though she has a crush on Stan. Marybeth develops a crush on Zeke which is reciprocated.\n\nCasey finds a strange creature on the football field and takes it to science teacher Mr. Furlong, who believes it is a new species of [[cephalopod]]-specific parasite called a [[mesozoan]]. Delilah and Casey hide in the teacher's lounge to find a story. They witness Coach Willis and Ms. Olson forcing one of the parasites into the ear of the school nurse. They also find the body of another teacher, Mrs. Brummel. Casey and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police, but his claims are dismissed.\n\nThe next day, Casey tells Delilah, Stan, and Stokely he believes the teachers are being controlled by aliens. After Zeke and Marybeth tease them about their theory, Mr. Furlong attempts to infect them. Zeke injects his homemade drugs into Furlong's eye, killing him. Zeke takes the five to his house, where he experiments on a specimen retrieved by Casey. He discovers it needs water to survive and can be killed by his drugs. Zeke makes everyone take his drug to prove they are uninfected. Delilah is revealed as infected and she destroys Zeke's lab and most of his drug supply before escaping.\n\nActing on Stokely's speculation that killing the alien queen will revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their football team is playing and infecting opposing players. Believing Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and fatally shoot her. Stan confronts the coach and team to see if the plan worked, but becomes infected himself. Zeke and Casey retrieve more of Zeke's drugs from his car. Casey leads infected students away from Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and incapacitates her.\n\nAt the gym, Marybeth reveals herself to be the alien queen; earlier on, she faked taking the drug. Casey and Stokely flee to the swimming pool, where Stokely is injured and becomes infected. Zeke and Casey hide in the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise. She explains she is taking over Earth because her planet is dying. Marybeth transforms back into her true form and hurls Zeke across the room into the lockers, knocking him out. Casey seizes the drug and traps the queen behind retracting bleachers. He stabs the drug into the queen's eye. Casey returns to the locker room and finds Stokely and Zeke alive.\n\nOne month later, everyone returned to normal. Stan and Stokely, who has shed her Goth girl image, are now dating. Zeke has taken Stan's place on the football team, while Miss Burke affectionately watches him practice. Delilah, no longer vindictive, is now dating Casey, who is considered a local hero as various news media reveal the attempted alien invasion is now public knowledge, even as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] denies it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jordana Brewster]] as Delilah Profitt\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Stokely \"Stokes\" Mitchell\n* [[Laura Harris]] as Marybeth Louise Hutchinson\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Zeke Tyler\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Stan Rosado\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Rosa Harper\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Elizabeth Burke\n* [[Piper Laurie]] as Karen Olson\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Frank Connor\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Valerie Drake\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Joe Willis\n* [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]] as Gabe Santora\n* [[Jon Stewart]] as Edward Furlong\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as John Tate\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Casey Connor\n* [[Summer Phoenix]] as \"F*%# You\" girl\n* [[Jon Abrahams]] as \"F*%# You\" boy\n* [[Susan Willis]] as Jessica Brummel\n* Pete Janssen as Eddie \"Meat\" McIvey\n* Tina Rodriguez as tattoo girl\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as F*%# up #1\n* [[Wiley Wiggins]] as F*%# up #2\n* [[Harry Jay Knowles|Harry Knowles]] as Mr. Knowles\n* [[Louis Black]] as Mr. Louis\n* [[Eric Jungmann]] as freshman\n* [[Libby Villari]] as Mrs. Connor\n* [[Duane Martin]] as police officer #1\n* [[Katherine Willis]] as police officer #2\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1990, David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel wrote their first draft of the script and sent it out, but there were no buyers.

It's smart without ever taking itself too seriously and campy without ever losing its cool, drawing proudly from the tradition of classic alien invasion movies and casting them in the 90s teen tradition.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/90s-teen-horror-movies-ranked/#scream|title=The Most Iconic 90s Teen Horror Movies, Ranked|date=October 20, 2019|website=Collider}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe film has been praised for its portrayal of teenage [[Alienation from human society|alienation]], especially within the high school environment and its system of [[clique]]s and [[Role|social roles]].{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|p=175}}{{sfnp|Sherman|2014|p=132}} In particular, the alien invasion through parasitized bodies has been recognized as functioning as a metaphor for those concepts, reflecting the fear of losing one's nascent [[individuality]] to a crowd.{{sfnp|Sherman|2014|p=132}}{{sfnp|West|2018|pp=111\u2013112}} The alien queen encapsulates this by offering the heroes a world without alienation or differences, in which \"everything that is both wonderful and awful about being a teenager is done away in favor of blind allegiance\".{{sfnp|West|2018|p=111}}\n\nExperts also noted in ''The Faculty'' a reinvention of the fear of [[female sexuality]] often found in the [[horror genre]].{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|pp=173, 175}}{{sfnp|Ferrimond|2017}} The character of Marybeth, the alien queen, is \"a complex imbrication of woman, alien and power\" that acts beyond the role of [[femme fatale]].{{sfnp|Ferrimond|2017}} She masquerades as a virginal, unassuming girl clad in floral dresses, but at the final battle she reveals her true sexual threat, becoming [[Nudity|nude]] by her alien transformation and turning confident and flirtatious.{{sfnp|Ferrimond|2017}} Her role as a threatening, [[Castration|castrating]] agent is underlined by the sharp teeth of her species, which evoke a [[vagina dentata]], and their association to water, the archaic, womb-like female element.{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|p=178}} As the [[Archaic mother|monstrous mother]] of her race, she tries to seduce the heroes by offering them a symbolic return to the womb.{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|p=183}} As Sharon Packer and Jody Pennington put it:\n\n<blockquote>The image on the screen is dual: we see the beautiful, young, naked Marybeth strolling around looking for Casey, and the shadow of the monstrous form in the walls. Marybeth delivers a speech which ties the elements of the movie together. It is about the \"world\" she came from and its promises of \"[[paradise]]\" for lost and lonely humans, trapped in high-school \"[[hell]]\".{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|p=182}}</blockquote>\n\nThe character of Miss Burke precedes Marybeth in the same line, revealing her hidden sexuality only after being infected and turned into a monster. The scene of her detached, tentacled head in particular echoes the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Medusa's Head|Medusa head]].{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|pp=179\u2013180}}{{sfnp|Ferrimond|2017}} The [[monstrous feminine]] is therefore used in the film to reflect the teenage characters entering adult world, where they are forced to \"come to terms with female sexuality and overcome their fear of its 'monstrous' aspects in order to become fully functioning adults\".{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington|2014|p=183}} Casey, the male character closest to his softer, feminine side, is the final hero of the film.{{sfnp|Packer|Pennington |2014|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for a total of eight awards, including an [[ALMA Award]] for director [[Robert Rodriguez]], 2 [[Saturn Awards]], 2 [[Blockbuster Entertainment Awards]] and 3 [[Teen Choice Awards]], but did not win any.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:93%;\"\n|-\n!
