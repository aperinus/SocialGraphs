The story centers on the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]], a [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] [[jazz]] club in the 1930s. The film stars [[Richard Gere]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Diane Lane]] and [[Lonette McKee]], with [[Bob Hoskins]], [[James Remar]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Allen Garfield]], [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Fred Gwynne]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was noted for its over-budget production costs, and took a total of five years to make. Despite being a [[Box-Office Bomb|disappointment at the box-office]], the film received generally positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including [[Golden Globe]]s for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] ([[Richard Sylbert]], [[George Gaines (set decorator)|George Gaines]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].<ref>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1985 1985|Oscars.org]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA musician named Dixie Dwyer begins working with [[mobster]]s to advance his career but falls in love with Vera Cicero, the girlfriend of [[Jewish-American organized crime]] [[Crime boss|kingpin]] [[Dutch Schultz]].\n\nA dancer from Dixie's neighborhood, Sandman Williams, is hired with his brother by The Cotton Club, a jazz club where most of the performers are black and the customers are white. [[Owney Madden]], the boss of the [[Hell's Kitchen]] [[Irish mob]], owns the club and runs it with his right-hand man, Frenchy DeMange.\n\nDixie becomes a Hollywood film star, thanks to the help of Madden and the mob but angering Schultz. He also continues to see Schultz's [[gun moll]], Vera Cicero, whose new nightclub has been financed by the jealous gangster.\n\nIn the meantime, Dixie's ambitious younger brother Vincent becomes an enforcer for Schultz's crew and eventually a public enemy, holding Frenchy as a hostage.\n\nSandman alienates his brother Clay at The Cotton Club by agreeing to perform a solo number there. While the club's management interferes with Sandman's romantic interest in Lila, a singer, its cruel treatment of the performers leads to an intervention by Harlem criminal 'Bumpy' Rhodes on their behalf.\n\nDutch Schultz is violently dealt with by Madden's men while Dixie and Sandman perform on The Cotton Club's stage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Michael \"Dixie\" Dwyer\n* [[Gregory Hines]] as Delbert \"Sandman\" Williams\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Vera Cicero\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as Lila Rose Oliver\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Owney Madden]]\n* [[James Remar]] as [[Dutch Schultz]]\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll|Vincent Dwyer]]\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as [[Abbadabba Berman|Otto Berman]]\n* [[Fred Gwynne]] as Frenchy Demange\n* [[Gwen Verdon]] as Tish Dwyer\n* [[Lisa Jane Persky]] as Frances Flegenheimer\n* [[Maurice Hines]] as Clayton \"Clay\" Williams\n* [[Julian Beck]] as Sol Weinstein\n* [[Joe Dallesandro]] as [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]] as Bumpy Rhodes\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Irving Starck\n* [[John P.

On December 12, 1980, it was announced that Evans and [[Paramount Pictures]] would serve as co-producers of the film while [[Robert Altman]] would direct and [[Mario Puzo]] would write. However, Evans and Altman's film ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' premiering that day became a box-office flop. Although Evans secured $12 million worth of financing from Saudi arms dealer [[Adnan Khashoggi]], Paramount Pictures withdrew from the film in 1981. Evans worked to secure sole ownership of the [[film negative]] to recoup his losses from recent poor stock-market investments and a cocaine trafficking arrest. However, this action alienated potential investors who would be unable to profit from television and home video distribution rights. The production was finally delayed when Evans reached a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]] to produce an [[advertising campaign]] of anti-drug [[public service announcement]]s in exchange for an expungement of his record.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=The Cotton Club|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/57065|url-status=live|access-date=2021-11-11|website=AFI Catalog}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 Evans, who intended to direct the film himself after Altman departed, hired [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] to re-write [[Mario Puzo]]'s story and screenplay. Evans eventually decided that he did not want to direct the film and asked Coppola at the last minute.<ref name=\"harmetz\" /> Evans and Coppola had an adversarial relationship from the production of the [[The Godfather (film series)|''Godfather'' films]] but Coppola accepted the jobs as screenwriter and then director because he needed the money&nbsp;\u2013 he was deeply in debt from making ''One from the Heart'' with his own money and his studio Zoetrope Studios went [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"gussow\">{{cite news|last=Gussow|first=Michael|date=March 22, 1984|title=Parting Film Shots: Coppola and Dutch|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>  Richard Sylbert said that he told Evans not to hire Coppola because \"he resents being in the commercial, narrative, Hollywood movie business\".<ref name=\"kroll\">{{cite news | last = Kroll | first = Jack | title = Harlem on My Mind | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = December 24, 1984 }}</ref> Coppola said that he had letters from Sylbert asking him to work on the film because Evans was crazy. Coppola also said that \"Evans set the tone for the level of extravagance long before I got there\".<ref name=\"kroll\" />\n\nBy the time Evans decided not to direct and brought in Coppola, at least $13 million had already been committed.<ref name=\"kroll\" />  [[Las Vegas]] casino owners Edward and Fred Doumani put $30 million into the film in exchange for a fifty-percent ownership stake in the film. Evans received further loans by mortgaging his mansion in Beverley Hills and stock in [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf + Western]] as collateral.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other financial backers included Arab arms dealer [[Adnan Khashoggi]], and vaudeville promoter [[Roy Radin]], who was murdered in May 1983. The killers later alleged that [[Contract killing|they had been hired]] by Evans and Radin's girlfriend Karen Greenberger, a [[drug dealer]] who felt she was cut out of profits from the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/ten-billionaires-stung-hollywood/|title=Ten Billionaires Who Were Stung by Hollywood|date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> In the 1989 \"''Cotton Club'' Trial\" Evans invoked his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right against self-incrimination and refused to testify.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]] in an interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', the budget of the film was $47 million. However, Coppola told the head of [[Gaumont Film Company]], Europe's largest distribution and production company, that he thought the film might cost $65 million.<ref name=\"scott\" />\n\nEvans cast [[Al Pacino]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], and [[Harrison Ford]] to portray Dixie Dwyer before Gere was hired.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Richard Pryor]] was considered for the role of Sandman Williams.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Richard Pryor|date=1 September 2011|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-richard-pryor/|access-date=18 April 2016}}</ref> Robert Evans wanted to cast his friend [[Alain Delon]] in a two-scene role as [[Lucky Luciano]] but this did not occur.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hollywood: French actor Delon will play Lucky role|author=Beck, Marilyn|work=Chicago Tribune|date=Sep 3, 1982|page=c5}}</ref> The  role of Luciano was instead portrayed by [[Joe Dallesandro]], starting the dramatic film career for the former [[Warhol superstars|Warhol Superstar]].\n\nAuthor [[Mario Puzo]] was the original screenwriter and was eventually replaced by William Kennedy,<ref name=\"gussow\" /> who wrote a rehearsal script in eight days which the cast used for three weeks prior to shooting. According to actor [[Gregory Hines]], a three-hour film was shot during rehearsals.<ref name=\"scott\" /> From July 15 to August 22, 1983, twelve scripts were produced, including five during one 48-hour non-stop weekend. Kennedy estimates that between 30 and 40 scripts were turned out.<ref name= \"scott\"/> Production began on August 22, 1983, at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Over 600 people built sets, created costumes and arranged music at a reported $250,000 a day.<ref name=\"scott\" /> During the production many crew members were abruptly fired. Within several weeks the film was already over budget, allowing Evans to deduct from the $4 million salary of Coppola, who had not yet been fully paid because the script was still being rewritten and thus incomplete. Coppola reacted by walking off set and refusing to continue directing the film until he was fully paid.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs costs on the film continued to rise, the Doumani brothers convinced Orion Pictures to advance costs for the film on the condition that Evans step down as producer and hired mobster Joseph Cusamano to intimidate Evans into giving up his share of the partnership. Evans initially agreed but stopped them by filing a [[restraining order]] against them after learning Sayyah was not involved in the deal.<ref name=\":0\" /> On June 7, 1984, Sayyah filed a lawsuit against the Doumani brothers, their lawyer David Hurwitz, Evans and [[Orion Pictures]] for fraud and breach of contract.<ref name= \"harmetz\">{{cite news | last = Harmetz | first = Aljean | title = ''Cotton Club'' Investor Sues Partners in Film | work = [[New York Times]] | date = June 10, 1984 }}</ref> Sayyah invested $5 million and said that he had little chance of recouping his money because the budget escalated from $25 to $58 million. He accused the Doumanis of forcing out Evans and said that an Orion loan to the film of $15 million unnecessarily increased the budget. Evans, in turn, sued Edward Doumani to keep from acting as general partner on the film.<ref name= \"harmetz\"/> The court ruled in favor of Evans but also gave Coppola's close associate [[Barrie M. Osborne]] full control over [[post-production]], essentially barring Evans from the completion of the film. Sayyah and the Doumani brothers would also be uncredited as producers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Music==\n[[The Cotton Club (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] for the film was written by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].
