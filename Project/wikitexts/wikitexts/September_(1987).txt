The film is modeled on [[Anton Chekhov]]'s 1899 play ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', though the gender roles are often subverted.<ref>{{cite web| author=Carol Rocamora.| url=http://www.broadstreetreview.com/index.php/main/article/taking_liberties_with_chekhov| title=Taking liberties with Chekhov| work=The Broad Street Review| date=June 6, 2011| access-date=June 22, 2015| archive-date=October 16, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016040639/http://www.broadstreetreview.com/index.php/main/article/taking_liberties_with_chekhov| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAllen's intention for'' September'' was that it be like \"a play on film,\" hence the great number of long takes and few camera effects. The film does not use Allen as an actor, and is one of his straightforwardly dramatic films. The cast includes [[Mia Farrow]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Jack Warden]], and [[Denholm Elliott]].\n\nCritical response to ''September'' was generally lukewarm.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a [[suicide attempt]], Lane has moved into her country house to recuperate in [[Vermont]]. Her best friend, Stephanie, has come to join her for the summer to have some time away from her husband. Lane's brassy, tactless mother, Diane, has recently arrived with her physicist husband Lloyd, Lane's stepfather. Lane is close to two neighbors: Peter, a struggling writer, and Howard, a French teacher. Howard is in love with Lane, Lane is in love with Peter, and Peter is in love with Stephanie.\n\nDiane, once a well-known actress, wants Peter to write her biography, primarily because, many years earlier, a teenage Lane supposedly shot her mother's abusive lover. Lane does not want this painful event to go back in the spotlight, but Peter thinks it would make a great story.\n\nOne evening, Diane decides to host a party, ruining Lane's plans with Peter. Peter arrives early and confesses to Stephanie that he has wanted to be alone with her for a long time. Outside, there is an electrical storm, and the lights go out. Candles and piano music create a romantic setting. Diane finds her old [[Ouija]] board and talks to the spirits of her previous lovers. A very drunk Howard finally reveals his feelings to Lane, who does not return them. Peter tells Lane that he does not share her feelings. Lane seems to take the rejection well. When everyone else has gone to bed, Peter tries seducing Stephanie, but she is conflicted, later following him back to his house.\n\nThe next morning, a real estate agent is showing a couple around the house; Lane is counting on the money from the sale to move back to New York. Lane is feeling depressed: she has not taken Peter's rejection well after all, exacerbating Stephanie's guilt. Soon after, Peter arrives and kisses Stephanie, just as Lane opens the door to show the room to prospective buyers, and Lane is shocked. Stephanie insists that it meant nothing, while Peter tells Lane that the two of them have deep feelings for each other. Diane comes downstairs, announcing that she and her husband are going to move into the house permanently. Lane becomes even more distraught, insisting that Diane gave Lane the property a long time ago. Diane dismisses it as one of her own drunken whims. Lane experiences a breakdown, accusing her mother of being fake and insensitive.\n\nThe film's climax comes when an anguished Lane cries, \"You're the one who pulled the trigger! I just said what the lawyers told me to say\", thus revealing that Diane was actually the one who shot her abusive lover. Presumably Diane's lawyers thought it would be better if Lane took the fall, as she would be treated leniently. The ordeal has obviously been hugely detrimental to Lane. Diane finally concedes that if she could go back, she would behave differently.\n\nEveryone leaves except Stephanie and Lane. The film ends with Stephanie encouraging Lane to move on and \"keep busy\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Denholm Elliott]] as Howard\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Stephanie\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Lane\n* [[Elaine Stritch]] as Diane\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as Peter\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Lloyd\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as Mrs. Mason\n* Ira Wheeler as Mr. Raines\n* Jane Cecil as Mrs. Raines\n}}\n\n==Filming==\nAllen shot the film twice. It originally starred [[Sam Shepard]] as Peter (after [[Christopher Walken]] shot a few scenes, but was determined not to be right for the role), [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as Diane, and [[Charles Durning]] as Howard. After editing the film he decided to rewrite it, recast it, and reshoot it. He has since stated he would like to redo it again.<ref>{{cite web| author=Eric Lax.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/september.html| title=For Woody Allen, 60 Days Hath 'September'| work=The New York Times| date=December 6, 1987| access-date=June 22, 2015| archive-date=March 28, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328100032/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/02/23/reviews/september.html| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''September'' has a 63% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 16 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/september_1987/|title=September (1987)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=September 24, 2021|archive-date=September 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210930080929/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/september_1987|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{div col|colwidth=48em}}\n* On a Slow Boat to China - By [[Frank Loesser]] - Performed by [[Bernie Leighton]]\n* Out of Nowhere - By [[Johnny Green]] & [[Edward Heyman]] - Performed by [[Bert Ambrose]] and His Orchestra\n* Just One More Chance - By [[Sam Coslow]] & [[Arthur Johnston (composer)|Arthur Johnston]] - Performed by Bert Ambrose and His Orchestra\n* My Ideal - By [[Leo Robin]], [[Richard A.
