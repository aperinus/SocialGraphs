Retrieved 17 November 2010</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Two Weeks Notice''''' is a 2002 American [[romantic comedy]] film written and directed by [[Marc Lawrence (filmmaker)|Marc Lawrence]] and starring [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Sandra Bullock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/two-weeks-notice-v271086|title=Two Weeks Notice (2002) - Marc Lawrence - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|website=AllMovie|access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref> Although critical response was mixed, the film was successful at the box office.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Childs Boardwalk Long Shot.JPG|thumb|The \"Coney Island community center\" Lucy wants to preserve was actually [[Childs Restaurants (Riegelmann Boardwalk location)|a Childs Restaurant at West 21st Street]]. It was declared a [[New York Landmark]] a month after this film's premiere. It closed later (this is a 2013 picture) and, after renovation, is part of the [[Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island]].]]\n\nLucy Kelson is an intelligent, highly competent [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[lawyer]] who specializes in historic preservation, environmental law, and [[pro bono]] causes in [[New York City]]. George Wade is an arrogant, needy billionaire [[real estate]] developer and stylish womanizing playboy, who is also quite na\u00efve. Lucy's hard work and devotion to others contrasts sharply with George's childish recklessness and greed.\n\nLucy meets George in an attempt to stop the destruction of the [[Coney Island]] [[community center]] from her childhood. Discovering she graduated from prestigious [[Harvard]] law school, he offers to hire her to replace his old Chief Counsel, overlooking their opposing views of real estate development. She decides the benefits he offers for discretionary funding for community causes she espouses outweighs the negatives, especially as he promises to protect the community center.\n\nSoon, she finds what he really requires is advice in all aspects of his life. She regretfully becomes his indispensable assistant, and he calls her for every little thing at all hours. At a friend's wedding, her cell phone loudly rings and disrupts the proceedings before she responds to his urgent page. When she discovers the \"emergency\" he needs her advice on is his attire to an important event, she gives him her two weeks' notice of [[resignation]]. Yet, her departure is not so easy.\n\nLucy looks for work at other firms, but everyone says no because George has called in advance asking them not to hire her, so he can keep her on. Eventually, he gives in, and she offers to help him find a replacement, but unaware of how close and interdependent they have become. They act like an old married couple at a restaurant, able to simultaneously carry out a conversation while involuntarily exchanging food out of habit from knowing each other's food preferences.\n\nWhen potential interviewee June Carver shows up without an appointment seeking the position, Lucy speaks to her, but is concerned June lacks real estate experience. When George sees June he is immediately attracted and is ready to hire her on the spot, with seemingly disregards Lucy's concerns. Rather than look the other way and let her soon-to-be-former boss deal with the foolishness of his sexist hiring practices, Lucy instead becomes increasingly concerned and competitive with her replacement. When George invites June to business social events that formerly would be just between George and Lucy, Lucy increasingly perceives the business events to be more like dates, and is surprised June is intruding on them.\n\nLucy finds out despite George's promise, the community center is going to be knocked down and challenges him on his apparent betrayal.  She arrives at his hotel to confront him and finds June and George in his apartment in lingerie during a game of \"strip chess\". George confronts her the next day, her last day, where Lucy reminds him he promised her to spare the community center.  Lucy leaves after George accuses her of being a saint, making everyone else look bad because they are humans who make mistakes.\n\nAfter she is gone, George realizes his time with her has demonstrated he needs to change. Meanwhile, in her new job, Lucy finds she misses him. He goes in search for her and reveals he decided to keep his promise to her. Lucy initially rebuffs him but then returns and they declare their feelings. George reveals he resigned.\n\nIn the DVD version of the film, an unreleased wedding scene of George and Lucy was featured. George and Lucy were married at the community center attended by family and friends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as George Wade\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Lucy Kelson\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as June Carver\n* [[Francie Swift]] as Lauren Wade\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Ruth Kelson\n* [[Robert Klein]] as Larry Kelson\n* [[Jason Antoon]] as Norman\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Meryl Brooks\n* [[David Haig]] as Howard Wade\n* [[Dorian Missick]] as Tony\n* [[Joseph Badalucco Jr.]] as Joseph Badalucco\n* [[Jonathan Dokuchitz]] as Tom Brooks\n* [[Sharon Wilkins]] as Polly St. Clair\n* [[Bill Bowers]] as Mime\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as RV Man\n* [[Veanne Cox]] as Melanie Corman\n* Janine LaManna as Elaine Cominsky\n* Iraida Polanco as Rosario\n* Charlotte Maier as Helen Wade\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as Tiffany\n* [[Donald Trump]] as himself\n* [[Norah Jones]] as herself\n* [[Mike Piazza]] as himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production == \nDirector [[Marc Lawrence (filmmaker)|Marc Lawrence]] suffered headaches, sinus infections, a [[root canal]], and a slipped disc, while making the film. Lawrence previously wrote the films ''[[Forces of Nature (1999 film)|Forces of Nature]]'' and ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'', which starred Bullock, and it was on the latter film where he asked her to look at his unfinished script. Bullock liked it enough to star in and produce the film. Grant was first choice for the part, he and Bullock had already wanted to work together. Lawrence hoped the film would be different enough for Grant, not the same as his ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' character, but not as unpleasant as his ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' character.<ref>{{cite web |title=Two Weeks Notice |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/08/19/two-weeks-notice/ |website=EW }}</ref> Filming took place in [[New York City]], and was noted as the first Hollywood production to take place after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@brianrowe_70270/the-sandra-bullock-files-33-two-weeks-notice-2002-5f1c4f0b50d2|title = The Sandra Bullock Files #33: Two Weeks Notice (2002)|date = 9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened at number 2 at the U.S. Box office, earning [[USD]]14,328,494 in its opening weekend, behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.
