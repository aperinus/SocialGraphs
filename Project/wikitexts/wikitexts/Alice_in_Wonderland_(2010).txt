The film stars [[Mia Wasikowska]] in [[Alice (Disney)|the title role]], with [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Crispin Glover]], and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], while featuring the voices of [[Alan Rickman]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Timothy Spall]]. A [[Live-action|live-action adaptation]] and [[re-imagining]] of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s works, the film follows [[Alice (Disney)|Alice Kingsleigh]], a nineteen-year-old who accidentally falls down a rabbit hole, returns to Underland and alongside the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]], helps restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to her throne by fighting against the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] and her [[Jabberwock]], a [[dragon]] that terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.\n\n''Alice in Wonderland'' came under development in December 2007, when Burton was asked to direct two 3D films for Disney, including [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|the remake]] of ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. Production began in September 2008 and concluded within three months, and was shot in the United Kingdom and the United States. It was followed by an extensive pre-production and visual effects process, where filming included [[Live action|live-action]] and [[motion capture]] sequences. The film premiered in London at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on February 25, 2010, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States through the [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] formats as well as in conventional theaters on March 5, 2010.\n\n''Alice in Wonderland'' received mixed reviews upon release; although praised for its visual style, costumes, musical score, performances and special effects, the film was criticized for its lack of narrative coherence. The film generated over $1.025&nbsp;billion in ticket sales and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film]] during its theatrical run, and it is also the [[2010 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2010]].<ref name=\"Time\">Corliss, Richard (May 13, 2012).

She receives an unwanted marriage proposal from Hamish Ascot at his father's garden party, where she spots a familiar white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and carrying a [[pocket watch]]. She follows it down a rabbit hole and [[Resizing (fiction)|shrinks]] after drinking from a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' (called Pishsalver), allowing her to enter the forest of a fantastical place called Underland. There she is greeted by the [[White Rabbit]], a [[the Dormouse|Dormouse]], a [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]], [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Talking Flowers]], and identical twins [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]], who all apparently know her.\n\nAlice asserts that she is dreaming, but learns from [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Caterpillar]] that she is destined to slay the [[Jabberwocky]] and end the tyranny of the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]]. The group is ambushed by the ravenous [[Bandersnatch]] and the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Playing Cards|Red Queen's knights]], led by the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]]. All are captured except Alice, who escapes, and the Dormouse, who takes one of the Bandersnatch's eyes. The Knave informs the Red Queen of Alice's return and he is ordered to find her immediately.\n\nThe [[Cheshire Cat]] guides Alice to the [[Tarrant Hightopp|Mad Hatter]], the [[March Hare]], and the Dormouse's tea party. The Hatter explains that the Red Queen took over Underland, usurping her sister the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]], and that he joined the resistance after she destroyed his village and killed his family. The red knights seize the party and the Hatter saves Alice from capture by allowing himself to be seized. Alice is found by the Knave's [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bloodhound]] who is allied with the resistance, who takes Alice to the Red Queen's castle, where she grows taller after eating a cake labeled 'Eat Me' (called Upelkuchen), infiltrating the castle as a courtier named \"Um\".\n\nAlice learns that the [[vorpal sword]], the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the Bandersnatch's den. She rebuffs advances from the Knave, leading the jealous Red Queen to demand her beheading. Alice obtains the sword and returns the Bandersnatch's eye, who gratefully helps her escape the castle and delivers her to the White Queen, who gives Alice a potion that returns her normal size. The Cheshire Cat uses his [[shapeshifting]] powers to save the Mad Hatter, who incites rebellion amongst the Queen's subjects before escaping. Absolem finally gets Alice to realize Underland is real, evoking memories of her visit when she was a little girl and called it \"Wonderland\", and advises her to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a [[pupa]].\n\nThe Queens gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. As the two armies battle, Alice beheads the Jabberwocky with the vorpal sword. The red knights turn against their ruler and the White Queen banishes her sister and the Knave into exile together. The White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood, which can fulfill one wish, and she decides to return to her world after saying farewell to her friends. \n\nAlice then awakes and gets out of the rabbit hole, dirty and scratched from her fall. When she returns to the gazebo at the garden party, she refuses Hamish's proposal and impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing trade routes to [[Hong Kong]], inspiring him to take her as his apprentice. Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship, where a blue butterfly lands on her shoulder, which she recognizes as Absolem.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Tarrant Hightopp]], [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Mad Hatter]]: The hammy yet bitter mayor of Wonderland and the [[leader]]/owner of the resistance against Iracebeth.<ref name=\"script\"/> Wasikowska said that the characters \"both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds, and have a special bond and friendship with Alice.\"<ref name=\"'Alice in Wonderland'' star Mia Wasikowska on Johnny Depp: 'He's so brave and smart\"/><ref name=\"confirm\"/> Burton explained that Depp \"tried to find a grounding to the character \u2026 as opposed to just being mad.\"<ref name=\"sdcc09\"/> Burton also said that \"[i]n a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [Depp's] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character.\"<ref name=\"sdcc09\"/> The orange hair is an allusion to the [[Erethism|mercury poisoning suffered by hatters]] who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character \"was poisoned \u2026 and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes\".<ref name=\"Johnny Depp explains how he picked his poison with the Mad Hatter\"/> Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions.<ref name=\"Johnny Depp is Mad\"/> In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to \"a [[mood ring]], [as] his emotions are ''very'' close to the surface\".<ref name=\"Johnny Depp Sets Sail on Fourth ''Pirates'' Movie\"/> The Hatter is [[Dissociative identity disorder|\"made up of different people and their extreme sides\"]], with a gentle voice much like the character's creator [[Lewis Carroll]] reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] accent (which Depp modeled after [[Gregor Fisher]]'s ''[[Rab C.
