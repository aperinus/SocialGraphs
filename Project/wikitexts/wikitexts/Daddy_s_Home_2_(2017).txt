A sequel to ''[[Daddy's Home (film)|Daddy's Home]]'' (2015), it stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Linda Cardellini]], [[John Cena]], with [[John Lithgow]] and [[Mel Gibson]]. The plot follows now-reformed fathers Brad and Dusty (Ferrell and Wahlberg), now co-parenting Dusty's kids, who have to deal with their own fathers (Lithgow and Gibson) visiting for the holidays.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, [[Red Granite Pictures]] was not involved in the film's production. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in [[Massachusetts]] in March 2017 and it was released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on November 10, 2017. Although the film received generally negative reviews from critics, it grossed over $180 million worldwide against a production budget of $69\u201370 million.\n\n==Plot==\nFinally friends, Brad Whitaker and Dusty Mayron co-parent Dusty's two children, Megan and Dylan, who take turns at each father's house. Dusty has remarried to Karen, a doctor/novelist, and is stepfather to her daughter Adrianna. The men decide to have a joint Christmas rather than separate ones, after Megan embarrassingly admits during a school recital, that she does not like Christmas anymore due to the stress and embarrassment caused by the dual arrangement. She'd prefer one \"together Christmas\".\n\nDusty's tough fighter pilot/[[Space Shuttle]] astronaut father Kurt and Brad's overbearing and cheerful father, Don, unexpectedly arrive for Christmas. Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don, as he is very present in their lives, while Kurt hasn't seen them since they were toddlers. From his envy of the affection the children show Don, Kurt rents a large cabin through [[Airbnb]], to house them all through the holiday week.\n\nBrad and Dusty's co-parenting is put to the test by Kurt's meddling. Dusty\u2019s beef with Kurt mainly stems from the fact that he was rarely there for him as a child. Especially painful was when, during a youth Glee Club recital he embarrassed himself by missing his solo part when Kurt left to make out with a woman during his part. Sara, meanwhile, tries to bond with Karen, but is appalled by her shoplifting clothes from a store and not caring if Adriana and Megan drink alcoholic eggnog. She later becomes concerned Don isn\u2019t with his wife, whom he claims couldn\u2019t come as she was staying home to take care of her ill brother.\n\nDylan develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door, causing Megan and Adrianna to constantly tease him in front of her. Brad gives him some \u201cadvice\", and Dusty interjects when he thinks Brad is having what looks like \u201cthe talk\u201d with Dylan, although they had agreed to do it together. As the trees on the Christmas tree farm are small, Kurt suggests they illegally go on to private property to cut one down. Brad mistakes a cell tower for a tree and is electrocuted.\n\nAfter bowling, the family takes the kids to see Santa. There, Kurt tries to convince Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun, but Don talks him out of it. Megan, however, wants one instead and is granted permission after Kurt makes a sexist comment. Out hunting the next day, Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital. While Kurt is down, she shoots two turkeys, surprising him. Sara confronts Brad over Don\u2019s odd behavior, but he refuses to believe her.\n\nBrad, Dusty, Don and Kurt go to an improv comedy club, where they have a good time until Kurt picking up a woman at the bar annoys Dusty. Brad enters Don into the improv show, and Dusty chooses the topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of the skit. As it progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife in real life. Sara comforts Don about his divorce in front of an eggnog bowl, but when Dusty reveals his part in the skit, Don and Brad become furious and Dusty and Brad's relationship becomes strained. When they leave, Megan and Adrianna sneak cups of alcoholic eggnog. Brad, attempting to get back at Dusty, invites Adrianna's father, Roger. Roger intimidates Dusty as he had done to Brad in the first film.\n\nThe entire family takes part in a live nativity. Brad fights with Dusty because he wants to play Joseph. A drunken Megan begins to swear, and an equally drunk Adrianna falls from her platform, then the crowd breaks up. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost fights Roger, and Don is repeatedly hit in the face with ice-balls.\n\nOn Christmas Day the families, depressed from all the arguing, pack up to leave. On their way out of town, they are forced back due to a blizzard, taking shelter at a movie theater. They see ''Missile Tow'', a holiday action comedy film starring [[Liam Neeson]]. When the power cuts off during the movie, everyone goes to the lobby where each man confronts his father about his secrets, lies, and attitudes, and reconcile.\n\nRemembering advice given to him by Kurt, Dylan walks toward the girl he has a crush on to kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna. Kurt pushes Dusty to stand up to Adrianna and punish her for her recent behavior, but he instead tells her he loves her. He then tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well as he is also part of the family. Roger almost leaves without Adrianna. However, he has a change of heart after everyone breaks out into a song of \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" (during which the power comes back on) and he decides to stay.\n\nSometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to head back to their respective homes. Adrianna, who has grown close with Don, reveals she signed him up for a dating app for seniors so he can move on from Brad\u2019s mother. Kurt goes with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they are going to spend New Year's together in [[Las Vegas]] to find dates more effectively.\n\nAs Brad's mother arrives, Dusty and Brad discover Brad's new stepfather is [[Sully Sullenberger]], pilot of the 2009 \"[[US Airways Flight 1549|Miracle on the Hudson]]\" flight. They remember watching the film ''[[Sully (film)|Sully]]'' together recently, and Dusty appears to be happy to see him. Brad seems willing to accept him, but instead runs down the terminal, screaming that Sully will never replace his father and \"You only have one good story, my father has a million\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Dusty Mayron\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Brad Whitaker\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Kurt Mayron\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Don Whitaker\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Sara Whitaker\n* [[John Cena]] as Roger\n* [[Scarlett Estevez]] as Megan Mayron\n* [[Owen Vaccaro]] as Dylan Mayron\n* [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] as Karen Mayron\n* [[Didi Costine]] as Adrianna\n* [[Bill Burr]] as Jerry\n* [[Chesley Sullenberger]] as himself\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as himself (voice)\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Young Dusty\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2016, the sequel was announced, with [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Mark Wahlberg]] reprising their roles, [[Sean Anders]] and [[John Morris (filmmaker)|John Morris]] writing the script, and Anders directing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/will-ferrell-mark-wahlberg-daddys-home-sequel-sean-anders-john-morris-paramount-1201742137/|title=Will Ferrell & Mark Wahlberg Set 'Daddy's Home' Sequel At Paramount |last=Fleming |first=Mike, Jr. |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 22, 2016|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, it was reported that [[Mel Gibson]] and [[John Lithgow]] were being sought to play the main characters' fathers in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/mel-gibson-daddys-home-sequel-john-lithgow-will-ferrell-mark-wahlberg-paramount-1201897677/|title=Mel Gibson, John Lithgow Circling 'Daddy's Home' Sequel |last=Fleming |first=Mike, Jr. |website=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 30, 2017|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref> The two were later confirmed to star, along with [[Linda Cardellini]], [[John Cena]], Owen Vaccaro and Scarlett Estevez, reprising their roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mel-gibson-and-john-lithgow-join-daddys-home-sequel-1201989588/|title=Mel Gibson and John Lithgow Join 'Daddy's Home' Sequel|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Justin|last=Kroll|date=February 15, 2017|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/john-cena-daddys-home-sequel-will-ferrell-mark-wahlberg-mel-gibson-1202040824/|title=John Cena Back For 'Daddy's Home 2'|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|date=March 10, 2017|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=November 17, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 20, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/~/media/Files/Production%20List/CPLBAFull%20pdf.pdf?531|title=Daddy's Home 2<!--PAGE 21-->|website=[[Directors Guild of America]]|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> Scenes were filmed in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] and [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in the United States on November 10, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paramount-sets-daddys-home-2-november-release-970505|title=Paramount Sets 'Daddy's Home 2' for November Release|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Ashley|last=Lee|date=February 1, 2017|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n''Daddy's Home 2'' was released on [[Digital distribution|Digital HD]] on February 6, 2018, and was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on February 20, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daddys Home 2 Blu-ray, 4k & Digital Release Dates Announced|url=https://hd-report.com/2018/01/06/daddys-home-2-blu-ray-4k-digital-release-dates-announced/|website=HD Report|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Daddy's Home 2 (2017)|url=https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/8366/daddys-home-2|website=DVDs Release Date|access-date=9 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Daddy's Home 2'' grossed $103.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $76.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $180.4 million, against a production budget of  $69\u201370 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\nIn the United States and Canada, ''Daddy's Home 2'' opened alongside ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (2017 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'', and was projected to gross around $20 million from 3,575 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref name=preview>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/thor-ragnarok-great-tuesday-murder-on-the-orient-express-daddys-home-2-weekend-box-office-preview-1202204084/|title='Thor' Rocks On With $10.8M Tuesday; Will Continue To Strike Lightning In Second Weekend With $60M|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> The film made $10.7 million on its first day, including $1.5 million from Thursday night previews at 2,500 theaters, up from the $1.2 million made by the first film.
