It was directed by [[Garry Marshall]], and stars [[Bette Midler]], [[Barbara Hershey]], [[Mayim Bialik]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[James Read]], [[Spalding Gray]], and [[Lainie Kazan]].\n\nDespite generally negative reviews from critics, the film was a commercial success, grossing $59 million in the box office.\n\nA [[sequel]], based on the 1991 novel ''[[I'll Be There (novel)|Beaches II: I'll Be There]]'' was planned with [[Barbara Eden]] but never filmed.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle-aged Cecilia Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom, a [[New York City|New York]] actress and singer, receives a note during a rehearsal for her upcoming [[Los Angeles]] concert. She leaves in a panic to travel to the side of her friend Hillary [[Whitney family|Whitney]], a [[San Francisco]] [[Inheritance|heiress]] and lawyer. Unable to get a flight to San Francisco because of [[fog]], she rents a car and drives overnight, reflecting on her lifelong friendship with Hillary.\n\nHillary and C.C. met in 1958, under the boardwalk on the beach in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Hillary is lost and C.C. is hiding from her overbearing [[stage mother]]. They become fast friends, growing up and bonding through letters of support to each other. Hillary becomes a [[human rights]] lawyer, while C.C.'s singing career does not exactly take off. Hillary shows up at the New York City [[dive bar]] where C.C. is performing, their first meeting since Atlantic City. She moves in with C.C. and gets a job with the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]. C.C. is now performing [[singing telegrams]], leading to a job offer from John, the artistic director of the Falcon Players, after she sings his birthday telegram.\n\nA love triangle ensues as Hillary and John are instantly attracted to one another, leaving C.C. resenting her best friend. Hillary and John sleep together on the opening night of C.C.'s first lead role in an [[off-Broadway]] production. When Hillary returns home to care for her ailing father, the two friends resolve their issues about John, as John does not have romantic feelings for C.C. After her father passes away, Hillary spends time at her family beach house with lawyer Michael Essex, eventually marrying him. C.C. and John spend a lot of time together, start dating and eventually marry. Hillary and Michael travel to New York to see C.C. perform on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], where she has become a star. When C.C. finds out that Hillary has stopped working as a lawyer, she accuses her of giving up on her dreams. Hillary responds that C.C. has become obsessed with her career. After the argument, Hillary ignores C.C.'s letters, throwing herself into being a dutiful, but unchallenged, wife.\n\nJohn tells C.C. that her self-centeredness and obsession with her career have him feeling left behind, and he asks for a divorce. C.C. turns to her mother for advice. Her mother tells her that she has given up a lot for her daughter, and C.C. starts to understand when her mother tells her the effect that her selfishness has had on those closest to her.\n\nHillary discovers her husband is having an affair. When Hillary learns that C.C. is performing in San Francisco, she makes contact for the first time in years. They learn of each other's divorces, then discover that they have been secretly jealous of each other for years: Hillary is upset that she has none of C.C.'s talent or charisma, while C.C. admits she has always been envious of Hillary's beauty and intelligence.\n\nHillary tells C.C. that she is pregnant, and has already decided to raise the child as a single parent. This wins her admiration from the feisty and independent C.C., who promises to stay and help her out. C.C. starts talking of settling down, and having a family of her own, having become engaged to Hillary's obstetrician. However, when C.C.'s agent calls with the perfect comeback gig for her, C.C. abandons her fianc\u00e9, and races back to New York City. Hillary gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria Cecilia. When Victoria is a young girl, Hillary develops [[viral cardiomyopathy]], requiring a heart transplant. Having a rare tissue type, she realizes she will most likely die before a heart is found.\n\nC.C. has become a big star, having won a Tony award, and completed her latest hit album. When she learns of Hillary's illness, she accompanies Hillary and Victoria to the beach house for the summer. Hillary becomes depressed due to her debilitated state, and takes her frustration out on C.C. whom she sees having fun with and connecting with Victoria. Hillary eventually begins to accept her prognosis bravely, appreciating her time with Victoria and C.C. Hillary and Victoria return to San Francisco, while C.C. heads to Los Angeles for a concert. Hillary collapses and is found by her daughter, leading to the note C.C. receives that prompts her to leave her rehearsal. C.C. takes Hillary and Victoria to the beach house, where Hillary dies.\n\nAfter the funeral, C.C. takes custody of Victoria, and the two console each other in their grief. C.C. goes forward with her concert and concludes it by singing \"The Glory of Love\", the first song Hillary heard her sing 30 years ago; as the song ends, C.C. tearfully waves toward the sky, in tribute to her. After the show, she leaves hand-in-hand with Victoria and begins telling stories of when she first met her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Cecilia Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom\n** [[Mayim Bialik]] as 11-year-old Cecilia Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Hillary Whitney\n** Marcie Leeds as 11-year-old Hillary Whitney\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as John Pierce\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Dr. Richard Milstein\n* [[James Read]] as Michael Essex\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Leona Bloom\n* Grace Johnston as Victoria Essex\n* [[Lynda Goodfriend]] as Mrs. Myandowski\n* [[Tracy Reiner]] as Department Store Clerk\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Diva\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Otto Titsling\n* [[Phil Leeds]] as Sammy Pinkers\n* [[Frank Campanella]] as Doorman\n* [[Kathleen Marshall]] as Delivery Room Nurse #1\n* Barbara Marshall as I.C.

The consenus summarizes: \"Not all great soundtracks make good movies, and ''Beaches'' lacks the wind beneath its wings.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beaches |title=Beaches (1988) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=October 18, 2022}}</ref> Critics almost unanimously found the film's emotional moments to be unearned, calculated, and familiar to the point of being predictable. [[Roger Ebert]] assessed that \"'Beaches' lacks the spontaneity of life. This is a movie completely constructed out of other movies - out of cliches and archetypes that were old before most of the cast members were born.\" He found the problem was compounded by the film foreshadowing Hillary's death right from the beginning, and gave it two and a half stars.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Beaches Movie Review & Film Summary |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beaches-1989 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=31 December 2019 |date=January 13, 1989}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] called it \"a much too mechanical tearjerker\" and criticized the slow pace, but acknowledged that he heard some sniffling among the audience and gave it two and a half stars.<ref name=Siskel>{{cite news |last=Siskel |first=Gene |author-link=Gene Siskel |title='Beaches' a Slow-Speed, Emotional Roller Coaster |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-13-8902250012-story.html |access-date=31 December 2019 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 13, 1989}}</ref> Jay Boyar noted in the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', \"In advance publicity for ''Beaches'', it has been routinely referred to as a 'tear-jerker.' Though the term is sometimes used admiringly these days, doesn't it actually mean that a movie has emotional scenes in which the emotion is somehow trumped-up or unearned? This is the sort of picture in which people slap each other as they take their marriage vows, suddenly develop life-threatening diseases, and, again, have violent confrontations whenever there's a break in the action. Anything for a laugh, anything for a tear, and nothing much authentic.\" Similarly to Ebert, he called it \"a 1940s retread\", noting its use of antiquated themes like the idea that a woman must choose between being a mother and having a career.<ref name=Sentrev>{{cite news |last=Boyar |first=Jay |title=Beaches: No Day at the Ocean |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1989-01-14-8901140503-story.html |access-date=31 December 2019 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=January 14, 1989}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Kehr]] likewise stated in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that \"''Beaches'' struggles to update a 1940s formula\", describing it as particularly derivative of the 1943 film ''[[Old Acquaintance]]''. He also felt the friendship between C.C. and Hillary to be implausible and lacking in genuine warmth, and commented that \"The cardinal rule of melodrama ... is that emotion must follow from situation. When that relationship is inverted, the result is sheer manipulation and blatantly false.\" He gave it two stars.<ref name=Kehr>{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Kehr |title=In 'Beaches', Music Is Fine |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-01-13-8902250013-story.html |access-date=31 December 2019 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=January 13, 1989}}</ref> [[Sheila Benson]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"the most shamelessly manipulative movie since they shot the dog in ''[[The Biscuit Eater (1940 film)|The Biscuit Eater]]''.\" While opining that emotional manipulation isn't necessarily bad, she felt the film had failed to capture what made the novel it is adapted from such an effective tearjerker, by neglecting the essence of C.C. and Hillary's friendship and instead focusing on petty arguments between the two. However, she praised the performances of Midler and Hershey, and admitted that the film succeeded in making her cry.<ref name=Benson>{{cite news |last=Benson |first=Sheila |author-link=Sheila Benson |title=Wallowing in Waves of 'Beaches' Emotion |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-12-23-ca-658-story.html |access-date=31 December 2019 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 23, 1988}}</ref>\n\nSeveral critics remarked that the scenes of C.C. and Hillary's childhood were more emotionally convincing and enjoyable than the rest of the film, with particular praise for Mayim Bialik's performance.<ref name=Siskel/><ref name=Sentrev/><ref name=Kehr/><ref name=Benson/> Midler's numerous singing performances were also frequently cited as a strong point in a mostly weak film.<ref name=Siskel/><ref name=Sentrev/><ref name=Kehr/><ref name=Benson/>\n\nThe film remained poorly regarded over later decades. In reviews for the 2017 remake, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[CNN Entertainment]]'' recalled the 1988 film as, respectively, \"a pastiche of 1950s tear-jerkers that was set, strangely and uncomfortably, in the 1970s and \u201980s. ... a shamelessly retrograde and literal-minded soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hale |first=Mike |title=Review: They've, Sob, Remade 'Beaches' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/arts/television/review-theyve-sob-remade-beaches.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftelevision&action=click&contentCollection=television&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sec |access-date=31 December 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> and \"a film that delivered a hit song and strong box-office results but is remembered mostly for its high schmaltz factor.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowry |first=Brian |title='Beaches' Remake Doesn't Achieve Liftoff on Lifetime |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/entertainment/beaches-review/index.html |website=[[CNN Entertainment]] |access-date=31 December 2019 |date=January 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nIncluded on the soundtrack was Midler's performance of \"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\".
