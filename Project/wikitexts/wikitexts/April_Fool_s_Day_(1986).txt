Wilson]], [[Deborah Foreman]], [[Griffin O'Neal]], [[Amy Steel]], [[Ken Olandt]], [[Deborah Goodrich]], and [[Leah Pinsent]]. The plot follows a group of college students vacationing during [[April Fool's Day]] weekend on an island estate, which is infiltrated by an unknown assailant.\n\nFilmed in [[Victoria, British Columbia|British Columbia]] in 1985, ''April Fool's Day'' was released in late March 1986 through [[Paramount Pictures]] in conjunction with the April 1 holiday. It received varied responses from film critics, with some commending it for its non-gratuitous violence and plot twists, while others lambasted it for its [[plot twist|surprise ending]].\n\nA [[April Fool's Day (2008 film)|remake]] of the film was released [[direct-to-video]] in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the weekend leading up to [[April Fools' Day]], a group of college friends, consisting of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Arch, gather to celebrate [[spring break]] by spending the weekend at the island [[mansion]] of Skip's cousin, [[Vassar College|Vassar]] student Muffy St. John. As Muffy prepares details around the house, she finds an old [[jack-in-the-box]] and recalls receiving the toy at a childhood birthday party. Her friends, meanwhile, joke around on the pier while awaiting the ferry. En route to the island, as their antics become more boisterous, local deckhand Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident.\n\nOnce on the island, it turns out that Muffy has set up a variety of [[practical joke|pranks]] throughout the mansion, ranging from simple gags such as a [[whoopee cushion]] and [[dribble glass]]es and [[exploding cigar]]s to more complex and disturbing pranks, such as an [[audiotape]] of a baby crying in someone's room and [[heroin]] paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. In spite of this, the group tries to relax, until Skip goes missing, and Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his [[cadaver|dead body]]. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing. During a search for the pair, Nikki falls into the island's well, where she finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch, along with the dead body of Nan. The remaining group members then discover that the phone lines are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday.\n\nOne after another, members of the group either vanish or get killed before their bodies are found. After putting some clues together, Kit and Rob realize that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane [[Evil Twin|twin]] sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \"Muffy\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy. They discover Muffy's severed head in the basement.\n\nBuffy chases them with a curved butcher's knife, and the couple gets separated. Kit flees from Buffy by escaping into the living room where she finds everyone else there, alive and calmly waiting for her. It was all a joke, or more accurately, a dress rehearsal. Muffy reveals that she hopes to turn the mansion into a resort offering a weekend of staged horror. She even had a friend who does special effects and make-up in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] help. Each \"victim\" agreed to take part as things were explained to them. Everyone has a huge laugh and they break out many bottles of champagne.\n\nLater that night, a half-drunk Muffy goes to her room and finds a wrapped present on her bed. She unwraps it, and the present is a non-descript jack-in-the-box. Savoring the surprise, she turns the handle slowly and when \"Jack\" finally pops out, Nan, who knew Muffy from acting class, emerges from behind her and slits her throat with a razor. Muffy screams, but then realizes she is not really bleeding and that Nan used a trick razor and stage blood.\n\nLaying on its side, the jack-in-the-box winks.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jay Baker (actor)|Jay Baker]] as Harvey Edison Jr.\n* [[Deborah Foreman]] as Muffy/Buffy St. John\n* [[Deborah Goodrich]] as Nikki Brashares\n* [[Ken Olandt]] as Rob Ferris\n* [[Griffin O'Neal]] as Skip St. John\n* [[Leah Pinsent]] as Nan Youngblood\n* [[Clayton Rohner]] as Chaz Vyshinski\n* [[Amy Steel]] as Kit Graham\n* [[Thomas F.

This ending has never been released, but stills of it have surfaced. A revised draft of the script included another version of the above-mentioned ending in which Skip sneaks back onto the island to kill Muffy. He springs out of a closet and cuts her throat. At first panics then realizes it's all a joke when she sees her friends standing around. The script then states that Skip stays on the island to help Muffy with the bed and breakfast.\n\nA [[straight-to-DVD]] [[April Fool's Day (2008 film)|remake]] was released in March 2008. Though it retains the original concept, the story and characters are radically altered in an effort to make it more contemporary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:428834|title=April Fool's Day (2008)|publisher=[[AllMovie]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Adam|year=2011|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn= 978-0-786-46932-1}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0090655|title=April's Fool's Day}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1001138_april_fools_day}}\n\n{{Fred Walton}}\n\n[[Category:1986 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s mystery films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1986 horror films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:American teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Mystery horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about pranks]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fred Walton (director)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set on islands]]\n[[Category:Films shot in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Holiday horror films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
