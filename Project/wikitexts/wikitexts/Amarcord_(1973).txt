The film's title is a [[univerbation]] of the [[Romagnol language|Romagnol]] phrase {{lang|rgn|a m'arc\u00f4rd}} (\"I remember\").<ref>Pettigrew, 76. Fellini elaborated further by suggesting that the Italian words {{lang|it|amare}} ('to love'), ''cuore'' ('heart'), ''ricordare'' ('to remember') and ''amaro'' ('bitter') were contracted into the Romagnolo neologism, ''amarcord'' (''a m'arc\u00f4rd'', in Italian ''io mi ricordo'').</ref> The title then became a neologism of the Italian language, with the meaning of \"nostalgic revocation\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=amarcord in Vocabolario - Treccani |url=https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/amarcord |access-date=2022-04-24 |website=www.treccani.it |language=it-IT}}</ref> The titular role of Titta is indeed based on Fellini's childhood friend from Rimini, Luigi Titta Benzi. Benzi became a lawyer and remained in close contact with Fellini throughout his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterionchannel.com/amarcord/videos/fellini-s-homecoming|title=Fellini's Homecoming - Amarcord|website=The Criterion Channel}}</ref>\n\nTitta's sentimental education is emblematic of Italy's \"lapse of conscience\".<ref>[[Peter Bondanella]], ''Amarcord: The Fascism Within Us'' in ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', pp. 20-21.</ref> Fellini skewers Mussolini's ludicrous posturings and those of a [[Catholic Church]] that \"imprisoned Italians in a perpetual adolescence\"<ref>Bondanella, 20. For other discussions of Fellini and fascism, see Bondanella's ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'' and ''I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon''.</ref> by mocking himself and his fellow villagers in comic scenes that underline their incapacity to adopt genuine moral responsibility or outgrow foolish sexual fantasies.\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]], and was nominated for two more [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Borgo San Giuliano, a village near Rimini, the arrival of fluffy [[Populus nigra|poplar]] seeds floating on the wind heralds the arrival of spring. As night falls, the inhabitants make their way to the village square for a traditional bonfire in which the Old Witch of Winter is ritually burned. The townspeople play pranks on one another, explode fireworks, cavort with loose women and make lewd noises when the civically minded lawyer lectures on the history of the region.\n\nSchool under Fascism is a tedious cavalcade of dry facts recited by instructors of varying levels of engagement and skill. All Titta and his fellow students can do is goof off or skip class when not called upon to solve math problems or identify obscure historical details. When Titta goes to confession, he is able to avoid telling Don Balosa about his masturbatory activities and attempt to seduce Gradisca, a glamorous older woman, because the priest is more concerned with floral arrangements.\n\nFascist officials come for a tour, and the schoolchildren are required to perform athletic routines for their approval. Titta's friend Ciccio daydreams about being married to his crush, Aldina, by the giant face of Mussolini. Surreptitiously wired into the bell tower of the town church, a gramophone plays a recording of \"[[The Internationale]]\" but it is soon shot at and destroyed by gun-crazy Fascists. Owing to his anarchist past, Titta's father Aurelio is brought in for questioning and forced to drink [[castor oil]]. He limps home in a nauseous state to be washed by his wife, Miranda.\n\nOne summer afternoon, the family visits Uncle Teo ([[Ciccio Ingrassia]]), Aurelio's brother, confined to an insane asylum. They take him out for a day in the country but he escapes into a tree yelling, \"''Voglio una donna!''\" (\"I want a woman!\"). All attempts to bring him down are met with stones that Teo carries in his pockets. A dwarf nun and two orderlies finally arrive on the scene. Marching up the ladder, the nun reprimands Teo, who obediently agrees to return to the asylum.\n\nFall arrives. The town's inhabitants embark in small boats to meet the passage of the [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']], the regime's proudest technological achievement. By midnight they have fallen asleep waiting for its arrival. Awakened by a foghorn, they watch in awe as the liner sails past, capsizing their boats in its wake. Titta's grandfather wanders lost in a disorienting fog so thick it seems to smother the house and the autumnal landscape. Walking out to the town's Grand Hotel, Titta and his friends find it boarded up. Like zombies, they waltz on the terrace with imaginary female partners enveloped in the fog.\n\nThe annual car race provides the occasion for Titta to daydream of winning the grand prize, Gradisca. One evening he visits the buxom tobacconist at closing time. She becomes aroused when he demonstrates he is strong enough to lift her, but is annoyed when he becomes overwhelmed as she presses her breasts into his face. She gives him a cigarette then coldly sends him home.\n\nWinter brings with it record snowfall. Miranda nurses a sick Titta to health, then as spring arrives again, dies of an illness herself. Titta is devastated. Later, the village attends the reception for Gradisca's marriage to a Fascist officer. As Gradisca drives off with her ''[[Carabinieri|Carabiniere]]'', someone notices that Titta has gone too.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruno Zanin]] as Titta\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Gradisca, hairdresser\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Miranda Biondi, Titta's mother\n* [[Armando Brancia]] as Aurelio Biondi, Titta's father\n* Giuseppe Ianigro as Titta's grandfather\n* Nando Orfei as Lallo or \"Il Pataca\", Titta's uncle\n* [[Ciccio Ingrassia]] as Teo, Titta's uncle\n* Stefano Proietti as Oliva, Titta's brother\n* Donatella Gambini as Aldina Cordini\n* Gianfranco Marrocco as Son of count\n* Ferdinando De Felice as Cicco\n* Bruno Lenzi as Gigliozzi\n* Bruno Scagnetti as Ovo\n* [[Alvaro Vitali]] as Naso\n* Francesco Vona as Candela\n*[[Maria Antonietta Beluzzi]] as the tobacconist\n* Josiane Tanzilli as Volpina\n\n==Deleted scene==\nA scene was shot that was later cut from the film by Fellini. The scene was shot without sound. It is described, however, in the novelization published by Rizzoli in 1973 and involves the contessa's loss of a diamond ring down her toilet. Carlini, or \"Eau de cologne\", the man who empties the town's cesspits, is called to retrieve it.

A year in the life of a coastal village, with due emphasis on the seasons, and the births, marriages and deaths. It is an ''[[Our Town]]'' or ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' of the Adriatic seaboard, concocted and displayed in the Roman film studios with the latter-day Fellini's distaste for real stone and wind and sky. The people, however, are real, and the many non-actors among them come in all the shapes and sizes one cares to imagine without plunging too deep into [[Tod Browning]] freak territory.\"<ref>Fava, Claudio G. and Vigano, Aldo, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', p.158.

It's an extravagantly funny, sometimes dreamlike evocation of a year in the life of a small Italian coastal town in the nineteen-thirties, not as it literally was, perhaps, but as it is recalled by a director with a superstar's access to the resources of the Italian film industry and a piper's command over our imaginations.  When Mr. Fellini is working in peak condition, as he is in ''Amarcord'' (the vernacular for \"I remember\" in [[Romagna]]), he somehow brings out the best in us. We become more humane, less stuffy, more appreciative of the profound importance of attitudes that in other circumstances would seem merely eccentric if not lunatic.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A03E0DF163FE13BBC4851DFBF66838F669EDE Canby, Vincent].

Last Retrieved 22 February. 2008.</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] discussed Fellini's value as a director: \"It's also absolutely breathtaking filmmaking. Fellini has ranked for a long time among the five or six greatest directors in the world, and of them all, he's the natural. [[Ingmar Bergman]] achieves his greatness through thought and soul-searching, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] built his films with meticulous craftsmanship, and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] used his fetishes and fantasies to construct barbed jokes about humanity.
