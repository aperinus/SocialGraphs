It was directed and written by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]]. The film was produced by Realitism Films. It was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in [[2010 Cannes Film Festival|2010]], where it received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA group of people in a [[Deserts of California|California desert]] are gathered to watch a \"film\". A [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] named Chad points out that many moments in [[History of film|cinema]] happen for \"no reason\", that life is full of this \"no reason\", and that this film is an homage to \"no reason\". Chad is sometimes participating in the narrative action and sometimes commenting on it. An accountant then passes binoculars to the audience members and rides off on a bicycle. The audience starts looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the \"film\" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people return in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far.\n\nSomewhere in the desert, a tire named Robert suddenly comes to life. After standing upright, he discovers he has [[psychokinesis]] and tests his newfound powers by making animals and inanimate objects explode. Robert spots a woman drive by and attempts to use his powers on her, but he only succeeds in making her car stall before he is run over by a truck. The woman manages to start her car and drive off while Robert kills the truck driver that ran him over.\n\nRobert locates the woman at a nearby motel and enters the room next to hers. He kills the motel's maid after she throws him out of the room. Sheriff Chad arrives at the scene to investigate the string of murders. Meanwhile, the in-film audience, having starved for two days, are given a turkey by the accountant, but they begin to suffer intense abdominal pain. While questioning the motel owner, Chad suddenly stops upon hearing an alarm go off, indicating that the audience have started to succumb to the poison-laced turkey. He urges the other characters to go home, telling them the film is over as the audience is dead, but the accountant informs him that an audience member who uses a wheelchair had not eaten turkey. As an embarrassed Chad resumes his investigation, he witnesses Robert kill the motel owner and leads the cops on a \"tire hunt\". The accountant attempts to poison the wheelchair-using audience member, but he becomes hungry and eats the poisoned food and dies.\n\nRobert comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires, resulting in him going on a killing spree for three days. Chad lures the tire into a trap using dynamite on a mannequin dressed as the woman. Robert blows up the mannequin's head, but the dynamite fails to detonate. The man who uses a wheelchair mocks the sheriff for the botched trap, enraging Chad enough to destroy Robert with a shotgun off-screen and tossing the tire's carcass at the man, who continues to criticize him for the [[Climax (narrative)|anticlimax]]. Robert is reincarnated as a tricycle and kills the man in the wheelchair before recruiting an army of tires on his way to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], the opening scene plays again, but this time from different angles, revealing that Chad is not speaking to anyone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Stephen Spinella]] as Lieutenant Chad\n* [[Jack Plotnick]] as Accountant\n* [[Roxane Mesquida]] as Sheila\n* [[Wings Hauser]] as Man in Wheelchair\n* [[Ethan Cohn]] as Movie Buff Ethan\n* [[Charley Koontz]] as Movie Buff Charley\n* Hayley Holmes as Cindy\n* [[Haley Ramm]] as Fiona\n* [[Daniel Quinn (actor)|Daniel Quinn]] as Dad\n* Devin Brochu as Son\n* Tara Jean O'Brien as Martina the Cleaning Lady\n* [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]] as Mr. Hugues\n* [[Blake Robbins]] as Eric\n* Remy Thorne as Zach\n* [[Cecelia Antoinette]] as Woman\n* [[Thomas F.

[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects were used for the shots of heads exploding; during filming Dupieux used practical effects, but he was unhappy with the results.<ref name=\"BD\"/>\n\nDuring the writing process, the tire, Robert, was designed solely as a bad guy with no redeeming qualities.<ref name=\"CB\">{{cite web|last1=Nemiroff|first1=Perri|title=Interview: Rubber Writer-Director Quentin Dupieux|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Rubber-Writer-Director-Quentin-Dupieux-23286.html|website=Cinemablend|access-date=6 March 2017|archive-date=25 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625163211/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Rubber-Writer-Director-Quentin-Dupieux-23286.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While shooting, however, Dupieux determined that this was the wrong approach realizing \"there\u2019s nothing evil about a tire\" based partly on early camera tests. Robert was reworked to be \"more like a stupid dog\".<ref name=\"CB\"/> The 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]]'', specifically the first act, was also an influence on the character.<ref name=\"BD\"/>\n\nThe film begins with Lieutenant Chad making a speech about how events in movies often happen for \"no reason\". Dupieux has stated he was inclined to put that speech in because he was not interested in explaining how the tire came to life, although he knew such a setup would be expected.<ref name=\"BD\"/> The meta element of the film came organically, as Dupieux quickly grew tired of writing about a killer tire. He was partly influenced by an experience where he snuck into a theater playing his previous film ''Steak'' only to find that no one else was in the theater, which he noted was \"kind of scary.\"<ref name=\"BD\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was shown on May 15, 2010, at Cannes Critic's Week.<ref name=\"v-review\" />\nAfter the film was shown at Cannes, it was picked up for US distribution by [[Magnolia Pictures|Magnet Releasing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/magnet-burns-us-deal-for-rubber-with-elle-driver/5014237.article|work=[[Screen Daily]]|title=Magnet burns US deal for Rubber with Elle Driver|author=Mitchell, Wendy|date=May 20, 2010|access-date=October 17, 2010|archive-date=May 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523092359/http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/magnet-burns-us-deal-for-rubber-with-elle-driver/5014237.article|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Rubber'' had its outside-France premiere on July 9, 2010, at the [[Fantasia Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fantasiafestival.com/2010/en/films/film_detail.php?id=308|work=[[Fantasia Festival]]|access-date=October 17, 2010|author=Laperri\u00e8re, Simon|title=Rubber: International Premiere|archive-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210420/http://fantasiafestival.com/2010/en/films/film_detail.php?id=308|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Rubber'' was shown at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] where it had a positive reception.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |last2=Mayorga |first2=Emilio |title='Neon,' 'Kidnapped' shine at Sitges |url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/neon-kidnapped-shine-at-sitges-1118025497/ |website=Variety |access-date=28 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528022652/https://variety.com/2010/film/news/neon-kidnapped-shine-at-sitges-1118025497/ |archive-date=28 May 2020 |language=en |date=11 October 2010}}</ref> The film was shown in Toronto at the [[Toronto After Dark Film Festival|After Dark Film Festival]].
