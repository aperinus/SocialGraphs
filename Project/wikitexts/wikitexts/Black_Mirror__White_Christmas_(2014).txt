It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts, first airing on [[Channel 4]] on 16 December 2014. Agreed as a one-off special after Channel 4 rejected potential series three scripts, the episode was the last to air before the programme moved to the streaming platform [[Netflix]].\n\nThe episode explores three stories told by Matt ([[Jon Hamm]]) and Joe ([[Rafe Spall]]) from a remote cabin on Christmas Day. The first follows a man attempting to seduce a woman at a Christmas party while receiving remote guidance; the second sees Matt at his job training \"cookies\", digital clones of people; and the third shows Joe obsessed over an ex-fianc\u00e9e after the relationship abruptly ends. Topics depicted include [[pickup artistry]], [[artificial intelligence]] and consciousness, as well as the concept of Internet [[block (Internet)|blocking]] extrapolated into real life.\n\nFilming took place in London with a restrictive budget and timescale. [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] references are made to each previous episode and a \"Z-Eyes\" technology which records hearing and vision has the same design and similar functionality to the \"grain\" from series one's \"[[The Entire History of You]]\". The episode received mostly positive critical reception and was nominated for multiple awards, including an [[International Emmy Award for Best Actor]] with Spall as the nominee.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], the plot summary needs to be 400 words or less. -->\nJoe Potter ([[Rafe Spall]]) awakens in a cabin on a snowy Christmas Day, greeted by Matt Trent ([[Jon Hamm]]). The two have lived there for five years but barely spoken. To ease Joe into conversation, Matt explains why he ended up in the cabin. He used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women through implants called \"Z-Eyes\", which transmit the user's vision and hearing. One member, Harry ([[Rasmus Hardiker]]), crashes an office Christmas party and talks to Jennifer ([[Natalia Tena]]). She is mentally ill and mistakes Harry's communication with the group for him [[auditory hallucination|hearing voices]], as she does. After they return to her place, she poisons them both in a [[murder-suicide]].\n\nMatt then talks about his former job, training \"cookies\"\u2014digital clones of people stored in an egg-shaped object\u2014as personal assistants. He describes the experience of Greta's ([[Oona Chaplin]]) cookie, which refused to be a personal assistant. Matt makes six months pass inside the cookie's world in a matter of seconds and she relents under threat of further boredom and isolation.\n\nJoe opens up: he was \"blocked\" by his fianc\u00e9e Beth ([[Janet Montgomery]]) after the two fought over her decision to have an abortion. Blocking causes them to see each other as grey silhouettes and prevents Joe from contacting Beth. Months later, Joe confronts her still-pregnant silhouette and is arrested. Each Christmas Eve, when Beth visits her father, Joe travels to his house to spy on Beth and her daughter (to whom the block extends). The block is removed after Beth dies in a train accident, allowing Joe to discover that Beth had an affair and he is not the child's father. Confronting Beth's father, Joe strikes him with a [[snow globe]], killing him, and leaves. The girl sets off into the snowy wilderness to get help, only to freeze to death.\n\nWhile Joe tells the story, the cabin gradually transforms into Beth's father's house. Joe and Matt are in a cookie, the five years resulting from altered perception of time, and Joe is a cookie that has just given testimony which will be used to convict the real Joe. For his service, Matt avoids imprisonment for his role in Harry's death, but he is now registered as a [[sex offender]] and permanently blocked by everyone. Meanwhile, an officer sets Joe's cookie to experience time at 1,000 years per minute, with [[Wizzard]]'s \"[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday]]\"\u2014which played as Joe killed Beth's father\u2014on repeat.\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the second series of ''Black Mirror'', [[Channel 4]] agreed to a third series of four episodes on the condition that detailed synopses of episodes were given. After presenting some ideas, series creator [[Charlie Brooker]] and executive producer [[Annabel Jones]] were told that they \"weren't very ''Black Mirror''\", leaving the show in a limbo situation. A year later, Brooker and Jones were able to negotiate a 90-minute Christmas special, \"White Christmas\".<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013103}} The episode incorporated one of the ideas they had pitched, \"Angel of the Morning\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|102\u2013103}} It was the last ''Black Mirror'' episode produced under Channel 4; following this, the series moved to [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|126\u2013127}} \"White Christmas\" aired on 16 December 2014 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Emily|title=Here's the first promo for the Black Mirror Christmas Special|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7333243/first-promo-black-mirror-christmas-special-white-christmas-jon-hamm-charlie-brooker|access-date=25 December 2020|work=[[The Verge]]|date=5 December 2014|archive-date=8 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208133957/http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7333243/first-promo-black-mirror-christmas-special-white-christmas-jon-hamm-charlie-brooker|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Conception and writing===\nThe episode was written by Brooker.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|77}} Inspirations for the episode include the 1945 horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]'' and the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', both of which are anthologies.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|103,106}} The setting of a spaceship was briefly considered.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}} The first story about dating featured Matt, Harry and Jennifer. It was inspired by Brooker's observations of people on the street using [[Bluetooth]] headsets for calls, who looked like they were talking to themselves \"as if they had a mental illness\". The horse anecdote was inspired by Brooker reading \"bullshit ice-breakers\" used by [[pickup artist]]s.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}} Brooker later commented that the story was timely in the context of pickup artist [[Julien Blanc]] being denied a visa to the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"DoG interview\"/>\n\nThe second story, where Matt sets up Greta's cookie, was inspired by the comedic idea of someone who \"put a consciousness into a toaster\", and the toaster then falls in love with them. Brooker had considered this idea for a while, and realised it was a \"fucking nightmare\" rather than a love story. One draft of the story showed Greta's cookie watching Greta play with her kids, realising that she would never be able to hug her children again. This scene was rejected as \"too weird and nasty\" for the episode, but later used in series four episode \"[[Black Museum (Black Mirror)|Black Museum]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}}\n\nThe third story is about Joe and his girlfriend Beth. It was based on an idea from Brooker's 2001 series ''[[Unnovations]]'' in which a pair of glasses showed homeless people as cartoon characters. With the invention of [[Google Glass]], this looked more possible in reality. The idea of blocking on social media was also considered. The ending takes inspiration from [[Stephen King]]'s 1981 short story \"[[The Jaunt]]\" and the 1982 series finale of ''[[Sapphire & Steel]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:\u0420\u0435\u0439\u0444 \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043b.jpg|thumb|alt=Rafe Spall|[[Rafe Spall]] played Joe Potter.]]\nThe episode was directed by Carl Tibbetts, who had previously directed series two episode \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|77}} Jon Hamm was cast as Matt Trent; he had enjoyed the programme on [[DirecTV]] after [[Bill Hader]] recommended it to him.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> In mid-2014, Hamm was in the U.K. for press appearances and asked his agent if they knew anyone who knew Brooker: by chance, the agent had just signed him and they met up along with Jones.<ref name=\"DoG interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-interview-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-rafe-spall/|title=Black Mirror interview: Charlie Brooker, Jon Hamm, Rafe Spall|work=[[Den of Geek]]|last=Mellor|first=Louisa|date=16 December 2014|access-date=25 December 2020|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106232804/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-interview-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-rafe-spall/|url-status=live}}</ref> In the first draft, Matt was cheerful and [[cockney]] to contrast with Joe.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|107}} Whilst the original version portrayed Matt as slightly grating, Hamm was keen for his character to be likeable and affable as a contrast to his odious actions.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nJoe is played by Rafe Spall, who had previously read a script for another ''Black Mirror'' episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=Black Mirror: Charlie Brooker, Jon Hamm on the dark side of Yuletide|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide|access-date=25 December 2020|work=Digital Spy|date=14 December 2014|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106232751/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide/|url-status=live}}</ref> Spall welcomed an anthology series role, having found that he needed a \"huge amount of energy\" to commit to long-running serialised shows so that he could understand all relevant storylines.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/arts/television/jon-hamm-stars-in-black-mirror-christmas-special.html|title=The Dark Side of a Digital Future|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=21 December 2014|access-date=25 December 2020|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106232749/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/arts/television/jon-hamm-stars-in-black-mirror-christmas-special.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Oona Chaplin was cast as Greta, roughly two days before filming, while working in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}}\n\n===Filming, music and editing===\nFor the setting, a slightly futuristic London and a world in which the characters lived on boats were both considered. However, the episode had a very limited budget. Filming took place in disparate areas of London within a short period of time, which posed a challenge. Sets were built at [[Twickenham]], which would be used during production of later ''Black Mirror'' series.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106\u2013107}} The cabin was designed to look timeless, with Matt's outfit looking cleaner than the environment, while Joe's is warm.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|113}} The episode was shot in October 2014, during a period when Hamm and Spall both had heavy colds.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nThe episode opens with Joe and the viewer first sees Matt through Joe's eyes. He is initially very quiet and not able to recall precisely why he is in the cabin. Every time the cabin is shown, some details are changed until it becomes the house in which Joe commits the murder. The cooker, work surface, fireplace and clock are some of these details. Additionally, at one point Joe hears a noise which is his cell sliding shut as someone checks on him.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112\u2013113}}\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The colour palettes, costumes and soundtrack of the three stories are designed to be similar to each other, to give the episode an overarching identity. The first story has monochrome tones and a \"lopsided weirdness\" to its soundtrack; Jennifer's dress is made of navy leather and mesh to signify her role as a dominatrix.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}} Unprecedented for the show, the segment reuses technology from another episode: after several designs for the Z-Eyes, it was decided that the \"grain\" device from series one episode \"[[The Entire History of You]]\" should be used.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}}\n\nJetlagged, Chaplin fell asleep during some of her early scenes, which required her to lie down on an operating table. Greta wears an outfit similar to a [[kimono]], to indicate her relaxed demeanour, while her cookie wears a [[neoprene]] fabric. The score for the second story is \"crisp, clean [and] sterile\", using digital synths to contrast with the rest of the soundtrack.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}} The third story changes \"from romance to tragedy\", so its score incorporates a [[viola]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}} A scene where Beth struggles to get a vomiting Joe into a taxi was cut from filming due to time constraints.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nThe ending shows Joe smashing the radio repeatedly, as it reappears each time. It was decided on the day that this should be filmed in one continuous take, with stagehands quickly replacing the radio on the table; this was difficult due to their limited supply of radios. A shot of Joe smashing the snow globe, only for it to reappear, was cut. During filming, Brooker had an idea for the closing moments, which show the camera continually panning out from the cabin to show it inside a snow globe. The effect used many different [[take]]s as well as visual effects.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}} Editing took place up to the day of its press screening at Channel 4, leading Brooker to delay work on his annual review special ''[[2014 Wipe]]'' for the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|123}}\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Jon Hamm at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|alt=Jon Hamm|[[Jon Hamm]] played [[Don Draper]] in ''[[Mad Men]]'', a character compared to his role as Matt.<ref name=\"AVClub\"/>]]\nThe episode has a dark tone, as with other ''Black Mirror'' instalments, and aspects of horror.<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref name=\"DoG\"/> For instance, Ellen Jones of ''[[The Independent]]'' found the episode \"genuinely unsettling\".<ref name=\"Independent\"/> Louisa Mellor of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' found it to additionally contain elements of pathos and humour.<ref name=\"DoG\"/> ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Daniel Krupa found it to be a \"macabre morality tale\" that drew from \"the potential misery\" associated with Christmas.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Mellor noted that Matt sharpening knives at one point heightened a subtext of \"menace and unpredictability\" between Matt and Joe, while several prison-related references foreshadow the twist, including Joe's room layout, the noise of a cell hatch opening, Matt's line \"it's not an interrogation\" and Joe's line \"it's a job, not a jail\".<ref name=\"DoG\"/> Mark Monahan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' compared the storyline in which Harry is poisoned to \"[[The Landlady (short story)|The Landlady]]\", a short story by [[Roald Dahl]] also featuring a poisoner. Making a second Dahl comparison, Monahan found the segment with Greta similar to \"[[William and Mary (short story)|William and Mary]]\", in which William is revived after death in the form of a few functioning body parts that lack agency.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\nBoth Joe and Matt are unreliable narrators.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}} According to Zack Handlen, writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Matt resembles Hamm's ''[[Mad Men]]'' persona [[Don Draper]] in that both have a \"fundamental character flaw\" of cowardice which is not so obvious that people would find it untrustworthy. Handlen believed that Hamm found a \"link\" between \"the Perfect Man\" and \"the pathetic striver\" that \"defines them\", in the case of both Draper and Matt.<ref name=\"AVClub\"/> ''[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]''{{'}}s Abraham Riesman saw Matt and Joe as showing that \"even empathetic people can ruin lives\", a point emphasised in Matt telling Joe: \"You're empathetic. You care about people.\"<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> With Joe, Brooker commented that the viewer quickly loses sympathy in the third story, as he is obnoxious towards Beth and is hinted to have an issue with alcohol. Joe is \"possessive and has an explosive temper\" and Brooker believes him to be the \"root cause\" of the issues in his and Beth's relationship.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}} Handlen saw Joe as unable to process his relationship with Beth ending or her pregnancy, because Beth blocked him, preventing resolution.<ref name=\"AVClub\"/> On whether Joe deserved his punishment, Brooker said \"he did and he didn't\". He thought viewers may find Matt's predicament harsh because of his charm, with Hamm opining that Matt deserved punishment but should have a path to redemption.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\n[[File:Google Glass Explorer Edition.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Google Glass|[[Google Glass]] was widely seen as an inspiration for the Z-Eyes.<ref name=\"DoG\"/><ref

the Z-Eyes as an \"embedded technology\", Krupa summarised them as \"contact lenses which control our perception of reality and cannot be removed\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> The second story shows a use for

of ''The Guardian'' found that the cookie raised questions over whether AI have rights relating to slavery, torture and parenthood.<ref name=\"Guardian Wollaston\"/> Mellor related the cookie to the
