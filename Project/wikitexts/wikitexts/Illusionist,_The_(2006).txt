It is based loosely on [[Steven Millhauser]]'s short story [[The Barnum Museum|\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\"]]. The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] in turn-of-the-century [[Vienna]], who reunites with his childhood love, a woman far above his social standing. The film also depicts a fictionalized version of the [[Mayerling incident]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and opened the 2006 [[Seattle International Film Festival]]; it was distributed in limited release to theaters on August 18, 2006, and expanded nationwide on September 1. The film was a commercial and critical success.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a magic show involving [[necromancy]]. Later, Uhl explains the story of Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold.\n\nEisenheim was born Eduard Abramovich, the son of a cabinet-maker, and became interested in magic. He fell in love with Sophie, the [[Duchy of Teschen|Duchess von Teschen]], but the two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught and separated by force. Eisenheim studied magic by travelling the world, and fifteen years later, returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women and even murdered one. Leopold invites Eisenheim to conduct a private performance at the palace. During the performance, Eisenheim humiliates the Crown Prince in front of the royal guests; in response, he is banned from performing again in Vienna. When Sophie comes to offer him help, they make love. Eisenheim asks her to flee with him, but she is afraid that they will be executed. She reveals that the Crown Prince is planning a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against his elderly father, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].\n\nAt the [[Mayerling]] hunting lodge, Sophie tries to end her engagement with Leopold. Her body is discovered the next morning in the [[Vienna Woods]], an unknown man blamed. This throws Eisenheim into depression. He buys a theatre and begins a new series of magic shows, this time focusing on the summoning of dead spirits. Leopold secretly attends one, during which Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says that someone in the theater is her murderer. Leopold, unnerved, orders Uhl to arrest Eisenheim for fraud, but Eisenheim avoids jail by confessing to the public that his show is an illusion.\n\nEisenheim is threatened that if he summons Sophie in his next performance, he will be imprisoned. Uhl attends the performance, and in spite of the warnings, Eisenheim summons Sophie again. Uhl storms the stage with his officers, but to the shock of the audience, Eisenheim is revealed to be a spirit when Uhl's hand passes through him.\n\nUhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence\u2014a jewel from Leopold's sword and Sophie's locket\u2014which could implicate Leopold in Sophie's murder. Uhl has already informed the Emperor and the [[Austro-Hungarian General Staff]] of Leopold's conspiracy to seize the throne. As officers of the imperial guard of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] arrive, Leopold shoots himself in the head. Uhl leaves and places Sophie's locket in his pocket. He is now no longer Chief Inspector of Police.\n\nAs a boy approaches him, he is jostled by a bearded man in a long coat. The boy gives him a package containing Eisenheim's notebook about the Orange Tree trick, which Uhl had been unable to figure out. He asks the boy who gave him the notebook, and the boy replies \"Herr Eisenheim.\" He realizes the person who jostled him stole the locket. He chases after the man, but the man boards a train and escapes. Uhl realizes the jostling and the notebook are a message from the illusionist, and begins to rethink recent events. He concludes that Sophie and Eisenheim staged her death so that she could be free of Leopold, with her ghostly apparitions being nothing more than [[phantasmagoria]]. Uhl laughs delightedly at the brilliance of their plan. Far away, Sophie and Eisenheim start a new life together in a cabin at a beautiful mountain. Eisenheim places Sophie's locket in her palm.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Eisenheim the Illusionist / Eduard Abramovich\n** [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] as Young Eduard Abramovich\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Chief Inspector Walter Uhl\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Duchess Sophie von [[Duchy of Teschen|Teschen]]\n** [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Young Sophie von Teschen\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Crown Prince Leopold, heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager\n* [[Jake Wood]] as Jurka\n* [[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]] as Willgut\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}\nThe script was based loosely on \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\", a [[short story]] by [[Steven Millhauser]] from Millhauser's 1990 collection ''[[The Barnum Museum]]''. Together with ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' and ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'', ''The Illusionist'' was one of three films in 2006 to explore the world of [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]].\n\nMagic consultancy and technical advice during the production was supplied by [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[Ricky Jay]], Michael Weber and [[Scott Penrose]]. Director [[Neil Burger]] wrote, \"Starting in pre-production, James (Freedman) became a major collaborator; brainstorming, designing and refining everything from small sleight of hand tricks to major narrative set pieces. He worked with [[Edward Norton]] preparing him for his stage performances and acted as a hand double in various scenes. His contribution was enormous.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0250-0299/0292.htm | title= News (Number 292) | date=28 January 2006| publisher=magicweek.co.uk | access-date=2009-12-25}}</ref> [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]], who plays the teenage Eduard in the beginning of the film, also learned how to do the ball trick seen in those scenes.<ref>{{cite video |people= Screenwriter/director [[Neil Burger]] |title= [[Audio commentary]] for ''The Illusionist'' |medium= DVD |time=?{{When|date=December 2010}}  }}\n</ref>\n\nThe original story, on which the movie is based, does not include the artifice of the [[protagonist]] framing the crown prince for murder.\n\nAlthough the film is set in [[Austria]], it was filmed mostly in the [[Czech Republic]]. The city of [[Vienna]] is represented in the film by [[T\u00e1bor]] and [[Prague]], while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]]. The Crown Prince's castle is actually the historical fortress of [[Konopi\u0161t\u011b]] (located near [[Bene\u0161ov]]), formerly the home of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]. The front gates of Leopold's Vienna palace (the [[Hofburg]]) were actually the front gates of [[Prague Castle]]. All other shots were at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague.\n\n==Reception==\n\nAs of June 29, 2008 the film had earned worldwide box office receipts of $87,892,388, including $39,868,642 in the United States, exceeding its reported $16.5 million budget.<ref>{{mojo title|id=illusionist}}.
