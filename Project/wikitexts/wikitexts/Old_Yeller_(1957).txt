While Jim is away, Travis sets off to work in the cornfield, where he encounters a [[Black Mouth Cur]] he names \"Old Yeller\", as \"yeller\" is a [[dialect]] pronunciation of \"yellow\" and the dog's bark resembles a human yell. Travis unsuccessfully tries to shoo the dog away, but Arliss defends him from Travis. However, Yeller's habit of stealing meat from [[smokehouse]]s and robbing hens' nests does not endear him to Travis, but his mother agrees with the idea of Arliss having a dog.\n\nLater, Arliss tries to capture a [[American black bear|black bear]] cub by feeding it [[cornbread]] and grabbing it. Its angry mother hears her cub wailing and attacks, but Old Yeller frightens her away, winning over the family. Travis grows to love and respect Old Yeller, who comes to profoundly affect the boy's life.\n\nBud Searcy and his granddaughter Lisbeth come for supper one day, and Lisbeth takes Travis aside to tell him Old Yeller has been stealing food all over the county. After she and Bud leave, Travis scolds Old Yeller. The next day, Old Yeller proves himself as a cow dog by protecting Travis from Rose, their cow, and restraining her while Travis milks her.\n\nOne day, Old Yeller's original master, Burn Sanderson, arrives looking for his dog. Realizing that the Coates family really needs Old Yeller, he agrees to trade him to Arliss for a [[desert horned lizard|horny toad]] and a home-cooked meal. Sanderson later takes Travis aside and warns him of the growing plague of [[Rabies|hydrophobia (rabies)]].\n\nOne day, Travis sets out to trap a family of [[feral hogs]]. Advised by Bud Searcy, he sits in a tree, trying to rope them from above as Old Yeller corners them. However, Travis then falls into the group of hogs and is attacked by one. Old Yeller defends Travis as he crawls away with an injured leg. However, Old Yeller is severely injured by the hog and Travis hides him in a large hole. Travis' mother then retrieves Old Yeller and uses mule hair to suture his wounds. As Old Yeller recovers, Searcy warns the Coates family of hydrophobia in the area but Katie chastises him for trying to scare Travis. Searcy leaves, and Lisbeth stays with the Coateses to help them harvest corn. Travis assures Katie that the hogs were not rabid, and both he and Old Yeller recover.\n\nLater, the family sees their cow, Rose, stumbling and foaming at the mouth. Travis confirms that she is rabid and shoots her. While Katie and Lisbeth burn her body that night, a wolf suddenly attacks them. Katie's scream alerts Travis, who runs outside with a [[rifle]], just in time to see Old Yeller fighting off the wolf. Travis successfully shoots the wolf, but not before it bites Old Yeller on the neck. Katie tells Travis that because no healthy wolf would attack near a burning area, the wolf was rabid. Katie then suggests shooting Old Yeller, but Travis insists that they instead pen him in the [[corn crib]] to see if he shows symptoms of the disease. After remaining quarantined, the Coateses believe that Old Yeller escaped infection. However, one night, when Travis goes to feed Old Yeller, he growls at him aggressively. Travis suspects that Old Yeller may have been infected but says nothing. Later that night, Arliss obliviously tries to open the corn crib to release Old Yeller. Katie slams the door shut as Old Yeller snarls and tries to attack. Katie then tells Travis that Old Yeller is suffering and returns Arliss to the house. Katie returns with the rifle, but Travis takes it, reluctantly shoots Old Yeller and departs.\n\nUpset over his dog's death, Travis declines a new puppy sired by Old Yeller. Jim then returns with money and gifts for the family. Katie tells him about the dog, and Jim discusses it with Travis. Upon returning to the farmhouse, Travis observes the puppy stealing a piece of meat, a habit inherited from Old Yeller. Travis then accepts the puppy, \"Young Yeller,\" as his new dog.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:TommyKirkFessParker.jpg|thumb|Promotional Photo of [[Tommy Kirk]] and [[Fess Parker]] during filming]]\n* [[Spike (dog)|Spike]] as Old Yeller\n* [[Fess Parker]] as Jim Coates\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Katie Coates\n* [[Tommy Kirk]] as Travis Coates\n* [[Kevin Corcoran]] as Arliss Coates\n* [[Jeff York]] as Bud Searcy\n* [[Beverly Washburn]] as Lisbeth Searcy\n* [[Chuck Connors]] as Burn Sanderson\n\n==Comic book adaptation==\nThe film was adapted into a 1957 comic book published by [[Dell Comics]].
