Like its predecessors ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' (1999) and ''[[Walking with Beasts]]'' (2001), ''Walking with Monsters'' is narrated by [[Kenneth Branagh]].\n\n''Walking with Monsters'' is the final installment in the ''[[Walking with...]]'' series of documentaries and was envisioned as completing the series' so-called \"''Trilogy of Life''\", the previous ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' and ''Walking with Beasts'' having explored the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], respectively. Like its predecessors, ''Walking with Monsters'' employs computer-generated imagery and [[animatronics]], as well as [[live action]] footage shot at various locations, to reconstruct prehistoric life and environments. Owing to being the latest installment, the CGI in ''Walking with Monsters'' is more sophisticated, which also contributed to a heavier reliance on CGI than animatronics than in previous series. In total, over 600 scientists were consulted for advise during the production of ''Walking with Monsters''.\n\nAlthough ''Walking with Monsters'' attracted the least viewers out of any ''Walking with...'' series during its original airing<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=2006-05-10 |title=Planet Earth sees off CGI |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/10/broadcasting.bbc1 |access-date=2022-04-25 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> and received more mixed reviews, the series won an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More)]].

The Cambrian segment showcases strange early arthropods, such as the super-predator ''[[Anomalocaris]]'',<!--As of 2021 these fossils have been reclassified as Houcaris, but this is WP:OR--> and ''[[Haikouichthys]]'', described as the first [[vertebrate]]. In the subsequent [[Silurian]] segment, the episode follows the jawless fish ''[[Cephalaspis]]'', which is hunted by the giant marine scorpion ''[[Brontoscorpio]]''. The final segment of the episode, set in the [[Devonian]] period, follows the [[amphibian]]-like [[tetrapod]] ''[[Hynerpeton]]''. Although arthropods have by this point shrunk in size, ''Hynerpeton'' are instead preyed upon by large predatory fish, such as the shark ''[[Stethacanthus]]'' and the two-ton giant ''[[Hyneria]]''.\n| LineColor = 9790BB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber= 2\n| Title= Reptile's Beginnings\n| Aux1= 300/280 mya\n| DirectedBy= Chloe Leland\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|12|15|df=y}}\n| Viewers= {{Unreported UK viewers|4.24}}<ref name=\"barb\"/>\n| ShortSummary= The second episode begins in the [[coal forest]]s of the [[Carboniferous]], where high oxygen content in the atmosphere has allowed [[arthropod]]s to once more reach giant sizes.
