Welles adapted [[Booth Tarkington]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning [[The Magnificent Ambersons|1918 novel]], about the declining fortunes of a wealthy Midwestern family and the [[Effects of the automobile on societies|social changes brought by the automobile age]].

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles's first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |access-date=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.<ref name=\"NationalFilmRegistry\">{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=Dave |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html |title=U.S. Film Registry Adds 25 'Significant' Movies |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 26, 1991 |access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in their [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] city in the last few decades of the 19th century. As a young man, Eugene Morgan courts Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. She instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love, and spoils their child, George. The townspeople long to see George get his \"comeuppance.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century, Major Amberson gives a large party at the Amberson Mansion for George, who is home from college for the holidays. Eugene, now a widower who has just returned to town after 20 years, attends. George dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber, and ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]]. He instantly takes to Eugene's daughter Lucy.\n\nThe next day, George and Lucy take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack. Eugene's \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers for them to \"get a horse.\"  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene, after his vehicle is mobile again, gives everyone a ride back home. George is humiliated by the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel and his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nWilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments and soon dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy manufacturing automobiles, and again courts Isabel, who refuses to risk George's disapproval by telling him about their love. Lucy rejects George's marriage proposal by saying that he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are, and she leaves town. The Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner, where George, blaming him for turning Lucy against him, criticizes automobiles. The Ambersons are shocked by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right.\n\nThat evening, George learns from Aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. Enraged, he rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything that might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel and asks her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home to find that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass, and Isabel is seriously ill, but George will not allow her to come home for fear that she will renew her relationship with Eugene. He relents only when she starts to die. George refuses to let Eugene go upstairs to visit Isabel on her deathbed although she begs to see Eugene one last time.\n\nAfter Isabel's death, Major Amberson sinks into senility and dies. His estate is worthless. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George intends to live on Fanny's income while he trains to be a lawyer, but she reveals that she lost everything in bad investments, and they are left with only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chief who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a law clerk and finds higher paying work in a chemical factory, which gives him enough money for himself and Fanny to live on. George wanders the city and is dazed by the modern factories and slums, which have grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson mansion before it is sold, George prays by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see him receive his comeuppance.\n\nGeorge is seriously injured by an automobile. Lucy and Eugene go to see him at the hospital and reconcile with him. In a hospital corridor, Eugene tells Fanny that Isabel's spirit had inspired Eugene to bring George \"under shelter again,\" which implies that his and Fanny's financial security was assured.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer, Wilbur's sister\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson, Isabel's brother.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that, Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself, \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl\u2026. [H]e had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last= Moorehead|subject-link=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date= February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name= \"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1= Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang |last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher= [[Turner Broadcasting Systems]] |location=Atlanta, Georgia|access-date=May 20, 2009|quote= The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor policy]]<ref name= \"tcmarticle\" />\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires\u2026  But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see.

During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164.
