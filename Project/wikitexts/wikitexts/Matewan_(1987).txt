He arrives in Matewan, West Virginia in 1920 to organize miners against the Stone Mountain Coal Company. His introduction to the town is his witnessing of a mob of miners angry at wage cuts beating up black miners who intended to cross the picket line. He takes up residence at a boarding house run by a coal miner's widow, Elma Radnor ([[Mary McDonnell]]), and her 15-year-old son, Danny ([[Will Oldham]]), who is also a miner and a budding [[Baptist]] preacher. The miners are reluctant to bring the imported workers, both black and Italian into their union, a cause not helped by [[Charles Lively (labor spy)|C. E. Lively]], a spy for the company within the union, who tries to goad the miners into violence and secretly informs the [[Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency]] of the \"red\" Kenehan's presence.\n\nThe next day, two Baldwin\u2013Felts men, Hickey and Griggs, show up in town and take up residence at the Radnor [[boarding house]]. Danny at first refuses to give rooms to Hickey and Griggs, but Kenehan voluntarily moves to the hotel, freeing up a room for the two men and averting trouble for Mrs. Radnor. Hickey and Griggs then start their campaign against the union by forcibly [[eviction|evicting]] miners from company-owned houses in town. Mayor Testerman and Police Chief [[Sid Hatfield]] refuse to let them be evicted without eviction writs from [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. Hatfield deputizes all the men in town and tells them to go home and come back with their guns.\n\nThe Baldwin\u2013Felts men then turn their attention on the strikers' camp outside town, where the miners and their families are living in tents. At night, the armed strikebreakers fire shots into the camp, injuring some strikers. The next day, they enter the camp to demand that all food and clothing purchased at the [[company store]] with [[company scrip|scrip]] be turned over to them, but are thwarted by the arrival of armed [[hillbilly|hill people]], whose land was taken by the coal company. Expressing disdain for the noise caused by the gunmen's automobile the night before, their presence and sympathy for the miners compels the Baldwin\u2013Felts men to leave empty-handed. The slow arrival of the union's thinly stretched strike funds tests the patience of Danny Radnor and other miners who become disillusioned and turn to violence in spite of Kenehan's warnings. The miners are involved in a night-time shootout with the agents and Sephus is wounded. He is rescued by some hill people but not before he recognizes Lively as the infiltrator.\n\nLively tries to drive a wedge between Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator, leading the miners to plot to kill Kenehan. Danny overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme and is discovered and threatened by Hickey. That night, while preaching at the [[Free Will Baptist|Freewill]] church, Danny relates a [[parable]] about [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story, taking advantage of the now-inebriated detectives. Lively silently slips out of the back of the church while a miner runs to the camp to stop Few Clothes (Jones) from killing Kenehan. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the [[Tug Fork River]].\n\nLater, while Danny and his friend Hillard Elkins, are stealing coal from the mine, they are confronted by the detectives. Danny hides, while Elkins is tortured for information. He provides five names, and is killed by Griggs anyway. Lively mentions that the men he has named died in the mines years ago, and muses that the death of a young boy will complicate things.\n\nThe situation between the Baldwin\u2013Felts men and Chief Hatfield reaches a boiling point with the arrival of reinforcements with orders to carry out the evictions. The mayor tries to negotiate as Kenehan comes running to try to stop the fight. The sudden movement sets off a climactic [[Battle of Matewan|gunfight]] between the exposed mercenaries and the armed townspeople firing from barricades and rooftops. Hatfield shoots two men and survives the battle, but Kenehan is killed and the mayor is shot in the stomach. Griggs is brought down, while Hickey escapes to Elma Radnor's boarding house, where he is shot and killed by Elma Radnor. Seven Baldwin\u2013Felts men and two townspeople are ultimately killed.\n\nIn the epilogue, the narrator (revealed to be an elderly Danny recalling those days in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|\"Bloody Mingo\"]]) recounts that Mayor Testerman succumbed to his wounds and the mayor's wife married Chief Sid Hatfield. But Hatfield was later gunned down in broad daylight on the steps of the [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] Courthouse in [[Welch, West Virginia|Welch]], with Lively stepping up to deliver the ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]''. He recalls the event as the start of the [[West Virginia Coal Wars|Great Coalfield War]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div-col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Joe Kenehan\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as \"Few Clothes\" Johnson\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Elma Radnor\n* [[Will Oldham]] as Danny Radnor\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Police Chief [[Sid Hatfield]]\n* [[Ken Jenkins]] as Sephus Purcell\n* [[Gordon Clapp]] as Griggs\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] as Hickey\n* [[John Sayles]] as Hardshell Preacher\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Charles Lively (labor spy)|C.E.

Among the memorable characters is Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper), a young union organizer who comes to Matewan to buck the bosses. With his strong face and [[Harrison Ford]] good-looks, Cooper gives the film its heartbeat...Most notable of the black workers is 'Few Clothes' Johnson (James Earl Jones), a burly good-natured man with a powerful presence and a quick smile. Jones' performance practically glows in the dark. Also a standout is Sayles veteran David Strathairn as the sheriff with quiet integrity who puts his life on the line.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117793024.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety''].

Accessed: January 17, 2008.</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Vincent Canby]] lauded the acting and the cinematography in the film and wrote in his review, \"There's not a weak performance in the film, but I especially admired the work of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Tighe, Miss McDonnell, Miss Mette, Mr. Gunton, Mr. Strathairn and Mr. Mostel. They may be playing Social-Realist icons, but each manages to make something personal and idiosyncratic out of the material, without destroying the ballad-like style.  For the most part, Haskell Wexler's photography doesn't go overboard in finding poetry in the images.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9B0DE7DA143DF93BA1575BC0A961948260&oref=slogin Canby, Vincent].

Accessed: February 25, 2008.</ref>\n\nCritic Desson Howe liked the look of the film and wrote, \"Cinematographer Haskell Wexler etches the characters in dark charcoal against a misty background. You get the feeling of dirt, sweat and \u2013 despite the story's mythic intentions \u2013 the grim grey struggle of it all. And Sayles, struggling for authority from ''[[Return of the Secaucus 7]]'' through ''[[The Brother from Another Planet]]'', has finally tapped the vein.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/matewanpg13howe_a0b10a.htm Howe, Desson].

If Sayles\u2019s bite were as lethal as his bark, he might have given this a harder edge and a stronger conclusion.\"<ref>[https://jonathanrosenbaum.net/2021/08/matewan/ Rosenbaum, Jonathan], film review, September 1, 1987.
