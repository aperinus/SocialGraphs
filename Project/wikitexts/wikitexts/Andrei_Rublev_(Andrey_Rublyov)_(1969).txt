The film is loosely based on the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the 15th-century Russian [[Iconography|icon painter]]. The film features [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], [[Nikolai Grinko]], [[Ivan Lapikov]], Nikolai Sergeyev, [[Nikolai Burlyayev]] and Tarkovsky's wife [[Irma Raush]]. [[Savva Yamshchikov]], a famous Russian restorer and [[Art history|art historian]], was a scientific consultant of the film.\n\n''Andrei Rublev'' is set against the background of early-[[Grand Duchy of Moscow|15th-century Russia]]. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, it seeks to depict a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] portrait of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Russia]]. Tarkovsky sought to create a film that shows the artist as \"a world-historic figure\" and \"[[Christianity]] as an axiom of Russia's historical identity\"<ref name=jhoberman>{{cite web | last = Hoberman | first = Jim | title = Andrei Rublev: An Icon Emerges | publisher = [[The Criterion Collection]] | url = https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/43-andrei-rublev-an-icon-emerges | access-date = 2019-04-18 }}</ref> during a turbulent period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]] that ultimately resulted in the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. \n\nThe film's themes include artistic freedom, religion, political ambiguity, [[autodidacticism]], and the making of art under a repressive regime.

The film was further cut for commercial reasons upon its U.S. release through [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1973. As a result, several versions of the film exist.\n\nAlthough these issues with censorship obscured and truncated the film for many years following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version, ''Andrei Rublev'' has come to be regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]], and has often been ranked highly in both the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' and directors' polls.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b7433c1 |title=Andrei Rublev (1966) |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=March 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313182011/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b7433c1 |archive-date=13 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics/|title=Critics' top 100|work=bfi.org.uk|access-date=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026034922/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/critics|archive-date=26 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/|title=Directors' top 100|work=bfi.org.uk|access-date=13 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418144845/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors|archive-date=18 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n''Andrei Rublev'' is divided into eight episodes, with a prologue and an epilogue only loosely related to the main film. The main film charts the life of the great icon painter through seven episodes which either parallel his life or represent episodic transitions in his life. The background is [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|15th century Russia]], a turbulent period characterized by fighting between rival princes and the [[List of conflicts in Europe during Turco-Mongol rule|Tatar invasions]].\n\n=== Prologue ===\n\nThe film's ''prologue'' shows the preparations for a [[hot air balloon]] ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim ([[Nikolay Glazkov]]) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. \n\nAt the very moment of his attempt, an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand into the face of one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he cannot prevent a crash-landing shortly after. \n\nHe is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, one of many horses in the film.\n\n[[File:Bosom of Abraham by Daniel Chorny.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Fresco ''Bosom of Abraham'' by the historical [[Daniil Chyorny]] (c. 1360\u20131430)]]\n\n=== I. ''The Jester'' (Summer 1400) ===\n[[Andrei Rublev|Andrei]] ([[Anatoly Solonitsyn]]), [[Daniel Chorny|Daniil]] ([[Nikolai Grinko]]) and Kirill ([[Ivan Lapikov]]) are wandering monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. \n\nAndrei is the observer, a humanist who searches for the good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. \n\nThe three have just left the [[Andronikov Monastery]], where they have lived for many years, heading to [[Moscow]]. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, where a group of villagers is being entertained by a jester ([[Rolan Bykov]]). The jester, or [[skomorokh]], is a bitterly sarcastic enemy of the state and the Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the [[Boyar]]s. He ridicules the monks as they come in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. \n\nShortly after, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped, Kirill returns. Kirill wants to leave, so Andrei wakes up resting Daniil. Unaware of what has happened to the jester, Daniil thanks the villagers for the shelter. As they walk on, the heavy rain starts again.\n\n=== II. ''Theophanes the Greek'' (Summer\u2013Winter\u2013Spring\u2013Summer 1405\u20131406) ===\nKirill arrives at the workshop of [[Theophanes the Greek]] (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, who is working on a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people.\n\nHis young apprentices have all run away to the town square, where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in [[Moscow]]. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who is renowned for his icon painting in the outside world, an admiration shared by Kirill and Theophanes. \n\nA short while later at the Andronikov Monastery, a messenger arrives from Moscow to ask for assistance in decorating the cathedral, as arranged, but instead of Kirill, he propositions Andrei. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes\u2019 offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes to say goodbye to his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and, in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the [[Secularity|secular]] world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is followed by his dog, but, in anger, he savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead.\n\n=== III. ''The Passion'' (1406) ===\n\nAndrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma ([[Mikhail Kononov]]). While walking in the woods, Andrei and Foma have a conversation about Foma's flaws, and in particular lying. Foma confesses to having taken honey from an [[apiary]], after Andrei notices his cassock is sticky, and he smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. \n\nWhile Foma has talent as an artist, he is less interested in the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with the practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his [[azure (color)|azure]], a color which at the time was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away, unimpressed by his attitude to art. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan; after poking it with a stick, he admires its wing and fantasizes about having a [[bird's-eye view]].\n\nIn the forest, Andrei and Theophanes argue about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn't understand how he can be a painter and maintain such views. This section contains a [[Passion Play]], or a [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's Crucifixion]], on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the events of Christ's death and expresses his belief that the men who crucified him were obeying God's will and loved him.\n\n=== IV. ''The Holiday ''(1408) ===\nCamping for the night on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are collecting firewood for their traveling party when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate, he comes upon a large group of naked [[Paganism|pagans]] who are conducting a lit-torch ritual for [[Kupala Night]]. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, tied to the crossbeam of a hut, his arms raised in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion, and is threatened with drowning in the morning. \n\nA woman named Marfa ([[Nelly Snegina]]), dressed only in a fur coat, approaches Andrei. After explaining to Andrei, who lashes her with prejudice, that her people are persecuted for their beliefs, she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, with Daniil now present, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans, including Marfa. In the struggle, her lover is captured, but she manages to escape by swimming naked into the river, passing right by Andrei's boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.\n\n=== V. ''The Last Judgment ''(Summer 1408) ===\nAndrei and Daniil are working on the decoration of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for two months the walls are still white and bare. A messenger, Patrikei ([[Yuri Nikulin]]), arrives with word from the Bishop, who is furious, to say they have until autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road in the middle of a field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the ''Last Judgement'' as he doesn't want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and wanting to work, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious church.\n \nStone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Duke's mansion. The Prince is dissatisfied with the work done, and wants it to be redone, more in line with his tastes, but the workers already have another job, which is to help set up the mansion of the Grand Duke's brother, and they promptly refuse and leave, after indignantly proclaiming that the Grand Duke's brother will have a much more splendid home than he himself. While walking on a path through a nearby forest towards the mansion of their client, the artisans are assaulted by soldiers sent by the Grand Duke, and [[Blinding (punishment)|their eyes are gouged out]], leaving them incapable of practicing their craft.\n\nBack at the church, Andrei is dismayed by the news of the attack on the artisans and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov), a young apprentice who escaped the assault unharmed, reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. A young woman, Durochka ([[Irma Raush]]), whose name identifies her as a holy fool, or [[Yurodivy]], wanders in to take shelter from the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence inspires in Andrei the idea to paint a [[Banquet|feast]].\n\n=== VI. ''The Raid'' (Autumn 1408) ===\nWhile the Grand Duke is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry younger brother forms an allegiance with a group of [[Tatars]] and raids [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. In a flashback, the Grand Duke and his brother attend a religious service in a church, and the rivalry and animosity between them is clear. The invasion of the combined armed forces, their men on horseback, results in great carnage: the city is burned, the citizens murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs. \n\nFoma, who is in the midst of the chaos, narrowly escapes being killed in the city by a Russian soldier and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei, who is also in the church, saves Durochka from being raped by a Russian soldier by killing him with an axe. The bishop's messenger Patrikei is also present; he is tortured with fire to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned with a flaming torch, he has hot liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth silencing his screams. Then he is dragged away feet first, tied to a horse.\n\nIn the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the cruelty of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for his killing of another man.\n\n[[Image:Rublev's saviour.jpg|thumb|[[Christ the Redeemer (icon)|''Christ the Redeemer'' icon]] from the so-called ''Zvenigorod Chin'' (c. 1410; today at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow)]]\n\n=== VII. ''Silence'' (Winter 1412) ===\n:''Note: In the 205-minute version known as The Passion According to Andrei, this episode is titled The Charity''\nAndrei is once again at the [[Andronikov Monastery]] as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow companion in silence.\n\nIn the same monastery, refugees discuss the problems plaguing their respective home towns, and one man who appears starts telling, in a broken voice, of his escape from [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir.]] He is recognized by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his time away from the monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted after much pleading and initial rejection, but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures 15 times in penance. \n\nSoon, a group of [[Tatars]] stops at the monastery while traveling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who have experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka, however, is too simple-minded to understand or remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by the shining breastplate carried by one of them. The group taunt and play with her, but the Tatar takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her in a blanket, promising to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. \n\nAndrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is delighted with the Tatar's gifts, and she rides away with the Tatars. Kirill approaches Andrei and talks to him for the first time since their departure from the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck and a great sin, and that she will be let go. Andrei still does not speak, despite Kirill's despaired pleading, and continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.\n\n=== VIII. ''The Bell ''(Spring\u2013Summer\u2013Winter\u2013Spring 1423\u20131424) ===\nThis episode concerns Boriska, ([[Nikolai Burlyayev]]) the young son of an expert bellmaker. Men have been sent by the prince to search out Boriska's father in order to ask him to cast a bronze bell for a church. Instead, they come upon Boriska, who tells them that the area has been ravaged by a plague, and that his father, as well as all his family, is dead. He furthermore tells them that he is the only one who possesses the secret, delivered by his father at his death bed, of casting a quality bronze bell, and asks them to take him with them, as he is, by his own contention, the only person left alive who can complete the task successfully. The men are initially dismissive, but soon agree, and Boriska is put in charge of the project.\n\nAt the site, Boriska contradicts and challenges the instincts of the workers in choosing the location of the pit, the selection of the proper clay, the building of the mold, the firing of the furnaces and finally the hoisting of the bell. The workers soon complain to him that his father treated them differently and one worker, who refuses his orders, is flogged in punishment. The process of making the bell grows into a huge, expensive endeavour with many hundreds of workers and Boriska makes several risky decisions, guided only by his instincts; soon, even he doubts the project's prospective success. Andrei, who has arrived on the scene, silently watches Boriska during the casting, and the younger man notices him too.\n\nDuring the bell-making, the ''[[skomorokh]]'' (jester) from the first sequence makes a reappearance amongst the crowds who have come to watch the bell being raised up and, seeing Andrei, he threatens to kill him, mistaking him for Kirill, his denouncer of years past. Kirill's implication of the man led to him being imprisoned and tortured. Kirill soon arrives and intervenes on behalf of the silent Andrei and later privately confesses to Andrei that his sinful envy of his talent dissipated once he heard Andrei had abandoned painting and that it was he who had denounced the ''skomorokh''. Kirill then criticizes Andrei for allowing his God-given talent for painting to go to waste and pleads with him to resume his artistry, but receives no response.\n\n[[File:Rublev Troitsa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Andrei Rublev's famous icon of the Holy Trinity (c.&nbsp;1410; [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow)]]\nAs the bell-making nears completion, Boriska's confidence slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he's seemingly succeeded at the task. As the furnaces are opened and the molten metal pours into the mould, he privately asks God for help. The work crew takes over as Boriska makes several attempts to fade into the background of the activities. After completion, the bell is hoisted into its tower and the Grand Duke and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by a priest. As the bell is prepared to be rung, some Italian ambassadors in the royal entourage express their doubt over the prospective success of its ringing. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know that if the bell fails to ring, the Grand Duke will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Duke has already had his brother, the one who raided Vladimir, beheaded.) \n\nThere is a quiet, agonizing tension among the crowd as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals the white-robed Durochka, leading a horse and preceded by a child which is, presumably, hers, as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. He admits his father never actually told him his bell-casting secret. Andrei, impressed by the effect the successful ringing has had on the rejoicing crowd, realizes the joy that his own art might bring. He comforts Boriska, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: \u201cYou\u2019ll cast bells. I\u2019ll paint icons.\u201d Andrei then sees Durochka, the boy and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance. The eighth part of the film ends with this scene and it is followed by an epilogue.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe ''epilogue'' is the only part of the film in color and shows time-aged, but still vibrant, details of several of Andrei Rublev's actual icons. The icons are shown in the following order: ''Enthroned Christ'', ''Twelve Apostles'', ''The Annunciation'', ''Twelve Apostles'', ''Jesus entering Jerusalem'', ''Birth of Christ'', ''Enthroned Christ'', ''Transfiguration of Jesus'', ''Resurrection of Lazarus'', ''The Annunciation'', ''Resurrection of Lazarus'', ''Birth of Christ'', ''Trinity'', ''Archangel Michael'', ''Paul the Apostle'', ''The Redeemer''. The final scene [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|crossfades]] from the icons and shows four horses standing by a river in thunder and rain.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] \u2013 [[Andrei Rublev]]\n* [[Ivan Lapikov]] \u2013 Kirill\n* [[Nikolai Grinko]] \u2013 [[Daniel Chorny|Daniil Chyorny]]\n* [[Nikolai Sergeyev (actor)|Nikolai Sergeyev]] \u2013 [[Theophanes the Greek]]\n* [[Irma Raush]] \u2013 Durochka (the [[holy fool]] girl)\n* [[Nikolai Burlyayev]] \u2013 Boriska\n* [[Yuriy Nazarov (actor)|Yuriy Nazarov]] \u2013 Prince [[Yury of Zvenigorod]]/Grand Duke [[Vasily I of Moscow]]\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]] \u2013 Patrikei the messenger\n* [[Rolan Bykov]] \u2013 the [[Skomorokh]]\n* [[Mikhail Kononov]] \u2013 Foma\n* [[Nikolai Grabbe]] \u2013 [[sotnik]] Stepan\n* [[Dmitry Orlovsky]] \u2013 old master (voiced by [[Ivan Ryzhov]])\n* [[Nikolay Glazkov]] \u2013 Yefim\n* Nelly Snegina \u2013 Marfa\n* [[Bolot Beyshenaliyev]] \u2013 [[Edigu]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Nogai Horde]]\n* Igor Donskoy \u2013 [[Jesus]] in the Passion Play\n* [[Irina Miroshnichenko]] \u2013 [[Mary Magdalene]] in the Passion Play\nThe voices of the Grand Duke's children were provided by [[Klara Rumyanova]].\n\n==Production==\nIn 1961, while working on his first feature film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'', Tarkovsky made a proposal to [[Mosfilm]] for a film on the life of Russia's greatest icon painter, [[Andrei Rublev]]. The contract was signed in 1962 and the first [[Film treatment|treatment]] was approved in December 1963. Tarkovsky and his co-screenwriter [[Andrei Konchalovsky]] worked for more than two years on the script, studying medieval writings and chronicles and books on [[Middle Ages|medieval history]] and art. In April 1964 the script was approved and Tarkovsky began working on the film.<ref name=\"mturovskaya\"/> At the same time the script was published in the influential film magazine ''Iskusstvo Kino'', and was widely discussed among historians, film critics and ordinary readers. The discussion on ''Andrei Rublev'' centered on the sociopolitical and historical, and not the artistic aspects of the film.\n\nAccording to Tarkovsky, the original idea for a film about the life of Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor [[Vasily Livanov]]. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ciwilko | first = Artur | title = Interview Andrzej Tarkowski \u2014 o filmie \"Rublow\" | journal = Ekran | volume = 12 | pages = 11 | year = 1965 | url = https://www.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Rublov.html | access-date = 2007-12-09 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211124453/http://www.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Rublov.html| archive-date= 11 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev.

Solonitsyn, who had read the film script in the film magazine ''Iskusstvo Kino'', was very enthusiastic about the role, traveled to Moscow at his own expense to meet Tarkovsky and even declared that no one could play this role better than him.<ref name=mciment>{{cite journal | last1 = Ciment | first1 = Michel | last2 = Schnitzer | first2 = Luda & Jean | title = Interview L'artiste dans l'ancienne Russe et dans l'URSS nouvelle (Entretien avec Andrei Tarkovsky) | journal = Positif | volume = 109 | pages = 1\u201313 | date = October 1969 | url = http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Rublov.html | access-date = 2007-12-08 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130209154045/http://people.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Rublov.html | archive-date = 9 February 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Tarkovsky felt the same, saying that \"with Solonitsyn I simply got lucky\".

The film was thus able to express the co-dependence of an artist's art and his personal life. In a 1969 interview, Tarkovsky stated that the flying man in the prologue is \"the symbol of daring, in the sense that creation requires from man the complete offering of his being. Whether one wishes to fly before it has become possible, or cast a bell without having learned how to do it, or paint an icon \u2013 all these acts demand that, for the price of his creation, man should die, dissolve himself in his work, give himself entirely.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last=Gianvito | first=John | title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series) | year=2006 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | isbn=1-57806-220-9 | page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe color sequence of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, ''The Trinity''. One reason for including this color finale was, according to Tarkovsky, to give the viewer some rest and to allow him to detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.<ref name=\"mciment\"/>\n\n===Editing===\nThe first cut of the film was known as ''Andrei [[Passion (music)|Passion]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u044e}}, ''Strasti po Andryeyu'', \"The Passion according to Andrei\"<!--translator's note for those who overtrust google translate: cf.

The first cut of the film was over 195 minutes in length prior to being edited down to its released length. The first cut was completed in July 1966.

The ministry's demands for cuts first resulted in a 190-minute version. Despite Tarkovsky's objections expressed in a letter to Alexey Romanov, the chairman of Goskino, the ministry demanded further cuts, and Tarkovsky trimmed the length to 186 minutes.<ref name=tvinokurova>{{cite journal | last = Vinokurova | first = Tatyana | title = Khozdenye po mukam Andreya Rublyova | journal = Iskusstvo Kino | volume = 10 | pages = 63\u201376 | location = Moscow | year = 1989 }}</ref>\n\nRobert Bird in his analysis of the comparison of the first cut of the film to the final Tarkovsky cut of the edited film summarized the editing process stating: <blockquote>\"The most conspicuous cuts were the most graphic shots of the stonemasons' gouged-out eyes, the burning cow, and the horse being lanced (although its horrific fall remained). Four embedded scenes of flashbacks or fantasies were also cut completely: Foma's fantasy of flight in episode two, Andrei's reminiscence of the three monks under a rain-soaked oak tree in episode four, the younger prince's fantasy of humiliating the Grand Duke in episode five, and Boriska's recollection of the bellfounding in episode seven. All in all, I have counted thirty-six shots which were completely deleted in the 185-minute version of Andrei Rublev, and about eighty-five which were considerably abbreviated, including nine very long takes which are split each into two or more parts. The total number of shots went from 403 to 390, with the average shot length dropping from 31\" to 28\". The only sequence which remained inviolable was the Epilogue in color.\"<ref>Bird, Robert. ''Andrei Rublev''. BFI Film Series Library. Page 34.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Depictions of violence===\nSeveral scenes within the film depict violence, torture and cruelty toward animals, which sparked controversy at the time of release. Most of these scenes took place during the raid of Vladimir, including one showing the blinding and the torture of a monk. The scenes involving cruelty toward animals were largely simulated. For example, during the Tatar raid of Vladimir a cow is set on fire. In reality the cow had an [[asbestos]]-covered coat and was not physically harmed; however, one scene depicts the real death of a horse. The horse falls from a flight of stairs and is then stabbed by a spear. To produce this image, Tarkovsky injured the horse by shooting it in the neck and then pushed it from the stairs, causing the animal to falter and fall down the flight of stairs. From there, the camera pans off the horse onto some soldiers to the left and then pans back right onto the horse, and we see the horse struggling to get its footing having fallen over on its back before being stabbed by the spear. The animal was then shot in the head afterward off camera. This was done to avoid the possibility of harming what was considered a less expendable, highly prized stunt horse. The horse was brought in from a [[slaughterhouse]], killed on set, and then returned to the abattoir for commercial consumption. In a 1967 interview for ''Literaturnoe obozrenie'', interviewer Aleksandr Lipkov suggested to Tarkovsky that \"the cruelty in the film is shown precisely to shock and stun the viewers. And this may even repel them.\" In an attempt to downplay the cruelty Tarkovsky responded: \"No, I don't agree. This does not hinder viewer perception. Moreover we did all this quite sensitively. I can name films that show much more cruel things, compared to which ours looks quite modest.\"<ref name=\"alipkov\"/>\n\n==Release and censorship==\nThe film premiered with a single screening at the Dom Kino in Moscow in 1966. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, despite some criticism of the film's naturalistic depiction of violence.<ref name=\"mturovskaya\"/> But the film failed to win approval for release from Soviet censors; the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] wrote in its review that \"the film's ideological erroneousness is not open to doubt.\" ''Andrei Rublev'' was accused of being \"anti-historical\" in its failure to portray the context of its hero's life: the rapid development of large cities and the struggle against the Mongols.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andrei Tarkovsky's poetics of cinema|last=Thomas.|first=Redwood|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=9781443822404|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=119|oclc=745970207}}</ref> In February 1967, Tarkovsky and Alexei Romanov complained that the film was not yet approved for a wide release but refused to cut further scenes from the film.<ref name=\"tvinokurova\"/>\n\n''Andrei Rublev'' was invited to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1967 as part of a planned retrospective of Soviet film on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. The official answer was that the film was not yet completed and could not be shown at the film festival. A second invitation was made by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to screen at the festival out of competition, and it was screened just once at 4 A.M. on the final day of the festival. Audience response nevertheless was enthusiastic, and the film won the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI]] prize. Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.<ref name=\"mlefanu\"/>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, influential admirers of Tarkovsky's work\u2014including the film director [[Grigori Kozintsev]], the composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and Yevgeny Surkov, the editor of ''Iskusstvo Kino''<ref name=\"vjohnson\"/>\u2014began pressuring for the release of ''Andrei Rublev''. Tarkovsky and his second wife, [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]], wrote letters to other influential personalities in support of the film's release, and Larisa Tarkovskaya even went with the film to [[Alexei Kosygin]], then the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]].\n\nDespite Tarkovsky's refusal to make further cuts, ''Andrei Rublev'' finally was released on December 24, 1971, in the 186-minute 1966 version.

Here it is 186-minute long, whereas, in the initial profile (beginning of the article), it is stated as 183 min. --> cut of the film over the original 205-minute version:\n\n<blockquote>Nobody has ever cut anything from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In the first version, the film was 3 hours and 20 minutes long. In the second \u2014 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed the subject matter nor what was important in the film for us. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, as opposed to a mere unpleasant impression that would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who, during long discussions, were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first, I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.<ref name=\"mciment\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe original 1966 version of the film titled as ''The Passion According to Andrei'' was published by [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2018 and released in both DVD and Blu-Ray format.<ref>The Criterion Collection.

Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tatars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was in black and white as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when ''Andrei Rublev'' was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV.
