J. Soles]], [[Sean Young]], and [[John Candy]]. Ramis wrote the film with [[Len Blum]] and [[Daniel Goldberg (producer)|Dan Goldberg]], the latter of whom also served as producer alongside Reitman. Numerous actors, including [[John Larroquette]], [[John Diehl (actor)|John Diehl]], [[Conrad Dunn]], [[Judge Reinhold]], [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Timothy Busfield]], and [[Bill Paxton]], appear in the film in some of the earliest roles of their careers. The film's score was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]].\n\nMurray stars as John Winger, an immature taxi driver who, after losing his job and his girlfriend, decides to enlist in the [[United States Army]] with his friend Russell Ziskey (Ramis). The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, and was a commercial success.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nWithin a few hours, [[Louisville, Kentucky]] cab driver John Winger loses his job, his apartment, his car, and his girlfriend Anita, who has grown tired of his immaturity. Realizing his limited prospects, he joins the [[United States Army|Army]]. He talks his best friend Russell Ziskey, a vocational [[English as a Second Language|ESL]] teacher, into joining him, and they go to a recruiting office and are soon sent off to basic training at nearby Fort Arnold. \n\nUpon arrival, they meet their fellow recruits and their [[Drill instructor|drill sergeant]], Sergeant Hulka. Following in-processing, the recruits introduce themselves and explain their reasons for enlisting in the Army. One of them, Dewey \"Ox\" Oxberger, says he wants to lose weight and be respected by his fellow trainees and women in general. While outgoing, John stands out as a [[slacker]] throughout basic training, but he and Russell become romantically involved with [[Military Police Corps (United States)|MPs]] Louise Cooper and Stella Hansen.\n\nAfter Hulka discovers that John and Russell have gone [[AWOL]] from basic training, Russell confesses his mistake, but John keeps silent. Hulka orders Russell to scrub garbage cans for 24 hours, while ordering the rest of the platoon to do kitchen patrol for the next two weekends. \n\nIn the latrines, Hulka privately tells John that he is not soldier material. John then tells him he can kick him out of the Army if he desires, but to otherwise leave him alone. Hulka offers to allow him a punch, but John misses so Hulka punches him in the stomach, reminding him to learn a lesson from the encounter.\n\nDuring the night, John attempts to escape back to Louisville. Russell awakens, discovers John's absence, finds him attempting to leave base and angrily intervenes, as it was John's idea they both enlist. Louise and Stella find them fighting and drive them back to their barracks without reporting them. John honors Russell's request for both of them to continue basic training.\n\nAs graduation approaches, Hulka is injured when the haughty and dull-witted Captain Stillman, the platoon's commanding officer, orders a mortar crew to fire without first setting target coordinates. \n\nLater, members of Hulka's platoon sneak off base and visit a mud wrestling bar, where John convinces Ox to mud wrestle with a group of women for $400. When MPs and police raid the club, Stella and Louise help John and Russell escape. The rest of the platoon are returned to base, where Stillman reprimands them for being arrested and threatens to report them to the base commander, General Barnicke, and make them repeat basic training.\n\nJohn and Russell, after having sex with Stella and Louise, return to base. John motivates the disheartened platoon with a speech and begins preparing them for graduation. After a night of practice, they oversleep and upon awakening, they realize they are late for the ceremony. They rush to the parade ground, where John leads them in an improvised, yet highly coordinated, drill display. Impressed upon learning that they completed their training without a drill sergeant, Barnicke assigns them to his EM-50 project in [[Italy]].\n\nIn Italy, the platoon is reunited with a recovered Hulka and tasked with guarding the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle, an [[armored personnel carrier]] disguised as a [[GMC Motorhome|recreational vehicle]]. John and Russell steal it to visit Stella and Louise, who are stationed in [[West Germany]]. When Stillman finds the vehicle missing, he launches an unauthorized mission to retrieve it, against Hulka's objections. \n\nStillman inadvertently leads the platoon across the border into [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]. Hulka jumps from the truck before the [[Soviet Army]] captures it, and makes a mayday radio call that John and Russell hear. Realizing that their platoon is in danger, John, Russell, Stella, and Louise take the EM-50 and infiltrate the Soviet base where the platoon is being held, and, aided by Hulka, rescue the platoon.\n\nUpon returning to the US, John, Russell, Louise, Stella, and Hulka are hailed as heroes, and are each awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].{{efn|The second highest U.S. military decoration, after the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Army Regulation 670&ndash;1: Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia|url = https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN30302-AR_670-1-000-WEB-1.pdf|publisher = [[United States Department of the Army|U.S. Department of the Army]]|location = Washington, DC|date = January 26, 2021|access-date = August 29, 2021|chapter = Wear of Decorations, Service Medals, Badges, Unit Awards, and Appurtenances|pages = 50\u201355}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title = Department of the Army Pamphlet 670&ndash;1: Guide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia|chapter-url = https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN30948-PAM_670-1-000-WEB-1.pdf|publisher = [[United States Department of the Army|U.S. Department of the Army]]|location = Washington, DC|date = January 26, 2021|access-date = August 29, 2021|chapter = Order of precedence by category of medal|pages = 259\u2013262}}</ref>}} Hulka retires and opens a restaurant franchise; Stella appears on the cover of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''; Cooper is interviewed for ''RoadLife'' magazine; Ox makes the cover of ''[[Tiger Beat]]''; Russell appears in ''Guts'' magazine; John appears on the cover of ''Newsworld''; and Captain Stillman is reassigned to a weather station near [[Nome, Alaska]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- Actors with WP articles only; as named and in credits order -->\n* [[Bill Murray]] as John Winger\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Russell Ziskey\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Sergeant Hulka\n* [[P.

Len Blum and Dan Goldberg wrote the screenplay in [[Toronto]] and read it to Reitman, who was in [[Los Angeles]], over the phone, who in turn would give the writers notes. Cheech and Chong's manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control. Reitman then suggested to Goldberg that they change the two main characters to ones suited for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, figuring that if they could interest Ramis and let him tailor the script for the two of them, he could convince Murray to do it.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\n===Casting===\nRamis had already co-written ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''Meatballs'', and ''[[Caddyshack]]'', but was relatively unknown as a film actor.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> His best-known acting work prior to ''Stripes'' was as a cast member for the late-night TV sketch comedy ''[[Second City Television]]'', which he had quit a few years earlier.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Caldwell |first1=Sara C. |first2=Marie-Eve S. |last2=Kielson |title=So You Want to be A Screenwriter: How to Face the Fears and Take the Risks |publisher=Allworth Press |location=New York |date=2000 |page=77 |isbn=978-1-58115-062-9}}</ref> [[Columbia Pictures]] did not like Ramis's audition but Reitman told the studio that he was hiring the comedian anyway.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> P.

[[Sean Young]] was cast based on her looks, and Reitman felt that her \"sweetness\" would go well with Ramis.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> [[P. J. Soles]] tested with Murray and they got along well together. [[John Diehl]] had never auditioned before and won his first paying job as an actor. Goldberg knew [[John Candy]] from Toronto and told Reitman that he should be in the film; he was not required to audition.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nReitman was a fan of the Westerns that [[Warren Oates]] had been in and wanted someone who was strong and whom everyone respected to control the film's misfit platoon. Reinhold said that during filming Oates would tell stories about working on films like ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' and they would be enthralled. Reitman wanted \"a little bit of weight in the center\", and added the argument between Hulka and Winger.<ref name=\"gillis\" /> It was not played for laughs and allowed Murray to do a serious scene, something he had not done before. During filming one of the obstacle courses scenes, Reitman told the actors to grab Oates and drag him into the mud without telling the veteran actor about it to see what would happen and get a genuine reaction. Oates' front tooth got chipped in the process and he yelled at Reitman for what he did.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\n===Filming===\nEvery scene had some element of improvisation due in large part to Murray and Ramis. Much of the mud wrestling scene was made up on the spot by Reitman. Candy felt uncomfortable during filming, but Reitman talked him through it. The spatula scene in the kitchen of the general's house was filmed at three in the morning, after the cast and crew had been up the entire day. Murray improvised the \"[[Aunt Jemima]] Treatment\" sequence and Soles reacted naturally to whatever he said and did.<ref name=\"gillis\" />\n\nFilming began in [[Kentucky]] in November 1980, then moved to California in December. Principal photography ended on Stage 20 at Burbank Studios on January 29, 1981. The production was allowed to shoot the army scenes at [[Fort Knox]], the city scenes in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and the Czechoslovakia scenes at the closed Chapeze Distillery (owned by [[Jim Beam]]) in [[Clermont, Kentucky|Clermont]], with a budget of $9\u201310{{nbsp}}million and a 42-day shooting schedule. Reitman, Goldberg, and Ramis were involved in a detailed negotiation with the Department of Defense to make the film conducive to the recruiting needs of the military, in exchange for subsidies in the form of free labor and location and equipment access.<ref>{{cite book |first1=David L. |last1=Robb |title=Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies |date=2004 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, N.Y. |isbn=978-1591021827}}</ref>\n\nDunn remembered Candy inviting the men in the platoon to his house while filming was under way, for a homemade spaghetti dinner and to watch the famous [[Leonard\u2013Dur\u00e1n II|Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n II No M\u00e1s Fight]] (November 25, 1980). He recalled that he and Candy were the only two cast members who knew the lyrics to the song \"[[Do Wah Diddy Diddy|Doo Wah Diddy]]\" and taught them to the rest of the company. \"I really enjoyed playing Psycho\", he said.<ref name=\"CD Interview 2011\"/>\n\nIn 1993 Murray reflected, \"I'm still a little queasy that I actually made a movie where I carry a machine gun. But I felt if you were rescuing your friends it was okay.

They become lost in a jungle and are captured by Spanish-speaking [[guerrillas]]. They are taken to camp and nearly shot before Winger saves the day by singing the chorus of [[Tito Rodriguez]]'s \"[[Quando, Quando, Quando]]\", effectively winning over their captors. Winger and Ziskey then leave and rejoin the special forces unit as it is re-boarding the plane. Other deleted scenes include a longer sequence of Winger talking Ziskey into joining the Army with him; Captain Stillman being called out as a liar by Winger when he blames another officer for his neglect in the mortar incident that injured Sgt. Hulka; Hulka giving everyone but John and Russell the weekend off in Italy while assigning them to guard and clean the EM-50, explaining cheerfully that his only reason for doing so is that he doesn't like John; and Russell saying he won't go rescue the platoon because he doesn't want to kill OR die while John warms up to the idea of mounting a rescue via the EM-50. The last two deleted scenes notably have John Winger being told that the platoon members dislike him (directly by Hulka, and indirectly by Russell when he tells John that the platoon hates his guts) which is in contrast to the positive reactions to Winger in the final act of the theatrically-released film.\n\nIn January 2012, the extended cut of the film was released on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Stripes-Extended-Blu-ray-Harold-Ramis/dp/B005PHTSTC|title=Stripes (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=February 15, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Stripes-Blu-ray/26773/#Review|title=Stripes Blu-ray Review|last=Liebman|first=Martin|date=October 22, 2011|website=Blu-ray.com|access-date=February 15, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Re-release==\nFor the 40th anniversary of the film's release, ''Stripes'' re-opened in theaters on August 29 to September 2, 2021, with a special introduction from Bill Murray and Ivan Reitman.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/stripes-rerelease-2021/ |title=Stripes Returns to Movie Theaters This Summer |first=Jeremy |last=Dick |work=[[MovieWeb]] |date=July 20, 2021 |access-date=August 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Kirby |title=40 years ago, 'Stripes' starring Bill Murray was filmed in Kentucky.
