The film stars [[Andrew McCarthy]] and [[Jonathan Silverman]] as young insurance corporation employees who discover that their boss, Bernie, is dead, after arriving at his house.\n\nWhile attempting to convince people that Bernie is still alive until they can leave to prevent them from being falsely suspected for causing his death, they discover that Bernie had ordered their own [[assassination]]s to cover up his [[embezzlement]]. It grossed $30&nbsp;million on a $15&nbsp;million budget. The film's success inspired a sequel, ''[[Weekend at Bernie's II]]'' (1993).\n\n==Plot==\nLarry Wilson and Richard Parker are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in [[New York City]]. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. He and Larry take their findings to the CEO, the wealthy and promiscuous Bernie Lomax, who commends them for discovering the [[insurance fraud]] and invites them to his beach house in [[The Hamptons]] for the [[Labor Day]] weekend. Unbeknownst to the pair, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his [[American Mafia|mob]] partner Vito, Bernie asks to have the two killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito orders that Bernie himself be killed instead due to Bernie having been sleeping with Vito's girlfriend, Tina.\n\nBernie arrives at the island before the pair and plans the murders with Paulie, the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his [[answering machine]]. Paulie arrives and kills Bernie with a [[heroin]] overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they believe he committed suicide. Before they can call the authorities, guests arrive for a party that Bernie usually hosts every weekend. To the pair's amazement, the guests are too busy partying to notice he's dead, with the dopey grin from the injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state. Fearing implication in Bernie's death, and wanting to enjoy the luxury of the house for the weekend, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush Gwen Saunders, a summer [[Internship|intern]] for the company, convinces him to go along with Larry's plan. Later that night, a drunken Tina arrives at the house and demands the pair direct her to Bernie. However, she also fails to realize the situation and [[Necrophilia|has sex with his corpse]]. One of Vito's mobsters witnesses this and, mistakenly thinking Bernie's assassination failed, notifies Vito. \n\nThe next morning, Richard is appalled to discover Larry furthering the illusion of Bernie being alive by manipulating his body's limbs. Richard attempts to call the cops, but instead activates the phone message detailing Bernie's plot against them. Unaware of how Bernie died, they mistakenly believe they are still the targets of a mob hit and, as Bernie had said not to kill them while he was in the area, decide to use Bernie's corpse as a shield. All of the pair's various attempts to leave the island are thwarted, as they repeatedly misplace and recover Bernie's body, and they are finally forced to return to Bernie's home. Meanwhile, Paulie, unhinged by his apparent failure to kill Bernie, returns to the island.\n\nGwen, who has been trying to talk to Bernie, sees Larry and Richard with the body and confronts them, forcing them to reveal his death. Paulie then appears and opens fire on Bernie, before turning his attention to Larry, Richard, and Gwen. Chasing after the trio, Paulie corners Larry, who clumsily manages to subdue him with a phone cord and a punch. \n\nThe police eventually arrive and arrest Paulie, taking him away in a [[straitjacket]] as he continues to insist Bernie is still alive. Gwen invites Richard to stay with her family for the week, while Larry decides to go home to give them space. Bernie is loaded into an ambulance; however, his gurney rolls away and topples off the boardwalk, dumping him onto the beach right behind the trio, who run away in disgust. Afterwards, a young boy, who earlier tried to bury Bernie in the sand, comes along and successfully does so.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Larry Wilson\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Richard Parker\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as Bernie Lomax\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Gwen Saunders\n* [[Don Calfa]] as Paulie\n* [[Catherine Parks]] as Tina\n* [[Eloise Broady DeJoria|Eloise Broady]] as Tawny\n* [[Greg Salata]] as Marty\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Vito\n* [[Ted Kotcheff]] as Mr. Parker\n* [[Jason Woliner]] as Bratty Kid\n\n== Production ==\n[[Jon Cryer]] was originally cast in the film, but was replaced by McCarthy.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/2005/07/08/ew-creates-extras-weekend-bernies/|title=EW creates extras for ''Weekend at Bernie's''|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 8, 2005|accessdate=June 23, 2021}}</ref>  Shooting took place in New York City in August 1988.
