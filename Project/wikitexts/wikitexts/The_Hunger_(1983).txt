An international co-production of the United Kingdom and United States, the film is a loose adaptation of the 1981 [[The Hunger (Strieber novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Whitley Strieber]], with a screenplay by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas. Its plot concerns a [[love triangle]] between a doctor who specializes in sleep and aging research (Sarandon) and a [[vampire]] couple (Deneuve and Bowie).

Her current companion is John, a talented cellist whom she met in 18th-century France. In a nightclub in New York City, they connect with a young couple whom they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with bladed [[ankh]] pendants. The victims' bodies are disposed of in an incinerator in the basement of Miriam and John's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music.\n\nNow, 200 years after he was turned, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realizes Miriam's promise, that periodically killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality, was only partially true; he will have eternal life, but not eternal youth. He seeks Dr. Sarah Roberts, a research [[gerontologist]] who, with her colleagues Charlie and Tom (also Sarah's boyfriend), are studying the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she can reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a [[hypochondriac]] or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As the angered John leaves the clinic, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging and offers her help, but John rebuffs her.\n\nOne of the Blaylocks' students, Alice Cavender, drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age. However, her blood does nothing to restore him, so John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic, which is filled with coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam's former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Sarah comes looking for John at his home, and Miriam claims that her husband is in Switzerland. Sarah asks to be updated on John\u2019s condition. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance.\n\nSarah returns to Miriam\u2019s home to again inquire about John. Miriam, who feels alone after losing both John and Alice, initiates a sexual encounter with Sarah, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.\n\nSarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative when she rejects food and is not forthcoming about her three-hour disappearance to the Blaylock residence. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood and reveal she has some kind of infection, in the form of a foreign and inhuman type of blood, that is taking over her own. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.\n\nTom arrives at Miriam's home, looking for Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom, where Sarah, starving and desperate, kills him. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's [[ankh]] knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam's, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam's previous lovers, including John, emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies become dust.\n\nThe police investigator returns to find a real estate agent showing the townhouse to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London with two new companions, standing on the balcony of a flat in the Barbican Estate's Cromwell Tower, admiring the view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam continually cries Sarah's name.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Miriam Blaylock \n* [[David Bowie]] as John Blaylock \n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sarah Roberts\n* [[Cliff De Young]] as Tom Haver\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Lieutenant Allegrezza\n* [[Beth Ehlers]] as Alice Cavender\n* Rufus Collins as Charlie Humphries\n\n[[Willem Dafoe]] and [[John Pankow]] have brief appearances as two youths harassing Sarah at a [[phone booth]].

[[James Aubrey (actor)|James Aubrey]] plays a man whom Miriam brings to Sarah as her potential first victim.\n\nEnglish [[gothic rock]] band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] appear during the film's opening credits as a group performing at the nightclub, with Peter Murphy onscreen, where they play their single \"[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]].\" Silent film star [[Bessie Love]] makes her final film appearance as an elderly fan at Sarah's book signing.\n\n== Production ==\nThe final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio's behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels.<ref name=\"Scott\">[[Tony Scott]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2004, [[Warner Bros.]]</ref> Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: \"The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame.\"<ref name=\"Sarandon\">[[Susan Sarandon]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2004, [[Warner Bros.]]</ref>\n\nBowie was excited to work on the film but was concerned about the final product.

Although a soundtrack album accompanied the film's release ([[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] VSD 47261), this issue omits much of the music used in the film.\n\nBlake's noted on working with director Tony Scott, \"Tony wanted to create a score largely using classical music and I researched this, many days going to his home in Wimbledon with stacks of recordings to play to him. One of these was the [[Flower Duet|duet for two sopranos]] from Delibes' ''[[Lakm\u00e9]]'', which I recorded specially with Elaine Barry and Judith Rees, conducting my orchestra The Sinfonia of London. Howard Shelley joined with Ralph Holmes and Raphael Wallfisch to record the second movement of Schubert's [[Piano Trio No. 2 (Schubert)|Piano Trio in E flat]]. Ralph recorded the Gigue from Bach's Violin Partita in E and Raphael the Prelude to Bach's solo cello sonata in G, to which Bowie mimed. I was persuaded to appear in one scene as a pianist, for which I wrote a 'Dolphin Square Blues'. Tony wanted to add a synthesizer score and I introduced him to Hans Zimmer, then working at The Snake Ranch Studio in Fulham but Tony eventually used a score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger with electronics by David Lawson. It is hard however to exactly separate these elements.\"<ref>{{Cite web | date = 2006 | last=Blake | first=Howard|author-link=Howard Blake | url= http://www.howardblake.com/music/Film-TV-Scores/545/THE-HUNGER.htm | title= The Hunger op.314 (October 1982) | website = howardblake.com | access-date = 13 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Critical response ===\n''The Hunger'' was nominated for two [[Saturn Award]]s for [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]], while receiving mixed reviews upon its release, with criticism given towards its pacing and plot, while being heavy on atmosphere and visuals.
