It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $487 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nConstruction executive John and tech support consultant Jane are answering questions during marriage counselling. The couple has been married for \"five or six\" years, but their marriage is suffering to the point that they cannot remember the last time they had sex. They tell the story of their first meeting in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], where they claimed to be together in order to avoid being questioned by Colombian authorities. They fell in love and got married.\n\nIn reality, John and Jane are both skilled field operatives working for different contract killing firms, both among the best in their field, each concealing their true profession from the other. They live in a large [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] house in the suburbs, and keep up appearances by reluctantly socializing with their \"conventionally\" wealthy neighbors. Under these cover stories, John and Jane balance their apparently mundane marriage\u2014which both of them find after a few years to be growing dull and suffocating\u2014with their secretive work. When both are assigned to kill [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] prisoner Benjamin \"the Tank\" Danz during a transfer, they encounter each other on the job and the hit ends up botched; Danz survives, while John and Jane are assigned to kill each other instead.\n\nAfter making escalating attempts on each other's lives, the Smiths' conflict culminates in a massive shootout that nearly demolishes their home. In a protracted, evenly matched fight, they wind up with guns in each other's faces. John declines to shoot, telling Jane that he loves her, and lays his gun down. Jane finds she cannot shoot John either, and they make passionate love that night with their relationship now reignited. The renewed Smith partnership is quickly threatened by their employers, who join forces to eliminate the couple. John's best friend and co-worker, Eddie, turns down a bounty of $400,000, but John and Jane find themselves under fire from an army of assassins. Fending off an attack which blows up their pockmarked house, the Smiths steal their neighbor's minivan and successfully destroy their attackers' three pursuing armored sedans, all while bickering over their fighting styles and newly discovered personal secrets.\n\nAfter meeting with Eddie, the Smiths decide to fight together to preserve their marriage. They kidnap Danz from his high-security prison to use as a bargaining chip. He reveals he was merely bait, an intern hired jointly by their employers after they discovered the Smiths were married, in the hopes of the Smiths killing each other. John and Jane discard their separate contingency plans and make their [[last stand]] together, fending off an assault of heavily armed operatives inside a home decorating store. The film ends with the couple meeting the marriage counselor again, where the Smiths state how much their marriage has thrived, with John encouraging him to ask for an update on their sex life to which he quietly answers \"10/10\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as John Smith\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Jane Smith\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Eddie\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Benjamin \"the Tank\" Danz\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Jasmine\n* [[Keith David]] as Father\n* [[Chris Weitz]] as Martin Coleman\n* Rachael Huntley as Suzy Coleman\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Gwen\n* [[Stephanie March]] as Julie\n* [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Jade\n* [[Perrey Reeves]] as Jessie\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Dr. Wexler, the marriage counselor (uncredited)\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as the voice of Mr. Smith's boss, Atlanta (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as Jane Smith, but when Brad Pitt dropped out from the film, Kidman dropped out, too.
