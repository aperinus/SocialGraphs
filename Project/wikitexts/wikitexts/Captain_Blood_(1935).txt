Pictures]], produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]] and [[Gordon Hollingshead]] (with [[Hal B. Wallis]] as executive producer), directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] and starring [[Errol Flynn]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Ross Alexander]].\n\nThe film is based on the 1922 novel ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' by [[Rafael Sabatini]], with a screenplay by [[Casey Robinson]], and concerns an imprisoned doctor and his fellow prisoners who escape their cruel island captivity and become pirates in the [[West Indies]].<ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web|title=Captain Blood (1935) |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2538/Captain-Blood/ |access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref> An earlier 1924 [[Vitagraph Studios|Vitagraph]] silent film version of ''[[Captain Blood (1924 film)|Captain Blood]]'' starred [[J.

In 1938 they would be reunited with Rathbone in ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''. The same year, Rathbone also starred with Flynn in ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]''.\n\nIn 1962, Flynn's son [[Sean Flynn (photojournalist)|Sean]] starred in ''[[The Son of Captain Blood]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn England in 1685, Irish doctor Peter Blood is summoned to aid Lord Gildoy, a wounded patron who participated in the [[Monmouth Rebellion]]. Arrested while performing [[Hippocratic Oath|his duties as a physician]], he is convicted of [[treason]] against [[James II of England|King James II]] and sentenced to death by the infamous [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]]. By the whim of the king, upon his advisor Lord Sunderland's counsel, Blood and the surviving rebels are transported to the West Indies to be sold into slavery.\n\nIn [[Port Royal]], Blood is acquired to Arabella Bishop, the beautiful niece of local military commander Colonel Bishop. Attracted by Blood's rebellious nature, Arabella tries to improve his situation by recommending him as the personal physician of the colony's governor, Steed, who suffers from painful [[gout]]. Outwardly resentful toward Arabella yet silently appreciative for her efforts on his behalf, Blood develops an escape plan for himself and his fellow prisoners. The plan is almost uncovered by the suspicious Colonel Bishop, who has one of Blood's men, Jeremy Pitt, flogged and interrogated. Blood is spared a similar fate when a Spanish man-o-war attacks Port Royal. During the raid, Blood and his fellow prisoners seize the Spanish ship from its drunken night watch and sail away to begin lives of [[piracy]] in 1687.\n\nCaptain Blood's crew quickly achieve great fame among the [[buccaneer]]s of the [[Brethren of the Coast|Brotherhood of the Coast]], with Blood himself deemed the greatest captain of the coast. When Governor Steed is unable to contain the pirate menace, Colonel Bishop is appointed governor. He sends Arabella to England on an extended holiday, but three years later, she returns to the Caribbean. Her ship, also carrying royal emissary Lord Willoughby, is captured by Blood's treacherous partner, the French buccaneer Captain Levasseur, who plans to hold them for [[ransom]]. Blood forces Levasseur to sell them to him while relishing the opportunity to turn the tables on Arabella. When Levasseur vehemently objects, the two pirate captains duel, in which Blood is forced to kill Levasseur. Blood offers Arabella valuable jewelry from his conquests as a sign of his love for her. Ungrateful for her \"rescue,\" Arabella is indignant at having been purchased by Blood, and calls him a thief and a pirate. Although angered by her rejection, he orders his men to set sail for Port Royal where he will deliver Arabella and Lord Willoughby, despite the danger to himself and his crew.\n\nAs they approach Port Royal, they sight two French warships attacking the city; Bishop has left it undefended in his single-minded pursuit of Blood. With England now at war with France, Lord Willoughby pleads with Blood to save the colony, but the captain and his crew refuse to fight for the corrupt king. Willoughby reveals that James was [[Glorious Revolution|kicked out of England and fled to France]] in hiding; England's new king, [[William III of England|William III]], has sent Willoughby to offer Blood and his men full pardons and commissions in the [[Royal Navy]]. This startling news quickly changes the pirates' minds, and they prepare for battle with the French.\n\nAfter ferrying Arabella ashore, Blood and his men approach Port Royal flying [[French ensigns|French colors]], but soon that ensign is replaced with the British [[Union Jack]]. A pitched ship-to-ship battle ensues, leading to frenzied hand-to-hand deck combat. Blood and his men defeat the French frigates, saving the colony, but not before losing their ship in the battle. As a reward, Blood is appointed the new governor of Port Royal by Lord Willoughby and has Arabella confess that she loves him. Blood also has the pleasure of dealing with his hostile predecessor, having now returned from his pirate hunt and under arrest for [[dereliction of duty|abandoning his post]] in a time of war. As Arabella playfully pleads with the new governor to spare her uncle's life, Blood reveals his face to the astonished Bishop, greeting him with the words \"Good morning, Uncle.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn in Captain Blood trailer.JPG|thumb|De Havilland and Flynn in ''Captain Blood'']]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Errol Flynn]] as Peter Blood\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Arabella Bishop\n* [[Lionel Atwill]] as Colonel Bishop\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as Levasseur\n* [[Ross Alexander]] as Jeremy Pitt, Blood's friend and [[navigator]]\n* [[Guy Kibbee]] as Henry Hagthorpe, Master Gunner\n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as Lord Willoughby\n* [[Robert Barrat]] as John Wolverstone\n* [[Hobart Cavanaugh]] as Dr. Bronson\n* [[Donald Meek]] as Dr. Whacker\n* [[Jessie Ralph]] as Mrs. Barlow\n* [[Forrester Harvey]] as Honesty Nuttall\n* [[Frank McGlynn Sr.]] as Rev.

In 1935, Warner Bros. asked Korngold to score the film, but he declined, feeling that a story about pirates was outside his range of interest. However, Korngold changed his mind after watching the filming. \n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=\"Korngold not only had the background but also had the gift of melody, an innate sense of theater, and the skills to manipulate sentiment, emotion, humor, and excitement.

The short time frame forced him to borrow portions of symphonic poems by [[Franz Liszt]], which constituted approximately ten percent of the score. As such, Korngold was unwilling to take credit for the entire film score, insisting instead that his credit be for \"musical arrangement\" only.<ref name=Thomas/>{{rp|8}}<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXb1QqmrRNc;t=2m30s ''Captain Blood'' trailer segment]</ref>\n\n''Captain Blood'' became an immediate hit, with an Oscar nomination for the score.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1936 Oscar nominees for 1936]</ref> As Korngold's first fully symphonic film score, it marked a milestone in his career, as he became the first composer of international stature to sign a contract with a film studio.<ref name=Thomas/>{{rp|10}}<ref name=Woodstra>Woodstra, Chris, Brennan, Gerald, Schrott, Allen, editors.

In January 1935, Warner Bros. signed Flynn and brought him to Hollywood after seeing him in the British B picture ''[[Murder at Monte Carlo]]''.<ref name=\"thomas-67\"/> For the female lead role, [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]] was originally chosen to play opposite Donat, but after Muir declined the role, the studio focused on the 19-year-old de Havilland, who had starred in three previous films that same year, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' for director [[Max Reinhardt]].<ref name=\"thomas-67\"/>\n\n===Filming locations===\nMost of the film was shot on a sound stage in the summer of 1935. Some exterior scenes, such as the sword fight between Rathbone and Flynn on a Caribbean shore, were shot at [[Laguna Beach, California]]. The final battle sequence between Blood's pirate crew and the French ships employed one of the largest technical crews assembled for a film, requiring 2,500 extras.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nDuring filming, Flynn collapsed from a bout of [[malaria]] that he had contracted in [[New Guinea]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box-office success,<ref name=\"thomas-71-72\" /> earning Warner Bros. a profit of $1.462 million.<ref>''Errol & Olivia: Ego & Obsession in Golden Era Hollywood'' by Robert Matzen, 2010</ref> According to Warner Bros., it earned $1,357,000 domestically and $1,733,000 overseas.<ref name=\"warners\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n''Captain Blood'' premiered on December 26, 1935 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre]] in New York City<ref name=\"Brown125\">{{cite book |title=Movie Time: A Chronology of Hollywood and the Movie Industry from its Beginnings to the Present |last=Brown |first=Gene |year=1995 |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=0-02-860429-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/movietimechronol00brow/page/125 125] |url=https://archive.org/details/movietimechronol00brow/page/125 }}</ref> and was released in the United States on December 28, 1935.

Its sundry little discrepancies, however, count against a more satisfying final tally. The inconsistencies, while not frequent, are rather prominent and at times irritating. \nAs, for instance, the climactic sea battle of the lone pirate ship (Blood's), now a volunteer in the cause of England, against the two French vessels. One French frigate stands idly by until Blood's corsair conquers one and then directs his attack on the other. The finale with the discomfited governor, in whose place Blood is appointed, is rather tent-twent-thirt [excessively melodramatic].\n\nAnd underlying it all, as a productionary shortcoming, is the false premise of the titular Capt. Blood. Here is a gallant, engaging young blade who, under pirate's colors, repels the very aspects which first cement his brave appeal.<ref name=Variety>[https://archive.org/stream/variety121-1936-01#page/n43/mode/2up \"CAPTAIN BLOOD\"], film review, ''Variety'', New York, N.Y., January 1, 1936, page 44; retrieved December 22, 2017. The compound adjective \"tent-twent-thirt\" in ''Variety'''s review derives from theatrical slang for \"ten-twenty-thirty\", which was once used to describe the early vaudevillian shows and other staged productions that were distinguished by their cheap admission prices (ten, twenty, or thirty cents) and by their highly melodramatic storylines or by characters displaying exaggerated emotions and actions.</ref>}}\n\nDespite also finding flaws in the \"scripting\" of ''Captain Blood'' and in the presentation of some battle sequences, ''Variety'' called Flynn's performance \"impressive\" and predicted that his work in the film would provide him with \"future big marquee values.\"<ref name=Variety/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 1936, [[Graham Greene]] offered a tepid review, describing the film as his favorite of those that he had reviewed that week but describing it as \"a fine spirited mix-up\" and noting the \"magnificently wrong characterization\" of King James. Greene also wrote that much of the film included anachronistic details related to clothing and setting.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 21 February 1936|title= I Dream Too Much/Anything Goes/Faust/Hohe Schule/Captain Blood|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/54|page= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/54 54]|isbn= 0192812866}})</ref>\n\n''[[FilmInk|Filmink]]'' magazine later wrote: \"Flynn was lucky \u2013 not just in being at the right place at the right time with the right lack of competition, but with his collaborators on Captain Blood.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/films-errol-flynn-2/|title=The Films of Errol Flynn: Part 2 The Golden Years |date=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\nThe film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and, despite not being nominated, [[Michael Curtiz]] received the second-highest number of votes for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] as a write-in candidate.
