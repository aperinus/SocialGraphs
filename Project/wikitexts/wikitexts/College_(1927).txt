Horne]] and [[Buster Keaton]], and starring Keaton, [[Anne Cornwall]], and [[Harold Goodwin (American actor)|Harold Goodwin]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Southern California, Ronald graduates high school as its \"most brilliant scholar\". At his graduation, Ronald speaks on \"the Curse of the Athlete\", arguing that books are more important than athletics. His speech offends most of the student body, especially the popular athlete Jeff, and causes Ronald's sweetheart Mary to reject him.\n\nRonald decides to follow Mary to Clayton, which the dean describes as an \"athlete-infested college\". Hoping to impress Mary, Ronald tries out for the [[baseball]] and [[track and field]] teams, but proves to be totally inept. At the same time, he attempts to work as a [[soda jerk]] and as a waiter in [[blackface]] while trying to keep these jobs a secret from Mary, who has started dating Jeff.\n\nEventually the dean asks Ronald why his grades are suffering. After Ronald explains the situation, the dean empathizes with him and orders the rowing coach to make Ronald the [[coxswain]] in the upcoming competition. The coach tries to sabotage Ronald by slipping him a [[Hypnotic|sleeping potion]] so he cannot compete, but the potion is accidentally consumed by the team's other coxswain instead. Despite Ronald capsizing the boat, pulling the rudder off mid-race, and causing collisions with other boats, the Clayton team wins the race anyway.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary starts to appreciate Ronald\u2019s futile efforts to impress her. However, on the day of the boat race, Jeff gets kicked out of college and takes her hostage in her room, locking them in an effort to get her expelled so she will marry him. In the end, she manages to contact Ronald by telephone, who in a sudden show of athleticism sprints to her dormitory, [[pole vault]]s into her window, and fights off Jeff by throwing household objects at him and demonstrating skills in javelin shot put and tackle football. Mary agrees to marry Ronald and they live the rest of their lives together, ending with a shot of side-by-side gravestones.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Buster Keaton]] as Ronald\n*[[Anne Cornwall]] as Mary Haynes\n*[[Harold Goodwin (American actor)|Harold Goodwin]] as Jeff\n*[[Flora Bramley]] as Mary's friend\n*[[Snitz Edwards]] as Dean Edwards\n*[[Carl Harbaugh]] as Crew Coach\n*[[Sam Crawford]] as Baseball Coach\n*[[Florence Turner]] as Ronald's mother\n*[[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]] as Head Cook\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1927]]\n* [[Buster Keaton filmography]]\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{IMDb title|0017765|College}}\n*{{Internet Archive film | CollegeVideoQualityUpgrade | College }}\n*{{Amg movie|10236|College}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124356/http://www.busterkeaton.com/Films/C10_College.html ''College''] at the [[International Buster Keaton Society]]\n\n{{Buster Keaton}}\n{{James W.
