It is a sequel to Brice's 2014 film ''[[Creep (2014 film)|Creep]]'', which was also written by Duplass and Brice. Duplass reprises his role from the first film as a serial killer who lures unsuspecting videographers to their deaths, with [[Desiree Akhavan]] portraying his latest target.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 6, 2017, and was released on October 24, 2017, by [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]]. Like its predecessor, ''Creep 2'' was also critically acclaimed, with much praise focused on the film's writing, atmosphere, dark humor, and the performances among the leads.\n\nBrice confirmed that a third film was in development.<ref name=\"Sprague\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nA prolific [[serial killer]], using the name \"Aaron\" after a [[Creep (2014 film)|previous victim]], finds himself dissatisfied with his killings and undergoing a [[midlife crisis]]. When his latest ad for a videographer lures [[YouTuber]] Sara to his remote cabin, Aaron changes his approach by admitting he is a serial killer who will let Sara live for the next 24 hours if she records a documentary on his life. Sara, doubting his revelation, agrees to film Aaron in the hope that the video will popularize her unsuccessful web series about eccentric [[Craigslist]] clients.\n\nOver the course of the day, Aaron struggles to intimidate Sara, who plays along with his various eccentricities. While Sara continues to doubt that Aaron is a serial killer, Aaron informs her that he intends to conclude the documentary by having her kill him. He eventually manages to horrify Sara by staging a suicide attempt, which almost causes her to leave. However, after Aaron reveals that his life was not in danger, she remains to hear Aaron share intimate details about himself, culminating in the two sharing a kiss.\n\nAaron brings Sara outside to announce that the documentary will end with them committing suicide together. Sara attempts to escape when she sees Aaron stab himself in the stomach, but Aaron stabs her and drags her into an open grave he dug. As Aaron gives a closing monologue, a still-alive Sara emerges from the grave and strikes him in the back of the head with a shovel before fleeing.\n\nAfterwards, Sara is recorded in public by an unidentified individual whistling a tune heard in Aaron's videos. When Sara notices the individual filming her, the camera abruptly cuts away.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Aaron\n* [[Desiree Akhavan]] as Sara\n* [[Karan Soni]] as Dave\n\nAdditionally, Kyle Field, [[Caveh Zahedi]], and Jeff Man portray Wade, Randy, and Alex, subjects featured in Sara's web series. Director [[Patrick Brice]] reappears in his role as Aaron (referred to in the credits as \"Old Aaron\") through archive footage from the [[Creep (2014 film)|first film]].\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2014, it was announced Duplass had plans on making the film into a trilogy, with [[RADiUS-TWC]] producing and distributing the films<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=Radius-TWC Partners With Blumhouse, Duplass Brothers on 'Creep' Trilogy|url=http://www.thewrap.com/radius-twc-partners-blumhouse-duplass-brothers-creep-trilogy/|publisher=The Wrap|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice Discuss Their Craigslist Nightmare 'Creep'|url=https://screenrant.com/mark-duplass-patrick-brice-creep-movie/|publisher=ScreenRant|access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=Radius-TWC Springs For Blumhouse-Duplass SXSW Thriller 'Creep'; Trilogy In The Works|url=https://deadline.com/2014/04/radius-twc-blumhouse-duplass-thriller-creep-710902/|publisher=Deadline|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref> and production taking place later in the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass Says CREEP 2 Will Shoot at the End of the Year; Aiming to Release the Entire CREEP Trilogy Next Year|url=http://collider.com/mark-duplass-creep-trilogy-release/|publisher=Collider|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref> In February 2015, Duplass stated production hadn't begun due to scheduling issues.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Mark Duplass on 'Lazarus Effect' and Turning Down 'Huge Movies' (EXCLUSIVE)|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/02/27/mark-duplass-lazarus-effect-interview/|publisher=Moviefone|access-date=September 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228181835/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/02/27/mark-duplass-lazarus-effect-interview|archive-date=February 28, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In August 2016, Duplass began trying on costumes for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3403159/mark-duplass-confirms-creep-2-works/|title=Mark Duplass Confirms \u2018Creep 2\u2019 in the Works|website=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|first=Jonathan|last=Barkan|date=August 16, 2016|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref> That same month, Brice confirmed the sequel was moving forward.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3403608/creep-director-confirms-sequel/|title=\u2018Creep\u2019 Director Confirms Sequel|website=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|first=Brad|last=Miska|date=August 19, 2016|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began in September 2016.<ref name=\"Sep2016D\">{{cite news|last1=Lincoln|first1=Ross A.|title=Desiree Akhavan Joins \u2018Creep 2\u2019 As Production Begins On Blumhouse & Duplass Brothers Horror Sequel|url=https://deadline.com/2016/09/creep-2-begins-production-with-desiree-akhavan-in-starring-role-1201816787/|access-date=September 11, 2016|work=Deadline|date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n[[Julian Wass]] composed the soundtrack for ''Creep 2.''
