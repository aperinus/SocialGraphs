It features [[Chris Pine]] reprising his role as Captain [[James T. Kirk]], with [[Zachary Quinto]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Karl Urban]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[John Cho]], [[Anton Yelchin]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], and [[Leonard Nimoy]] reprising their roles from the previous film. [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Alice Eve]], and [[Peter Weller]] are also in the film's principal cast. It was Nimoy's last film appearance before his death in 2015. Set in the [[23rd century]], the film follows Kirk and the crew of [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as they are sent to the [[Klingon]] homeworld seeking a former [[Starfleet]] member-turned-terrorist, [[Khan Noonien Singh|John Harrison]].\n\nAfter the release of ''Star Trek'', Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Kurtzman, and Orci agreed to produce its sequel.

Its gross earnings of over $467 million worldwide have made it the highest-grossing entry in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[86th Academy Awards]]. It was followed by ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 2259, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] is removed from command of the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] for violating the [[Prime Directive]] after exposing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to first officer. [[Spock]] is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, Starfleet officer Thomas Harewood, sent by Commander John Harrison, bombs a [[Section 31 (Star Trek)|Section 31]] installation in [[London]]. During an emergency meeting on the situation, Harrison uses a ship to ambush and kill Pike and other senior officers, before transporting to [[Klingon#Homeworld|Kronos]], homeworld of the hostile [[Klingon]]s.\n\nAdmiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to ''Enterprise'' with orders to kill Harrison using a new long range stealth torpedo. Chief Engineer [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns [[Pavel Chekov]] to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and [[Uhura]] to the planet, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols. Harrison appears and kills the Klingons. Harrison surrenders when he learns the precise number of torpedoes on board ''Enterprise''.\n\nDr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and Marcus's daughter, Dr. Carol Marcus, open a torpedo at Harrison's urging, revealing the torpedoes contain [[cryonics|cryonically-frozen]] humans. Harrison is taken to ''Enterprise''{{'}}s brig, where he reveals his true identity as [[Khan Noonien Singh]], a genetically engineered superhuman, awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of sleep and forced to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged ''Enterprise''{{'}}s warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, sparking war with the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates, which Kirk asks Scott to investigate. Scott discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility.\n\n''Enterprise'' is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS ''Vengeance'', commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but ''Enterprise'' flees to Earth to expose him. After ''Vengeance'' disables ''Enterprise'' near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard ''Enterprise'' to stop the attack. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to ''Vengeance'' before ordering ''Enterprise''{{'}}s destruction. ''Vengeance'' loses power after being sabotaged by Scott, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latter's knowledge of the warship's design, [[space diving|space-jump]] to ''Vengeance''. Meanwhile, Spock contacts his future self on New Vulcan, who tells him of [[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|his own encounter with Khan]] and warns that he cannot be trusted. After fighting their way to the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott, and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of ''Vengeance''.\n\nKhan demands that Spock return his frozen crew in exchange for the ''Enterprise'' officers. Spock complies, having had McCoy surreptitiously remove Khan's frozen crew from the torpedoes beforehand. When Khan starts shooting at ''Enterprise'', Spock detonates the warheads, crippling the ship. With both starships caught in Earth's gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters ''Enterprise''{{'}}s radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.\n\nKhan crashes ''Vengeance'' into downtown [[San Francisco]] in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters, while McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. A vengeful Spock pursues Khan through the city and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat. Uhura beams down and stuns Khan. Spock prepares to kill Khan, but Uhura stops him, explaining he is their only chance to save Kirk. Khan's blood revives Kirk and Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. One year later, Kirk speaks at ''Enterprise''{{'}}s re-dedication ceremony. The ''Enterprise'' crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[James T.
