The screenplay was written by [[Irving Ravetch]] and [[Harriet Frank Jr.]], based in part on three works by [[William Faulkner]]: the 1931 novella \"[[Spotted Horses]]\", the 1939 short story \"[[Barn Burning]]\" and the 1940 novel ''[[The Hamlet]].'' The title is taken from ''The Hamlet'', as Book Three is called \"The Long Summer\". Some characters, as well as [[Tone (literature)|tone]], were inspired by [[Tennessee Williams]]' 1955 play, ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', [[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (film)|a film adaptation of which]] \u2013 also starring [[Paul Newman]] \u2013 was released five months later.{{sfn|Miller, Gabriel|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JmZ_cwPXn78C&pg=PA29 29]}}\n\nThe plot follows the conflicts of the Varner family after ambitious drifter Ben Quick (Newman) arrives in their small Mississippi town. Will Varner ([[Orson Welles]]), the patriarch, has doubts about his son, Jody ([[Anthony Franciosa]]) and sees Ben as a better choice to inherit his position. Will tries to push Ben and his daughter Clara ([[Joanne Woodward]]) into marriage.\n\nFilmed in [[Clinton, Louisiana]], the cast was composed mostly of former [[Actors Studio]] students, whom Ritt met while he was an assistant teacher to [[Elia Kazan]]. For the leading role, [[Warner Bros.]] loaned Newman to [[20th Century Fox]]. The production was marked by conflicts between Welles and Ritt, which drew media attention. The [[film score|music score]] was composed by [[Alex North]] and the title song, \"The Long Hot Summer\", written by North and [[Sammy Cahn]], was performed by [[Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].\n\nThe film was well received by critics but did not score significant results at the box office. Its critical success revitalized Ritt's career, after his having been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] during most of the 1950s. Newman won the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Long hot summer still.jpg|thumb|Ben Quick talks to Clara Varner soon after arriving in Frenchman's Bend.|left]]\nBen Quick is on trial for [[Arson|barn-burning]], but when no solid evidence is found, the judge expels him from town. Ben hitches a ride to Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, with two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula ([[Lee Remick]]). Clara's father, Will Varner, is the domineering owner of most of the town.\n\nBen goes to the Varner plantation. Will is away, but his only son, Jody, agrees to let Ben become a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]] on a vacant farm. When Will returns from a stay in the hospital, he is furious at Jody for hiring a notorious \"barn burner\", but soon begins to see in Ben a younger version of himself and comes to admire his ruthlessness and ambition, qualities that Jody lacks. Will is also disappointed with the man that his 23-year-old daughter, Clara, has been seeing for five or six years: Alan Stewart ([[Richard Anderson]]), a genteel Southern \"blue blood\" and a [[Mother's boy|mama's boy]].\n\nWill therefore schemes to push his daughter and Ben together, to try to bring fresh, virile blood into the family. However, she is openly hostile to the crude, if magnetic, upstart. Will is determined to have his bloodline go on, so he offers to make Ben wealthy if he marries Clara. Meanwhile, Minnie Littlejohn ([[Angela Lansbury]]), Will's long-time mistress, is dissatisfied with their arrangement and wants to get married.\n\n[[File:Lee Remick in The Long Hot Summer.jpg|thumb|upright|Eula and Jody]]\nJody becomes increasingly frustrated, seeing his position in the family being undermined. After Ben sells some wild horses for Will, he is rewarded with the position of clerk in the [[general store]], alongside Jody. Will even invites him to live in the family mansion.\n\nThis is the final straw for Jody. He pulls a gun on Ben and threatens to kill him.  Ben talks his way out by telling Jody about buried [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era treasure he has supposedly found on a property that Will gave him, a down payment to seal their bargain over Clara. Jody starts digging and finds a bag of coins. He is elated, thinking he might finally free himself of his father's domination; he buys the land from Ben. Late that night, Will finds his son, still digging. After examining one of the coins, Will notices that it was minted in 1910. Jody is shattered.\n\nBen aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan what his intentions are, and does not like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father alone in their barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot go through with it and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between father and son. Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Clara persuades him to get into her car and they drive away. Then Will defuses the situation by saying he accidentally started the fire by dropping his cigar.\n\nThe smell of fire brings back bad memories for Ben, who confesses to Clara that his father was a real barn-burner. He tells her how, at age ten, he warned a farmer that his father was about to set another fire. Ben's father got away, never to be seen again. Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, he may have to live forever.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Ben Quick.

Immediately after filming was completed, during an interview with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', Welles explained that the cause of his behavior was that he did not know what kind of \"monkeyshines\" his co-stars would be or the \"caprices\" they would receive from him. He also stated that they overcame the differences and completed the film.{{sfn|Life magazine staff|1958|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 53]}}  Welles later wrote a letter to Ritt praising his work and apologizing for his interference during the making of the movie. Ritt replied, expounding his admiration for Welles.{{sfn|Jackson, Carlton|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=go8Fb0uytswC&pg=PA52 52]}} Despite the mutual apologies, during an interview in 1965, Ritt recalled an incident on the set. While the film was being shot, it was often stopped by bad weather. During a day suitable for shooting, he found Welles not ready for the scene, instead reading a newspaper in Spanish. Ritt decided to skip Welles's scene and shoot the next one. He attributed Welles' later cooperation to the incident, which Welles had found humiliating.  Ritt thus earned the nickname \"the Orson Tamer\" throughout the Hollywood community.{{sfn|Jackson, Carlton|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=go8Fb0uytswC&pg=PA51 51]}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name        = The Long Hot Summer\n| cover       =\n| caption     = \n| type        = soundtrack\n| artist      = [[Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Alex North]], [[Lionel Newman]]\n| released    =  {{Start date|1958|06}}\n| length      = {{Duration|m=35|s=58}}\n| label       = [[Roulette Records]]\n| producer    =\n| misc = {{Audio sample\n | type        = soundtrack\n | header      = \"The Long, Hot Summer\" song\n | file        = Jimmie Rodgers - The Long Hot Summer.ogg\n | description = Audio sample featuring vocal by Jimmie Rodgers\n}}\n}}\n[[Alex North]] composed the film's score, which leaned toward a jazz style. \"The Long Hot Summer\" was the only song written by North to be used as the title track of a film.

Scheuer perceived the southern accents of the cast and the use of redness on their make-up to be unauthentic, but he felt that the use of the Louisiana landscapes and the development of the characters gave the film a \"comulative bite\" and a \"powerful persuader\" that \"you are there\". The review described Welles' acting as \"terrific\" and as dominating of the plot, while it favored Newman, Woodward and the supporting cast.
