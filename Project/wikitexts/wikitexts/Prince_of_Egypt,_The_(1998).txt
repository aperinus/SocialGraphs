The first feature film from DreamWorks to be [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]], it is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the [[Book of Exodus]] and follows the life of [[Moses]] from being a prince of [[Biblical Egypt|Egypt]] to his ultimate destiny to [[The Exodus|lead the Jews out of Egypt]]. Directed by [[Brenda Chapman]], [[Steve Hickner]], and [[Simon Wells]] (in Chapman and Hickner's feature directorial debuts), the film features songs written by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and a [[Film score|score]] composed by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The voice cast consists of [[Val Kilmer]] in a dual role, [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Martin Short]].\n\n[[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] had frequently suggested an animated adaptation of the 1956 film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' while working for [[The Walt Disney Company]], and he decided to put the idea into production after co-founding DreamWorks Pictures in 1994. To make this inaugural project, DreamWorks employed artists who had worked for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and [[Amblimation]], totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 countries. The film has a blend of [[traditional animation]] and [[computer-generated imagery]], created using software from [[Toon Boom Animation]] and [[Silicon Graphics]].\n\nThe film was released in theaters on December 18, 1998, and on home video on September 14, 1999. Reviews were generally positive; critics particularly praised the visuals, songs, and voice acting. The film grossed $218 million worldwide in theaters, which made it the most successful non-Disney animated feature at the time. The film's success led to the [[direct-to-video]] [[prequel]] and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Joseph: King of Dreams]]'' (2000), and a [[The Prince of Egypt (musical)|stage musical adaptation]] which opened in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]] in 2020.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Norm-Lewis-Aaron-Lazar-Will-be-Joined-by-All-Star-Cast-in-Concert-Reading-of-Stephen-Schwartzs-THE-PRINCE-OF-EGYPT-20150624 Norm Lewis & Aaron Lazar Will be Joined by All-Star Cast in Concert Reading of Stephen Schwartz's THE PRINCE OF EGYPT] Broadway World, Retrieved July 27, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/THE-PRINCE-OF-EGYPT-Will-Take-World-Premiere-Bow-in-Denmark-20170214 THE PRINCE OF EGYPT Will Take World Premiere Bow in San Francisco, then Play Denmark] Broadway World, Retrieved February 14, 2017</ref> The song \"[[When You Believe]]\" became a commercially successful single in a [[Pop music|pop]] version performed by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Mariah Carey]], and went on to win [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[71st Academy Awards]], making it the first animated film independently outside of Disney and [[Pixar]] films, as well as the first DreamWorks Animation film to receive two nominations and win one at the [[Academy Awards]], succeeded by ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' (2005).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Biblical Egypt|Ancient Egypt]], the enslaved [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] pray to [[God in Judaism|God]] for deliverance. [[Pharaohs in the Bible|Pharaoh]] [[Seti I|Seti]], fearing that the growing numbers of Hebrew [[Slavery in ancient Egypt|slaves]] could lead to rebellion, orders a mass [[infanticide]] of all newborn Hebrew boys. [[Jochebed|Yocheved]] and her two children, [[Miriam]] and [[Aaron]], rush to the [[Nile|Nile River]], where she places her newborn son in a basket on the water, after bidding him farewell with a final lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it sails to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Seti's wife, [[Tuya (queen)|Queen Tuya]], who names him [[Moses]]. Before leaving, Miriam prays that Moses will set their people free.\n\nYears later, Moses and his adoptive brother [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], heir to the throne of Egypt, are scolded by Seti for accidentally destroying a [[Egyptian temple|temple]]. After Moses suggests that Rameses be given the opportunity to prove his responsibility, Seti names Rameses [[prince regent|Prince Regent]] and gives him authority over Egypt's temples. High priests [[Hotep]] and [[Huy (High Priest of Ptah)|Huy]] offer Rameses a beautiful but rebellious young [[Midian]]ite woman, [[Zipporah|Tzipporah]]. During the banquet, Moses humiliates Tzipporah by letting her fall into a pond after she refuses to submit, appeasing the crowd but disappointing Tuya. Rameses, uninterested in her stubbornness, gives Tzipporah to Moses instead and appoints him Royal Chief Architect. Later that night, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace, and runs into the now-adult Miriam and Aaron, whom he does not recognize. He refuses to believe their claims and opts to have them arrested until Miriam sings their mother's lullaby, triggering Moses's memory. He flees in denial, but learns the truth of Seti's genocide from a nightmare, then from Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews were \"only slaves\". The next day, Moses tries to stop an Egyptian slave driver from flogging an elderly Hebrew slave, accidentally pushing the guard to his death. Horrified and ashamed, Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses's pleas that he stay.\n\nArriving at an oasis, Moses defends three young girls from [[brigands]], only to find out their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian. Moses becomes a shepherd, falls in love with Tzipporah, marries her, and grows adjusted to life in Midian. Moses discovers a [[burning bush]], through which God tells him to return to Egypt and [[The Exodus|guide the Hebrews to freedom]]. God bestows Moses's shepherding [[Staff of Moses|staff]] with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Tzipporah decides to join him.\n\nArriving in Egypt, Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh with a wife and son. Moses requests the Hebrews' release and transforms his staff into a snake to demonstrate God's power. Hotep and Huy deceptively recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses's. Not wanting to have his actions cause the empire's collapse and feeling betrayed by Moses's motives for his return, Rameses doubles the Hebrews' workload.\n\nThe Hebrews, including Aaron, blame Moses for their increased workload, disheartening Moses. However, Miriam inspires Moses to persevere. Moses casts the first of the [[Ten Plagues of Egypt]], but Rameses remains unmoved. Moses inflicts eight more plagues onto Egypt, but still Rameses refuses to relent, vowing never to release the Hebrews. Disheartened, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, including Rameses's son, while sparing those of the Hebrews. Grief-stricken, Rameses gives the Hebrews permission to leave. After leaving the palace, Moses collapses in grief.\n\nThe following morning, Moses, Miriam, Aaron and Tzipporah lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. At the [[Red Sea]], the Hebrews discover that a vengeful Rameses is pursuing them with his army, intent on killing them. However, a [[Pillars of fire and cloud|pillar of fire]] blocks the army's way, while Moses uses his staff to [[Crossing the Red Sea|part the sea]]. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, but the sea closes over and drowns the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone. Moses sadly bids his brother farewell and leads the Hebrews to [[Mount Sinai (Bible)|Mount Sinai]], where he receives the [[Ten Commandments]].\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Moses]], a Hebrew who was adopted by Pharaoh Seti and Queen Tuya\n** Kilmer also provides the uncredited voice of [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\n** [[Amick Byram]] provides Moses's singing voice\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother and eventual successor to Seti\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Zipporah|Tzipporah]], Jethro's oldest daughter and Moses's wife\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as [[Miriam]], Aaron's sister and Moses's biological sister\n** [[Sally Dworsky]] provides Miriam's singing voice\n** [[Eden Riegel]] provides the voice of a younger Miriam\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Aaron]], Miriam's brother and Moses's biological brother\n* [[Danny Glover]] as [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], Tzipporah's father and Midian's high priest\n** [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] provides Jethro's singing voice\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Seti I|Pharaoh Seti]], Rameses's father and Moses's adoptive father, the Pharaoh at the beginning of the film\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Tuya (queen)|Queen Tuya]], Seti's wife, Rameses's mother, and Moses's adoptive mother\n** Linda Dee Shayne provides Tuya's singing voice\n* [[Steve Martin]] as [[Hotep]], one of the [[high priest]]s who serves as an advisor to Seti, and later Rameses.

While working for [[The Walt Disney Company]], Katzenberg suggested this idea to [[Michael Eisner]], but he refused. The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks Pictures in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, [[Amblin Entertainment]] founder [[Steven Spielberg]], and music producer [[David Geffen]], were meeting in Spielberg's living room.<ref name=Production3>{{cite web | url=http://www.assistnews.net/strategic/s0000023.htm | title=Dan Wooding's strategic times | publisher=Assistnews.net | access-date=March 3, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030329004351/http://assistnews.net/strategic/s0000023.htm | archive-date=March 29, 2003 | url-status=live }}</ref> Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, \"You ought to do ''The Ten Commandments''.\"<ref name=Production3 />\n\n''The Prince of Egypt'' was \"written\" throughout the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, story supervisors [[Kelly Asbury]] and Lorna Cook led a team of fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film&nbsp;\u2014 sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]] digital editing system by editor [[Nick Fletcher (film editor)|Nick Fletcher]] to create a \"story reel\" or [[animatic]]. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand what is happening in each sequence of the film.<ref name=Production1 />  After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances.<ref name=Production1 /> Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in [[Biblical studies|Biblical scholars]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Jewish]], and [[Muslim]] [[Theology|theologians]], and [[Arab American]] leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original [[The Exodus|story]]. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources.<ref name=Production3 />\n\n=== Animation and design ===\nArt directors Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and production designer Darek Gogol led a team of nine visual development artists in setting a visual style for the film that was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt.<ref name=Production1>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmscouts.com/SCRIPTs/matinee.cfm?Film=pri-egy&File=productn | title=Prince of Egypt-About the Production | publisher=Filmscouts.com | access-date=March 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090848/http://www.filmscouts.com/SCRIPTs/matinee.cfm?Film=pri-egy&File=productn |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists, as well as taking part in trips such as a two-week journey across Egypt by the filmmakers before the film's production began.<ref name=Production1 />\n\nCharacter designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and [[Nico Marlet]] worked on setting the design and overall look of the characters. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time.<ref name=Production1 /> Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments.<ref name=Production1 /> The backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts.

past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well.\" It was decided that the voice of God would be provided by [[Val Kilmer]], who portrayed Moses in the film, in order to indicate that God was communicating to him via the voice he
