The film tells of a man who has risen from humble beginnings only to be torn between his free-thinking lifestyle and the tradition of his wealthy fianc\u00e9e's family. The film, adapted by [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] and [[Sidney Buchman]] from the [[Holiday (play)|1928 play of the same name]] by [[Philip Barry]], stars [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]] and features [[Doris Nolan]], [[Lew Ayres]], and [[Edward Everett Horton]]. Horton reprised his role as Professor Nick Potter from the 1930 version.\n\nAlthough Hepburn had been Hope Williams' understudy in the original production of the play on Broadway, she only played the part for one performance.{{sfn|Leaming|1995|p=265}} Screenwriter [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] appeared in the original stage version as Nick Potter.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=5092 \"Donald Ogden Stewart\"] on the [[Internet Broadway Database]]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJonathan \"Johnny\" Case ([[Cary Grant]]), a [[self-made man]] who has worked all his life, is about to marry Julia Seton ([[Doris Nolan]]), whom he met while on holiday in Lake Placid, New York. He knows very little about his bride-to-be, and is surprised to learn that she is from an extremely wealthy family, the youngest daughter of banker Edward Seton ([[Henry Kolker]]).\n\nThen Johnny meets Julia's vivacious elder sister, Linda ([[Katharine Hepburn]]), to whom he confides his plan to take a long holiday from work to find the meaning of life. He also meets the sisters' younger brother, Ned Jr ([[Lew Ayres]]), an alcoholic whose spirit has been broken by subservience to their father. At first Julia's father is stunned when she tells him her plan to marry Johnny, but is appeased after meeting Johnny and looking into his work history. Edward Sr. plans an elaborate New Year's Eve engagement party, even though Julia had promised Linda that she, Linda, could throw a smaller party for Johnny and herself, one that would include only close friends.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, upset that she did not get to throw the engagement party she was promised, Linda refuses to come downstairs. Julia sends Johnny to get her, and he finds her and Ned in \"the playroom\", the one truly human room in the enormous and over-built Park Avenue mansion. They are with Johnny's off-beat friends, Professor Nick Potter ([[Edward Everett Horton]]) and his wife Susan ([[Jean Dixon]]), who had gotten lost in the house and serendipitously ended up there. The group spends a joyful time together, and Julia and Edward Sr. find them just as Johnny and Linda are completing a [[tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling trick]].\n\nMr. Seton later offers Johnny a job at his bank, and Johnny reveals his plans for a holiday from work. Julia is appalled that her boyfriend had said no to her father. After seeing in the New Year with Linda, and the announcement of the engagement to the assembled guests, Johnny tries to kiss Linda. She kindly rebuffs Johnny, reminding him that she will soon be his sister-in-law. Johnny leaves the mansion in a dark mood without saying goodbye to the family, although wishing the kitchen staff a Happy New Year as he goes. Linda tells her brother that she has fallen in love with Johnny but, because of her love for her younger sister, she will keep her feelings to herself.\n\nHoping to patch things up between Johnny and Julia, Linda visits the Potters, and finds them packing for a voyage to Europe. They tell her that Johnny is planning to go as well, and that he has asked Julia to go with them. A telegram arrives, informing them that Julia has turned him down. Linda returns home, hoping to change her sister's mind, but they argue instead. Julia is certain that Johnny will give up his plans and return to her. Just then Johnny arrives with a compromise: He will work at the bank for two years, but will quit then if he is unhappy.\n\nMr. Seton accepts this, and Julia and he begin planning the couple's honeymoon in minute detail, mixing together stops at the homes of relatives with business-related matter. They discuss hiring servants to work in Julia and Johnny's new home, which he also just finds out about. This makes Johnny realize that Julia and Edward Sr.'s plan won't work, that marrying Julia on these terms will be more of an encumbrance on his freedom than he can abide. He begs Julia to marry him that evening, and travel to Europe with him. She says no. He leaves to meet the Potters and sail.\n\nLinda sees from Julia's reaction that she is relieved by Johnny's decision. Linda makes Julia admit that she does not really love Johnny after all. With the way now clear, and inspired by Johnny, Linda renounces her father's stifling influence and declares her independence. She asks Ned to go with her, and when he can't, she promises to come back for him. Linda rushes off to meet Johnny and the Potters to go on holiday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Potters arrive at the ship, saddened that Johnny had decided to take the job at the bank. Johnny surprises them, and explains that he couldn't go through with it, and they cheerfully celebrate. Johnny is doing a [[Handspring (gymnastics)|back flip]] in the ship's hallway when Linda arrives. Seeing her while in mid-handspring, Johnny falls on his stomach rather than finishing. As she greets the three of them Johnny takes her hand, pulls her to the floor, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Linda Seton\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Johnny Case\n* [[Doris Nolan]] as Julia Seton\n* [[Lew Ayres]] as Edward \"Ned\" Seton Jr\n* [[Henry Kolker]] as Edward Seton Sr\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Professor Nick Potter\n* [[Jean Dixon]] as Susan Potter\n* [[Binnie Barnes]] as Laura Cram\n* [[Henry Daniell]] as Seton Cram\n}}\n\nJean Dixon retired from films after this performance.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\n==Production==\nIn 1936, Columbia Pictures purchased a group of scripts, including the script for ''Holiday'', from [[RKO]] for $80,000. Although the film was originally intended to reunite ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' co-stars Cary Grant and [[Irene Dunne]], George Cukor decided to cast Hepburn instead,{{sfn|Edwards|2000|pp=164\u2013165}} and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] borrowed her from [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], where she had just turned down the lead role in ''[[Mother Carey's Chickens (film)|Mother Carey's Chickens]]''.<ref name=tcmnotes/> [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered to play Hepburn's role,<ref name=tcmnotes>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/209/Holiday/notes.html \"Notes\"] on [[TCM.com]]</ref> and [[Rita Hayworth]] was tested for the role of Julia.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\nThe character of Linda Seton, played by Hepburn, was loosely based on socialite [[Gertrude Sanford Legendre]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Nemy |first=Enid |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/13/us/gertrude-sanford-legendre-97-socialite-turned-hunter-and-prisoner-of-war.html |title=Gertrude Sanford Legendre, 97, Socialite Turned Hunter and Prisoner of War |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 13, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603081048/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/13/us/gertrude-sanford-legendre-97-socialite-turned-hunter-and-prisoner-of-war.html |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Donald Ogden Stewart]], who co-wrote the screenplay, had played Professor Nick Potter in the original Broadway cast. Katharine Hepburn had understudied the role of Linda Seton in the original Broadway cast. The working titles for the film were ''Unconventional Linda'' and ''Vacation Bound''.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\nA scene that was to come before what is now the first scene of the film was set in the snows of Lake Placid, New York, but it was filmed in Bishop, California. The idea was to \"open up\" the stage play by utilizing an exterior scene, but when director George Cukor saw the scene, he did not like it and decided to cut it. A few still photographs, one of them on a lobby card that was distributed to theaters, are the only known remnants of this scene.<ref>{{cite book|title=Holiday DVD, \"Deleted Scenes\" featurette|year=2006|publisher=Sony}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the film was not a financial success, it was well received by critics. Hepburn biographers have speculated that Johnny Case's plans to give up working did not appeal to [[Great Depression]] audiences who were struggling to find jobs.{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=166}}{{sfn|Leaming|1995|p=352}} Hepburn, at the time, had earned a reputation as [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]], causing her departure from [[RKO Pictures]].<ref>Osborne, Robert.
