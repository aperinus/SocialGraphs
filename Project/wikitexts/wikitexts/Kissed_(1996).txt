It premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, 1996.\n\nThe film stars [[Molly Parker]] as Sandra Larson, a young woman whose fixation on [[death]] leads her to study [[embalming]] at a mortuary school, where in turn she finds herself drawn toward feelings of [[necrophilia]]. [[Peter Outerbridge]] also stars as Matt, a fellow student who develops romantic feelings for Sandra, and so must learn to accept her sexual proclivities.\n\n==Plot==\nAs far back as Sandra Larson (Parker) can remember, she has been fascinated by death. As a child, she dances with the corpses of animals at night, rubbing them on her body, before giving them a funeral. She performs this dance in front of her only friend, a girl named Carol (Jessie Winter Mudie), who ends their friendship soon afterward.\n\nIn college, Sandra studies biology, carefully dissecting the bodies of small animals, trying to avoid disfiguring them. She gets a job at a funeral home to be closer to dead bodies. The funeral home's janitor Jan (James Timmons) believes, like Sandra, that dead bodies still have a soul in them. While driving the hearse with a body in a coffin in the back through a car wash, Sandra looks at the body and finds a shining light, believing that body's soul is alive somewhere.\n\nMr. Wallis apprentices Sandra in embalming. She starts studying mortuary science, where she meets a medical student named Matt ([[Peter Outerbridge]]) who also must study corpses for his major. Matt and Sandra begin to date, and Matt is intrigued by Sandra's death fascination. Occasionally they spend nights together in Matt's basement apartment, but Sandra always leaves for late night visits to the mortuary to celebrate the dead bodies of young men with dance ceremonies which escalate into [[necrophilia]].\n\nMatt becomes distraught when he discovers that he is competing with dead bodies. He tries unsuccessfully to get Sandra to talk about her necrophilia, so he starts visiting her at the funeral home, which upsets her. Matt has to go to an extreme to win Sandra's heart, as she struggles with choosing between the living or the dead, with tragic results.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Molly Parker]] as Sandra Larson\n**Natasha Morley as young Sandra\n*[[Peter Outerbridge]] as Matt\n*[[Jay Brazeau]] as Mr. Wallis, Mortician\n*Jessie Winter Mudie as Carol, young Sandra's best friend\n*James Timmons as Jan, Mortuary Janitor\n*Joe Maffei as Biology Teacher\n*[[Robert Thurston]] as Detective\n*Annabel Kershaw as Mother Larson\n*[[Tim Dixon]] as Father Larson, owner of Larson's Flowers\n\n==Production==\n===Concept===\n[[File:Barbara Gowdy - Eden Mills Writers Festival - 2017 (DanH-9388) (cropped).jpg|thumb|\"We So Seldom Look on Love\", a 1992 short story about a necrophile written by Barbara Gowdy (''pictured'') was Lynne Stopkewich main inspiration for ''Kissed'']]\n\nOriginally, Director [[Lynne Stopkewich]] had no particular interest in death or necrophilia.

It's like 'You can run but you can't hide!'\".{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=63, note 20}} }} The director also said she was confronted by people angry \"with the fact we've created this character who is totally inaccessible from a male, heterosexual standpoint\",<ref name=vansun/> and commented Sandra's sexual acts were not [[phallocentric]].<ref name=cold/> Paakspuu, in the chapter \"Lynne Stopkewich: Abject Sexualities\" of ''Great Canadian Film Directors'', described Sandra as an \"[[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]-driven, free spirit, in touch with her feelings and emotions\u2014a loner with the sensitivity of a poet\",{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=386}} and said that her quest for [[forbidden knowledge]] and deviant sexuality made her \"a woman to fear\".{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=390}}\n\nLee Parpart, writing in ''The Gendered Screen: Canadian Women Filmmakers'', commented that ''Kissed'' features \"contradictory impulses\" in the simultaneous wish to have the audience sympathy and to keep them out of their comfort zone that make difficult to say if it is or not a feminist film.{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=52}} On one hand, Stopkewich called ''Kissed'' \"the Disney version of a film about necrophilia\", which Parpart agreed when she analyzed the different portrayal Sandra had in Gowdy's short story. Parpart said Stopkewich \"de-radicalize\" core aspects of the original story by removing its emphasis on middle-aged femininity, adding a spiritual tone that makes her sound inoffensive, making changes in her voice tone, and changing its ending to one that aligns Sandra with the domestic values of loyalty and monogamy.{{sfn|Parpart|2010|pp=48-49}}{{efn|Parpart further said Stopkewich's Sandra never utters \"necrophile\" and \"cunnilingus\", both used in the short story. Also, Gowdy's story concludes with Sandra saying, \"I am still a necrophile, occasionally and recklessly. I have found no replacement for the torrid serenity of a cadaver\", while the film ends with the line \"I still work at a funeral home, and I still cross over. But now I see Matt when I look at the centre\". According to Parpart, this ending diminishes Sandra's sexual extremism by \"aligning her with the domestic values of loyalty and monogamy\" because it portrays Sandra as Matt's soulmate even after his death, and as a kind of \"necrophiliac widow who will forever be haunted by the memory of her favourite corpse\".{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=49}} }} She also stated that the fact that the characters's deviant sexuality is contained within a [[heteronormative]] context helped its normalization.{{efn|Parpart noted Sandra is portrayed as \"unambiguously heterosexual\" both in the short story and in the film. Although Matt suggests that Sandra might be lesbian, Sandra, surprised, dismisses it in the film, and \"her blinking, startled expression at the thought of sleeping with a dead woman rather than a dead man arguably helps to further normalize Sandra's otherwise hugely unorthodox sexual aims\".{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=50}} }} On the other hand, Parpart observed the film had a modernist desire to provide audience with intellectual discomfort as evidenced by Stopkewich's use of white light to constrain walking out people.{{sfn|Parpart|2010|pp=50-51}} She further declared it fit [[third-wave feminism]]'s trend for female icons who balance empowerment with sexual availability and allure,{{sfn|Parpart|2010|pp=51-52}} and functioned as part of the debates within 1980s feminism in North America, including [[Feminist views on pornography|feminist reconsiderations of the role of pornography and its censorship]].{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=63, note 21}}\n\nPaakspuu analyzed that Sandra's obsession with death is associated with her first menstruation\u2014an addition done by Stopkewich that fills in details that have only been implied in Gowdy's story.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|pp=388-390}} One of the first moments Sandra realizes her passion is when she is playing with dead animals along her friend Carol. At one point, Sandra is reprehended by Carol when she thinks Sandra had rubbed herself with animal blood when it is actually menstrual blood. According to Paakspuu, Carol's reaction could be interpreted as demonstrating a moral belief system that opposes a \"good\" blood (menstrual/life giving) to a \"bad\" one (from death/injury). By doing that, Stopkewich subverts what would be common and naturalizes the [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=390}}\n\n===Light use and spirituality===\n[[File:PER51895 061.jpg|thumb|The 1974 film ''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]'', directed by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] (''pictured''), was an influence on Stopkewich's symbolic use of white light in ''Kissed'']]\n\nThe display of light and darkness in ''Kissed'' was meant to be symbolic by Stopkewich, who was influenced by Gowdy's description of Sandra's sexual acts as \"being like being burned by a white light\".<ref name=fm/> Since necrophilia is usually seen as a morbid subject, Stopkewich tried to subvert this perception by making Sandra \"a child of light (and by association) of goodness\".{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}} The director said: \"We used burns to white whenever Sandra touches death to play against the idea of a cold so deep it is seen as a white light\".<ref name=fm/> The whiteness was also influenced by and a homage to German [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 1974 film ''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]'', in which blinding fades to white denote the protagonist's desire to be free from the constraints of social status.<ref name=fm/>{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}} Sandra's necrophile acts are the moments in which fog filters are used to create a \"spirit-filled glow or 'aura' around the characters\" that \"intensify the lyrical, dream-like quality of 'crossing over'\", as described by Paakspuu.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}} Lee Parpart argued that the use of fog filters, halo effects, beloweye-line shots, and the white light made ''Kissed'' \"sells its blood-loving lead character as a sensitive figure whose stated motivation for sleeping with dead bodies ... becomes all the more believable and acceptable because she is lit and shot in a way that lends her a kind of otherworldly beauty and innocence\".{{sfn|Parpart|2010|p=49}}\n\nPaakspuu noted Stopkewich created a moral dichotomy through her symbolic use of lights, colour palette, scenarios, and sounds in the film. Sandra, presented as \"a light-drenched angel\" in Paakspuu's words, is shown in sparsely decorated grey-blue that mirrors the clarity of corpses. She becomes illuminated by red when she is courted by Matt, \"embodying the uncontained sensuality and sexuality of a noir vamp\".{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=390}} Matt is also thematically connected to darkness because of his basement apartment and attitudes like sitting in the dark and jumping out of the darkness at Sandra leaving the funeral home.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}} Stopkweich said, \"Darkness too plays a part if only to differentiate from the 'light' of Sandra's experience\".{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|pp=390-391}} Paakspuu wrote that Matt's darkness is shown by his interest in alternative realities and his lack of own motives that makes him try to fill that gap by making Sandra's interest his own.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}} While she is associated with nature, shyness, and virginity because of her pagan and ritualistic's world, Matt's one is linked to science and technology and is claustrophobic and distracting.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=390}} As such, their soundscapes reflect a [[nature\u2013culture divide]], in which Matt's surrounding sounds like traffic, household appliances and airplanes stand for the culture, while Sandra's [[classical element]]s and animals' sound effects stand for nature.{{sfn|Paakspuu|2007|p=391}}\n\nMany film critics considered that necrophilia was not the subject ''per se'' of the film.
