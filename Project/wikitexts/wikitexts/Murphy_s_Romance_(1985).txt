The screenplay by [[Harriet Frank Jr.]] and [[Irving Ravetch]] was based on the 1980 novella by [[Max Schott]]. The film stars [[Sally Field]], [[James Garner]], [[Brian Kerwin]], and [[Corey Haim]], and was produced by [[Laura Ziskin]] for Field's production company Fogwood Films.\n\nThe film's theme song, \"Love for the Last Time\", is performed by [[Carole King]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nEmma Moriarty ([[Sally Field]]) is a 33-year-old, divorced mother who moves to a rural Arizona town to make a living by training and boarding horses. She becomes friends with the town's pharmacist, Murphy Jones ([[James Garner]]), an idiosyncratic widower. A romance between them seems unlikely because of Murphy's age and because Emma allows her ex-husband, Bobby Jack Moriarty ([[Brian Kerwin]]), to move back in with her and their 12-year-old son Jake ([[Corey Haim]]).\n\nEmma struggles to make ends meet, but is helped by Murphy. While refusing to help her outright with charity or personal loan, Murphy gives a part-time job to Jake and buys a horse with her assistance, boarding it with Emma and encouraging others to do the same. He also provides emotional support for Emma and Jake.\n\nA rivalry develops between Murphy and Bobby Jack, who is immature and dishonest. Emma and Murphy fall in love despite Bobby Jack's efforts to hamper their romance. Bobby Jack finally leaves town after an 18-year-old  he had a fling appears at the ranch with their newborn twin sons. With him gone, Murphy and Emma are free to pursue a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sally Field]] as Emma Moriarty\n* [[James Garner]] as Murphy Jones\n* [[Brian Kerwin]] as Bobby Jack Moriarty\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Jake Moriarty\n* [[Dennis Burkley]] as Freeman Coverly\n* [[Carole King]] as Tillie\n* [[Georgann Johnson]] as Margaret\n* Dortha Duckworth as Bessie\n* Michael Prokopuk as Albert\n* Billy Ray Sharkey as Larry Le Beau\n* Michael Crabtree as Jim Forrest\n* [[Anna Thomson|Anna Levine]] as Wanda\n* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Amos Abbott\n* [[Bruce French (actor)|Bruce French]] as Rex Boyd\n* [[John C.

However, Columbia agreed because of the success of ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), with the same star (Field), director, and screenwriting team ([[Harriet Frank Jr.]] and [[Irving Ravetch]]), and with Field's new production company Fogwood Films producing. Columbia then wanted [[Marlon Brando]], or someone with \"greater box-office allure\", to play the part of Murphy, so Field and Ritt had to insist on Garner.<ref>Cameron, Julia. \"Garner Fits Romantic Role, Not Hollywood Pigeonhole.\"''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', January 19, 1986.</ref><ref>Laurence, Robert P. \"Garner doesn't go by the book in role in 'Breathing Lessons'.\" ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'', February 6, 1994.</ref><ref>Rosenthal, Phil. \"Garner Remains TV's Class Act.\"''[[Daily News of Los Angeles]]'', February 6, 1994.</ref><ref>Sachs, Lloyd. \"Sally Field says what she means\u2014'Murphy's Romance' star is not just another perky face.\" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', January 19, 1986.

Field had worked successfully with Newman in 1981's ''[[Absence of Malice]]'', but Newman declined the project, and Garner was the only other actor that Ritt and Field had asked.<ref name=LumenickL-TR-1985-01-17>[[Lou Lumenick|Lumenick, Lou]]. \"For Sally Field, A Two-Sided Romance.\" ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'', January 17, 1986.

It did a limited, selected, release for the film on December 25, 1985, so that it would qualify for that year's [[Academy Awards]].<ref name=LumenickL-TR-1985-01-17 />\n\nThe screenplay is very different from the [[Max Schott]] novella. In the Schott story, Murphy and Emma stay just platonic friends. Murphy marries someone else, and then tries to find Emma a suitable husband.<ref name=\"LumenickL-TR-1985-01-17\" />\n\nThe film was one of the final titles to be released on the now defunct [[CED Videodisc]] format in 1986.\n\n==Reception==\nReviews were generally favorable. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars (out of 4), stating \"Much depends on exactly what Emma and Murphy say to each other, and how they say it, and what they don't say. The movie gets it all right.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860117/REVIEWS/601170303/1023 Murphy's Romance] from [[Roger Ebert]]'s ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' website</ref> The film holds a rating of 74% on review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 27 reviews.<ref>{{Rotten-tomatoes|murphys_romance}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n''Murphy's Romance'' received Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (James Garner) and for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[William A.
