It is the first installment in the [[Kung Fu Panda|''Kung Fu Panda'' franchise]]. Directed by [[John Stevenson (director)|John Stevenson]] (in his feature directorial debut) and [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]], the film stars the voices of [[Jack Black]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Ian McShane]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Lucy Liu]], [[David Cross]], [[Randall Duk Kim]], [[James Hong]], [[Dan Fogler]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and [[Jackie Chan]]. The film is set in a version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic animals and revolves around a bumbling panda named [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]], a kung-fu enthusiast. When a notorious [[Snow leopard|snow-leopard]] named Tai Lung is foretold to escape from prison, Po is unwittingly named the \"Dragon Warrior\" \u2013 a prophesied hero worthy of reading a scroll said to grant its reader limitless power.<ref>{{cite news|access-date=September 1, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7560194.stm|title=Kung Fu Panda sequel in pipeline|work=BBC|date=August 14, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally conceived by Michael Lachance, a DreamWorks Animation executive. It was originally intended to be a parody of martial arts films, but director Stevenson decided instead to make an action-comedy ''[[wuxia]]'' film that incorporates the [[hero's journey]] narrative [[archetype]] for the lead character. The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. As with most DreamWorks Animation films, [[Hans Zimmer]] (this time collaborating with [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]]) scored ''Kung Fu Panda''. He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the [[China National Symphony Orchestra]] as part of his preparation.\n  \n''Kung Fu Panda'' premiered in the United States on June 6, 2008. The film received positive reviews for its mature themes, faithfulness to the Chinese environment and tradition, action sequences, and writing. ''Kung Fu Panda'' opened in 4,114 theaters, grossing $20.3&nbsp;million on its opening day and $60.2&nbsp;million on its opening weekend, resulting in the number one position at the box office. The film became DreamWorks' biggest opening for a non-sequel film, making it [[2008 in film|the third highest-grossing film of 2008]], the highest-grossing animated film of the year worldwide, and also had the fourth-largest opening weekend for a DreamWorks film at the American and Canadian box office, behind all three ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' sequels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37302907/ns/today-entertainment/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526010221/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37302907/ns/today-entertainment/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 26, 2010|title='Shrek Forever After' roars to top of box office|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 23, 2010|access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film|Golden Globe Award]] for best animated film, but lost both awards to ''[[WALL-E]]''. The success of ''Kung Fu Panda'' launched a multimedia franchise and two sequels, with ''[[Kung Fu Panda 2]]'' (2011) and ''[[Kung Fu Panda 3]]'' (2016) with a fourth film in the works for release in 2024.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be around 400-700 words. Current wordcount is at 693. -->\nIn the Valley of Peace, a land in [[Ancient China]] inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]], a clumsy [[giant panda]], helps his adoptive father Mr. Ping run their noodle restaurant. Po dreams of fighting alongside the Furious Five \u2013 Masters Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis \u2013 a group of [[kung fu]] masters who live in the Jade Palace, where they are trained by Master Shifu, a cranky [[red panda]]. The wise [[tortoise]], Master Oogway predicts that Shifu's former [[snow leopard]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tai Lung, will escape from prison and attack the valley to obtain the Dragon Scroll, a legendary artifact he had previously been denied. Panicked, Shifu sends a cowardly goose named Zeng to increase the security at Chorh-Gom Prison in [[Mongolia]].\n\nAt the same time, Shifu holds a tournament for the Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the prophesied hero worthy of reading the Scroll, which is said to grant limitless power on its reader. Po arrives too late to enter the arena; desperate to see his idols, he accidentally launches himself into the middle of the arena, where Oogway proclaims him the Dragon Warrior. Believing Oogway's decision to be an accident, Shifu tries to dispose of Po with a harsh training regime, while the Five dismiss Po as an enthusiast with no potential in martial arts. Po considers quitting, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and gradually befriends the Five with his resilience, culinary skill, and good humor.\n\nDuring this time, Po learns that Shifu's cold and distant behavior stems from his own shame over Tai Lung's betrayal, having raised him from infancy. At Chorh-Gom Prison, Zeng's warnings are ignored, and Tai Lung escapes. Shifu informs Oogway of the event, with the latter making him promise to believe in Po as the Dragon Warrior. Oogway then [[Ascension (mystical)|passes on to the heavens]] in a stream of peach blossoms. Upon hearing that Oogway has died and that Tai Lung is fast approaching, Po, still unable to make any progress with kung fu, makes Shifu admit that he does not know how to train the panda into the Dragon Warrior.\n\nTigress overhears this and leads the Five in an attempt to stop Tai Lung themselves, unbeknownst to Po and Shifu. Meanwhile, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food, and successfully trains Po by incorporating these feats into an innovative kung fu style. The Furious Five fight Tai Lung; however, all but Crane are soon defeated by his nerve-strike fighting technique.\n\nCrane carries the Five back to the Jade Palace, where Shifu revives them and decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll. When Po reads it, he discovers that the scroll is nothing but a blank reflective surface. Despaired, Po and the Five evacuate the inhabitants of the Valley, while Shifu prepares to face Tai Lung alone. In trying to console a distraught Po, Mr. Ping reveals that his \"secret ingredient soup\" has no secret ingredient, explaining that things are special with belief. Realizing that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll, Po rushes back to help Shifu. At the Jade Palace, Tai Lung overpowers Shifu and demands to know the location of the Scroll.\n\nPo arrives with the Dragon Scroll and challenges Tai Lung to combat. Tai Lung eventually wins, but also despairs over the blank scroll, and takes out his anger on Po. Discovering that his body fat renders him immune to Tai Lung's nerve strikes, Po trounces his adversary with his new kung fu style, and eventually banishes him to the Spirit Realm using the Wuxi Finger Hold technique. Po is honored by the Valley and gains the respect of the Furious Five. In a post-credits scene, Shifu and Po share a meal while a peach that Shifu had planted earlier in the movie grows into a tree in the background.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{see|List of Kung Fu Panda characters}}\n[[File:Kung Fu Panda The Five.jpg|upright=1.36|thumb|right|From left to right: Master Viper, Master Monkey, Master Mantis (on Monkey's head), Master Shifu, Master Tigress, and Master Crane.<br />\n<br />The Furious Five are homages to the actual [[Snake Kung Fu|Snake]], [[Monkey Kung Fu|Monkey]], [[Northern Praying Mantis|Praying Mantis]], [[Hung Ga|Tiger]], and [[Fujian White Crane|Crane]] styles of [[Chinese martial arts]].<ref>{{cite web |access-date=September 1, 2008 |url=http://www.kungfupanda.com |title=''Kung Fu Panda''-production-five fighting warriors |publisher=DreamWorks}}</ref>]]\n* [[Jack Black]] as [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]], an energetic and accident-prone yet heroic [[giant panda]] and a die-hard kung-fu fan who eventually becomes The Dragon Warrior.\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Master Shifu, an elderly and strict [[red panda]] and kung-fu master to the Furious Five and Po and Tai Lung's old master/adopted father.\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as Grand Master Oogway, an ancient [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]] and Shifu's mentor.\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Tai Lung, an arrogant and aggressive [[Snow leopard|snow-leopard]] who was formerly Shifu's adoptive son and student.\n* The Furious Five:\n** [[Angelina Jolie]] as Master Tigress, a no-nonsense and tough-as-nails [[South China tiger|South China tigress]] and leader of the Furious Five.\n** [[Seth Rogen]] as Master Mantis, a dry-humored [[Chinese mantis]].\n** [[Lucy Liu]] as Master Viper, a sweet and good-natured [[Craspedocephalus gramineus|green tree-viper]].
