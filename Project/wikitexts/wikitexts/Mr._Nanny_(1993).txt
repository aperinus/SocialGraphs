Burt Wilson ([[Sherman Hemsley]]), Sean's friend and former manager, has a bum leg from saving Sean's life and financial difficulties with his personal security business. With much whining and acting, Burt manages to persuade Sean to take a [[bodyguard]] job for Alex Mason Sr. ([[Austin Pendleton]]), the head of the prestigious tech firm, Mason Systems, which is developing a new anti-missile system, the Peacefinder Project. The vital information for this project is stored on a [[integrated circuit|microchip]]. But it is neither the inventor nor the chip Sean has to guard - he is to look after the two Mason kids: Alex Jr. ([[Robert Hy Gorman|Robert Gorman]]) and Kate ([[Madeline Zima]]).\n\nAlex and Kate are two highly mischievous kids who vie for their often-too-absent father's attention by wreaking havoc in the household via elaborate and rather vicious pranks and booby-traps, with their specialty targets being the nannies he has assigned to take care of them (Alex Sr. is a widower). However, their father proves to be either too distracted or too lenient, which causes the children to continue their schemes. Thinking that he is a new (albeit unusual) replacement, they find a new target in Sean. But after one prank too many, which involves a swimming pool full of red dye (\"the Pit of Blood\"), Sean finally exerts his authority and not only gets to quiet Alex and Kate down, he also manages to open the eyes of their father to his family problems, as well as bonding with the kids and managing to help them sort out problems of their own.\n\nMason's chip is coveted by Tommy Thanatos ([[David Johansen]]), an unscrupulous and vain criminal who will not stop at anything to get it. As it turns out, Sean and Burt had been once at the receiving end of one of his schemes: he had ordered them to throw a match, and when they had not complied, he attempted to shoot them. However, Burt threw himself in front of Sean, taking the bullet in his right leg; Sean had chased Thanatos to the roof of the stadium, and after a furious fight, Thanatos ended up plunging head-first into an empty pool. This accident fractured the top of his skull, forcing the attachment of a steel skullplate and removing part of his proud [[afro|afro mane]].\n\nThanatos kidnaps Alex Sr. with the help of Frank Olsen ([[Raymond O'Connor]]), the corrupt security chief of Mason Systems (who is disposed of en route to the hideout), and demands of him to hand over the chip. When Alex Sr. (who stowed the chip in Kate's doll) refuses, Thanatos has Alex and Kate kidnapped in order to force him to comply. Despite a valiant effort, Sean is overpowered and Burt is taken as well, giving Thanatos an unexpected revenge bonus. But Sean manages to track down Thanatos, and with the help of his friends is able to beat the villains. As Thanatos prepares to charge Sean, Alex Sr. and the children activate an improvised electromagnet to launch him into the night sky, leaving only his skullplate.\n\nThe movie ends with Sean preparing to take a leave of absence from the Masons. But Alex and Kate intend to have him back much sooner - and therefore Sean falls victim to yet another prank.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Hulk Hogan]] as Sean Armstrong\n* [[Sherman Hemsley]] as Burt Wilson\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Alex Mason Sr.\n* [[Madeline Zima]] as Kate Mason\n* [[Robert Hy Gorman|Robert Gorman]] as Alex Mason Jr. \n* [[Mother Love (entertainer)|Mother Love]] as Corinne\n* [[David Johansen]] as Tommy Thanatos\n* [[Raymond O'Connor]] as Frank Olsen\n* Peter Kent as Wolfgang\n* Jen Sung as Kojiro\n* Jeff Moldovan as Jocko\n* Artie Malesci as Skipper\n* Tim Powell as Lieutenant\n* Sandy Mielke as Principal\n* Darci Osiecky as Teacher\n* Kelly Erin as Nanny\n* Joshua Santiago as Bully #1\n* Danny Fotou as Bully #2\n* [[Afa Anoa\u02bbi]] as Himself\n* [[Brutus Beefcake]] as Himself\n* [[George Steele|George \"The Animal\" Steele]] as Himself\n* [[Jim Neidhart|Jim \u201cThe Anvil\u201d Neidhart]] as Himself (uncredited)\n* [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] as Himself (uncredited)\n* Angeline-Rose Troy as Student (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing just $4.3 million against its $10 million budget.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film was poorly received by critics.
