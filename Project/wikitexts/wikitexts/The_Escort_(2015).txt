When he is fired, he applies for a job with a magazine. The editor promises to hire him if he writes a more interesting article than his competitors. He decides to write about Natalie, a [[Stanford University|Stanford]]-educated [[Call girl|escort]] he met by chance. She is not interested at first, but after a violent encounter with a client, she allows him to accompany her and provide security. Mitch learns that Natalie also tutors school children in mathematics, she finds out about his sex addiction, and they become friends. When he visits his father and sister, he presents her as his girlfriend. She stands up for him when his father puts him down for not having achieved much, and she tells him that she was [[Cyberbullying|Internet-bullied]] because of a sex journal she wrote in college and cannot get a regular job. They have sex that night, and Mitch shows signs of jealousy when he accompanies her to her next clients. He picks a fight with one of them, and he and Natalie fall out. He later confesses his feelings for her and tries to make up with her, but she refuses.\n\nAt first Mitch does not want to go through with his article about Natalie, but the editor encourages him to, and the story becomes a success, which impresses his father. Mitch gets the job and joins a self-help group for his sex addiction. Finally, Natalie contacts him, tells him that she has given up prostitution, is enrolled in an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] program and intends to start a legitimate tutoring business, and admits she loves him too. They start a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lyndsy Fonseca]] as Natalie (aka Victoria)\n*[[Michael Doneger]] as Mitch\n*[[Tommy Dewey]] as JP \n*[[Bruce Campbell]] as Charles\n*Rachel Resheff as Emily\n*[[Rumer Willis]] as Dana\n*[[Steven Ogg]] as Warren\n*[[Iqbal Theba]] as Richard\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to Sheri Linden of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Michael Doneger and his co-star Lyndsy Fonseca in ''The Escort'' \"played with charm... and their mercenary alliance proceeds as a spirited, mostly convincing, exploration of life in the big city.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/escort-laff-review-801401|title='The Escort': LAFF Review|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=June 23, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* 2015 [[Los Angeles Film Festival]]\n** Nominated \u2014 LA Muse Award (Will Slocombe)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|3793788}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_escort_2015}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Escort, The}}\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 independent films]]\n[[Category:2015 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:The Orchard (company) films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
