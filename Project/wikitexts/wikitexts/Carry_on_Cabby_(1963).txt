Released on 7 November 1963,<ref name=\"Art & Hue\" /> it was the first to have a screenplay written by [[Talbot Rothwell]] (although the first screenplay \"Tolly\" submitted to Peter Rogers was developed as ''[[Carry On Jack]]'') from a story by [[Dick Hills and Sid Green]] (script writers for [[Morecambe and Wise]]). Regulars [[Sid James]], [[Hattie Jacques]], [[Kenneth Connor]] and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] are all present. [[Liz Fraser]] makes her third appearance (and last for more than a decade) and both [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] and [[Esma Cannon]] make their final (and in both cases, fourth) appearances. This was the first film in the series to feature ''Carry On'' regular [[Jim Dale]], and the first not to feature [[Kenneth Williams]] in the cast. Williams turned down the role of Allbright due to what he considered an inferior script. The part was scaled down, and given to [[Norman Chappell]].\n\n''Carry On Cabby'' was originally planned as a non-Carry On film, called ''Call Me A Cab'' (after a stage play) but midway through development it became part of the ''Carry On'' series. The film is notable from others in the series for its dramatic plotline of a troubled marriage.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Austin FX3 Metropolitan taxi (1958) - 30178349803.jpg|thumb|[[Austin FX3]] taxicab]]\n[[File:Ford Consul Cortina (1964).jpg|thumb|[[Ford Cortina]]]]\nCharlie Hawkins ([[Sid James]]) is the workaholic owner of thriving taxi company ''Speedee Taxis'', but his wife Peggy ([[Hattie Jacques]]) feels neglected by him. When Charlie misses their fifteenth [[wedding anniversary]], because he is out cabbing, she decides to punish him. Telling Charlie that she is going to 'get a job', she establishes a rival company, ''GlamCabs''. The cars are brand new [[Ford Cortina]] Mk1s and driven by attractive girls in provocative [[uniforms]]. Flo, the wife of one of Charlie's drivers, is appointed to the post of office manager.\n\nCharlie continues to coach his mainly inept (and often ex-army) drivers, including the clumsy Terry \"Pintpot\" Tankard ([[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]), whilst Peggy refuses to tell Charlie about her new job. Charlie feigns a lack of interest, but he is dying to know. As Charlie unsuccessfully struggles to cope with his wife's absences, and realises just what she had to endure, Peggy's company becomes a thriving success due to the large number of male taxi passengers preferring to ogle her sexy drivers during journeys. Speedee rapidly starts losing money and faces bankruptcy. Peggy feels terrible for what she has done. Charlie and his drivers attempt to [[sabotage]] the rival company, but they are chased off.\n\nIn desperation, Charlie suggests a [[merger]] with his rivals, but is furious to discover who the real owner is and storms off.\n\nA month later, Peggy is living at the office and Charlie has turned to drink, allowing his company to collapse around him. Peggy and Sally ([[Liz Fraser]]) are [[carjacking|hijacked]] by bank robbers. Peggy manages to use the [[taxicab|taxi]] radio to subtly reveal their situation and location. Charlie intercepts the broadcast and rallies the other ''Speedee'' drivers in pursuit. The robbers are cornered and captured.\n\nPeggy and Charlie are reconciled, especially over the fact that she is expecting a baby.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sid James]] as Charlie Hawkins\n* [[Hattie Jacques]] as Peggy Hawkins\n* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] as Terry \"Pintpot\" Tankard\n* [[Kenneth Connor]] as Ted Watson\n* [[Esma Cannon]] as Flo Sims\n* [[Liz Fraser]] as Sally\n* [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as Smiley Sims\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Len\n* [[Jim Dale]] as Expectant father\n* [[Norman Chappell]] as Allbright \n* [[Judith Furse]] as Battleaxe\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Houston]] as Molly\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] as Aristocratic lady\n* [[Amanda Barrie]] as Anthea\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Dumb driver\n* [[Cyril Chamberlain]] as Sarge\n* [[Peter Gilmore]] as Dancy\n* [[Michael Ward (actor)|Michael Ward]] as Man in tweeds\n* [[Noel Dyson]] as District nurse\n* [[Michael Nightingale]] as Businessman\n* [[Ian Wilson (actor)|Ian Wilson]] as Clerk\n* [[Peter Byrne (actor)|Peter Byrne]] as Bridegroom\n* [[Darryl Kavann]] as Punchy\n* [[Peter Jesson]] as Car salesman\n* [[Don McCorkindale (actor)|Don McCorkindale]] as Tubby\n* [[Charles Stanley (actor)|Charles Stanley]] as Geoff\n* [[Marian Collins]] as Bride\n* [[Frank Forsyth]] as Chauffeur\n* [[Norman Mitchell]] as Bespectacled businessman (uncredited)\n* [[Marian Horton]] as Glamcab driver (uncredited)\n* [[Valerie Van Ost]] as Glamcab driver (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Crew==\n\n* Screenplay \u2013 [[Talbot Rothwell]]\n* Idea \u2013 SC Green & RM Hills\n* Music \u2013 [[Eric Rogers (composer)|Eric Rogers]]\n* Associate Producer \u2013 [[Frank Bevis]]\n* Art Director \u2013 [[Jack Stephens (set decorator)|Jack Stephens]]\n* Editor \u2013 Archie Ludski\n* Director of Photography \u2013 [[Alan Hume]]\n* Camera Operator \u2013 Godfrey Godar\n* Unit Manager \u2013 Donald Toms\n* Assistant Director \u2013 Peter Bolton\n* Sound Editor \u2013 Arthur Ridout\n* Sound Recordists \u2013 [[Bill Daniels]] & Gordon K McCallum\n* Hairdressing \u2013 Biddy Chrystal\n* Make-up Artists \u2013 Geoffrey Rodway & Jim Hydes\n* Continuity \u2013 Penny Daniels\n* Costume Designer \u2013 Joan Ellacott\n* Producer \u2013 [[Peter Rogers]]\n* Director \u2013 [[Gerald Thomas]]\n\n==Filming and locations==\n\n* Filming dates: 25 March&nbsp;\u2013 7 May 1963\n\n'''Interiors''':\n\n* [[Pinewood Studios]], Buckinghamshire\n\n'''Exteriors''':\n\n* The streets of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]\n\nThe scene in which \"Pintpot\" (Charles Hawtrey) drives a cab (PEG 1) round and round a roundabout was filmed at the junction of Goswell Road and Arthur Road, Windsor, with the railway arches of Windsor & Eton Central Station visible in the background.
