A direct sequel to ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' (2004), it is the third installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Capcom]] [[survival horror]] [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]]. The film follows the heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], along with a group of survivors from [[Raccoon City]], as they attempt to travel across the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave desert]] wilderness to [[Alaska]] and escape a [[zombie apocalypse]].<ref name=\"Production Notes\">{{cite web | date=Fall 2007| title=Resident Evil: Extinction Production Notes| work=sonypictures.com | url = http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilextinction/site/download.php?file=library/ResidentEvilExtinction_ProductionNotes.pdf | access-date = December 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2005, [[Screen Gems]] gained the rights for the third installment in the franchise, which was then subtitled ''Extinction''. Anderson returned as a writer, and filming took place in [[Mexico]] with Mulcahy as the director.\n\n''Resident Evil: Extinction'' was released in the United States on September 21, 2007 and was released in the United Kingdom on October 12, 2007, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] versions were released in North America on January 1, 2008. The film grossed $147 million against a $45 million budget. A fourth film, ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'', was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nA cloned Alice wakes up in a mansion, wanders through its halls, and is forced to escape several [[Booby trap|security traps]], mirroring some events of the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]]. During her escape, Alice makes use of new telekinetic powers, killing a security guard. However, she is eventually killed by a [[bounding mine]] hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of other Alice clones, representing the failed results of the [[Umbrella Corporation]]'s ongoing Project Alice.\n\nFollowing Umbrella's attempts to cover up the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|contamination of Raccoon City]], the T-virus spreads around the world, devastating not only the human population, but the entire global environment in the next five years. The real Alice wanders the wasteland that was once the Southwestern U.S., and after fighting off a family of marauders, discovers information in an abandoned notebook referring to an uninfected area in [[Alaska]]. Alice realizes that she, like her clones, has developed [[telekinesis]].\n\nSimultaneously, a convoy of survivors led by [[Claire Redfield]] and Raccoon City survivors [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]] and L.J. Wade travels across the country in search of supplies and safe harbor. While searching a motel, L.J. is bitten by a zombie. Fearing the harsh fate that awaits him, he chooses not to tell the other survivors about the injury. The next morning, the convoy is attacked by a murderous flock of infected crows. With the team nearly overwhelmed, Alice appears and defeats the remaining crows with her newfound [[Psionics|telekinesis]], though falling unconscious. Awaking shortly thereafter, Alice is introduced to Claire and tells her about the notebook, convincing her to take the convoy to Alaska.\n\nIsaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected lead to the creation of a new zombie breed. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater, reports on Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella regulations. Wesker tasks Slater with watching Isaacs, telling him to kill the scientist if he disobeys orders again. Tracing an energy pattern sent out by Alice's telekinesis, Umbrella triangulates her location. Desperate to reclaim Alice for the sake of achieving his goals, Dr. Isaacs sends his new zombies to ambush the convoy against Wesker's specific orders. During the attack, most of the convoy is killed, and L.J. succumbs to his infection, biting Carlos. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from Umbrella's programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he is bitten as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground facility.\n\nApproaching the scene, Alice meets a holograph of the [[List of Resident Evil film characters#Red Queen|Red Queen's]] \"sister\" [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], the White Queen. She informs Alice that her blood can cure the T-virus, defends the Red Queen's prior actions, and reveals what happened to Dr. Isaacs. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice encounters one of her clones, which awakens but appears to die from shock soon after. Alice discovers Isaacs/Tyrant, defeating him after leading him to the replica of The Hive's laser corridor featured in the film's opening. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by the clone, who is still alive.\n\nLater in [[Tokyo]], Wesker informs his fellow Umbrella executives that the North American facility has been lost. Alice appears during the meeting, declaring that she and her \"friends\" (the other clones) are coming for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and her clones. She is an ex-security officer of Umbrella who has turned against them.

Drawing inspirations from [[Spaghetti Western|Western films]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic movies]], including the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' series]], ''Extinction'' manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the [[Peak oil|shortage of oil]], the shortage of supplies, a [[Mad Max 2|convoy traveling across a desert]], and the desert taking over civilized land.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\nAnderson stated that the film's story is original and unfolds in a world that fans of the game recognize: \"It's all part of trying to deliver a movie-going experience that satisfies the fans of the game but also provides a fun cinematic experience for a broader audience that has never played a ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> The story takes place five years after the events of ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. While previous installments in the series had minor changes to plot and characters, ''Extinction'' branches completely away from the video game series as evidenced by the fact that ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' takes place six years after the events portrayed in ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and the world has not become overrun with zombies. References to ''[[Resident Evil \u2013 Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica]]'' are made, such as the replica mansion and the viral outbreak itself.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> A common element used throughout each ''Resident Evil'' film is the climactic battle which occurs in the finale.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> ''Extinction'' marked the first appearance of herbs, a healing item in the video game series, as seen in Dr. Isaac's lab,<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> and it also referenced the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]] with the inclusion of a replica [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|Hive facility]] designed after the one in [[Raccoon City]], the Raccoon City Hospital, a holographic computer database known as the White Queen, and the replica Spencer Mansion.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\nNumerous references to the video game series have been made, including zombies being unleashed through a T-virus mutation. While the concept of the undead remains the same, this film includes \"Super Undead\". As Anderson explains, these are \"a result of Umbrella experimenting with the Undead and attempting to give them back some of their reasoning power, some of their intelligence and a little of their humanity. Unfortunately, these experiments don't quite work and the side effect is the Super Undead, which are Undead that are faster, stronger and [a] more cunning foe.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> Other creatures from the video game series have also made appearances in the film, including the [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]], a swarm of crows, and a pack of [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]]s (although [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|Belgian Shepherd Dog]]s were used during production).<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\nTwo main characters were added to the film's cast: [[Albert Wesker]] (portrayed by [[Jason O'Mara]]) and [[Claire Redfield]] (portrayed by [[Ali Larter]]) from ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\nHorror magazine ''[[Fangoria]]'' featured the film in its August 2007 issue and also on the cover of its September 2007 issue, talking with director Russell Mulcahy. The following details reported were inaccurate, possibly indicating to a change in the storyline:\n* Alice's convoy are traveling across the Nevada desert trying to reach sanctuary in [[Alaska]] to meet [[Chris Redfield]] and other survivors. In the film, however, there is no mention of Chris, and the convoy is headed by Claire.\n* The film would feature new \"super zombies\" that had been \"pumped up on some sort of alter-essence steroids\". The final \"super zombies\" are created using blood taken from clones of Alice.\n* Mulcahy stated concerning the (what was then considered to be) ending of the film trilogy, \"As far as I'm aware, this is indeed supposed to close the book.\"\n* ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' takes place eight years after ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. In the film, this was contradicted when characters stated that it had been five years since the outbreak.\n* The character of Claire Redfield did not exist in the early draft scripts for the film and previously [[Jill Valentine]] (who appeared in ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' played by [[Sienna Guillory]]) would continue the role in ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. Later, producers Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt decided to have a separate game character appear alongside Alice, saying, \"We thought, rather than bring Jill back, put her with another game heroine.\"<ref>{{cite magazine
