It stars [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. It was adapted by [[Helen Deutsch]], directed by [[Compton Bennett]] and [[Andrew Marton]] and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn \"[[British East Africa]]\" ([[Kenya Colony]]) in 1897, experienced British safari guide [[Allan Quatermain]] is persuaded by Elizabeth Curtis to look for her husband, who disappeared in the unexplored African interior while searching for the legendary titular mines. She has a copy of the map he used. A tall, mysterious native, Umbopa, joins the [[safari]], as do Elizabeth and her brother John Goode. Allan has no use for women on a safari, but during the long and grueling journey, he and Elizabeth begin to fall in love.\n\nThe party encounters Van Brun, a lone white man living with a tribe. They learn that he met Curtis. However, when Allan recognizes him as a fugitive who cannot afford to let them go, they take him hostage to leave the village safely. Van Brun tries to shoot Allan, killing his faithful right-hand man Khiva instead. Allan dispatches Van Brun, and the party flees from the angry villagers.\n\nWhen they finally reach the region where the mines are supposed to be, they are met by people who resemble Umbopa. They discover that their companion is royalty; he has returned to attempt to dethrone the evil usurper King Twala (Baziga). Umbopa leaves with his supporters to raise a rebellion, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala. With his last rifle bullet, John kills a would-be attacker, temporarily quelling the natives.\n\nThe king's advisor, Gagool, communicates that they have seen Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and the skeletal remains of Elizabeth's husband. While they are distracted by this grisly discovery, Gagool sneaks away and triggers a booby trap that seals them inside the cave. They find a way out through an underground stream and return to Twala's [[kraal]], just as Umbopa and his followers arrive.\n\nUmbopa's people have an unusual method of deciding a disputed kingship. The two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. Afterwards, he provides an escort for his friends' return trip.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as Elizabeth Curtis  \n* [[Stewart Granger]] as Allan Quatermain  \n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as John Goode  \n* [[Hugo Haas]] as Van Brun (\"Smith\")\n* [[Lowell Gilmore]] as Eric Masters\n* Kimursi as Khiva (credited as Kimursi of the Kipsigi Tribe)  \n* Siriaque as Umbopa \n* Sekaryongo as Chief Gagool\n* Baziga as King Twala (credited as Baziga of the Watussi Tribe)\n\n==Production==\nIn November 1946, MGM announced they had purchased film rights to the novel from [[Gaumont British]], who made the 1937 adaptation. [[Sam Zimbalist]] was assigned the job of producing.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Metro Signs Gable to New Contract: Actor Agrees to Take Lead in 'Hucksters,' With Deborah Kerr, English Player Of Local Origin|date=November 4, 1946|newspaper=The New York Times|page=42}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1948, Helen Deutsch was assigned to write the script.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Metro is Planning Musical of Old Hit|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 20, 1948|page=37}}</ref>\n\nMGM typically made one or two big \"overseas\" spectacles a year around this time.

But it strays even further from the novel than the 1937 British adaptation ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1937 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]''. There are several African characters in the book, particularly Umbopa, a king in disguise. In the earlier film, [[Paul Robeson]] received [[Billing (film)|top billing]] for the role, whereas in this version, Umbopa's importance is greatly reduced.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Deborah Kerr]] was announced as the female lead in July 1949.<ref>{{cite news |first=Thomas F. |last=Brady |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 23, 1949 |title=Deborah Kerr Gets Metro Movie Lead|id={{ProQuest|105803181}} }} {{subscription required}}</ref> MGM wanted [[Errol Flynn]] to co-star.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hedda Hopper|title=Deborah Kerr Stars in 'Solomon's Mines' |date=July 23, 1949|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |id={{ProQuest|165994338}}|author-link=Hedda Hopper }} {{subscription required}}</ref> The same month Compton Bennett was signed to direct; he had just finished ''[[That Forsyte Woman]]'' for MGM with Flynn.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Walt Disney to Speed 'Cinderella'; Gary Cooper Will Narrate Scenic|author=Schallert, Edwin|date=July 25, 1949|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=A7}}</ref>\n\nFlynn eventually chose instead to star in ''[[Kim (1950 film)|Kim]]''.
