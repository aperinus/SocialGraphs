The screenplay was adapted by John Baines, [[Michael Hogan (screenwriter)|Michael Hogan]], and Frank Launder from the 1908 novel ''[[The Blue Lagoon (novel)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' by [[Henry De Vere Stacpoole]]. The original music score was composed by [[Clifton Parker]] and the cinematography was by [[Geoffrey Unsworth]].\n\nThe film tells the story of two young children shipwrecked on a [[Desert island|tropical island paradise]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Emotional feelings and physical changes arise as they grow to [[Sexual maturity|maturity]] and fall in love. The film has major thematic similarities to the [[Bible|Biblical]] account about [[Adam and Eve]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1841, 8-year-old Emmeline Foster and 10-year-old Michael Reynolds, two British children, are the survivors of a [[shipwreck]] in the South Pacific. After days afloat, they are [[marooning|marooned]] on a lush tropical island in the company of kindly old sailor Paddy Button. Eventually, Paddy dies in a drunken binge, leaving Emmeline and Michael alone. They survive solely on their resourcefulness and the bounty of their remote paradise.\n\nEight years later, in 1849, the now-adult couple live together in the island paradise, fish, and collect \"beads\" from the shellfish in the surrounding lagoon. One day, a ship arrives carrying Doctor Murdoch and James Carter, two British men, who are intimated to have fled as criminals from civilization. Surprised to find the couple on the island, Doctor Murdoch soon realizes that Michael collects valuable pearls without knowing their true worth. While Murdoch attempts to trick Michael into getting him a bounty of pearls, Carter tries to kidnap Emmeline and escape. Murdoch and Carter kill each other on the boat, and Michael and Emmeline vow to never attempt to leave the island again. They marry, and during a tropical storm, a child, Paddy, is born.\n\nIn 1852, Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and wants to leave the island. She fears for their child if Michael and she should die. Michael gives in to her pleading and they pack a small boat and leave the island.  [[wikt:becalmed|Becalmed]] in mid-ocean, they succumb to [[Exposure (environmental hazard)|exposure]]. They are found by a British ship, but the film leaves their fate ambiguous, showing only that Paddy remains alive in the small boat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Emmaline Foster\n* [[Donald Houston]] as Michael Reynolds\n* [[Susan Stranks]] as Emmaline (younger)\n* Peter Rudolph Jones as Michael (younger)\n* [[Noel Purcell (actor)|Noel Purcell]] as Paddy Button\n* [[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]] as Dr. Murdock\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as James Carter\n* [[Nora Nicholson]] as Mrs. Stannard\n* [[Maurice Denham]] as Ship's Captain\n* [[Philip Stainton]] as Mr. Ansty\n* [[Patrick Barr]] as Second Mate\n* Lyn Evans as Trotter\n* [[Russell Waters]] as Craggs\n* [[John Boxer (British actor)|John Boxer]] as Nick Corbett\n* [[Bill Raymond]] as Marsden\n\n==Production history==\nThe film was an adaptation of a novel that had been [[The Blue Lagoon (1923 film)|filmed in 1923]].

The updated version, directed by [[Randal Kleiser]], included nudity and sexual content, although not as much as the book. According to Kleiser himself, it was the book and not the 1949 film that inspired his version of the story. That version was followed in 1991 by the sequel ''[[Return to the Blue Lagoon]]'', starring [[Milla Jovovich]] and [[Brian Krause]]. Although the sequel bears a strong similarity to the 1980 film, it bears little resemblance to Stacpoole's second novel, ''[[The Garden of God]]''. The pearl-greedy traders do not appear in Stacpoole's original novel. However, in Stacpoole's third novel, ''[[The Gates of Morning]]'', a pair of sailors attack the people of a nearby island for pearls after seeing a woman wearing a double pearl hair ornament, as Emmaline does in the 1949 film.<ref>{{Cite web |title='Return to the Blue Lagoon' is for those who liked original |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1991-08-02-1991214206-story.html |access-date=2022-05-19 |website=The Baltimore Sun |language=en}}</ref>\n* A \"contemporary remake\" of ''The Blue Lagoon'' was made for television in 2012. Called ''[[Blue Lagoon: The Awakening]]'', it depicts two contemporary teenagers (played by [[Indiana Evans]] (Emmaline Robinson) and [[Brenton Thwaites]] (Dean McCullen). The male lead from the 1980 film, [[Christopher Atkins]], appears in this film as one of the teachers on the shipborne field trip where Emma and Dean are lost at sea and end up on an island.\n\n==See also==\n* [[State of nature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0041190|The Blue Lagoon (1949)}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_blue_lagoon_1949}}\n* {{TCMDb title|69220|The Blue Lagoon (1949)}}\n* {{AllMovie title|85509|The Blue Lagoon (1949)}}\n* [https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-03#page/n85/mode/2up Review of film] at ''Variety''\n\n{{The Blue Lagoon}}\n{{Launder and Gilliat}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blue Lagoon (1949 film), The}}\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1940s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1949 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about survivors of seafaring accidents or incidents]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on romance novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Henry De Vere Stacpoole]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Frank Launder]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Clifton Parker]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Fiji]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1840s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1841]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1849]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1850s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1852]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Victorian era]]\n[[Category:Films set on uninhabited islands]]\n[[Category:Juvenile sexuality in films]]\n[[Category:1940s British films]]"}]}}}}
