The film co-stars [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Danny DeVito]]. The film follows a romance novelist who must venture beyond her New York City comfort zone to [[Colombia]] in order to save her sister from criminals who are holding her for [[ransom]] as they search for a priceless treasure.\n\nThomas wrote the screenplay in 1979, as the only one in her lifetime. Zemeckis, who at the time was developing ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'', liked Thomas's screenplay and offered to direct but [[20th Century Fox]] initially declined, citing the commercial failure of his first two films ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' and ''[[Used Cars]]''. Zemeckis was eventually dismissed from ''Cocoon'' after an early screening of ''Romancing the Stone'' failed to further impress studio executives. [[Alan Silvestri]], who would collaborate with Zemeckis on his later films, composed the score.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Landekic |first=Lola |title=Romancing the Stone |url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/romancing-the-stone/ |url-status=live |access-date=2022-07-20 |website=www.artofthetitle.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Romancing the Stone'' was released on March 30, 1984, to positive reviews from critics and earned over $115 million worldwide at the [[box office]]. A sequel, ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]'', was released in December 1985.\n\n==Plot==\nJoan Wilder is a successful, but lonely, romance novelist in [[New York City]]. After finishing her latest novel, Joan leaves her apartment to meet her editor, Gloria. On the way she is handed a letter that contains a map, sent by her recently murdered brother-in-law, Eduardo. While she is gone, a man tries to break into her apartment and is discovered by her apartment supervisor, whom he kills. Returning to her apartment, Joan finds it ransacked. She then receives a frantic phone call from her sister Elaine, Eduardo's widow. Elaine has been kidnapped by [[antiquities]] smugglers, cousins Ira and Ralph, and instructs Joan to go to the [[Colombia]]n coastal city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] with the map she received; it is Elaine's ransom.\n\nFlying to Colombia, Joan is diverted from the rendezvous point by Colonel Zolo\u2014the same man that ransacked her apartment looking for the map\u2014by tricking her into boarding the wrong bus. Instead of heading to Cartagena, this bus goes deep into the interior of the country. Ralph realizes this and begins following Joan. After Joan accidentally distracts the bus driver by asking where they are going, the bus crashes into a Land Rover, wrecking both vehicles. As the rest of the passengers walk away, Joan is menaced by Zolo but is saved by the Land Rover's owner, an American exotic bird smuggler named Jack T. Colton. For getting her out of the jungle and to a telephone, Joan promises to pay Jack $375 in [[traveler's cheque]]s.\n\nJack and Joan travel the jungle while eluding Zolo and his [[military police]]. Reaching a small village, they encounter a drug lord named Juan, who is a big fan of Joan's novels and happily helps them escape from Zolo.\n\nAfter a night of dancing and passion in a nearby town, Jack suggests to Joan that they find the treasure themselves before handing over the map. Zolo's men enter the town, so Jack and Joan steal a car to escape\u2014but it is Ralph's car, and he is sleeping in the back. They follow the clues and retrieve the treasure, an enormous [[emerald]] called ''El Coraz\u00f3n'' (\"The Heart\"). Ralph takes the emerald from them at gunpoint, but Zolo's forces appear, distracting Ralph long enough for Jack to steal the jewel back. After being chased into a river and over a waterfall, Jack and Joan are separated on opposite sides of the raging river; Joan has the map, but Jack has the emerald. Jack directs Joan to Cartagena, promising that he will meet her there.\n\nIn Cartagena, Joan meets with Ira, who takes the map and releases Elaine. But Zolo and his men arrive, with a captured Jack and a severely beaten Ralph. As Zolo tortures Joan, Jack tries to throw the emerald into a crocodile pool behind Zolo. Zolo is able to catch the emerald, but then a crocodile jumps up and bites his hand off, swallowing the emerald with it. A shootout ensues between Zolo's soldiers and Ira's gang. Joan and Elaine dash for safety, pursued by the maimed Zolo, as Jack tries to stop the crocodile from escaping. He begrudgingly releases it, to          instead try to save Joan.\n\nA crazed Zolo charges at Joan; she dodges his wild knife slashes and he falls into a crocodile pit. As the authorities arrive, Ira and his men escape, but Ralph is left behind. After a kiss, Jack dives into the water after the crocodile with the emerald, leaving Joan behind with her sister.\n\nLater, Joan is back in New York City, and has written a new novel based on her adventure. Gloria\u2014Joan's publisher\u2014is moved to tears by the story and tells Joan she has another best-seller on her hands. Returning home, she finds Jack waiting for her in a sailboat named the ''Angelina'', after the heroine of Joan's novels, and wearing boots made from the crocodile's skin. He jokes that the crocodile got \"a fatal case of indigestion\" from the emerald, which he sold, using the money to buy the boat of his dreams. They go off together, planning to sail around the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Jack T.
