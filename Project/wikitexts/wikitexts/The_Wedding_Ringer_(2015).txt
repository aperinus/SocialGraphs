Doug Harris, a successful tax attorney, and his fianc\u00e9e Gretchen Palmer are planning their wedding. Frantically needing a best man and groomsmen, Doug contacts Jimmy's company.\n\nDoug needs a \"Golden Tux\" (seven groomsmen) to match with Gretchen's bridesmaids, which has never been done before. Jimmy agrees to do it for $50,000, all expenses paid.\n\nThree of Jimmy's friends are recruited as groomsmen: Fitzgibbons, a federal prison escapee, Lurch, who has a nagging wife and Reggie, an airport security guard. They interview for the four remaining spots: they choose Kip, sexy with a stutter; Endo, has three testicles; Bronstein, can dislocate and relocate his shoulder; and Otis, can say sentences backwards.\n\nDoug tells Gretchen that \"Bic\" is a military priest based in El Salvador, and she insists that he also come to the family brunch. There, Doug gets nervous, almost blowing his cover until Jimmy accidentally sets Gretchen's grandmother on fire. In the emergency room, Jimmy lies to Gretchen's father Ed, that they used to play football. So he challenges them to a match with some of his old college teammates.\n\nDoug meets his groomsmen, all with fake identities based on the last names of famous [[Los Angeles]] sports figures&mdash;[[Jim Plunkett|Plunkett]], [[Kurt Rambis|Rambis]], [[Steve Garvey|Garvey]], [[Lyle Alzado|Alzado]], [[Don Drysdale|Drysdale]], [[Rod Carew|Carew]], and [[Eric Dickerson|Dickerson]]. Jimmy takes Doug and the groomsmen on fake photo shoots of skydiving, scuba-diving, etc..\n\nWhen Doug begins to have doubts, they visit Edmundo, who tells him the key is to please Gretchen and her mother Lois and nothing else. To prove how good he is at being a best man, Jimmy takes Doug to a wedding where the best man makes a terrible speech. After, they have drinks and show off their dance moves. Jimmy tells him how he gave an excellent best man speech for an acquaintance which led to his career as a wedding ringer. Doug explains that he moved a lot as a child, so he never got to make friends. When his parents died, Doug took over the business, and work consumed him, leaving him without friends and therefore a best man. Jimmy drives Doug home, and reiterates that they are in a business relationship, and Doug, although hurt, agrees.\n\nAt Doug's outrageous bachelor party he is introduced to Nadia, who tries to seduce him, but Doug instead befriends her. A prank involving peanut butter, a dog and a blindfolded Doug's goes awry, requiring the groomsmen and Nadia to rush him to a hospital. When he wakes up the next day, Nadia kisses him goodbye, she hints she would like to know him better. Later, the groomsmen play football with Ed and his college football friends, including [[Joe Namath]], [[John Riggins]], and [[Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones]]. A mud bowl ensues, Ed blows out his knee on the last play and the wedding party team wins.\n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Gretchen's bridesmaids sing a song, while Doug's groomsmen create a slideshow of the fake pictures they took, winning Gretchen over. That night, she notices the Bic razors and Mitchum deodorant in the cabinet, and recognizes the last names of the groomsmen and deduces the scheme. Asking Doug about it, he brushes it off, saying she is paranoid, to which she reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn the wedding day, the family priest cancels, so Doug suggests that Jimmy officiate. At the reception, Jimmy congratulates Gretchen, who exclaims that the wedding is a disaster as her zipper  is torn, her grandmother has third degree burns, her dad's knee is blown out, the food is bad, and she doesn't love Doug (saying she only married him because he is nice and can easily afford her lavish lifestyle). Doug overhears, telling Jimmy that he can't go through with it, but Jimmy dismisses this.\n\nAs Jimmy gives his best man speech, Doug stops him, revealing they aren't really married as \"Bic\" is not a real priest, nor are his groomsmen who they claim to be. Gretchen is livid that her wedding is ruined. Ed's college friends make peace with Doug and Jimmy and tell them they were good players. Jimmy gets a date with Gretchen's sister, Allison. As they leave, Doug pays Jimmy his $50,000 fee and they accept each other's friendship. Jimmy then has the idea to cash in Doug's first class honeymoon tickets to [[Tahiti]], going instead on a guys trip, along with Nadia (who is now with Doug).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Kevin Hart]] as Jimmy Callahan/Bic Mitchum\n*[[Josh Gad]] as Doug Harris\n*[[Kaley Cuoco]] as Gretchen Palmer\n*[[Alan Ritchson]] as Kip Loyola/Carew\n*[[Cloris Leachman]] as Grandma\n*[[Mimi Rogers]] as Lois Palmer\n*[[Ken Howard]] as Ed Palmer\n*[[Affion Crockett]] as Reggie/Drysdale\n*[[Jenifer Lewis]] as Doris Jenkins\n*[[Olivia Thirlby]] as Allison Palmer<ref>{{cite web|title=Olivia Thirlby Joins Kevin Hart and Josh Gad's The Wedding Ringer| date=12 September 2013 |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108825|publisher=ComingSoon.net|access-date=10 January 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Justine Ezarik]] as Pam Reinsdorf\n*[[Jorge Garcia]] as Lurch/Garvey\n*[[Josh Peck]] as Bad Best Man\n*Eugenio Cobo as Roberto\n*[[Aaron Hernan]] as Francisco \n*[[Joe Namath]] as Himself\n*[[John Riggins]] as Himself\n*[[Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones]] as Himself\n*[[Francisco Gattorno]] as David\n*[[Michelle Vieth]] as Martha\n*[[Fernando Colunga]] as Jose\n*[[Aaron Takahashi]] as Harvey Endo/Rambis\n*Dan Gill as Gil Bronstein/Dickerson\n*[[Corey Holcomb]] as Otis/Alzado\n*[[GloZell|Glozell Green]] as Attractive Traveler\n*[[Tristin Mays]] as Cute Bridesmaid \n*[[Colin Kane]] as Fitzgibbons/Plunkett\n*[[Ignacio Serricchio]] as Edmundo Regal\n*[[Nicky Whelan|Nicole Whelan]] as Nadia\n*[[Whitney Cummings]] as Holly Munk\n*[[Jeff Ross]] as a Wedding Singer \n*[[Nikki Leigh]] as The 15 Year Old\n*[[Lisa Donovan]] as The Flight Attendant \n*[[Lindsay Pearce]] as Alexandra Plylow\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\nThe film evolved from a spec script titled \"The Golden Tux\" that was purchased by [[Dimension Films]] as early as 2002, at that time Todd Phillips, director of ''[[The Hangover]]'' was attached as a producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-89019309.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921194536/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-89019309.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-09-21|title=Dimension fitted for 'Tux' script.(The Golden Tux)(Brief Article)}}</ref> The film went through many revisions as many actors came and left the project.<ref name=\"empireonline.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=19756|title=Wearing In The Golden Tux - Movie News - Empire|work=empireonline.com|access-date=18 January 2015}}</ref> By 2013, Screen Gems and Miramax had agreed to produce the film, which by then had both Kevin Hart and Josh Gad attached <ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/06/screen-gems-miramax-at-altar-on-buddy-comedy-kevin-hart-josh-gad-star-and-jeremy-garelick-directs-517485/|title=Screen Gems, Miramax At Altar On Buddy Comedy; Kevin Hart, Josh Gad Star And Jeremy Garelick Directs|author=Mike Fleming Jr|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=10 June 2013 |access-date=18 January 2015}}</ref> and the name had officially changed to ''The Wedding Ringer'' and production had begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/09/screen-gemsmiramaxs-kevin-hart-pic-now-titled-the-wedding-ringer-rounds-out-cast-585208/|title=Screen Gems/Miramax's Kevin Hart Pic Now Titled 'The Wedding Ringer', Rounds Out Cast - Deadline|author=The Deadline Team|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=12 September 2013 |access-date=18 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film was officially given a date of February 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/release-dates-set-for-addicted-2014-and-wedding-ringer-2015|title=Release Dates Set For 'Addicted' (2014) And 'Wedding Ring - Shadow and Act|author=Tambay A.
