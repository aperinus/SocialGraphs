It is based on [[William Gibson]]'s [[short story|story]] of [[New Rose Hotel|the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nFox (Walken) and X (Dafoe) are Tokyo based corporate extraction specialists, half headhunters, half kidnappers, who specialize in helping R&D scientists relocate from corporations who would rather see them dead than working for their competitors. Fox is obsessed with one Hiroshi ([[Yoshitaka Amano]] ) a paradigm-shattering super-genius who is currently working for Maas, the corporation who crippled him. To that end, Fox and X employ Sandii (Argento), a \"[[Shinjuku]]-girl\", or small-time hustler/call girl, to help \"persuade\" Hiroshi to defect to Hosaka, another corporation to which Fox is somewhat warmer. Fox is responsible for brokering the deal with Hosaka, Sandii for getting Hiroshi to fall in love with her and defect to a Hosaka lab in [[Marrakech]], and X is responsible for teaching Sandii how to make Hiroshi melt. Sandii disappears, Fox commits suicide, and X retreats to the safest place he knows, the New Rose Hotel, a derelict capsule hotel.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Christopher Walken]] as Fox\n*[[Willem Dafoe]] as X\n*[[Asia Argento]] as Sandii\n*[[Annabella Sciorra]] as Madame Rosa\n*[[John Lurie]] as Distinguished Man\n*Kimmy Suzuki as Asian Girl #1\n*Miou as Asian Girl #2\n*[[Yoshitaka Amano]] as Hiroshi\n*[[Gretchen Mol]] as Hiroshi's Wife\n*[[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] as Hosaka Executive\n\n==Production==\n[[Edward R.
