The film was released on December 8, 2000, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]], receiving mixed reviews and grossed $215 million at the box office.\n\nThe film was the third collaboration between Campbell and actor [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]], after ''[[No Escape (1994 film)|No Escape]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' (1998).\n\n==Plot==\nWhile climbing in [[Monument Valley]], siblings Peter and Annie Garrett lose their father, Royce. After two falling climbers leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose in order to save Peter and Annie. Three years later, Peter has retired from climbing, but Annie has become a renowned climber. Their relationship is strained, as Annie still blames Peter for Royce's death. Peter reunites with Annie at the [[K2]] base camp, where Annie is planning a summit attempt on K2. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn. Their team includes Annie, Vaughn, renowned climber Tom McLaren, mountaineer Ali Nazir, and one other.\n\nThe night before the climb, Vaughn throws a party. The gala is interrupted by reclusive Montgomery Wick, reportedly the foremost K2 expert, who verbally challenges Vaughn. It's later revealed that Wick's wife, an expedition guide, died during Vaughn's previous expedition. Vaughn claims they were hit by a storm and Wick's wife died of [[High altitude pulmonary edema|pulmonary edema]] because her supply of [[dexamethasone]] was swept away in the storm. Wick has never believed that story and has spent years trying to find his wife's body. Back in the present day, Vaughn forces McLaren to continue despite a radio warning from base camp of an approaching storm. An [[avalanche]] occurs, and Annie, Vaughn, and McLaren become trapped in a [[crevasse]], while the other two are killed. Radio contact is lost, but Peter hears Annie using static and [[Morse code]] to signal that they are alive. Peter assembles a rescue team, which includes Wick. Pairs are assigned, and after a treacherous helicopter drop-off, each pair takes a different path to increase chances of success. Each pair carries a canister of explosive[[nitroglycerine]] donated by the [[Pakistani army]] to clear the entrance to the crevasse.\n\nMonique and Cyril experience a harrowing incident after Cyril loses his balance at the edge of a cliff. While Monique attempts to rescue him their nitro canister falls over the cliff and explodes, causing another avalanche. Monique survives but Cyril does not. At the military station the nitroglycerine canisters are exposed to sunlight and explode. Base camp tells the team to get their cases of nitro into the shade. Kareem and Malcolm do so, but their canister leaks fluid into the sunlight, causing another explosion that kills them. Underground, McLaren is severely injured and has lost his dexamethasone. Annie shares her dex with him, but Vaughn refuses it. Annie risks her life to reach Ali's backpack and manages to obtain more dex, but Vaughn says that since McLaren is unlikely to survive, he and Annie should keep the dex for themselves.\n\nThe explosions have shaken loose some ice, and Wick finally discovers his wife's body. The empty dex container nearby suggests that Vaughn lied and stole her dex, ensuring his own survival while leaving Wick's wife to die. Monique, Peter and Wick camp for the night. Peter is wary of Wick, who seems more intent on taking revenge than in rescuing the survivors. In the crevasse, Annie falls asleep, and Vaughn kills McLaren with a syringe [[air embolism|full of air]] to avoid having to give McLaren more dex. Wick awakens to find that Peter and Monique have left without him. Annie and Vaughn manage to mark the crevasse entrance by detonating a flare inside a bag of McLaren's blood which explodes over the snow. Peter and Monique see the marker and use nitro to blast a hole, enabling access to the survivors. They drop a rope, and Vaughn harnesses Annie.\n\nWick descends into the cave, and although Vaughn thinks Wick will attack him, Wick attaches a clip to Vaughn. Monique and Peter attempt to pull Annie out of the crevasse, but an ice boulder falls, knocking Wick and Vaughn from the ledge in the crevice, and pulling Annie and Peter down, creating a scenario similar to the opening scene: Monique alone remains on the ledge holding the rope from which the other four are dangling. To save Annie and Peter and, to fulfill his desire for revenge against Vaughn, Wick cuts the rope and he and Vaughn fall to their deaths.\n\nRecovering at base camp, Annie reconciles with Peter, who then pays his respects at a makeshift memorial for climbers who have died.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Peter Garrett\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Elliot Vaughn\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Annie Garrett\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Montgomery Wick\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Monique Aubertine\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Major Rasul\n* [[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]] as Skip Taylor\n* [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]] as Royce Garrett\n* [[Nicholas Lea]] as Tom McLaren\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Kareem Nazir\n* [[David Hayman]] as Frank \"Chainsaw\" Williams\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Malcolm Bench\n* [[Steve Le Marquand]] as Cyril Bench\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as Colonel Amir Salim\n* [[Ed Viesturs]] has a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film, playing Himself as a mountain trainer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Viesturs|first=Ed|author2=David Roberts |title=No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks|publisher=Random House, Inc.|year=2007|pages=225|isbn=9780767924719 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdBj-S9OXQIC&q=%22Ed+Viesturs%22+cameo&pg=PA225}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Vertical Limit'' was filmed on location in Pakistan (location of [[K2]]), [[Queenstown, New Zealand]] and the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\n[[Bell 212]] helicopters contracted from Hevilift Australia were painted in a khaki green colour to represent the Pakistani Air Force.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Vertical Limit'' grossed $69.2 million domestically and $215.7 million worldwide, becoming the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2000.
