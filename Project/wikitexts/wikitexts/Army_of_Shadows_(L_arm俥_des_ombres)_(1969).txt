The French-Italian co-production is a [[film adaptation]] of [[Joseph Kessel]]'s 1943 book of the same name, which mixes Kessel's experiences as a member of the [[French Resistance]] with fictional versions of other Resistance members.\n\n''Army of Shadows'' follows a small group of Resistance fighters as they move between safe houses, work with the Allied militaries, kill informers and attempt to evade the capture and execution that they know is their most likely fate.<ref name=\"ebert\" /> While portraying its characters as heroic, the film presents a bleak, unromantic view of the Resistance.<ref name=\"av\" /><ref name=\"criterion\" />\n\nAt the time of its initial release in [[France]], ''Army of Shadows'' was not well received nor widely seen. In the wake of the [[May 1968 in France|events of May 1968]], French critics denounced the film for its perceived glorification of [[Charles de Gaulle]]; at the time, American art-film programmers took their cues from ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', which had attacked the film on this basis.<ref name=\"criterion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/483|title=Army of Shadows: Out of the Shadows|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Because of this, the film was not released in the United States for almost forty years.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060521/REVIEWS08/605210301 |title=rogerebert.com: Great Movies: Army of Shadows |access-date=2008-05-05 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=2006-05-21}}</ref><ref name=\"criterion\" /> In the mid-1990s ''Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma'' published a reappraisal of the film and Melville's oeuvre, leading to its restoration and re-release in 2006.<ref name=\"criterion\" /> The film was greeted with critical adulation in the U.S., appearing in many critics' year-end top ten lists.<ref name=\"av\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/army-of-shadows,34392/|title=Army Of Shadows|first=Scott|last=Tobias}}</ref><ref name=\"criterion\" />\n\n==Plot==\nPhilippe Gerbier, the head of a [[French Resistance]] network, is arrested by [[Vichy French]] police on suspicion of Resistance activity. Acquitted for lack of evidence, he is still interned in a camp. He and a young communist begin to work on an escape plan, but before it can come to fruition, he is transported to Paris for questioning by the [[Gestapo]]. He manages to kill a guard and make his escape.\n\nGerbier manages the Resistance network in [[Marseille]]. He and three of his men, F\u00e9lix Lepercq; Guillaume Vermersch, a burly veteran known as ''Bison''; and Claude Ullmann, a young recruit known as ''Le Masque''; need to execute one of their own members, a young agent, Paul Dounat, for having betrayed Gerbier. They find the house next door to the one that they are using occupied and so they cannot use their guns. Lacking a decent knife, they strangle him.\n\nLepercq recruits an old friend in a bar, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jardie, a handsome, risk-loving former pilot. On his first mission to Paris, Jardie meets Mathilde, a housewife who is one of the linchpins of Gerbier's network, and he visits his older brother, Luc Jardie, a renowned philosopher who lives a seemingly detached, scholarly life in his Paris mansion. Some time later, Gerbier travels to the [[Free French]] headquarters in [[London]] in a British [[submarine]]. On the submarine, Gerbier meets Luc Jardie, who proves to be the head of all Resistance networks; his identity is a closely guarded secret. In London, Gerbier organises additional logistical support for the resistance and Luc Jardie is decorated by [[Charles de Gaulle]]. While they are there, Lepercq is arrested by the Gestapo. When Gerbier learns of the event, he cuts his trip short and parachutes into France's countryside.\n\nMathilde, in command after Lepercq's arrest, devises an audacious plan to rescue Lepercq, who is being tortured in a maximum-security [[Gestapo]] prison in [[Lyon]]. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jardie, after hearing the details of the plan, writes Gerbier a letter of resignation and incriminates himself with an anonymous letter to the Gestapo so that he will be arrested and jailed with Lepercq. They share a cell, Jardie badly beaten and Lepercq now barely alive after being tortured repeatedly. Shortly afterwards, disguised as Germans, Mathilde, ''Le Masque'', and ''Bison'' use forged papers that order Lepercq's transfer to a different detention facility as a ruse to rescue him. Their plan fails when the prison doctor pronounces Lepercq unfit for transport. When Jean-Fran\u00e7ois sees that the rescue has failed, he gives Lepercq his one [[cyanide]] pill.\n\nHaving seen during the rescue attempt that the Gestapo has displayed his photo as a wanted man, Mathilde urges Gerbier to escape to London, but he refuses and says that no one can take his place in the growing Resistance. Moments afterward, Gerbier is swept up in a raid by Vichy police and handed over to the Germans. He and his cellmates are due for execution, but subjected to an SS officer's sadistic game. They will live a little longer if they can run to the far wall of the room before they are killed by the machine gunners. As the shooting starts, Mathilde's team tosses [[smoke bombs]] to block the Germans' view and thus throws a line to Gerbier, who narrowly escapes.\n\nGerbier spends a month alone in an abandoned farmhouse deep in the countryside. Jardie arrives to seek his advice following the arrest of Mathilde. They fear that she has been forced to reveal the identities of her confederates because the Nazis have threatened her teenage daughter. Jardie hides when ''Le Masque'' and ''Bison'' arrive. Gerbier orders Mathilde's immediate execution, but ''Bison'' refuses to carry out the order and swears to prevent Gerbier from killing her. Jardie emerges and convinces ''Bison'' that Mathilde is incapable of suicide but expects them to kill her. Later, Jardie reveals to Gerbier that the argument he presented to ''Bison'' is purely speculative. Jardie and his team pull to a stop on a Paris street, where they have located Mathilde. ''Bison'' shoots her twice. The final text screens reveal the eventual fates of the four men, all of whom died either through suicide or at the hands of the Nazis.  Gerbier's precise fate is not revealed, only that on 13 February 1944, he \"decided not to run this time\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Lino Ventura]] as Philippe Gerbier\n* [[Paul Meurisse]] as Luc Jardie.

As a result of the poor reviews, the film was not distributed widely outside France, but it was very well received in the late 1970s, on its British release. American audiences were unable to discover the movie until 2006, but when it was reissued; the film then appeared in many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2006/toptens.shtml |title=Metacritic: 2006 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |access-date=2008-01-08 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004758/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2006/toptens.shtml |archive-date=2007-12-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* 1st \u2013 David Ansen, ''[[Newsweek]]''\n* 1st \u2013 Ella Taylor, ''[[LA Weekly]]''\n* 1st \u2013 Glenn Kenny, ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''\n* 1st \u2013 Manohla Dargis, ''[[The New York Times]]''\n* 1st \u2013 Scott Foundas, ''[[LA Weekly]]''\n* 1st \u2013 Stephanie Zacharek, ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''\n* 2nd \u2013 Jonathan Rosenbaum, ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' (tied with ''Statues Also Die'')\n* 2nd \u2013 Michael Sragow, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''\n* 2nd \u2013 Nathan Lee, ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n* 2nd \u2013 Wesley Morris, ''[[The Boston Globe]]''\n{{Col-2}}\n* 3rd \u2013 Stephen Hunter, ''[[The Washington Post]]''\n* 4th \u2013 Shawn Levy, ''[[The Oregonian]]''\n* 4th \u2013 Sheri Linden, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''\n* 5th \u2013 Marjorie Baumgarten, ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''\n* 7th \u2013 Richard James Havis, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''\n* 7th \u2013 Richard Schickel, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]\n* 8th \u2013 Michael Wilmington, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n'''General top ten'''\n* Steven Rea, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''\n* V.A.
