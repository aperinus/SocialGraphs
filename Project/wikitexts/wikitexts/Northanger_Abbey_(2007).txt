It was directed by British television director [[Jon Jones (director)|Jon Jones]] and the screenplay was written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]]. [[Felicity Jones]] stars as the protagonist [[Catherine Morland]] and [[JJ Feild]] plays her love interest [[Henry Tilney]]. The story unfolds as the teenaged Catherine is invited to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to accompany some family friends. There she finds herself the object of Henry Tilney's and John Thorpe's ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]) affections. When she is asked to stay at Northanger Abbey, Catherine's youthful and naive imagination takes hold and she begins to confuse real life with the Gothic romance of her favourite novels.\n\n''Northanger Abbey'' was one of three novels adapted for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[The Jane Austen Season|Jane Austen season]]. It was shot on location in Ireland from late August 2006 on a budget of \u00a32 million. The drama was co-produced by [[Granada Productions]] and American studio [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]]. ''Northanger Abbey'' premiered on 25 March 2007 in the United Kingdom and on 16 December 2007 in Canada. It was broadcast in the United States and Australia in 2008. The drama was viewed by 5.6 million people in the UK, making it the second most watched of the 2007 adaptations. ''Northanger Abbey'' garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics, with many praising the cast's performances.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old Catherine Morland ([[Felicity Jones]]), daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Morland (Gerry O'Brien and Julia Dearden), is a tomboy with a wild imagination and a passion for Gothic novels. Family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen ([[Desmond Barrit]] and [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]]), invite Catherine to spend the season in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and she readily accepts. At her first ball, Catherine meets and dances with Henry Tilney ([[JJ Feild]]). The following day, Catherine makes the acquaintance of the Thorpe family. She becomes good friends with Isabella Thorpe ([[Carey Mulligan]]) and she meets Isabella's brother, John ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]), when she is reunited with her own brother, James ([[Hugh O'Conor]]).\n\nJohn flirts with Catherine at a ball, but she is more interested in meeting with Henry and his sister, Eleanor ([[Catherine Walker (actor)|Catherine Walker]]). Catherine is pressured by Isabella and John into riding to [[Blaise Castle]], despite her having made plans for a walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]] to [[River Boyd|Wick Rocks]], but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney ([[Liam Cunningham]]), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her to spend the day with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.\n\nOn her return home, Isabella tells Catherine that she and James are engaged. James and John announce that they are to leave Bath for a few weeks and after talking about marriage with Catherine, John leaves believing she is in love with him. Isabella catches the eye of Henry's older brother, Captain Frederick Tilney ([[Mark Dymond]]), and flirts with him after she learns how low James' income will be. General Tilney invites Catherine to stay with his family at Northanger Abbey and she accepts. When Isabella tells Catherine that John is going to propose to her, Catherine tells her friend to write to him and explains that he is mistaken. Isabella continues to flirt with Frederick and Catherine asks Henry to convince his brother to leave her alone. However, he tells Catherine that Frederick will be leaving town soon to re-join his regiment.\n\nCatherine states that Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she imagined it and she becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps it is possible to read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.\n\nGeneral Tilney returns home from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and believes that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception and adaptation ===\n{{Quote box|quote=\"People think Austen is a lot more romantic and straightforward than she actually is. She is quite practical about love and relationships \u2013 she's very measured about who people should marry. What's quite interesting with Henry Tilney is that he doesn't necessarily fall madly in love with Catherine straight away. It's a very gradual development, and it's her enthusiasm for him that prompts him to return her affections. It's very subtle how she draws her characters, which is what I like.\"<ref name=\"BWilson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/austen/01/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070501022929/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/austen/01/ |url-status=dead|archive-date= 1 May 2007 |title=Exclusive: the stars of ITV's Jane Austen season talk to RT |last=Wilson |first=Benji |date=March 2007 |work=[[Radio Times]] |publisher=[[BBC Magazines]] |access-date=14 July 2012 }}</ref>|source=\u2014Felicity Jones commenting on Austen's writing.|width=26em|align=right}}\nOn 10 November 2005, Julia Day from ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported ITV controller of drama, Nick Elliott, had ordered three new adaptations of ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]''.<ref name=\"Day\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/nov/10/broadcasting.ITV?INTCMP=SRCH|title=ITV falls in love with Jane Austen|last=Day|first=Julia|date=10 November 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> Elliot commented that the adaptations would be \"important remakes for the new generation\".<ref name=\"Glendinning\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-generation-of-teenagers-prepare-to-be-seduced-with-rebirth-of-austen-436556.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220621/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/new-generation-of-teenagers-prepare-to-be-seduced-with-rebirth-of-austen-436556.html |archive-date=21 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=New generation of teenagers prepare to be seduced with rebirth of Austen|last=Glendinning|first=Lee|date=16 February 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> He explained, \"About every 10 years, all the great stories need retelling.
