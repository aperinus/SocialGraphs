Sherkow and Stuart Oken, and starring [[Hugh Grant]] as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Judy Davis]] as [[George Sand]]. It was shot entirely on location in [[France]] as a British production by an American company. Its main filming location was at the Chateau des Briotti\u00e8res outside of [[Angers]], in the [[Loire Valley]].<ref>[http://www.frenchentree.com/france-pays-de-la-loire-chateau-bed-and-breakfast/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=38027 Chateau des Briottieres] frenchentree.com, accessed 25 December 2011</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSince getting divorced, Baroness Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin (previously Baroness Dudevant, the successful and notorious writer of sensational romance novels), now lives under the pseudonym [[George Sand]], in Paris, and has been in the habit of dressing like a man. In her romantic pursuit of the sensitive [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], whose music she fell in love with before meeting him, George/Aurora is advised that she must act like a man pursuing a woman, though also advised to avoid damaging Chopin's health by pursuing him. With this advice she is deterred by a fellow countrywoman  (the mistress of [[Franz Liszt]]) the Countess [[Marie d'Agoult]], acting like she is smitten with Chopin to prevent a relationship between Chopin and Sand.\n\nSand meets Chopin in 1836<ref>Kallberg, Jeffrey. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/742461 \"Nocturnal Thoughts on Impromptu\"], ''[[The Musical Quarterly Vol. 81, No. 2, Summer, 1997]]'', Oxford, Summer 1997. Retrieved from JSTOR on 20 October 2018.</ref> in the French countryside house of the Duchess d'Antan, a foolish aspiring [[socialite]] who invites artists from Paris to her salon to feel cosmopolitan. Sand invites herself, hoping to meet Chopin, not knowing that a few of her former lovers are also in attendance. A small play is written by [[Alfred de Musset]] is presented, satirizing the aristocracy and specifically mocking their hostess. When Chopin protests at this lack of manners, de Musset bellows and a fireplace explosion ensues.\n\nChopin is briefly swayed by a beautifully written love letter ostensibly from d'Agoult, actually written by, and stolen from, Sand. Eventually Sand wins over Chopin when she proves that she wrote the letter, reciting it to him passionately. And after buying a copy of her memoir, he finds the text of the letter in the book.\n\nChopin is then challenged to a duel by one of Sand's ex-lovers. He faints during the face-off. Sand finishes the duel for him and nurses him back to health in the countryside, solidifying their relationship.\n\nNear the end of the movie, Sand and Chopin dedicate a volume of music to the countess, although this only suggests that she has had an affair with Chopin, causing a falling-out with her lover Liszt. Sand and Chopin depart for [[Majorca]], relieved to escape the competitive nature of artistic alliances and jealousies in Paris.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judy Davis]] as [[George Sand]] (Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin)\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as [[Alfred de Musset]]\n* [[Bernadette Peters]] as [[Marie D'Agoult|Marie Catherine Sophie, Comtesse d'Agoult]]\n* [[Julian Sands]] as [[Franz Liszt]]\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]\n* [[Georges Corraface]] as [[Felicien Mallefille]]\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] as Duke d'Antan\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Duchess d'Antan\n* [[Anna Massey]] as Sophie-Victorie Delaborde, George Sand's Mother\n\nThe film's supporting performances include [[David Birkin]] as Maurice, [[John Savident]] as Buloz, [[Lucy Speed]] as Young Aurora, and [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] as Baroness Laginsky.\n\n==Production==\n[[Sarah Kernochan]], director [[James Lapine]]'s wife, had written the film in 1988 during a lay-off due to [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]]. Kernochan explained the film: \"How do complicated people find a simple way of loving?\" The producer Stuart Oken liked the project; his concern was to give Lapine \"a chance to realize his vision and become a movie director.\" Oken brought the project to his friend and fellow producer, Dan Sherkow, who secured financing and distribution for the picture.<ref name=corbett>Corbett, Patricia.[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/07/movies/film-in-impromptu-it-s-george-sand-and-chopin-again-the-1830-s.html \"In 'Impromptu,' It's George Sand And Chopin Again\" (abstract)]''New York Times'', 7 January 1990, pH13</ref>\n\nFor the cast, Lapine wanted \"to use people he had worked with before.\" He cast actors who \"didn't look like, but embodied the characters.\" Judy Davis and Mandy Patinkin could \"hardly look more unlike the cultural icons they portray.\" Lapine hired a piano coach and a music consultant to advise Grant and Sands on piano techniques.<ref name=corbett/>\n\nDue to [[European Economic Community|Common Market]] legalities, the film was incorporated as a British production with co-production by the French company [[Ariane Films]] and distribution by the United States company Sovereign Pictures.

Speaking of director [[James Lapine]]'s approach, Maslin said, \"Handling this material playfully, he tosses together the film's artistic luminaries and allows them to indulge in outrageous antics, like the scene that finds Sand pleading for Chopin's affections and telling him she needs only a minute of his time to explain her feelings.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Terrence Rafferty]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that the film was \"an ebullient and absurdly entertaining account of the famous love affair of George Sand and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. ...The historical figures in this movie are cartoons, but they\u2019re cartoons with recognizable human qualities, and the actors look as if they were having a wonderful time charging around in their period costumes. Hugh Grant\u2019s Chopin is a brilliant caricature of the Romantic ideal of the artist; he gives the character an air of befuddled unworldliness, and punctuates his readings with delicately timed tubercular coughs. Judy Davis plays Sand\u2014a great actress in a great role.\"<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Rafferty | first = Terrence | url = http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/impromptu_lapine#ixzz1hUASNo6H | title = The Film File ''Impromptu'' | magazine = New Yorker | access-date = 24 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+List of awards and nominations\n!
