The [[screenplay]] was written by [[Zden\u011bk Sv\u011br\u00e1k]], the director's father. The film stars Czech actors [[Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd]], [[Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek]] and [[Old\u0159ich Kaiser]]. British actors include [[Tara Fitzgerald]], [[Charles Dance]] and [[Anna Massey]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, during the [[Cold War]], Franti\u0161ek (Franta) Sl\u00e1ma (Ond\u0159ej Vetch\u00fd) is incarcerated in [[Czechoslovakia]], because of his prior service in the RAF. His recollections of the war begin in 1939, just days prior to the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. After the invasion, the [[Czechoslovak Army]] is disbanded and [[Czechoslovak Air Force|its Air Force]] has to surrender its aircraft. However, Franta and his young friend Karel Vojt\u00ed\u0161ek (Kry\u0161tof H\u00e1dek), among others, refuse to submit to their occupiers and flee to the United Kingdom to join the RAF.\n\nThe British make the Czechoslovaks retrain from the basics, which infuriates them, especially Karel, who is both impatient to fight the Germans and humiliated at being retaught what he already knows. Karel also sees the compulsory English language lessons as a pointless waste of his time. The RAF is in such a dire need of pilots during the [[Battle of Britain]] that eventually the Czechoslovak airmen are allowed to fly. After their first [[sortie]] they realise why the British have trained them so intensely: a young Czechoslovak nicknamed \"Tom Tom\" is shot down by a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and killed. Franta becomes the unit commander, with the younger Karel under his charge.\n\nWhile shooting down a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber, Karel's [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] fighter aircraft is shot down. However, he manages to survive and find his way to a farm. There he meets and falls in love with Susan (Tara Fitzgerald), although she thinks he is far too young. The next day, after returning to the [[aerodrome]], Karel brings Franta to meet Susan. The latter begins to get attracted to Susan, although Karel believes that Susan is interested in him.\n\nFollowing a mission to France where the [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] attacks a train, Karel is shot down, but Franta lands and rescues him, a move that shows that their friendship endures. Soon after, however, Karel learns a sort of [[love triangle]] has developed, with Susan being involved with Franta, which leads to a quarrel between the two friends. Later in the war, while escorting American bombers, Franta's Spitfire malfunctions and he is forced to ditch into the ocean. His [[life raft]] bursts as he tries to inflate it, so Karel tries to drop his own raft, but he flies too low and fatally crashes. The raft emerges from the water, allowing Franta to survive.\n\nAfterward, when the war is over, Franta drives to Susan's home, only to find her with her injured husband recently returned from fighting overseas. Knowing he has no future with Susan and wanting to preserve her honour, he pretends to have lost his way and asks directions to the next town. Franta returns to Czechoslovakia and finds his old girlfriend has married the neighbourhood [[jobsworth]], has given birth to a child, and has taken over Bar\u010da, his dog. All the disappointed Franta can do is endure the situation as stoically as he can. In prison, he only has his memories of his friendship with Karel to sustain him.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

Retrieved: 28 August 2014.</ref>\n\nDogfight footage from the 1969 film ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' was seamlessly integrated with contemporary film footage using computer imagery and mastering to create the aerial sequences due to the prohibitively expensive cost ($10,000 per hour) of renting a real Spitfire. The scene of a train being attacked was the most expensive scene in [[Czech cinema]] history, costing more than the entire film ''Kolya''. Brief scenes from the 1990 film ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' were also incorporated. Director Jan Sv\u011br\u00e1k played a number of roles, including practically all the crew members of an Allied [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bomber in the scene where a damaged bomber is escorted.\n\n==Reception==\n''Dark Blue World'' opened in both the U.S. and Europe at major international film festivals in London and Toronto, to generally positive reviews, making it one of the most popular aviation war films made. \n[[Rex Reed]] described the film in ''The New York Observer'' as an \"epic that blends action, romance and tragedy. Brilliantly directed and sublimely acted.\"<ref>''Dark Blue World DVD''. Los Angeles: Columbia Tristar Video, 2002.</ref> Animator [[Hayao Miyazaki]] said that this is his favourite film, as it shows the speed and fragility of aircraft and the historic tragedy of the Czech pilots after the war.<ref>Miyazaki, Hayao. \u6298\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u70b91997\uff5e2008 [''Orikaeshi Ten 1997\u20132008'' Japanese]. Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 2008. {{ISBN|4-00-022394-1}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, other reviewers were not as enthused. [[Leonard Maltin]] commented that the love triangle provided a \"more novel and interesting\" aspect but the \"surprisingly elaborate\" flying scenes helped make the film less of a \"capable but uninspired yarn\", not very different from other World War II features.{{sfn|Maltin|2009|p=315}} [[Peter Bradshaw]]'s review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' echoed a similar view, \"A by-the-numbers WW2 romantic tale of two Czech pilots in love with the same British woman, which plays like a mixture of ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and \"[[Two Little Boys]]\" by [[Rolf Harris]].\"<ref>Bradshaw, Peter.
