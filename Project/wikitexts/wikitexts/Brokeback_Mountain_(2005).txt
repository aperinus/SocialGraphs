Adapted from the [[Brokeback Mountain (short story)|1997 short story of the same name]] by [[E. Annie Proulx|Annie Proulx]], the screenplay was written by Ossana and [[Larry McMurtry]]. The film stars [[Heath Ledger]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Anne Hathaway]], and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] and depicts the complex romantic relationship between two American [[cowboy]]s, [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]], in the [[Western United States|American West]] from 1963 to 1983.\n\nLee became attached to the project in 2001 after previous attempts to adapt Proulx's story into a film did not materialize. [[Focus Features]] and [[River Road Entertainment]] would jointly produce and distribute the film. After Ledger and Gyllenhaal's casting was announced in 2003, filming commenced in various locations in [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]] in 2004. ''Brokeback Mountain'' premiered at the [[62nd Venice International Film Festival|2005 Venice International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released to theaters on December 9 that year.\n\nThe film received universal acclaim, with particular praise for the performances of Ledger and Gyllenhaal, and was a commercial success, grossing over $178&nbsp;million worldwide against its $14&nbsp;million budget. At the [[78th Academy Awards]], ''Brokeback Mountain'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and won for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Original Score]]. It garnered seven nominations at the [[63rd Golden Globe Awards]], and won four awards. At the [[59th British Academy Film Awards]], ''Brokeback Mountain'' was nominated for nine awards, winning [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Gyllenhaal).\n\n''Brokeback Mountain'' was subject to controversies; its loss to ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004) for the Academy Award for Best Picture, subsequent censorship, and criticism from conservative media outlets received significant attention. The sexuality of the main characters has been subject to discussion. ''Brokeback Mountain'' has also been regarded as a turning point for the advancement of [[New Queer Cinema|queer cinema]] into the mainstream. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn Wyoming in 1963, cowboys [[Ennis Del Mar]] and [[Jack Twist]] are hired by foreman Joe Aguirre to herd his sheep through the summer on grazing pastures on Brokeback Mountain. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a pass at Ennis. While initially reluctant, Ennis becomes receptive, and he and Jack have sex in their tent. Despite Ennis telling Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Before parting ways, Ennis and Jack have a brawl that leaves both of them bloodied. Ennis later marries his longtime fianc\u00e9e Alma Beers and has two daughters with her\u2013Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who had observed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, refuses to hire him again. Jack moves to Texas, where he meets wealthy [[rodeo]] rider Lureen Newsome; they marry and have a son.\n\nAfter four years apart, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, the two passionately kiss, which a stunned Alma inadvertently witnesses. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life with Ennis on a ranch, but Ennis refuses, as he is unwilling to abandon his family and is haunted by a childhood memory of his father showing him the body of a man who was tortured and killed for suspected homosexuality. Ennis and Jack continue to infrequently meet for fishing trips while their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo and goes into business with her father, which causes Jack to work in sales. Alma and Ennis divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about the divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming and tells Ennis that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Upset, Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico.\n\nAlma takes custody of Alma Jr. and Jenny and marries Monroe, her store manager. She eventually confronts Ennis when he visits about the true nature of his relationship with Jack; the two spar, causing Ennis to cease contact with Alma. Ennis has a short-lived romantic relationship with a waitress named Cassie. Jack and Lureen befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall have a brief affair. At the end of a fishing trip, Ennis tells Jack that he cannot see him again before November due to work demands. The pair argue, blaming each other for their not being together. Ennis begins to cry, and Jack embraces him.\n\nSometime later, Ennis receives a returned postcard that he had sent to Jack, stamped with \"Deceased\". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident from drowning in his own blood after a car tire exploded in his face, though Ennis visualizes Jack's death as a violent murder. After Lureen tells him that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, Ennis visits Jack's parents in hopes of carrying out the request. Jack's father refuses and contends that Jack's ashes will be interred in a family plot. Ennis goes to Jack's bedroom, where he finds the shirts the two wore during their brawl, his shirt inside Jack's, in the closet. Ennis holds the shirts to his face, inhales deeply, and silently weeps. Jack's mother allows him to keep the shirts.\n\nLater, a 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis's trailer to tell him that she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding, and after some hesitation, he agrees to attend. Once Alma Jr. leaves, Ennis goes to the closet where the two shirts hang together, though now Ennis's shirt is outermost. Next to them, tacked to the closet door, is a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. With tears in his eyes, he stares at the mementos, and says, \"Jack, I swear...\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as [[Ennis Del Mar]], a Wyoming sheepherder who develops an emotional relationship with Jack, although Ennis is reluctant in displaying affection.\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Jack Twist]], a fellow sheepherder that meets Ennis at work, and attempts to persuade him to have a future together.\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Alma Beers Del Mar, Ennis' wife\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Lureen Newsome Twist, Jack's wife\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Joe Aguirre\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Cassie Cartwright\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Lashawn Malone\n* [[David Harbour]] as Randall Malone\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Mrs. Twist\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as John Twist\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Alma Del Mar Jr.\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Monroe\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as L.D.
