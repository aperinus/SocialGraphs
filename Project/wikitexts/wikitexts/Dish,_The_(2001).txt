It was the top-grossing [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film]] in 2000.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[radio telescope]] at [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]] ([[Parkes Observatory]]), New South Wales, was used by [[NASA]] throughout the [[Apollo program]] to receive signals in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], along with the NASA [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] near [[Canberra]].\n\nIn the days before the July 1969 space mission that marked humanity's first steps on the Moon, NASA was working with a group of Australian technicians who had agreed to engineer a space-to-Earth interface to carry the video and telemetry signals from the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Lander]] ''[[Lunar Module Eagle|Eagle]]'' on the Moon and relay them to the rest of the global audience, estimated then at some 600 million people. The dish antenna used had to be large, as the signals expected from the spacecraft were very weak and easily lost; NASA had to use the Parkes radio telescope, situated in the middle of an Australian sheep station. There were some background concerns at NASA about using the Parkes antenna, mainly technical, as the signals had to go via point-to-point microwave links to get re-transmitted globally.\n\nBased on a true story, ''The Dish'' takes a sometimes comical look at the differing cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while revisiting one of the greatest events in history. It depicts the activities in a control room of a radio telescope doing a job it was not originally expected to do. The film depicts some animosity between the Australian staff and the NASA representative, but they come together as a team when one of the locals fails to properly service a backup generator, putting their part in the mission at risk. They apply all their science skills to re-acquire the signal and cover their mistake, so that everything works out in the end. The directors of the film portray, quite accurately, what is in essence a complex technical task, such as re-pointing the dish when it loses the signal's \"lock\" and deciding to use it when the wind whips up threatening to damage and even destroy the structure. The film dramatises the team-work of a few technicians, who sometimes nearly lose their tempers with each other, painted against a backdrop of proud Australian townsfolk, with visiting dignitaries including the U.S. ambassador, hoping nothing will go wrong.\n\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Cliff Buxton\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Al Burnett\n* [[Tom Long (actor)|Tom Long]] as Glenn Latham\n* [[Kevin Harrington (actor)|Kevin Harrington]] as Ross \"Mitch\" Mitchell\n* [[Roy Billing]] as Bob McIntyre\n* [[Eliza Szonert]] as Janine Kellerman\n* [[Tayler Kane]] as Rudi Kellerman\n* Billy Mitchell as Cameron\n* [[Roz Hammond]] as Miss Nolan\n* Christopher-Robin Street as Damien\n* Luke Keltie as Graeme\n* Naomi Wright as Melanie\n* Ben Wright-Smith as Nicholas\n* [[Beverley Dunn]] as Secretary v/o\n* Grant Thompson as Mr. Callen\n* [[Bille Brown]] as the Prime Minister (unnamed, but [[John Gorton]] at the time).\n* [[Lenka|Lenka Kripac]] as Marie McIntyre\n* [[Neil Pigot]] as the newspaper reporter\n* [[Frank Bennett (singer)|Frank Bennett]] as Barry Steele\n\n==Production==\n[[File:parkes.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|The Parkes 64-metre [[radio telescope]] at the [[Parkes Observatory]] in New South Wales, Australia (the bigger of the two) ''Picture credit: [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]'']]\n[[File:ABC Apollo 11.ogv|thumb|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the role of the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes radio telescope]] and the [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]], broadcast a week before the Moon landing]]\n\nMuch of the film was shot on location; the \"cricket match\" and \"hayride\" scenes were shot on the real dish and researchers often postponed experiments to position the dish for photography.<ref name=\"dishOS\">{{cite web |url=http://thedishmovie.warnerbros.com/ |title=The Dish Official Site - Production notes (Flash) |work=Warner Bros. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128130827/http://thedishmovie.warnerbros.com/index_flashmain.html |archive-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> The set reconstructing the 1969 control room was extremely accurate, down to some details as small as ashtrays.
