The film stars [[George Clooney]], [[Shailene Woodley]], Amara Miller in her film debut, [[Beau Bridges]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Matthew Lillard]], and [[Robert Forster]], and was released by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] in the United States on November 18, 2011,<ref name=\"variety09072011\">{{cite news |url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118042405 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110915221329/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118042405 | archive-date = September 15, 2011 |date = September 7, 2011 | access-date=September 15, 2011| title='Descendants' gets earlier bow: Clooney starrer beats Thanksgiving glut with Nov. 18 rollout|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]| first=Rachel| last=Abrams}}</ref> after being screened at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=tiff>{{cite web |url=http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2011/descendants |title=Special Presentation: 'The Descendants': Alexander Payne |publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]] |access-date=September 15, 2011 |first=Cameron |last=Bailey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915224815/http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2011/descendants |archive-date=September 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTracing the journey of attorney and land baron Matt King, who struggles with unexpected occurrences in his monotonous life, ''The Descendants'' was a critical and financial success, grossing $177 million against a $20 million budget and receiving acclaim for the performances of Clooney and Woodley, Payne's direction and writing, and [[Kevin Tent]]'s editing. The film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Payne, and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Clooney, winning one for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film also won two [[Golden Globe Awards]]; [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] for Clooney.\n\n==Plot==\nMatthew \"Matt\" King is a [[Honolulu]]-based attorney and the sole trustee of a family [[trust law|trust]] of {{convert|25,000|acre|km2}} of pristine land on [[Kauai]]. The land has great monetary value, but is also a family legacy. While Matt (like his father before) has ably managed his own finances, most of his cousins have squandered their inheritances. With the trust expiring in seven years due to the [[rule against perpetuities]], the King clan is pressuring Matt to sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. Amidst these discussions, a boating accident has rendered Matt's wife, Elizabeth, comatose. With Elizabeth hospitalized, Matt is forced to cope with his two troubled daughters, 10-year-old Scottie, who seeks attention by bullying other children, and 17-year-old Alex with a history of substance abuse who is away at a private boarding school on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]]. Doctors determine that Elizabeth's coma is irreversible and her [[Advance healthcare directive|living will]] directs all life support to be discontinued. When Matt tells Alex, she reveals she learned Elizabeth was having an affair during her last visit, causing a major rift between mother and daughter.\n\nTwo close family friends, Kai and Mark Mitchell, tell Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy and loved Brian Speer, a real estate agent, and wanted a divorce. After Matt informs friends about Elizabeth's condition so they can say goodbye, he decides Brian should also have an opportunity to do the same. He and the girls, along with Alex's slacker friend Sid, travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matt's cousin, Hugh, mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer to whom the majority of the family wants to sell the land. Brian stands to make a small fortune from the sales commission. Matt privately confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying, and offers him an opportunity to say goodbye. Brian says Elizabeth loved him, but he only loves his wife and children, then apologizes to Matt.\n\nFrustrated and fragile from recent events, Matt asks Dr. Johnston to explain Elizabeth's inevitable death to Scottie. Elizabeth is disconnected from life support. Elizabeth's father, Scott, admonishes Matt for failing to be a more generous and loving husband. Withholding his wife's affair, Matt agrees with him, but Sid and Alex unexpectedly defend Matt. At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority vote of his cousins, deciding instead to keep the land and look for a way around the rule against perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that the family will take legal action, but Matt is undeterred.\n\nAfter learning about Brian's affair with Elizabeth, his wife, Julie, comes to the hospital. She tearfully tells a comatose Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for \"trying to destroy\" her family, but that she forgives her. Matt comes to terms with his wife's infidelity and impending death. He kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie. They later scatter Elizabeth's ashes in the ocean off [[Waikiki]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[George Clooney]] as Matthew \"Matt\" King\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as Alexandra \"Alex\" King\n* Amara Miller as Scottie King\n* [[Nick Krause]] as Sid\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as Hugh King\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Julie Speer\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brian Speer\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Scott Thorson\n* Patricia Hastie as Elizabeth King\n* [[Mary Birdsong]] as Kai Mitchell\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Mark Mitchell\n* [[Milt Kogan]] as Dr. Johnston\n* [[Laird Hamilton]] as Troy \n* [[Michael Ontkean]] as Cousin Milo\n* [[Matt Corboy]] as Kaiba\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Beach from the Descendants (9924241775).jpg|thumb|View of the beach used in the film]]\nThe film began its on-location shoot in Hawaii on March 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Guerrasio |title=Alexander Payne's 'The Descendants' Begins Shooting |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/news/2010/03/alexander-paynes-the-descendants-begins-shooting/ |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=March 15, 2010 |access-date=October 29, 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323033843/http://filmmakermagazine.com/news/2010/03/alexander-paynes-the-descendants-begins-shooting/ | archive-date= March 23, 2010| url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the film was shot in [[Honolulu]] and around [[Hanalei Bay]].<ref name=\"prodnotes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/descendants/notes.pdf |title=The Descendants: Production Notes|publisher=[[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]|access-date=June 26, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703075111/https://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/descendants/notes.pdf|archive-date=July 3, 2012}}</ref> The location used as Matt King's house lacked the [[banyan tree]] described in the book; the filmmakers solved the issue by transplanting a banyan.<ref name=\"prodnotes\" /> For the scene where the King family drives up to a ridge to look over their land, the film used a {{cvt|3,000|acre|ha|adj=on}} private cattle ranch on the south shore of Kauai, Kipu Ranch.
