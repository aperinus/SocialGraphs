The film stars [[Penelope Ann Miller]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Linda Hunt]], and [[James Whitmore]]. In the film, a detective and a biologist try to defeat a South American lizard-like monster which is on a killing spree in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe movie was shot in [[Chicago]] at the highly-regarded Field Museum of Natural History. Production was originally intended to be held at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Slotek\" /> However, a deal could not be reached and, after taking interest in the film's premise, the Field Museum offered to let the studio shoot there instead. The film was the second on-screen collaboration between Hunt and Miller, who both worked on the film ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' as well.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 10, 1997, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It grossed over $48 million worldwide. It was the last film appearance of actress [[Audra Lindley]].\n\n== Plot ==\nJohn Whitney, an [[anthropologist]] for the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], studies a tribe in [[South America]] and drinks a soup made by the tribesmen. Shortly after, Whitney accosts a merchant ship captain, asking him to remove the cargo he had intended to send to Chicago off the ship. Unwilling to delay the ship's departure, the captain refuses and Whitney sneaks aboard. Unable to find his cargo, he cries out. Six weeks later, the ship arrives on [[Lake Michigan]] with its crew missing. [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago PD]] [[homicide detective]] Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta and his partner, Sgt. Hollingsworth, investigate the ship and find dozens of bodies and severed heads in the [[bilge]].\n\nMargo Green, an [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]], arrives at work at the museum and discovered that co-worker Greg Lee is applying for the same research grant she is. Margo and her mentor, Albert Frock, examine Whitney's crates after their arrival and find the crates empty, except for a bed of leaves and a stone statue of the \"Kothoga\", a mythical forest monster. Margo notices a fungus on the leaves and sends it to be analyzed. That night, security guard Frederick Ford is murdered like the ship's crew. D'Agosta suspects a connection. Believing the killer is still inside the museum, he orders it closed until the police have finished searching. Ann Cuthbert, the museum director, protests and mentions an important upcoming exhibition.\n\nMargo discovers the fungus contains concentrated [[hormones]] found in several animal species. In the container of leaves, she finds a mutated beetle that possesses both insect and reptilian DNA. Ford's autopsy reveals that his [[hypothalamus]] was extracted from his brain, like the bodies from the ship. In the museum's basement, the police are startled by a mentally-ill, homeless ex-convict and kill him. Finding Ford's wallet on him, everyone except D'Agosta considers the case closed, though Mayor Robert Owen and the museum\u2019s head of security Tom Parkinson forces D'Agosta to let the exhibition proceed.\n\nOn the opening night, D'Agosta orders a lock-down of all museum areas except the main exhibition hall. Frock and Margo, trapped in the laboratory wing, continue working and discover Ford's killer is after the hormones on the leaves. D'Agosta and several officers search the basement tunnels once again. They are attacked by an unseen creature, killing K-9 Officer Bradley and a police dog. D'Agosta tells Hollingsworth to evacuate the museum, but he is too late. In the main hall, the headless body of a murdered policeman falls into the crowd, causing a panic. During the hysteria, the museum's alarms are tripped and their security system goes haywire, trapping a small group of people inside. Two security guards try to restore the power but are killed by an unseen creature.\n\nD'Agosta meets Margo and Frock in the lab, where a Kothoga, an enormous [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric]] beast, attacks them; they close a steel door to stop it. Margo theorizes the fungus mutated a smaller creature, and Frock says that without the leaves to eat, the Kothoga instinctively seeks the closest substitute, human hypothalami, until it runs out of targets and dies; he further postulates that the tribe knew of the fungus, and used it on a human or animal to deal with an external threat, then hid until the threat was destroyed and the Kothoga died of \"starvation.\" D'Agosta finds a radio and tells Hollingsworth to lead the museum guests out via an old coal tunnel. Tom, Greg, and benefactors Mr. and Mrs. Blaisedale refuse to go, and CPD officer McNally stays behind to guard them; the Kothoga returns to the main hall and murders them and the [[S.W.A.T.]] officers who enter through the skylights.\n\nMargo suggests using [[liquid nitrogen]] to kill the Kothoga, as it is part-reptilian and likely [[ectothermic|cold-blooded]]. While collecting the remaining leaves in the lab, Margo and D'Agosta discover Frock has been killed. In the sewers, D'Agosta uses the leaves to lure the Kothoga away from the coal tunnel, allowing the guests to escape, though CPD officer Bailey and a guest are both killed. However, liquid nitrogen has no effect on the creature. Margo and D'Agosta flee. In the lab, her computer completes the analysis of the creature's human [[DNA]], revealing John Whitney ''is'' the Kothoga, mutated after drinking the tribesmen's soup.\n\nThe Kothoga smashes into the lab through the ceiling, while D'Agosta is locked outside. The creature chases Margo, corners her, and suddenly pauses, seemingly recognizing her. Margo starts an explosive fire that destroys the Kothoga, surviving by hiding inside a [[maceration (bone)|maceration]] tank. As dawn comes, D'Agosta and a team of police break into the lab, see the charred remains of the Kothoga, and rescue Margo from the tank.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Margo Green, museum evolutionary biologist\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Lt.

The producers were faced with a problem as only museums in [[Chicago]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], resembled the one in New York. The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago loved the premise and allowed them to shoot there.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\nPenelope Ann Miller had not done a horror film prior to ''The Relic'' but was drawn to director Peter Hyams' desire to have a strong, smart female lead. Tom Sizemore was attracted to the film because he got to play the male lead: \"I had the responsibility of pushing the narrative forward.\"<ref name=\"Slotek\"/>\n\nMakeup artist [[Stan Winston]] and his team made three creatures with two people moving the heads and people on the side working the electronics to move the arms, claws, mouth, and so on.<ref name=\"Slotek\"/> Hyams reviewed Winston's early drawings and his only suggestion was to make the monster more hideous looking. The director also suggested certain invertebrates for inspiration and Winston came up with an [[arachnid|arachnoid]] outline for the monster's face.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> In the scenes where the creature is running or jumping, a computer-generated version was used.<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Sue |title=Actor Immerses Himself in the Part |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=May 1, 1997 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to shooting on location in Chicago, a set was built in [[Los Angeles]] of a tunnel flooded with water. Sizemore spent most of the shoot either damp, cold or soaking wet and, as a result, caught the flu twice. The production was shut down briefly when Hyams became too sick to work.<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''The Relic'' premiered on January 10, 1997.
