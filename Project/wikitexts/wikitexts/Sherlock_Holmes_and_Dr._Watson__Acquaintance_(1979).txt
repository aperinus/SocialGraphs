They were directed by [[Igor Maslennikov]].\n\n== Overview ==\nBetween 1979 and 1986, Soviet television produced a series of five films at the [[Lenfilm]] movie studio, split into eleven episodes, starring [[Vasily Livanov]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Vitaly Solomin]] as [[Dr. Watson]]. Later, a cinematic adaptation was made based on the 1986 episodes. This film was called ''[[The Twentieth Century Approaches]]''.\n=== Episodes ===\nThe series ran as follows:\n* 1979 ''[[Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]''\n** 1st episode: \"Acquaintance\" (based on \"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band]]\").\n** 2nd episode: \"Bloody Inscription\" (based on ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'').\n* 1980 ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]''\n** 1st episode: \"The King of Blackmail\" (based on \"[[The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton]]\").\n** 2nd episode: \"Deadly Fight\" (based on \"[[The Final Problem]]\").\n** 3rd episode: \"The Tiger Hunt\" (based on \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\").\n* 1981 ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1981 film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''. Two episodes based on ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.\n* 1983 ''[[The Treasures of Agra|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: The Treasures of Agra]]''. Two episodes based on ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' and \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\".\n* 1986 ''[[The Twentieth Century Approaches|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: The Twentieth Century Approaches]]''. Two episodes based on \"[[The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Second Stain]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]\" and \"[[His Last Bow (short story)|His Last Bow]]\".\n=== Production ===\n[[File:Jauniela iela, Riga, Latvia (3).JPG|thumb|Jauniela street, in old [[Riga]], doubles as [[Baker Street]] in the series.]]\nUnlike some of their Western counterparts, the films are very close to the literary source. Some of the departures include Holmes' easy-going and humorous demeanor, as well as comic relief provided by some of the characters (most notably that of Sir Henry Baskerville and his butler Barrymore in [[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1981 film)|''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' episode]]).\n\nThe series' soundtrack was composed by [[Vladimir Dashkevich]]; the introductory piece has become one of the most recognizable pieces of cinematic music in the former Soviet Union.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The tune intentionally resembles an hourly musical logo played on the shortwave [[BBC Russian Service]] (the ''[[Prince of Denmark's March]]''), and Maslennikov later confirmed that he wanted a similar tune which could be identified with the spirit of the British Empire.<ref>{{cite book | title = \u0411\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0435\u0440-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 | author = \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u041c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 | publisher = Litres | year = 2020 | isbn = 978-5-04226-805-2 | language = ru | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pcHKDwAAQBAJ&q=\u043f\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435+\u0431\u0438-\u0431\u0438-\u0441\u0438&pg=PT174 }}</ref>\n\nA street in old [[Riga]] doubles as [[Baker Street]].
