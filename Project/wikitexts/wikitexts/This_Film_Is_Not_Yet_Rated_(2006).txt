It [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on September 1, 2006. [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]], the film's distributor, aired the film later that year. As it includes numerous clips from [[List of NC-17 rated films|films rated NC-17]] to illustrate content that had garnered the rating, the MPAA rated an early version of the film [[MPAA film rating system#Ratings|NC-17]] due to \"some graphic sexual content\". Dick appealed this rating so he could chronicle both the rating and appeals process of the early version of the film in the final version, which, true to the title, is not rated.\n\nThe film discusses a number of alleged disparities in the ratings the MPAA gives films and the feedback it gives filmmakers based on whether the project is a [[Major film studios|studio]] or [[independent film]], whether the questionable content is violent or sexual in nature, and whether sexual content is heterosexual or homosexual and centers on pleasure.\n\n==Themes and discussion==\n{{anchor|Plot}}\nMuch of the film's press coverage was devoted to Dick and his crew's use of private investigator Becky Altringer to unmask the identities of the ratings and appeals board members.\n\nOther revelations in the film include:\n\n* That many ratings board members either have children 18 and older or have no children at all (typically, the MPAA has suggested it hires only parents with children between the ages of 5 and 17)\n* That the board seems to treat homosexual material much more harshly than heterosexual material (this assertion is supported by an MPAA spokesperson\u2019s statement in ''[[USA Today]]'' that \"We don't create standards; we just follow them\")\n* That some sexual activities are frequently treated more harshly when it involves female orgasm or nontraditional sexual activities\n* That NC-17 ratings often significantly reduce a film's chances of success at the box office and overall commercial success, because many movie theaters will not show NC-17 films, and, if they do, it is for very limited time periods\n* That NC-17 ratings are also harmful to home media sales, as many brick and mortar retailers do not rent or sell NC-17 or unrated movies\n* That harsher film ratings are particularly detrimental to smaller and independent filmmakers, who often do not have the financial and professional support of major distribution companies\n* That the board's raters receive no training and are deliberately chosen because of their lack of expertise in media literacy or child development\n* That senior raters have direct contact in the form of mandatory meetings with studio personnel after movie screenings\n* That the MPAA's appeals board is just as secretive as the ratings board, its members being mostly movie theater chain and studio executives\n* That the appeals board includes two members of the clergy, one Catholic priest (Father Dave) and one Protestant ([[James M. Wall|James Wall]]), who may or may not have voting power\n\nThe film sparked some interest in the press when the MPAA rated it NC-17 for \"some graphic sexual content\". Then, when it premiered at Sundance, it was discovered that the rating process for an early version of the film and Dick\u2019s appeal of that rating were depicted in the finished film. As the additional footage changed the film significantly, the NC-17 could no longer be used for the finished film, which would need to be resubmitted to the MPAA to receive a rating of its own. It never was, however, so the film was released without a rating.\n\nAfter Sundance, the film went on to draw crowds at many other festivals, including [[South by Southwest]] and the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and received a theatrical release in fall 2006.\n\n==Interviews==\nThose interviewed in the film include:\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Kimberly Peirce]], Director of ''[[Boys Don't Cry (1999 film)|Boys Don't Cry]]''\n* Jon Lewis, Author of ''Hollywood v.

(Included is the personal information the film revealed about them, such as their age, the age of their children, and how long they had been on the board. These details were significant in the context of the film's critique of the MPAA ratings process, as the MPAA had said (according to the film) that the review board was composed of average American parents, with children between the ages of 5 and 17, who serve on the board for fewer than seven years.):\n\n* Head of the Board: [[Joan Graves]] (the only member of the board whose identity the MPAA had already made public)\n* Anthony \"Tony\" Hey \u2013 61; age of children: 16, 28, 30\n* Barry Freeman \u2013 45; elementary-school-aged children\n* Arlene Bates \u2013 44; age of children: 15 and 23\n* Matt Ioakimedes \u2013 46; age of children: 17 and 20 (had served as a rater for 9 years, as of 2005)\n* Joan Worden \u2013 56; age of children: 18 (twins)\n* Scott Young \u2013 51; age of children: 22 and 24 (next-door neighbor of Arlene Bates)\n* Joann Yatabe \u2013 61; age of children: 22 and 25\n* Howard Friedkin \u2013 47; no children?
