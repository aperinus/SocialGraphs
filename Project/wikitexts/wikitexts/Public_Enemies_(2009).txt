It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Bryan Burrough]]'s 2004 [[non-fiction]] book ''Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933\u201334''. Set during the [[Great Depression]], the film chronicles the final years of the notorious bank robber [[John Dillinger]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) as he is pursued by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Melvin Purvis]] ([[Christian Bale]]), Dillinger's relationship with [[Evelyn Frechette|Billie Frechette]] ([[Marion Cotillard]]), as well as Purvis' pursuit of Dillinger's associates and fellow criminals [[John Hamilton (gangster)|John \"Red\" Hamilton]] ([[Jason Clarke]]), [[Homer Van Meter]] ([[Stephen Dorff]]), [[Harry Pierpont]] ([[David Wenham]]) and [[Baby Face Nelson]] ([[Stephen Graham]]).\n\nBurrough originally intended to make a television [[miniseries]] about the Depression-era crime wave in the United States, but decided to write a book on the subject instead. Mann developed the project, and some scenes were filmed on location where they occurred, though the film is not entirely historically accurate. Released on July 1, 2009, the film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $214 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1933, John Dillinger infiltrates [[Indiana State Prison|Indiana State Penitentiary]], [[jailbreak]]ing his crew. During the firefight, his mentor Walter is shot and killed. Dillinger and company change clothes and eat at a nearby farm before driving to a [[safe house]] on Chicago's east-side.\n\nAfter killing [[Pretty Boy Floyd|Charles Floyd]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Melvin Purvis]] is promoted by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to lead the hunt for Dillinger. Purvis also uses modern methods to battle crime, from cataloging fingerprints to tapping telephone lines.\n\nIn between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets [[Evelyn Frechette|Billie Frechette]] at a restaurant and impresses her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and they become inseparable.\n\nPurvis leads a failed ambush of Dillinger at a hotel, and an FBI agent is killed by [[Baby Face Nelson]], who escapes with [[Tommy Carroll (criminal)|Tommy Caroll]]. Purvis asks Hoover for additional, experienced agents to deal with the hardened killers. So, [[Intelligence officer]] [[Charles B. Winstead|Charles Winstead]], of military background, arrives to assist Purvis.\n\nPolice arrest Dillinger and his gang in [[Tucson, Arizona]], after a fire breaks out in their [[Hotel Congress]]. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where [[Crown Point, Indiana#Gangster era|Sheriff Lillian Holley]] locks him up in the Lake County Jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana|Crown Point]]. Using a fake gun to escape, he is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight police surveillance. Dillinger learns that [[Frank Nitti]]'s associates won't help as the FBI has been prosecuting interstate crime thanks to him, imperiling Nitti's [[bookmaking]] [[racket (crime)|racket]]. This severs Dillinger's ties with the [[Chicago outfit]], forcing him and [[John Hamilton (gangster)|Red Hamilton]] to seek money elsewhere.\n\nCarroll goads a desperate Dillinger into robbing $800,000 from a bank in [[Sioux Falls]] with Baby Face Nelson. Both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and have to leave Carroll behind. They retreat to the [[Little Bohemia Lodge]] in [[Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin]], realizing their haul (~$46,000) is significantly less than expected. Dillinger hopes he can free the rest from prison, including [[Harry Pierpont|Pierpont]] and [[Charles Makley|Makley]], but Hamilton convinces him this is unlikely. Dillinger longs to see Frechette again.\n\nPurvis and his men apprehend Carroll and [[torture]] him for the gang's location. An ambush is organized at Little Bohemia. Dillinger and Hamilton break away, and agents Winstead and Hurt pursue them through the woods, engaging in a shootout that fatally wounds Hamilton. Nelson, Shouse, and Van Meter hijack a Bureau car, killing Purvis's partner Carter Baum in the process. After a car chase, Purvis and his men kill Nelson and the rest of the gang. Elsewhere, Hamilton dies from his injuries after warning Dillinger to let Frechette go.\n\nDillinger meets Frechette, telling her he will commit one more robbery to pay enough for them to escape together. He drops her off, thinking he is safe, but she is arrested and badly beaten for refusing to reveal his whereabouts. Winstead and Purvis eventually intervene to stop the abusive and violent interrogation. Dillinger organizes a train robbery with [[Alvin Karpis]] and the [[Barker Gang]], intending to flee the country the next day. Receiving a note from Frechette through her lawyer, [[Louis Piquett]], he is told not to break her out of jail as she will be released in two years.\n\nPurvis enlists [[Anna Sage]]'s help, a \"madam\" and one of Dillinger's acquaintances, threatening her with [[deportation]] to Romania, unless she sets up Dillinger, to hide out at her brothel. They go out to see ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' but when out of the theater, are met by Purvis and other agents who awaited them. Dillinger spots the police unit but is shot before he can aim. Winstead kneels down beside the dying Dillinger to hear his last words. Purvis informs Hoover of Dillinger's death as bystanders begin to crowd around his body.\n\nWinstead visits Frechette in prison; she already knows about Dillinger's death. He tells her that he thinks his dying words were, \"Tell Billie for me, 'Bye bye Blackbird.'\" Frechette sheds tears as Winstead leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[John Dillinger]], a notorious and charismatic bank robber whom the FBI declares to be \"Public Enemy No. 1\".

In focusing on Dillinger, Mann and co-writers Biderman and Bennett omitted Bonnie and Clyde entirely, briefly included only one member of the Barker gang ([[Alvin Karpis]]), and left out Pretty Boy Floyd except for his death.<ref name=\"patterson\" />\n\nIn the film, Dillinger is shown participating in a 1933 prison break from [[Indiana State Prison]] and freeing some of his associates in a shootout. In reality, Dillinger did help smuggle weapons into the prison for his associates,<ref name=\"bbaccuracy\" /> however it is unclear how: Burrough's book reports that some believed Dillinger tossed the weapons over the prison fence, while other accounts (and the film) suggest that the guns were smuggled in boxes of silk sent to the prison shirt factory. Also, Dillinger was not present during the escape, because he was imprisoned in [[Lima, Ohio]] at the time, and \"few shots were fired\" according to historian Elliott Gorn (the only injury was a clerk shot in the leg, and no guards were killed).<ref name=\"gorn\">{{cite web|title=Is Michael Mann's Public Enemies historically accurate|url= http://www.slate.com/id/2222070/|publisher=Slate|access-date=July 18, 2010| last =Gorn | first = Elliott|date=July 1, 2009}}</ref> Dillinger's preexisting friendship with those he helped break out, like Pierpont and Makley, who had taught Dillinger how to rob banks while he was in prison with them previously,<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger as public enemy No 1 returns|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6485337.ece|work=The Times|access-date=July 18, 2010| last = Burrough | first = Bryan|date=June 13, 2009|location=London}}</ref> is not presented.

It wouldn't be credible if you put it in a movie, so we had to tone it down.\"<ref name=\"carnevale\" /> In the course of Dillinger's 1933\u201334 crime spree, he is depicted as killing multiple people; Gorn writes that Dillinger himself \"probably murdered just one man\": William Patrick O'Malley, a cop who had been shot during a holdup in [[East Chicago]], Indiana.<ref name=\"gorn\" /> Although Purvis was in charge of the Bureau of Investigation's office in Chicago as depicted in the film, fellow agent [[Samuel Cowley]] led the Dillinger investigation in its final months before Dillinger's death.<ref name=\"gorn\"/> [[Homer Van Meter]] and [[Baby Face Nelson]] are shot to death by Purvis after a vehicular pursuit from the Little Bohemia Lodge in the film.
