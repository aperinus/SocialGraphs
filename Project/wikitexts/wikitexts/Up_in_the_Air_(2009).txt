It was written by Reitman and [[Sheldon Turner]], based on the 2001 novel ''[[Up in the Air (novel)|Up in the Air]]'' by [[Walter Kirn]]. The story is centered on traveling corporate \"[[layoff|downsize]]r\" Ryan Bingham ([[George Clooney]]). [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Anna Kendrick]], and [[Danny McBride]] also star. ''Up in the Air'' was primarily filmed in [[St. Louis]] with additional scenes shot in [[Detroit]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Las Vegas]], and [[Miami]].\n\nReitman promoted ''Up in the Air'' with personal appearances at film festivals, starting with [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]] on September 5, 2009. Following a Los Angeles premiere at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Mann Village Theater]] in November, [[Paramount Pictures]] gave ''Up in the Air'' a wide release on December 23, 2009.\n\n''Up in the Air'' was met with critical acclaim, for Reitman's screenplay and direction, and the performances by Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick. The film received several accolades, including six nominations each at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] and the [[67th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]], winning Best Screenplay at the latter. A number of critics and publications included ''Up in the Air'' on their lists of the best films of 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nRyan Bingham works for a [[human resources]] consultancy firm specializing in [[termination of employment|employment-termination]] assistance. His work constantly takes him around the country, conducting company layoffs on behalf of employers. Ryan also gives motivational speeches, using the analogy, \"What's in Your Backpack?\" to extol living free of burdensome relationships and material possessions. A frequent flyer, Ryan aspires to earn ten million [[frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer]] miles with [[American Airlines]]. While traveling, Ryan meets a woman named Alex, a professional who also flies frequently. They begin a [[casual relationship]], meeting up in various cities as their respective schedules allow.\n\nRyan is recalled to his company's offices in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]]. Natalie Keener, a young, ambitious new hire, promotes cutting costs by conducting layoffs via [[video conference|video-conferencing]]. Ryan raises concerns that the new system is impersonal and undignified, and argues that Natalie lacks understanding about the firing process and how to handle emotionally vulnerable people. Ryan's boss, Craig Gregory, has Natalie accompany a reluctant Ryan on his next round of terminations to observe the process.\n\nRyan tutors Natalie on traveling more efficiently using smaller luggage and moving quickly through airport security. As they travel together, Natalie challenges Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly regarding relationships and love, but Ryan defends his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie's boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by [[text message]]. Ryan and Alex comfort the shattered Natalie. On a video termination test run, Ryan's earlier concerns prove valid; when one laid-off person breaks down on camera, Natalie is unable to properly console him and another employee threatens suicide.\n\nNatalie castigates Ryan for his inability to commit to Alex, despite their obvious compatibility; Ryan dismisses her criticisms and chastises her for lacking empathy and never appreciating her surroundings. Before returning home, Ryan, taking Alex along, heads to [[Wisconsin]] for his sister Julie's wedding. He has a strained reunion with his semi-estranged family who resent his absence. When Jim, the groom, gets [[cold feet]] just prior to the ceremony, Ryan's older sister, Kara, asks Ryan to intervene. Although counter to his personal philosophy, Ryan uses his motivational skills to persuade Jim to proceed with the wedding.\n\nRyan begins questioning his lifestyle and philosophies, and doubts what he lectures others about. In [[Las Vegas]] for a prestigious speaking engagement, Ryan abruptly walks offstage mid-presentation and impulsively flies to [[Chicago]] to see Alex. Arriving at her front door, he is stunned to discover that she is married and has children. She later phones, chastising him for nearly wrecking her marriage, and says her family is her real life; he is merely an escape.\n\nOn Ryan's flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten million mile mark. American Airlines' chief pilot is aboard to personally congratulate Ryan and notes he is the youngest person to achieve the milestone. When asked where he is from, Ryan, realizing he has no real home, simply says, \"here.\" Back in Omaha, Ryan transfers a million frequent flyer miles to Julie and Jim so they can have a honeymoon. Craig informs Ryan that a laid-off employee has committed suicide (the same one who had threatened to do so earlier). Natalie, upset over the news, has quit via text message. The remote-layoff program is tabled, and Ryan is sent back on the road.\n\nNatalie applies to the same [[San Francisco]] company where she had previously declined a position, having followed her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. Impressed by her qualifications and Ryan's glowing written recommendation, the interviewer hires her. The film concludes with Ryan at the airport, standing in front of a vast destination board, contemplating where he should travel next (something Natalie encouraged him to do earlier).  Looking up, he lets go of his luggage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[George Clooney]] as Ryan Bingham, \"a suave, smartly dressed businessman in his 40s\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Up in the Air: Credits|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]|url=http://www.theupintheairmovie.com/credits.html|access-date=September 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225182939/http://www.theupintheairmovie.com/credits.html|archive-date=December 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"French\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/17/up-in-the-air-review|title=Up in the Air|last=French|first=Philip|date=January 17, 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=August 1, 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022436/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/17/up-in-the-air-review|archive-date=2014-12-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Alex Goran, a constantly traveling businesswoman<ref name=\"French\"/>\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Natalie Keener, an ambitious 23-year-old\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Craig Gregory, owner of Career Transition Counseling\n* [[Amy Morton]] as Kara Bingham, Ryan's older sister\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Julie Bingham, Ryan's younger sister\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Jim Miller, Julie's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Steve, a fired employee\n* [[J.

Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some Turner inventions that were used in the film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech (\"Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now ...\"), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as a man).<ref name=\"wrap012510\"/><ref name=\"LAT 2010-01-15\">{{cite web|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=Screenwriting credits, floating up in the air|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 15, 2010|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html|access-date=January 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119021056/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html|archive-date=2010-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the [[Writers Guild of America]] ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read.

The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them.
