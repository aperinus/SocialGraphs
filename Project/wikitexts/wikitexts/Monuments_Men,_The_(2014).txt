The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] including Clooney, [[Matt Damon]], [[Bill Murray]], [[John Goodman]], [[Jean Dujardin]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Hugh Bonneville]], and [[Cate Blanchett]].\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 2007 non-fiction book ''The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History'' by [[Robert M. Edsel]] and Bret Witter. It follows an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] group from the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] that is given the task of finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before [[Nazi]]s destroy or steal them during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=George Clooney Sets Daniel Craig, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Jean Dujardin For WWII Drama 'The Monuments Men' |magazine=Deadline |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/10/george-clooney-sets-daniel-craig-bill-murray-cate-blanchett-jean-dujardin-for-wwii-drama-monuments-men/|access-date=November 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Directors' Page|url=http://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/directors/|publisher=[[Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art]]|access-date=March 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''The Monuments Men'' was co-produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] (in association with [[20th Century Fox]]) and [[Babelsberg Studio]]. It received mixed critical reviews and grossed $155 million worldwide against a $70 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] are making good progress driving back the [[Axis powers]] in Italy. Frank Stokes convinces [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] that victory will have little meaning if the artistic treasures of Western civilization are lost. Stokes is directed to assemble an Army unit nicknamed the \"Monuments Men\", comprising museum directors, curators, art historians, and an architect, to both guide Allied units and search for stolen art to return it to its rightful owners.\n\nIn July 1944, Claire Simone, a curator in occupied France, is forced to assist Nazi officer Viktor Stahl in overseeing the theft of art for either [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[F\u00fchrermuseum]] or as personal property of senior commanders such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]. All seems lost when she discovers that Stahl is taking all of her gallery's contents to Germany as the Allies approach Paris. Simone runs to the railyard to confront him, but can only watch as he departs aboard the train carrying the cargo.\n\nStokes' unit finds its work frustrated by Allied officers in the field, who refuse to endanger their own troops for the sake of his mission. The unit splits up to cover more ground, with varying degrees of success. James Granger meets Simone, but she suspects the Americans want to confiscate the stolen art for their own country, and refuses to cooperate. British officer Donald Jeffries sneaks into occupied Bruges at night to save [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'', but is killed in the attempt.\n\nRichard Campbell and Preston Savitz learn that [[Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' was removed by the priests of [[Ghent Cathedral]] for safekeeping, but their truck was stopped and the panels taken. Eventually, they find and arrest Viktor Stahl, who is hiding as a farmer, when they identify the paintings in his house as masterpieces, at least one stolen from the [[Palais Rothschild#The Rothschild Collections|Rothschild Collection]].\n\nIn December 1944, Walter Garfield and Jean Claude Clermont get lost in the countryside and blunder into a firefight. Clermont is mortally wounded and dies when Garfield is unable to find medical help. Meanwhile, Simone reconsiders when Granger shows her the [[Nero Decree]], which orders the destruction of all German possessions if Hitler dies or Germany falls, and she sees him return a painting looted from a Jewish family to its rightful place in their empty home. She provides a comprehensive ledger she has compiled that provides valuable information on the stolen art and the rightful owners.\n\nEven as the team learns that the artwork is being stored in various mines and castles, it also learns that it must now compete against the Soviet Union, which is seizing artwork from [[Allied-occupied Germany|its occupation zone]] as [[war reparations]]. Meanwhile, Colonel Wegner is systematically destroying whole art caches. Eventually, the team has some success, as it discovers at least one mine hiding over 16,000 art pieces. In addition, the team captures the entire gold reserves of the Nazi German national treasury.\n\nFinally, as the war ends in May 1945, the team finds a [[Altaussee#Nazi repository for stolen art|mine in Austria]] that appears to have been demolished, and the Soviets will be there in hours. Discovering that the entrances were actually blocked by the locals to prevent the Nazis from destroying the contents, the team evacuates as much artwork as possible, including sculptures, the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', and the ''Madonna and Child'', before the Soviets arrive.\n\nAfterwards, Stokes reports back to [[President Truman]] that the team has recovered vast quantities of artwork and various other culturally significant items. As he requests to stay in Europe to oversee further searching and restoration, Truman asks Stokes if his efforts were worth the lives of the men he lost. Stokes says they were. Truman then asks if, thirty years from then, anyone will remember that these men died for a piece of art. In the final scene, set in 1977, the elderly Stokes replies \"Yeah\", while he takes his grandson to see Michelangelo's ''Bruges Madonna''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Lieutenant Frank Stokes, loosely based on [[George L.

In the film, it is stated that 'local miners' had blown up the mine to prevent the contents being destroyed. In 1945 a British [[Special Operations Executive]] mission, codenamed Bonzos and led by [[Albrecht Gaiswinkler]], was responsible for saving the looted art stored in Austrian salt mines.

The real organisation was never a big one (a few dozen officers at most), but the film reduces it to just seven men to personalise the hunt for the looted art: five Americans, one British officer, the first to be killed off (Hugh Bonneville), and a Free French officer, marginalising the British role in the establishment of the organisation. This is presented as set up at Clooney's [Stokes'] initiative after the [[Battle of Monte Cassino#Second battle (Operation Avenger)|bombing of Monte Cassino]] (so, after February 1944). In fact, its origins actually went back to British efforts in [[Libya]] in 1942, and it already existed (albeit with teething troubles) when the Allies invaded [[Sicily]] in July 1943.\"\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Rescuing Da Vinci]]'' (2006 book)\n* ''[[The Rape of Europa (book)|The Rape of Europa]]'' (1994 book and 2006 documentary film)\n* ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964 film)\n* ''[[The Hessen Affair]]'' (2009 film)\n*[[Woman in Gold (film)|''Woman in Gold'']] (2015 film)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title|2177771|The Monuments Men}}\n* {{mojo title|monumentsmen|The Monuments Men}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_monuments_men|The Monuments Men}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The Monuments Men}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100925073753/http://monumentsmen.com/ ''Monuments Men'' book]\n\n{{George Clooney}}\n{{Art and World War II}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monuments Men, The}}\n[[Category:2014 war drama films]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American war drama films]]\n[[Category:German war drama films]]\n[[Category:World War II films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Art and cultural repatriation after World War II]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1977]]\n[[Category:Babelsberg Studio films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Films about the visual arts]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Clooney]]\n[[Category:Films set in Austria]]\n[[Category:Films set in Bruges]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1943]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1944]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1945]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Germany]]\n[[Category:Monuments men]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by George Clooney]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Grant Heslov]]\n[[Category:Smokehouse Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alexandre Desplat]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Grant Heslov]]\n[[Category:Films produced by George Clooney]]\n[[Category:2014 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s German films]]"}]}}}}
