It is the third installment in the [[Rush Hour (film series)|''Rush Hour'' franchise]] and centers on Inspector Lee (Chan) and Officer Carter (Tucker) tracking an assassin to Paris to unravel a mystery about the Chinese triads. Announced on May 7, 2006, filming began on July 4 on location in [[Paris]] and Los Angeles. Released on August 10, 2007, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews from film critics. Despite this, it was a box office success, grossing $258 million worldwide against a $140 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events of ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'', in 2000, Chinese Ambassador Solon Han, with [[Hong Kong Police Force]] Chief Inspector Lee as his bodyguard, addresses the importance of fighting the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] at the World Criminal Court in [[Los Angeles]]. When Han starts to announce the whereabouts of Shy Shen, a semi-mythical individual of great importance to the Chinese mob, an [[assassin]] in the [[building]] across from them suddenly snipes him, causing an outrageous panic of many people around the streets close to them. Lee corners the shooter, but when he learns that this is his childhood foster brother, Kenji, who shot the ambassador, he hesitates, allowing Kenji to escape just as [[LAPD]] Detective James Carter arrives after hearing what happened over the police radio.\n\nHan is later [[hospitalized]] at [[UCLA Medical Center]], surviving the assassination attempt, and Lee and Carter promise his daughter Soo Yung to find the person responsible. She insists they head to the local Kung Fu studio to retrieve an envelope Han left her, but learn from the studio master the Triads took Soo Yung's belongings.\n\nLee and Carter return to the [[hospital]] and intercept a few French-speaking Chinese [[hitmen]] before they can further injure Han. After defeating them, Lee and Carter interrogate one of them with the help of Sister Agnes, a French-speaking [[nun]]. For her protection, they take Soo Yung to the French Embassy, leaving her with French ambassador and chairman of the [[World Criminal Court]], Varden Reynard. When Reynard and Soo Yung are nearly killed by a car bomb, Lee and Carter go to [[Paris]] to investigate this case further.\n\nAfter a painful inspection from Parisian Commissaire Revi, Lee and Carter meet [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] [[taxicab driver]], George, and force him to drive them to a Triad hideout. While there, Carter meets stage performer Genevi\u00e8ve while Lee is tricked by mob assassin Jasmine, who claims to have information about Shy Shen, and Carter saves Lee from being killed.\n\nThe pair tries to escape, but is ultimately captured by Kenji's men. Kenji says he'll let them live if they leave Paris, but Lee refuses. Following a short struggle, he and Carter successfully escape. They recover and rest at a [[hotel]] where they both book themselves a room, and Lee soon reveals his relationship with Kenji and decides to continue alone. A disillusioned Carter leaves, but recomposes himself when he spots and follows Genevi\u00e8ve. Meanwhile, Reynard meets Lee and explains Shy Shen is not a person, but a list of Triad leaders and that Genevi\u00e8ve is Han's informant with access to the list.\n\nAfter locating Genevi\u00e8ve and saving her from being killed, the two flee with her to their hotel. They are attacked by Jasmine, but George rescues them out of a newfound admiration for Americans. Genevi\u00e8ve reveals to Lee and Carter that the Triad leaders' names were tattooed on the back of her head and that she will be beheaded when the Triads capture her. Lee and Carter bring her to Reynard and discover he was working with the Triads the entire time. Kenji calls to inform Lee that he has captured Soo Yung and demands he turn over Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nLee arrives at the [[Eiffel Tower]] to make the exchange, with Carter disguised as Genevi\u00e8ve with a wig. Kenji challenges Lee to a sword fight, during which the two fall into a safety net. After Kenji's sword cuts the net, Lee tries to save him, but Kenji is touched by Lee's kindness and lets go, falling to his death and devastating Lee. Meanwhile, Carter saves Soo Yung and defeats Jasmine by kicking her into an elevator wheel that crushes her to death. After escaping the remaining Triad members, Carter and Lee are confronted by Reynard, who threatens to kill Genevi\u00e8ve and frame them. However, George shoots Reynard from behind, killing him. As the police arrive, Revi tries to take credit for Lee and Carter's work, but they knock him out and leave with a [[Victory dance (sports)|victory dance]] to [[Edwin Starr]]'s \"[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Before re-ordering Chris Tucker and/or Jackie Chan, please note that they are listed in the same order as shown in the end credits of the movie. -->\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Chief Inspector Yan Naing Lee of the [[Hong Kong Police Force|HKPF]], the head of Ambassador Han's security detail.\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Detective James Carter of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]].
