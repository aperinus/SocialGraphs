Baker]] from the novel of the same name by author [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]. The film was directed by [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]] and illustrates the self-destruction of [[punk rock]]. Released in 1996, the film documents a once-popular punk band, Hard Core Logo, comprising lead singer Joe Dick ([[Hugh Dillon]]), fame-tempted guitarist Billy Tallent ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), [[schizophrenic]] bass player John Oxenberger ([[John Pyper-Ferguson]]), and drummer Pipefitter ([[Bernie Coulson]]). [[Julian Richings]] plays Bucky Haight, Dick's idol. Several notable punk musicians, including [[Art Bergmann]], [[Joey Shithead]] and [[Joey Ramone]], play themselves in cameos. Canadian television personality [[Terry David Mulligan]] also has a cameo, playing a fictionalized version of himself.\n\nIn a 2001 poll of 200 industry voters, performed by [[Playback (magazine)|''Playback'']], ''Hard Core Logo'' was named the fourth best Canadian film of the last 15 years. In 2002, readers of ''Playback'' voted it the 4th greatest Canadian film ever made.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Hard Core Logo 2]]'', premiered at the [[Whistler Film Festival]] on December 4, 2010 with the members of Die Mannequin and McDonald walking the red carpet. It had its second screening at the [[Victoria Film Festival]] on February 6, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is about a documentary team that follows the reunion of Hard Core Logo. Joe Dick gets the band back together ostensibly for an [[Gun control|anti-gun]] benefit after hearing Canadian punk rock legend Bucky Haight, and personal [[mentor]], is shot. They begin the tour in [[Vancouver]] and travel thousands of kilometers east along the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] to [[Winnipeg]], then northwest along the [[Yellowhead Highway]] to [[Edmonton]]. On the way the band's dark secrets are revealed, however while they travel they keep ignoring each other's darkness.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hard Core Logo |url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000091175/ |website=IMDB |access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref> John Oxenberger loses his schizophrenia medication and slowly loses his sanity. Billy Tallent finds out that by going on tour he loses his position in mainstream rock band Jenifur and with that his one shot at stardom. The band stops by Bucky Haight's reclusive estate only to find he was never shot and that Joe Dick fabricated the lie in order to get the band together. The band and documentary crew drop [[LSD|acid]] and experience hallucinations. Bucky admonishes Joe Dick for using him to get the band together. At Edmonton, Billy Tallent finds out he has another opportunity to permanently join Jenifur. Joe Dick finds out from the film crew and later attacks Billy on stage. Joe Dick destroys Billy Tallent's [[Fender Stratocaster]], which was a gift from Bucky Haight, and the band parts ways.  In the final scene Joe Dick drinks with the documentary crew members and shoots himself in the head.\n\n==Cast==\n*  [[Hugh Dillon]] as Joe Dick\n*  [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Billy Tallent\n*  [[John Pyper-Ferguson]] as John Oxenberger\n*  [[Bernie Coulson]] as Pipefitter\n*  [[Julian Richings]] as Bucky Haight\n*  [[Benita Ha]] as Pipefitter's Girlfriend\n*  [[Claudia Ferri]] as John Oxenberger's Girlfriend\n*  [[Joey Ramone]] as Joey Ramone\n*  [[Corrine Koslo]] as Laura Cromartie\n\n==Production==\nMcDonald grew up in the [[Vancouver]] [[punk rock]] scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was drawn to Michael Turner's book about aging musicians. McDonald commented in an interview, \"what I thought was really interesting is where it is 15 years later, and what are these guys doing now\".<ref name=\"Poppy\">{{cite news | last = Poppy | first = Nick | title = All Rock, No Mounties: Canadian Bruce McDonald's ''Hard Core Logo'' | work=INDIEwire | date = November 13, 1998 }}</ref> He had just come off the critically acclaimed ''[[Dance Me Outside]]'' and friends warned him not to repeat himself by making another road movie.<ref name=\"Craig\">{{cite news | last = Craig | first = Jeff | title = Canuck Punk | work=[[Edmonton Sun]] | date = October 17, 1996 }}</ref> However, McDonald did not see ''Logo'' as a repeat of previous films. \"On the other films, they (the anti-heroes of ''[[Roadkill (1989 film)|Roadkill]]'' and ''[[Highway 61 (film)|Highway 61]]'') go down the road and meet a nutty person and things happened.

McDonald remembers, \"Cannes was very humbling. You're in the same arena as [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] and Czechoslovakian pornographers. It's such a bizarre spectrum.\" The film went on to be nominated for six [[Genie Awards]], including Best Picture and Director. [[Quentin Tarantino]] saw ''Logo'' at a film festival and liked it so much that he bought the U.S. distribution rights under his Rolling Thunder label and even toyed with casting Dillon in ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]''.\n\n==Reaction==\n''Hard Core Logo'' was well received by Canadian film critics.

However, scheduling (among other reasons) kept it from moving forward. After some discussion, McDonald and MacIvor decided to rewrite the screenplay for two women, with [[Molly Parker]] and [[Tracy Wright]] in mind. The film was released in 2010 as ''[[Trigger (film)|Trigger]]''. Rennie has a cameo in the film, reprising his role as Billy Tallent.\n\n== Sequel ==\n''[[Hard Core Logo 2]]'' premiered at the [[Whistler Film Festival]] on December 4, 2010 with the members of Die Mannequin and McDonald walking the red carpet. It had its second screening at the [[Victoria Film Festival]] on February 6, 2011.\n\n==Soundtrack albums==\nAlthough music figures heavily in the film, a conventional soundtrack album was not initially released; instead, McDonald had several notable Canadian bands record [[cover versions|covers]] of the songs in the film, and packaged them as if they were a [[tribute album]] to a real band. That album, ''[[A Tribute to Hard Core Logo]]'', was also released in 1996.\n\nA more traditional soundtrack album, comprising the actual music contained in the film itself, was released later in 1998 on Velvel Records.\n\n===Track listing===\nLyrics by [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]] and music by [[Hugh Dillon]] and [[Swamp Baby]], except where noted.\n\t\t\n# \"Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?\" (2:54)\n# \"Rock & Roll Is Fat and Ugly\" (1:57)\n# \"Something's Gonna Die Tonight\" (3:17)\n# \"Blue Tattoo\" (3:14)\n# \"Sonic Reducer\"  (2:54) ([[Dead Boys]] cover)\n# \"Edmonton Block Heater\" (3:00)\n# \"China White (Ten Buck Fuck)\" (4:45)\n# \"One Foot in the Gutter\" (1:52)\n# \"Hawaii\" (1:37) - ([[Young Canadians]] cover)\n# \"Bonerack\" (3:35) - [[Teenage Head (band)|Teenage Head]]\n# \"Touring\" (2:52) - [[Ramones]]\n# \"Wild Wild Women\" (3:19) - [[Chris Spedding]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116488|title=Hard Core Logo}}\n* {{Amg movie|136323|Hard Core Logo}}\n* {{mojo title|id=hardcorelogo|title=Hard Core Logo}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=hard-core-logo|title=Hard Core Logo}}\n\n{{Bruce McDonald}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian mockumentary films]]\n[[Category:Punk films]]\n[[Category:Fictional musical groups]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce McDonald]]\n[[Category:Films set in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films based on Canadian novels]]\n[[Category:1996 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
