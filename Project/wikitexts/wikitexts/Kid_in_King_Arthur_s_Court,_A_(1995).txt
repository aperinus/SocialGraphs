It is loosely based on the [[Mark Twain]] 1889 novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', previously filmed by Disney as ''[[Unidentified Flying Oddball]]'' in 1978. Starring [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Joss Ackland]] and [[Art Malik]], and is notable for being one the first film roles of [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Kate Winslet]].\n\n==Plot==\nCalvin Fuller is a nerdy young boy living in the Los Angeles suburb of [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] who loves baseball, but is not a good player. He is at a game, standing at bat for his team, the Knights, ready for yet another strike out. Suddenly an earthquake hits; as the others run for safety, the ground opens up under Calvin's shoes and he falls through the chasm. He eventually lands on the head of a 6th-century [[black knight]]. Upon hearing of his miraculous appearance, the elderly [[King Arthur]], seeing him as the savior whose appearance [[Merlin]] has predicted, dubs the boy Calvin of Reseda and invites him to dine with the [[court]].\n\nCalvin begins his knight training under Arthur's top knight, Sir Kane, to help the king retain his [[The crown|crown]]. When the earthquake hit, Calvin had just grabbed his [[knapsack]], a fact that enables him to dazzle the people of Camelot with his [[futuristic]] \"magic\", including an introduction to [[rock and roll]] via [[CD player]], and a [[Swiss Army knife]]. Calvin also shows them how to make [[Roller skating|inline roller skates]]. His work wins him adulation and renown, but it also rouses the jealousy of Lord Belasco, who will use any means to take over the [[throne]]. Meanwhile, Calvin finds himself spending time and developing a crush on young Princess Katey, while her elder sister, Sarah, is secretly in love with Sir Kane. Belasco moves forward with his plans and kidnaps Katey and tries to frame Calvin for murder and tells Sarah that if she does not marry him, Katey will die. As Belasco is about to arrest Calvin, Sarah rescues him, tells him Katey is alive and to find her father and show him the proof. Calvin goes to Arthur and shows the proof of Belasco's scheme. Playing along, Arthur misdirects the knights and helps Calvin escape and they disguise themselves to go rescue Katey. Walking amongst the people, Calvin tells Arthur that Belasco has been stealing from them for years and they think Arthur does not care about them, and Arthur vows to be a better king. Calvin and Arthur find the castle Katey is being held captive; during the fight, Calvin renews Arthur's will to fight by giving him [[Excalibur]] (gifted to Calvin by Merlin). They release Katey, but Belasco' second-in-command, Richard, kidnaps her again and holds her hostage over the moat. Calvin uses a laser pointer from his CD player to blind Richard, causing him to fall and save Katey. Arthur knights Calvin as a Knight of the Round Table and arrive back in Camelot to stop Belasco from forcing Sarah into marriage. To take Belasco down for good, Arthur holds a jousting tournament for Sarah's hand.\n\nDuring the tournament, Sir Kane defeats all the opponents and just him and Lord Belasco are in the finals. Belasco uses a magnifying crystal to use the sunlight to beam it into Kane's eyes and nearly knock him out. Sarah runs off in anger and Calvin asks the King to stall Belasco. Belasco is close to declaring his victory if Kane does not return, but Kane does return and faces him in another joust; Belasco knocks Kane's helmet off, but the now headless Kane still jousts and makes a comeback victory by knocking Belasco off his horse. But it is not Kane, it is Calvin, who pokes his head out from the large armor. Belasco pulls Calvin off the horse and tries to kill him, but the black knight that Calvin encountered earlier appears and ambushes Belasco, saving Calvin. Forfeiting his victory to the black knight, Calvin, Arthur, and all of Camelot are surprised to see the knight is Sarah herself; an astounded but happy Arthur rewards his daughter with the right to choose her own hand in marriage, and she proudly chooses Kane. Belasco is banished from Camelot forever. Now that he has helped Arthur keep the crown, Calvin has Merlin uphold his end of the bargain and send him home, and he sadly bids the king and Katey farewell. He is returned to the 20th century just before the moment when he struck out, and he steps up to the plate: this time, he is ready and hits a home run. He is greeted by his teammates, including Katey, and is looked on by King Arthur, who is whittling a piece of wood with a pocketknife \u2013 the same knife Calvin gave to him. Merlin catches Calvin\u2019s home run and then breaks the fourth wall by stating \"Taught that kid everything he knows.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Calvin Fuller\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as [[King Arthur]]\n* [[Art Malik]] as Lord Belasco\n* [[Paloma Baeza]] as Princess Katey\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Princess Sarah\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Master Kane\n* David Tysall as Ratan\n* [[Ron Moody]] as [[Merlin]]\n* Barry Stanton as Blacksmith\n* Michael Mehlnan as Shop owner\n* Melanie Oettinger as Peasant woman\n* Rebecca Denton as Washer woman\n* Michael Kelly as Apprentice\n* Louise Rosner as Lady-in-waiting\n* Paul Rosner as Peasant boy\n* B\u00e9la Unger as Head guard\n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Coach\n* Tim Wickham as Ricky Baker\n* Daniel Bennett as Howell\n* Debora Weston as Mom\n* [[Vincent Marzello]] as Dad\n* Catherine Blake as Maya\n* J.
